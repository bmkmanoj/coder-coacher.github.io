shown you how to use and how to define a
function in Python in this video also I
am going to continue with functions and
I am going to show you how to use some
other features in functions like default
parameter and multiple parameters in
function so let's get started in the
last video I've shown you how you can
declare a function so you can declare a
function in Python like this def for
example I want to make a function to
print out the score of a student so I
can say student poor for example this is
name of my function and in this brackets
I can pass parameters right for example
name and score okay and then this colon
and inside this function we can write
the definition or the food to our
function for example I want to print
something print the student name and
score I can just write the or something
like names for this much amount of marks
so I can just write name and then comma
and then score and then comma this
should be score right not scare from a
Mark's right and this is simple you have
already understood I think the concept
of you know defining the function and
how to print these values right and if I
call this function it will just give me
the answer for
example a boss named as mark and score
and 70% at sales mark scored this much
amount of marks right but sometimes you
want that there are some default value
which are already
initializing these parameters for
example in the case of databases here
it's a bad idea to save blank values or
null values in the database so and you
cannot depend upon the user that he can
define or you cannot you know be sure
that user will define a parameter for
every function so what you can do in
Python is you can define default
parameter so once again I'm going to
take this function but I will initialize
this function with some value so that it
will not be null at any point for
example Tom as name and score is equal
to zero for example right now I can just
print the score and name and the default
value will remain just the same right
and my function is defined and now when
I use this function and even if I don't
pass any parameter generally you have to
pass the parameter when you define a
function and when you define a function
with parameters but when you initialize
a function with default value you even
skip passing the values to your
parameter and once I call this function
it's a storm scored zero mark because
Tom is a default value and score form is
zero okay so Tom is a default name and
zero is the default mark and so you can
ask what is the purpose of this the
purpose of this is if the user
I will not pass any value as an argument
then the fault value will be taken
otherwise if the user enters some valid
name for example mark and 85 marks and
once again you can see it's printing
mark scored 85 marks okay so it has
overwritten the storm as mark the name
it has overwritten as mark and this
score is overwritten by 85 right now you
can choose to you know pass the first
parameter and skip the second parameter
for example you can just pass mark here
and it says marks code zero marks
because this it has taken as the first
parameter and it has over over it in the
name but we haven't passed our score so
it will take the score as default which
is zero so it will print like this now
for for example you want to pass this
score and you want the name to be
default what you can do once again take
the function and this time just write
score is equal to 99 for example it says
Tom scored 99 marks right so Tom is the
default value here and 99 is overwritten
or zero is row overwritten by 99 which
you passed okay so this is about default
parameter passing now there is a concept
of passing multiple parameters to
function and how you can pass this
multiple parameter for example you I
will take the same example of student
and you want to pass some parameters so
I want to pass
name of the student and I want to pass
multiple took score of the student for
example students as scored you know
marks in language marks in programming
marks in maths or marks and some other
subject and you want to pass the
parameters but you don't know the number
of subject you know student is you know
taking so what you can do in this
condition you can just use the name as
it is but for example you want to pass
multiple scores you can just use Asterix
and this Astrix says python that this
parameter will be passed one as one
parameter also or multiple parameters
also so move on or more parameters so
our s trick says to the python that this
score can be multiple also or even it
can be one also okay and it's saying
invalid invalid syntax let's see what's
the error yeah I have forgotten the DEF
keyword to define a function so I will
define a function depth and then we call
this and once again I can print for
example I will print first of all the
name print name and then I will print
scores okay and I will just call this
function for example student and I will
pass name as
once again mark and scores for example
he has taken a language course so he
scored 55 marks in this language course
he has taken maths course he is 477
marks he has taking programming course
he scored 90 marks
he has taken other courses physics
67 marks or multiple courses okay so
this is a wild card kind of entry which
says you can pass one or more parameters
right and you see it has printed first
of all the name of the student which is
mark and then these these marks as a
couple if you don't know what is a
couple couple is just like a list but
you cannot add it a list or you cannot
even delete an element from a list you
can just read this element from tuple
right so tuple is just like a list but
the only difference is you cannot modify
or they eat any elements from this
double so this is a tuple right so in
this way you can even pass multiple
values using this Asterix and it's not
necessary that you need or to pass only
two parameters you can just pass one
parameter for example def score
something like this a strike
score it will be valid I have forgot
this call : or like this and what's the
problem here so okay I left some indent
here which it's saying unexpected
indentation okay and you want to print
score and be totally valid when you call
this function score and you can pass
multiple values 1 comma 3 some some
marks multiple marks right and it will
give you our topple so in this way you
can pass default parameters to a
function and you can pass multiple
parameters to a function in Python I
