shell scripting tutorial for beginners
in this video we will learn how to use
break statement and continuous statement
in shell scripting so let's start with
the break statement so the break
statement is used to exit the current
loop before its normal execution so
whenever we want to break out of the
loop prematurely then we can use break
statement so let's take an example so
for example I have a for loop like this
which initialize the value of I as one
and then we are awaiting the condition
if the value of I is less than or equal
to ten and then here we are just
incrementing the value so this construct
you already know I already told you in
the you know last videos right and then
I simply just you know print the value
of I and let's run the script and let's
see what happens first of all so I'm
going to just run the script and it
prints one to ten which is a normal
operation now for some reason we want to
exit out of the loop prematurely for
example if the value of I is greater
than five then we want to come out of
the loop then what we can do here is we
can use for example if and then inside
the if statement
we can say if I so dollar I is greater
than five then we want to come out of
the loop so then and then fi for to end
the loop and in here we just give the
break so just write break keyword here
and what it does is whenever the value
of I goes greater than 5 then it this
condition is true and the program
institution comes here and sees
break he would and then it comes out of
the loop so let's see what happens now
so let's run the script and let's see
what happens so you can see it's
printing this because I just need to
give space here and once again let's run
the script and you can see it trends 1
to 5 here right so whenever this
condition is true this keyword is called
and then the program goes out of the
loop okay so it doesn't print up to 10
even if the you know execution of this
for loop demands that we need to go up
to 10 and then it goes out of the loop
but we have given the special keyword
break so whenever this condition is met
then it goes out of the loop so this is
how you can use break to come out of the
loop or break the normal execution of
the loop prematurely so before it's
normal ending right now let's see how to
use the continue statement now continue
is a little bit different from break and
what it does is whenever you use
continue it skips the normal execution
for that iteration so whatever comes
after the continue keyword will be
skipped and then the program will go to
the next iteration right so let's say we
have this condition I is equal to and
let's say I is equal to 3 and or let's
say we want to give the or operator here
and let's say we say dollar i equals 6
okay so we are just saying here that if
I is equal to 3 or I is equal to 6 then
we will give the continue
key word here okay and the continue
keyword will skip the execution of the
loop or whenever it sees three or five
so let's see what happens so I'm going
to just clear the screen and run the
script once again
and you can see it trends one to ten but
when we see carefully here you see one
two but there is no three here right and
that is what we have written here and
then you can see four five and there is
no six here so whenever this condition
is met where I is equal to three or I is
equal to six then this condition is met
and then this keyword continue is called
and what it means is whenever your
program or your script sees this keyword
in the loop then whatever comes after
this keyword will be skipped so for
example this echo statement comes after
this continue keyword then this will be
skipped and your program will go to the
next iteration so in case of three are
discontinued continue keyword is called
so this will be skipped that means three
will not be printed and then in the
condition of for this condition is not
match so once again this will print
using this echo and in the case of six
this is called and the if this is called
everything after the continue keyword
will be skipped so it will not print six
and it will go to the next iteration and
then it sees that I is equal to seven
and it will go normally until this
condition is met okay so this is how
break and continue keyword works in
shell scripting I hope you have enjoyed
