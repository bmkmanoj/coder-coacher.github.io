video I will show you how to install C
make on your Ubuntu operating system I
will also show you how to make use of C
make and how to build your first C++
program with C make and QT creator IDE
so first of all let's see what a why C
make is important so when you go on the
C make dot o-r-g the on the first page
it's written that C make is the
cross-platform open-source build system
so cross-platform is important for us
because the program which you build from
C make can be used on different
operating system like Windows or Ubuntu
or Mac or you can say and you can see
the list of distribution on which your
program can be used so that's the
important thing
so whatever program for example C++
program you have built on Linux that can
be used or reused on your Windows
operating system it will generate the
visual c++ project the same project in
Visual C++ in Windows so that's very
interesting for us so first of all let's
see how we can install C make on our
Ubuntu operating system
so just open this terminal on you're
open to operating system and on the
terminal you need to paste or you need
to write this command so write sudo apt
- cat install C mix it's very simple and
give you a password and it will install
in your system and I will say yes
so now my see make is installed in my
system so once this see make is
installed in your system
you will be able to see in your file
system so if you go to your file system
and go to user bin in a bun - you will
be able to see this see make executable
you okay and now I will launch QT
creator so if you don't know how to
install QT creator on Ubuntu I also have
the tutorial on that so just you can
search my channel and you can just
install QT creator so I will open this
QT creator first so my QT creator is
open now and I am I will make a new
project and build it with CMake so I
will go to file new project and go to
non Qt project here non Qt project and
you can see automatically here there is
an option play in C++ C make build and
plain C project C make builds so I'm
going to make a plain C++ C make build
because I am going to use C make so I
will select this and I will choose and I
will give the project name
see make test and you can choose the
default location for the project or you
can just make a new workspace so I will
make a new workspace for me
QT workspace here and I will choose this
world space here for example and I will
say next and I will say finish and now
by default when you are making your
project using C make it makes a folder
called your project name - Build folder
in which all your build or executable
file will be there so your source code
is in your project folder and in your
build folder there will be executable
files okay so click Next you don't need
to do anything it will generate the
build folder automatically so click Next
and here is the important step so
whenever you are making the this project
for the first time you need to give the
argument like this so like right - DC
make under scope build underscore type
is equal to debug or release whatever
you want okay and when you click this
run C make it will compile your project
and if you don't see any red red wants
here that means your C make is
working or is ready to work or otherwise
in some cases you need to give the path
of your see make directory which I have
shown you in the user bin folder right
so go to the file system user and bin
and here you will be able to find the
see make if it asks for the part for see
make then you need to give the path for
the Simic so it's very simple so our
project is successfully made and we will
say finish so when you're first see make
program is build you will be able to see
this see make list dot txt which will be
optically generated and when you see
here there are some arguments and some
mam see make code here which is
generated by default so this I will
maybe explain in next videos this is a
hollow world program so it is generated
automatically I will just right click
and say build and it will build my
program without any error so this build
is done by the C make build
that's important it's not using any
other cutie make Q make build options
it's using the C make option and when I
run the program it's running so in this
way you can configure and install C make
and write your first program for C++
program in your Qt creator with C make
so I hope you have learned something new
this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
