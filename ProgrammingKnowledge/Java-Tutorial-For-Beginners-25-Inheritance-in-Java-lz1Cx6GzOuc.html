tutorial on Java programming from
beginners and in this video we will see
what is class inheritance in Java and
how to use class inheritance in Java so
classes in Java can be extended and how
they can be extended by creating new
classes which can retain the character
sticks of the base class and base class
I mean here is the class from which we
are inheriting now to understand it
fully I have a little diagram to explain
now for example I want to make a class
which can calculate the area of some
shapes so it can be rectangle square
circle or triangle or anything right so
I can make a class called polygon
because they share rectangle and
triangle shares a similar property and
what is this property they both have
width and height right so I can define
two variables in my polygon class and I
can set these width and height of these
value in this polygon class using a
method set value and in this rectangle
or an triangle class I can create two
methods which can calculate the area of
triangle and area of rectangle so the
common properties which they both share
which is height and width we can not we
don't need to define it in separate
places in rectangle also and triangle
also we can define them at the single
place and we can use them using the
inheritance property and
how you can know that these shapes or
whatever classes you are going to make
shares inheritance property so if the
classes you are making have is our
relationship is our means what I mean to
say is is our relationship like this so
rectangle is a polygon right and
triangle is a prop polygon so they share
is a property in between them so this
relationship whenever some class
inherits from some other class the share
is a property or in a relationship so
rectangle is a polygon and triangle is a
pro polygon right so let's go towards
the code part of it so what we are going
to do is we are going to make three
classes so we will go to the package one
class first class we are going to make
and I will call it as poly gone right
and I will I'm going to make two more
classes one is rectangle and one is
triangle so I will say this is rectangle
plus and I'm going to make one more
class which is going to be the triangle
class triangle okay now in my polygon
class I have what property in common
both rectangle and triangle can have
width and height so I will define two
variable which will be protected and why
they are protected I have shown you and
I have shown you
what is the meaning of access modifier
so protected and then int height and in
the same way I will declare one more
variable which will also be protected
which will be with okay and I will
define a method which will be public and
which will return the area so for
example we will return area in double
right and so this in here let's try to
set the values of for width and height
for rectangle and triangle okay so this
will be void set values and in here we
will define in a comma int B and
whatever user will pass the value of a
we will just say height is equal to a
and width is equal to width is equal to
B okay so by this method we are going to
set the values okay now in my rectangle
class how we can inherit from this
polygon class we can inherit from
polygon class in my rectangle class by
using keyword extends okay just use the
keyword extend and then use the class
from which you are extending okay so
rectangle class is inheriting from your
polygon class
and polygons class is he in here is
called derived class and rectangle class
here is the class which is deriving
right so this can be called base class
and this can be called the cloud class
which is deriving okay in a same way I
will extend in the triangle class also
from polygon because polygon is my base
class from which I am inheriting and now
in my rectangle class I'm just going to
calculate the area now one whenever or
if you are inheriting from a base class
to a derived class then all its
protected members and public members are
accessible in your derived class okay so
these member height and width and set
values are expressed can be accessed by
this rectangle class because we are
extending from it okay if this was these
variables and this methods what private
then we cannot you know use them in
other classes but because they are
protected and public protected and
public method can be used in subclasses
so this is a subclass and this is a base
class so we can just define a method
public and this will be the area so
double area and what this method is
going to do it will just return the area
so return
height and - width and which height and
which width we are talking about here
because we haven't declared width and
height inside this class in this
rectangle class right but whenever you
hover over and click on this height you
will go to the height in polygons class
okay so this height in polygons class is
accessible in this rectangle class also
ok and with also from polygon class is
acceptable in the rectangle class also
okay in a similar way the area of that
triangle is half so height into width /
- right so we will just divide it by two
okay so we have everything we have the
area of triangle we have area of a
rectangle and we are setting these value
by this polygon class now what we can do
in our main method we can use or we can
create the instance of rectangle class
so rectangle are easy for a rectangle is
equal to new rectangle and we are going
to create the instance of our triangle
class also so triangle TR t RI is equal
to new triangle and then for calculating
the area we first need to set the value
so we will set the value of first
rectangle so we will use instance of
rectangle class dot set because we are
inheriting from the polygon class in
rectangle class this set value
method is ox also accessible in the
rectangle class wire it's instant okay
that's why we can access set when you
method wire this rectangle instance for
example we have ten and ten width and
height okay in a same way we can access
set value method from our triangle class
and this for example e is also same then
and then width and height okay now we
just need to call the area so we can
just write this oh and from rectangle
class we can call its area method dot
area and in a same way we can call the
area from the triangle instance which is
try and now when we run the program we
will get the answer first is the area of
rectangle and second is the area of
triangle so we can just modify this
something like this area of
rectangle
is equal to plus right in a same way we
can write area of triangle is equal to
this one okay and area of rectangle and
triangle are displayed like the area of
rectangle is 100 which is 10 into 10
width into height and area of triangle
is equal to 10 into 10 divided by 2 is
equal to 50 right so once again whenever
we use inheritance all the property of
the base class in our trace polygon
class is available in your derived class
in our case these are rectangle and
triangle class so all the method which
are protected or public are accessible
inside our rectangle or triangle Schloss
okay so you can use the method inside
polygon class if you derive it in
rectangle class you can use this height
and width we have different derived in
here using this rectangle it's lost
because we are extending from it okay so
in this way you can extend the property
of polygon class to the rectangles laws
and same is for triangle class so I hope
you have understood the basic concept of
inheritance in Java and I hope you
