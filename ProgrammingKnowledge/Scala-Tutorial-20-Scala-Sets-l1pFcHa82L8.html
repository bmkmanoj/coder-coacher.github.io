scarlet roll for beginners in this video
we will learn how to use sets in Scala
now first of all what are sets so in
Scala set is a collection of different
elements of same data types so what do I
mean by that so a set cannot have
duplicate values inside them so all
values inside a set must be unique so
let's say I have declared in the
previous video this list and I have
given these values to the list and when
I add some duplicates value for example
4 and 4 two times and when I run the
code it's possible to have duplicate
values inside the list but when I
declare a set let's declare a set so a
set can be of two kinds mutable set and
the immutable set now the difference
between the mutable sets and immutable
set is that that the object itself
cannot be changed inside immutableset ok
so how we can declare a set so when we
write well my set so this is the
variable name and then we need to use
the keyword set instead of the list and
same we will do here ok and as I said
set cannot have duplicate value but
let's say I just added this duplicate
value 4 and 4 here and same for the set
of strings so instead of using lists
here we will just use the keyword set ok
now let's print this my set using print
line and I'm going to run the code and
you can see even though I have entered
duplicate values in my set declaration
when I print the set you can see all
values are unique in the set so only 1/4
is printed here it has just resolved the
set and
only 1/4 is present here so even though
you can just repeat the value in the
Declaration even though for example I
have used repeated values inside the set
when I just print the set all values
will be unique now let's say I want to
just add something to this set so by
default when I declare this set like
this all sets are by default immutable
ok so by default all sets are immutable
and when I want to declare a set as
mutable then I need to use this kind of
notation so instead of this I need to
use this kind of notation which is Scala
dot collection dot mutable dot set and
because it's mutable let me just change
it to var here and here also in the
declaration I will just write mutable
here also or even better I can just
remove this from here and that's also a
valid mutable set ok so whenever you
want to declare a mutable set you can
declare it like this but by default when
you declare a set like this it's
immutable so let's say I want to add
some value to set I can just write my
set +10 right and lets me let me print
the value of my set also so we can also
see the value of my set so when I use a
plus operator and then just add some
value to my set it just added this value
to the set
but keep in mind when I print the my set
my set in itself is not changed right so
when I add this value 10 to the set it
has created a new set and then printed
this set here ok but my set in itself is
not changed because it's immutable right
now one more interesting
thing you can see here is set is not
ordered
okay so sets in Scala are not ordered
that means when I inserted let's say ten
into this set this is inserted at this
place which is completely out of order
right so it's not added to the end or
it's not added to the front it is added
to our random place here right so sets
are not ordered that means you cannot
index sets okay so let's say when I say
my set and let's say when I say eight
here so when I write something like this
this means that I want to check whether
eight is present inside my stat or not
right in the case of list this would be
the index of the list but there is no
such thing like index inside said so
when I write this kind of notation this
means that it's want to check whether it
is present in the set or not okay and
when you want to learn more about this
you can see it's just applying the
method and then it will give the boolean
value and it tests if some element is
contained in the set or not okay so let
me run the code and let's see what
happens when I run the code so it says
true because eight is present inside the
set let's say I just add some random
value here and when I run the code
it says false because it a dated is not
present in my set same you can do for
the string set also so let's say I just
write max here - name set right and when
I run the code it says true and when I
just add some random name here it'll say
false here now let me use three method
which we can you
four sets and these are let's say my
said dot had it let's say and then I
want to use the tail and I want to use
if the set is empty or not so is empty
and then I'm going to run this code and
what it returns so head returns the
first value of set so at this time the
first value inside the set is five let's
say and the meta tail will give you the
rest of the element except for the first
element and the is empty method is going
to check whether the set is empty or not
now let's say I want to concatenate two
sets so I'm going to just remove these
duplicate values and what I want to do
is I want to concatenate two set let's
say here I want to add some more values
here
so I have declared a set and let's say
this set is my set to write so this is
also a set and let's say I want to
concatenate my set and my set to so how
can I do this and to do this we have two
variations one we can use double plus
operators and then we can just write my
set two which is going to concatenate
these two values otherwise what you can
do is were you can do the same thing
using this notation also so you can just
write the first set my set let's say and
then dot plus plus and in the
parenthesis the second set so the second
set is my set to and this is the same
notation as the first which is above
this line okay so I'm going to run the
code and what you will observe here is
this result is showing the unique values
in both the sets so in the result the
duplicate values are removed okay only
the unique values inside both the sets
are printed here now let's say you want
to just find out that intersection of
two sets then you can just write print
Ln and then first of all you will just
write first set and then you will use
the notation dot and okay so just use
the notation dot and and then the second
set which is my set to and what it's
going to do is it's going to give us the
intersection of those set so whatever
values are intersecting between these
two sets let's say you can see nine and
nine are intersecting or four and four
and intersecting and two and two are
intersecting so that result will be
printed this is the intersection and
then all the other values are you know
not printed you can do the same using
the intercept
method also so my set thought into set
and this is also going to give you the
same result and it will give me the same
result
in this way you can use sets in Scala
for more method about sets you can
always use for example your setting and
then dot operator and then you can see
the list of all the methods you can use
with the set so let's say for example I
want to print out the maximum value I
can use Max or the minimum value I can
use the min and so on and so forth so
I'm going to just print the min and Max
values let's say and here is the min and
let me just convert it to print Ln here
okay println and print Ln and I'm going
to just save the code and run it once
again
which is going to give me the result 9 n
1 so 9 is the maximum value inside this
my set and 1 is the minimum value one
last thing I want to show here is how we
can use the set with the for loops so I
can run just write my set name my set
dot for each and then you just can you
know iterate over this set so for
example I want to print all the values
inside the set so I will just write
print L n here and this is going to
print out all the elements inside my set
now let's say I want to use the normal
for loop so for that I can just write 4
and let's say I want to iterate over the
names set so I can just write name here
and then this arrow symbol and then I
want to iterate over the names set right
so I will just write names set here and
then this name keyword is going to give
me every time it iterate over the set
the element its iterating over so I can
just write
prynt Ln and then I can write name here
and let's run the code let's see what
happens
so it has iterated over the first set
and it had iterated over the second set
using the second for loop so I hope you
