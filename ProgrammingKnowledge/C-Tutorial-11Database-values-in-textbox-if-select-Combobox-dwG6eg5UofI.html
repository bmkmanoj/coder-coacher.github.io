last video I have shown you how to link
your combo box with your database and I
have shown one column containing names
in my combo box now in this video I will
show you if you select one of these
names
how can you display the corresponding
data in these text field so for example
if I select mark from here his employee
ID his name mark his last name and its
age should appear here for every name
right so how can I do that I will show
you in this video so
first of all just select your combo box
and double click it and this will lead
us to the event of this combo box combo
selected index event this is and if you
remember in the last video I have shown
you this fill combo method right to fill
the combo box just copy this code within
the function of the method from string
to the catch block here and we will once
again go to the form and just double
click it and inside this combo box event
I will paste all the code here okay
and this code will remain same just I
will change the query so I have the
database called database and table name
is II data and I have this column name a
ID name surname and age for column I
want to show in the text boxes when I
select something in the combo box so I
will write select star from database dot
e data and I will add it the query after
that where name is equal to single
quotes then double quotes + + and inside
this double plus sign I will copy the
name of this combo box which is combo
box one copy it
and paste it here and then write dot txt
okay
and then in the while loop we have
written last time this string
declaration and we have populated the
combo box with the names so I will
delete this combo box 1 dot items dot
add a name and I will copy this string
variable and paste it four times because
I want to show the name employee ID
surname and gate so first is the I D and
here also I will change the variable
name e ID name will remain same here I
will change so name surname and he also
column name so these are all the column
names right
which are like this this column e ID
name so they manage and last is age and
he rolls age
okay but here in the last string I have
aged as a integer so these are having I
will show you I will so I click my
database and alter database where you
will be able to see the data types of
the columns so Eid data type is int name
data type is where cap which is just
like string and it is also data type int
right so I need to change this one age
and Eid as int so I will go here instead
of this string I will write int and in
here also my either don't get int 32
this is a standard form for INT in c
shop for here also I will change the
same int and in here also not get int 32
okay this will place my data in these
variables now I have other problem this
int I cannot show in the text box
because text box we can only pass the
string values right and if you pass the
integer in the text it will show some
error so I need our trick to convert my
int into the strings so that I can pass
into my text boxes so what is the trick
let's see I will just change my in
employee ideas string so it will shows
the error but you can change this int
into string by dot to string
right and bracket and back closed and
your error is gone so in this way you
can convert your int integer into the
string on this also I will do the same
for the heat dot to string racket and
bracket load and this is it so I am
taking employee ID in this string name
in this and the surname in this and the
age in this now I will pass these
strings into the text fields so just go
to your form copy the text box name of
your AI dee' and come here paste it here
dot text is equal to this one first
employee ID strength okay same eye we do
for all the four text boxes just take it
and waist tail dot text
is equal to me this one
once again
sunny
and I mean just copy the edge also
textbox
okay and I will just copy this dot text
paste it here or paste it here is equal
to is equal to and copy this paste it
here and copy this paste it right so
what I have done is I took the column
values value from E I D and then pass it
into the strength and then I will
transfer this string into this Eid
textbox I think for this I don't need
the while loop so I will just commenting
this and now we will run our code okay
let's see if it smoke or not username
password correct second and my combo box
is filled with the values but when I
selects any values from here all the
respective value should appear let's see
no it's not appearing in melet attempt
across the field before calling okay
let's go to our code once again
so initially I thought that I don't need
this value but I think now I need this
wide loop because it shrinks me show me
some error so uncomment this while loop
and just run the program once again
username password correct and when I
select any value in the combo box it
will show me the respective value of
that name right we can check against the
database also so let's see for example I
select John it will his employee IDs one
is her name is Bell and his age is 27 so
let's select John this data comes okay
so we know that it's giving us the right
values so in this way you can show your
selected combo box items into the text
field I hope you have enjoyed this video
