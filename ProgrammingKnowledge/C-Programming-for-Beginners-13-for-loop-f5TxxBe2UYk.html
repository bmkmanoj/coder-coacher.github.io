tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last two videos we have seen how
a loop works in a C and we have learned
how to use while loop and do-while loop
in C now in this video we are going to
learn how to use for loop in C so for
loop is also a kind of loop which
depends upon the initialization
condition and the increment property so
let's see what is the basic structure of
for loop and then we will take an
example and see how it works so the
basic structure of for loop looks like
this and this structure starts with
keyword 4 and then comes these brackets
and in these bracket comes three
arguments and these arguments are
separated by these semicolon okay so
this is these are the semicolons
and these are three different parameters
and then comes these two curly braces
and if the condition in this for loop is
true then this code inside your for loop
will be executed now first parameter in
this for loop is called image or
initialization of something second
parameter checks whether some condition
is true or not which is related to
initialization and then the third
parameter is the increment of the
parameter which you have initialized in
the first parameter so this is the basic
structure of for loop now let us take
the same example which we have been
seeing in the last our two videos just
renting
zero to ten as an integer so I will just
declare a variable which is equal to
zero and on the basis of this variable I
want to print ten but in the last video
I have shown you that you need to
declare this first of all initialize it
and then you have need to give the while
loop and then check the condition and
then increment but in the for loop it
it's done automatically and or you don't
need to initialize anything separately
but what we will do is we will just
start with four and then with of bracket
and inside this bracket I have told you
first a parameter is the initialization
so initialization you can do it like
this int I and then I is equal to zero
right it's just like declaring a
variable in a is equal to zero like this
okay so in follow we don't need to do
this kind of initialization separately
but we can do it inside the for loop
okay now comes the semicolon and then
comes the condition so as we have seen
in the last two videos that in while
loop and do-while loop we check some
condition to fulfill and if this
condition is fulfilled then we execute
the code so in this for loop we are
checking if I is less than 10 okay so we
are checking this condition if the I
value of I is less than 10 because we
have initialized I with 0 I value of I
will be you know replaced here and it
will check first of all 0 is 0 is less
than 10 which is true and we keep on
going
this until analyst the condition is met
now the third parameter is incrementing
the values like this I plus plus and in
the previous videos I have told you I
plus plus just means I for example I is
equal to I plus 1 it's just like this I
in short whenever you want to increment
the value of any variable you just write
I plus plus like this okay now comes
your curly braces so what we have done
in our for loop we have initialized a
variable and then we are checking on the
basis of that variable if some condition
is true and we are incrementing the
variable which we have initialized now
we just need to do whatever we want to
do inside our for loop for example if
you want to print so we just try printf
and then we can write the value of I is
equal to percentage D right and then
comma I and don't forget this semicolon
here and this should be value okay so
the for loop takes care of your
initialization condition and increment
and then you can you know do whatever
you want to do inside your loop and this
loop will print the value of I from 0 to
10 and in it's incrementing it also now
let's first run our program and let's
see what's the result and first of all
what it's saying some error it's showing
so I will see what's the error and the
error s for loop initial declare
are only allowed in here okay so what we
will do here so if you see this error
which says that for for loop initial
declaration are only allowed in c99 mode
then if you have C 99 which is a newer
version of C is not enabled in your IDE
especially in code blocks so to enable
this C 99 in your code blocks you just
need to go to your project
so just right-click your project here or
you can just go to the settings here so
I will prefer to go to my project and
right-click my project and I will go to
the build or the properties here the
last option so go to the last of portion
called properties and in here go to
project build option so click this
project builds option and in here it
will open product builds option and in
here you will be able to see compiler
flags and there is a tab called
other options okay in other options you
just need to type this - STD is equal to
C 99 okay so just type this - STD is
equal to C 99 and just click OK click OK
and I will just paste it here so you can
see it better it's - STD C 99 ok now
when I compile this program and run this
it runs right and I should give this
line break here so we can see the output
and now we can see from 0 to 9 the value
of I is printed and how it is working so
initially we initialize the value of Phi
is
to zero and then see checks this
condition if the value of I which is
initially 0 is less than 10 or not if
it's less than 10 then it goes here and
execute your code first and then after
your code execution just above this
curly braces ending it increases the
value of I so then before the value of I
was 0 now it becomes 1 and then once
again it checks whether this condition
is true 1 is less than 10 which is not
true it prints the value of I and then
increments the value of I just before
here so I becomes 2 and it goes and goes
and goes until and unless this condition
becomes false and then it goes out of
the loop ok so once again it prints from
0 to 9 and if you want to print 0 to 10
just add equal to after your greater
than or less than sign okay so there is
a very simple rule here is always use
equal to after your greater than or
smaller than this symbol okay and once
again when you run the program it prints
from 0 to 10 okay
so in this way you can use for loop and
