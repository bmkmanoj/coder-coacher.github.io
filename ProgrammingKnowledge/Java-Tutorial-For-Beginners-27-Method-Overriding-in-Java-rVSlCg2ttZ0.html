tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what is method overriding and how it's
different from method overloading so in
the last video I have shown you how and
what is polymorphism and how we can use
it right so we have defined a superclass
which we call it as Bank and it was
having one method called get interest
rate which returns the interest rate of
the bank okay and we have defined a sub
class which we call it as Bank ABC which
extends from Bank class and let's say
for now it doesn't have anything so it
doesn't have any implementation and now
whenever we create the instance or the
object of class ABC using the reference
of Bank ABC or using the reference of
banked class which is our superclass
then what happens let's see so it
returns use 0 right because here in the
superclass it has the method get
interest rate and which returns 0 and
here there is no implementation of cat
interest rate right so whenever we
define a reference which points to the
object of the subclass which in our case
this is Bank ABC and when we call this
get interest rate function it refers to
this function which is in the superclass
right now for example we introduce a
function which has the same name and the
same return type and same number of
arguments as in block base or sober
class ok so
I have the same implementation in my sub
class also the only differences is
returning five and our superclass was
returning zero interest okay
and now earlier the the interest rate
returns was zero and now when we run the
program it returns five and this
phenomena is called a method overriding
and method overriding is nothing but the
changing of the implementation of the
method okay so earlier the method which
we were using for getting the interest
was this one get interest rate from the
base class but as soon as we introduce a
new method in a subclass which is same
and it's returning different you know
interest rate and we define the object
of the subclass as a reference then you
see it's returning five right so your
base class or your object will always
take the latest or the most recent
method which is defined so this is the
most recent method and it happened it's
happening at the runtime that's why it's
returning five so this is called method
overriding now there are some rules for
method overriding the rule of method
overriding is you must have same number
of arguments same name and same return
data type for overriding a method so for
example this can get interest method was
returning integer and it doesn't take
any argument in here also we have to
whenever we want to override the method
which was there in the superclass we
have to define the
integer return type and with no argument
if you do it something like this end
for example this thing this will be
called method overloading and this will
not be called method overriding so this
takes us to what is the difference
between method overloading and method
overriding right
so generally method over loading we use
in a same class right so in this if we
want to do it we can do it something
like this and we can return in ABC
something like this okay and this to
method are called the method overloading
so this method is overloading of a
previous method right so this generally
happens in the same class and whenever
you do the method overloading this
return type can be different the
arguments can be different but the only
same thing here is the method name so in
method overloading only method name
should be same but you can change the
return type or number of argument also
but in the method overriding you cannot
change the return type or the number of
argument okay so this is the main
difference between method overloading
and method overriding so I hope you have
understood the basic concept of method
overriding and what is the difference
between method overloading and method
overriding so that's it for this video
