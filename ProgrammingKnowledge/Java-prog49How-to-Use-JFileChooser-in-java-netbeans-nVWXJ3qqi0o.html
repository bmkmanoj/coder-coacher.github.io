going to show you how to use J by
chooser so jfilechooser you can find
into your AWT components and here is
your jfilechooser so take it and drag it
to your J frame and it looks like this
so when you run the program you can see
here you can choose any of your document
from your computer or your file or disks
you can copy all these or search for
these and when you click example take
this document and open it's not doing
anything but I will show you how to use
this to me
so if you use this jfilechooser the
first thing comes into mind is it's
taking too much of your place in the
jframe so what if a button can do the
same thing or open the same thing
without using this big J component so I
will delete this J component and I will
take just a button to open j-pal juda
and also I will take text eat
to
showed the path of the file you have
chosen so this is I named it as touch
and make this text field empty so right
click your button go to event detection
and action performed and in your action
performed right J
by chooser give it any name as you wish
is equal to mu J Phi to complete the
bracket and complete it I think I did
some spelling mistake so yes here - so
my spelling mistakes correct what I did
what I have to do is right-click and go
to fix import this will fix all of your
import files here above so we were
missing this file
import javax.swing Danzig if I choose
Network that's why it was showing the
error so now write this after this line
you have to write
chooser which is this variable name
not
so
dialogue in this right null after that
right while this is data type y is and
give it any name them it as f is equal
to choose ur dot that selected file
and make it flows this file is showing
error once again so I will right click
and click fix imports it will fix my
import I have to import Java dot IO dot
file so I press ok and let me go the
error will go after that right string
variable and I will name it as is equal
to F which is this F dot get
absolute part like this after this
just copy your text we named because we
need it for showing our path of our
files so just copy this dot set text and
yeah it is fine name this variable name
paste it here and you are good to go now
so now let's try to run our program we
just need these four or five lines in
order to open your jfilechooser so let's
run the program yes
so I've just pressed attach it opens my
file chooser so I will fire choose one
file for example I want to choose
anything this and you can see the
absolute path of this table is printed
into my text field so this is the
tutorial how you can use the day file
the jfilechooser by using a button and
how to copy and paste your absolute path
into on the text field you can use this
for many applications I will continue
this jfilechooser tutorial and I will
show you how to save and open document
by this jfilechooser in the coming
videos so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
