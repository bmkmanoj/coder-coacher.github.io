bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use models in
bootstrap so first of all what is a
model model is just like a pop-up box or
a pop-up window on top of your web page
okay so it will appear on top of your
web page for showing something for
example for showing some login form or
for showing some contact information or
anything so let's see how we can create
a model in bootstrap so first of all go
to your HTML code and in here first of
all we will create a button which we
will use to open our model so just
create a button and in this button this
will be first of all type is equal to
button and then the class will be equal
to BTN BTN and let's say it's a danger
button okay and then we will add some
more attributes to it first is data
toggle so data toggle and this will be
equal to modal ok so just write modal
here and the second attribute we are
going to add here is data target and
this will be equal to the name which you
will set to reference the model so you
can just write a hash and define any
name of out your choice for example my
model or any other name okay so now
using this ID we are going to create or
call a model okay
so now we are going to create an actual
body of model so just add a div tag here
and add
this ID so we will reference this ID
here first of all which is my model okay
so just give it here
the second thing is we will call a class
called model fade so model - fade I
think this will be only model fade thus
this kind and we will define one more
attribute here which will be role and
it's a dialogue okay now inside this div
tag we will add one more div tag like
this so they've and we will add a class
called class is equal to modal dialogue
so modal dialogue this okay now inside
this modal dialogue we will add the
content of the model okay
so just add one more div element div and
this time this will be the model content
so add a class called modal - content
okay and inside the content it will work
like normal body of HTML page you can
say it has a header and the body and the
footer so we will add three more devs
here
first of all Dave for the modal header
so modal first of all class class is
equal to modal - head up and this will
contain the header of the model in a
same way we will add two more their
second is the modal body and third is
the modal footer
okay so this is our basic model you can
write something here something like
model header and here you can write
model body and here you can write model
footer okay and save it and we will
refresh our page and we will see this
button and when you click this button
it's going to show this model this
button we haven't included anything as a
text so let's add some text to it so
this button is open model okay save it
once again we are going to refresh our
page and just click open model and it is
going to open this kind of pop-up box
which has had a and the body and the
footer but you will notice here that
there is nothing to close this model
okay so there should be some X symbol or
some close button to close this model so
to add this close symbol or button what
we can do here is in the footer for
example you want to add this close
button so what we are going to do here
inside the footer we are going to create
this button button and inside this first
of all we will add this type which will
be button second we will add a class
which will be BTN and for closing let's
add BT and default for example BTN
default okay and then we will add one
more attribute which will be data this
so add this class data
- dismiss and this will be not with SS
it will be single s and then just write
modal here okay and as a text you can
write here close and save it and refresh
your webpage and click open Moodle and
now we have close button which we press
and it's closed in the same way you can
add this X symbol to the header so just
go and copy this button here and inside
the modal header we have this modal
header here and just after this we can
add this button but this time it will be
of class close so just add closed and
the text here will be our X symbol so
it's something like and times like this
okay save it and refresh your page and
open model and you see here this X
symbol which you click and it will be
disappeared okay now one more thing you
can add to the header which is for
example this div tag you can add Dave
and here you can add a class called
modal - title and in here you can add
your title in any tag for example h1 tag
or any other tag you can add it okay so
save it and refresh your page and once
again open model it will be like this
but we can see this X symbol is down and
this is a little bit above to adjust
this we can just
place this div at the bottom and instead
of using the staff you can use h4 tag or
h3 tag something like this save it and
once again refresh this webpage and now
you can see this header which is a title
and this closing button closing button
and the body in the body you can add any
div any HTML tag for example you want to
add a paragraph you can just add
something like this add a paragraph and
inside this paragraph you can add some
text for example this lorem ipsum
something like this save it and close
this and refresh it open Moodle and now
your text has here okay
so in this way you can use modal one
more thing if you want to use this model
with for example about this about
navigation bar button you can do it also
so for example what we want to do is
with this about button we want to open
this modal so what we can do instead of
using this button just copy this data
toggle and data target from here and
place it in the about list item here so
just add it here in the link tag okay
I'm going to delete this button because
we are not going to use it now save it
and refresh your page and now when you
click this about button you will see
this modal okay and you can close it so
you can call it from here or using any
button so I hope you enjoyed this video
