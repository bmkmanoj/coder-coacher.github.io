we have made and we have successfully
able to save our data delete update
clear or text field and make our jframe
like that now I want to teach you
something more interesting about
deleting when you click J table and this
thought as represented in these text
field when you click delete button the
data is instantly deleted when you press
ok
not as deleted but sometimes you want
that was some message should come that
in most of the very big project when you
delete the data it will ask you whether
you want to really delete or save the
data so by mistake
if you press delete buttons on the order
your data should not be deleted so for
example I will show you an example
so in my previous project this I am made
and when you press the button the window
will ask do you really want to delete
the data and if you press no then it
will not delete the data if you press
yes it will be a to your daughter so
let's learn how to do that so go to your
delete method like right licking your
delete button event action action
performed so we will go directly into
the delete action perform method and in
this we have already created our delete
method I think I've shown you in the
video number 16 how to delete data now
we just have to write some line
in order to make it ask you we really
want to delete your data so right here
in P you can take any any p name then J
option a dot show confirm dialogue
and in the confirmed dialogue we must
write in first we should write null
because we don't want this build in
second feed here is to follow at semi
column second field you can write your
message whatever you want to display at
the time of greeting
so for example I want to write you
we want to delete like that then once
again comma and in here you can give the
name to the message box so I will name
as limiters delete
and once again the palma
right J option pain dot
right
yes no option
so I moved once again tell you what time
written when I will complete and then
will load my third
you know first line which here written
you should write a condition if P is
equal to zero this P is same as this in
P which we have declared earlier
so this FP is equal to zero
we have to enclose a hole delete method
in this ape condition so first
parentheses I make it here and after
closing Panthers here you can see if
statement is closing our delete method
okay
and then now when we run the program
and we want to delete the data it will
ask you do I really want to delete which
is our message and this is the delete
which we have given the name to this box
so for now I click no because I don't
want to delete my daughter and I'll show
you once again the code so you can
remember it just go to your delete
action perform method write int P give
any variable name is equal to J option P
dot show confirmation dialog and in the
bracket null comma the message you want
to display and you are deleting the data
comma the name of the frame which is
opening comma J option pain dot yes/no
option and then in the next line if this
P is equal to zero and you have to
enclose in the condition your previous
delete code which you've written already
and which I have shown already in the
video 16 then it will ask you whether
you want to delete the data or not so
once again I will try to run the program
I choose four and I press Delete and it
will ask me do you want to leave the dot
on that if I will say yes data will be
deleted and you can see is that I've
already deleted from there so that was a
tutorial how to make a condition I hope
you have enjoyed please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
