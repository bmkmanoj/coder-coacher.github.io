video we will see how to use loops with
your LabVIEW programs so till now we
have this numeric control and numeric
indicator and when I increase this
numeric value this indicator will be
increased by the multiple of five but
here you can see there are two button
there is Run button and there is run
continuously button and if you want this
program to respond continuously you need
to press this run continuously and if
you run this program only once or press
this button it just responds one so
there is there are controls in LabVIEW
to run your program continuously with
the help of loops so let's see how we
can do that
first of all let's add one more
indicator here so I will go to first of
all I will right click and go to numeric
indicator and you can take a tank or
whatever indicator you would like to
have indicator means the outputs so just
remember that this is the output and
this is the output and the control means
the input what you are given so right
click once again numeric controls that
means this we will use for giving the
inputs let's take a pointer slide and
drag and drop here and in here instead
of this constant I will delete this
constant and I will right click delete
wire branch and once again I will
connect this by this
multiply sign and the output I can see
here also on the numeric indicator and I
will connect this output with this tank
also so this will also increase okay so
once you have done that just right click
and here you will see the function
palette just pin it down and if you have
just this you can just click here at the
bottom this arrow and you will see the
detail list go to programs and go to
structures and here you will see the
loops and other structures this for loop
and while loop are used extensively in
LabVIEW for loop is used whenever you
know the number of turns of number of
iterations you need to give you your
loop and the while loop runs
continuously until you stop it
so we are going to use while loops just
click it and go to your block diagram
and just cover your program with this
loop like this and you can make it
bigger also so your loop is complete but
you will see here your Run button is
showing some error so just click it it
says that while loop conditional
terminal is not wired that means you
haven't given your loop to a condition
to stop or when it stops so just go to
this red button here just right click
and we are going to create our control
for that so just click create control
and you will see this stop button here
when this stop button comes here on the
front panel also you will be able to see
the stop button so when you press the
stop button your while loop will stop so
now let's try and run our program by the
meantime your Run button will not show
error now so just hit Run button not run
continuously but Run button and when you
increase your slider from here you see
it's increasing this tank here also
right but you also see that when I just
increase this slide slightly up to to
hitting it fills the tank towed healing
so this you can adjust by going into the
property of this tank so you can just
right click go to the properties and you
can
gave the scale from here so here there
is appearance data type scale so you can
give 0-200 scale to this okay
and we make it ten and we run it once
again and now you see that your tank is
spinning as this slider moves up and
down so this is very useful when you
want to run your program continuously
but whenever you run your program
continuously it runs very fast and it
takes lot of machine memory and memory
cycles and that may or may not be useful
for your application sometimes you may
not need to run your while loops so fast
so what you can do is you can give a
weight signal to your while loop so it
will wait for some time and then it
iterates once again so how you can do it
just right-click your function pallet
once again or we already have this
function panel pinned here and go to
programs and in here you will see timing
just click timing and we are going to
take this weight from here and drag and
drop into your while loop and for this
also just right click and we are going
to create a control for that so create
and go to control and from here you can
give the
millisecond in to this controller from
here this numerical value in millisecond
you can give from here and it will
iterate after that many milliseconds so
let's make it 100 milliseconds and now
run your program once again and now your
program runs as it is but it iterates
every hundred milliseconds and you will
see there is no change in the response
and your other resources are also not
engaged to this program so this also you
can do let's increase this weight or
more and you can you see here there is a
delay when I move this slide for some
time you can increase it and you will
see the response delay here so I move it
and you will see the response a little
bit late after 10 seconds so here you
here we go so in this video I just
wanted to let you know how to use loops
while loops and how to give weight or
timing signals to your loop I hope you
have enjoyed this video and you have
learned something new this time please
keep watching these videos and please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
