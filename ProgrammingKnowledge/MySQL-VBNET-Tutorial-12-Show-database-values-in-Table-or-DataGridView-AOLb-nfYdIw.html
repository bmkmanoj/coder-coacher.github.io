video I am going to show you how to load
your data base table values in a data
grid view or a table so let me show you
what I am going to teach you today so I
have this data grid view control in my
form and when I press this load table
button it should load all the table
values from II data which is present in
my database this is the table and I want
to show all the table values with the
column names in this table so whatever
table values are present in this II data
table in my MySQL database I want to
show in this data grid view in Visual
Basic so how can I do that or how can we
do this using Visual Studio I am going
to show you so let's get started what I
am going what you need to do first is
you need to take a data grid view from
here so you will find this data grid
view control from here and just drag and
drop into your form it will look like
this okay so I have already done that
and just take a button from your tip
toolbox and I have changed the name of
this or text of this button as load
table and I have changed the name of
this button as button load table okay
now what I need to do next is I will
select this button and I will double
click this button and in here I have
written a code to load the table in the
data grid view right so let me explain
what I have done these two lines you are
already familiar with I think because
with every in every video I use them
these two lines are you
to connect my Visual Basic project to
the MySQL database so just declare my
skill corn is equal to new MySQL
connection and then just copy this MySQL
connection dot connection string and
give your credentials of your MySQL
server and if you don't understand this
you need to watch the first few videos
of my playlist of this MySQL Plus Visual
Basic so just write these two lines and
these this is the new thing to connect
the data grid view with them with your
database table so you need to declare
three variables or instances of these
classes first declare them as TA as a
new my SQL data adopter second declared
M data D B's data set as new dot table
and third variable declare them be
source as new binding source okay so
this will help us to get the data from
the database this this one and these two
variables will help us to bind our data
which we get from the MySQL data dr. to
the data grid view okay and then give
this try-catch block this also I have
already shown you in the last couple of
videos so if you want you can just copy
this skeleton of the try-catch block to
catch any exception when the query
occurs okay now in the triquet try block
I have just opened the connection with
the MySQL database just copy this MySQL
connection dot open this will open the
connection with the database right and
in here I have declared a string
variable called query this query will
contain the query which
you want to perform in the database
right so just write this select star
from your database name dot your table
named my daughter base name is database
and my table name is edata so that's
what here I have written select star
from database dot e data and then just
copy this command variable which I have
declared above I have already shown you
in the last video that you need to
declare these global variables first is
them MySQL Khan as MySQL connection and
them command as MySQL command right so
just declare these in the global
variable I think you have already have
them if you are following these videos
and then write that command variable is
equal to new MySQL command and just pass
your query which is this query and just
pass the MySQL connection which is this
one so just pass through argument in
this my MySQL command function one is
this ready and second is MySQL
connection right then take this
SDA which is MySQL data dr. variable dot
select command just write SDA dot select
command is equal to command so this will
perform your queries right and then in
the second line what we are doing is we
are writing SDA dot fill and in the
bracket we are passing this data set
variable this line will do is it will
first line is performed just this query
and just taking all the values and then
this this line will fill all the all the
values which are coming from this query
to this data set right and then just
write B source which is your this
binding source variable dot dot a source
is equal to DB data set so now we are
filling our data set to are the binding
source so that this binding source can
bind the data set and your data grid
view right so just write B source dot
data source is equal to DB data set and
in the next line just write the name of
your data grid view which is the name of
this thought a grid view which is data
grid view one dot data source is equal
to B source and then the last line is s
da dot update and in the bracket just
pass this DB data set yeah so this is
the code you need to write in order to
fill your data grid view with the MySQL
table values if you want just pause the
video and just copy all this code right
now we are going to run this program and
username and password and now when you
just click this load table button this
loads all the columns from your II data
table which is this table and it loads
all the values in this data grid view
now suppose you don't want all the all
the values you just want some of the
columns for example you want the column
let's say e ID name surname and age
these four columns you need only and you
don't want to show all this username and
password and other columns in the data
grid view this is very simple you just
need to change the query just right
instead of select star you just write it
select a ID which is the name of my
first column dot name comma
so name comma age so what are these four
things these four things or these four
values are the column names of my first
four column e ID name surname and age
right so just write the name of the
column separated by comma which you want
to show in the data grid view now once
again when I run the program and when I
click this load table button now it only
shows only four columns right now the
next thing is to load the table for
example what you want is as soon as you
log in to the second form or as soon as
you load the second form you want to
load all the table without pressing this
button okay so what you can do is you
can define a new sub so I'm defining a
new sub just above my end class code I
can define the new sub or I can define a
new sub diff above this button load
click button load table click event
anywhere you can define a new sub just
right private load table and I forgot
sub so I right here sub and just press
ENTER here so this will create a new sub
volume and in this sub or sub routine
just copy all the code from your this
button click event load table button
click event and just copy all the code
from here
from start to end and paste it in this
load table sub right and next what we
are doing going to do is just copy this
load table sub from here and just click
your form anywhere not any control but
the form has a hole just double-click it
and at the top just paste this function
load table function and okay I don't
need this semicolon so just paste this
sub here okay and then now when I run
this program and when I log in and as
soon as my second form opens that values
are loaded automatically and I don't
need this load table button anymore okay
so this also you can do it right now the
third thing is suppose you add a new
data to the database so let's see when
we add a new data right now we have 14
entries in our database right I want to
enter employee ID 15 some name some sort
name and age and I save it into the
database
I save the daughter database data is
saved but you see here this table is not
updated when I enter the 15/15 employee
ID and this will or this employee entry
will come here when you click this node
table button so what this load table is
doing is just refreshing your query or
refreshing your disk load table code
will send a new query which will give
you all the values from the database so
this load table is also working as a
refreshing refresh button for your room
for your code so when you click this now
you can see the fifteenth entry in the
data grid view okay and in here in the
database also you will be able to see
when you refresh the database you can
see the fifteenth entry so this also is
handy a function this load table
whenever you save the data and
automatically you want to refresh your
data grid view what you need to do is
just copy this load table function or
sub once again and go to this Save
button click event and this code I have
written in the last videos when I have
shown you how to save your data using
your Visual Basic windows form
application in your MySQL database so
just go at the bottom of this code and
paste this node table sub what this load
table sub will do is after you save your
data in the database it will perform
this load table sub and what this load
table sub will do is it will refresh the
query it or it will send the new query
to the database and it will refresh your
data grid view as soon as you save the
data in the database this function you
can also paste in update button click
event at the last and in the delete
button click event at the last of your
sub routine so now every time you
perform any action your data grid view
is refreshed automatically so for
example I want to
delete this employee ID 15 what I will
do here simply I will write employee ID
15 I will delete it and as soon as I
delete the the I press this delete file
button this will be refreshed
automatically and you will be able to
see only 14 employee ID so let's see I
delete it and your data current view is
refreshed automatically and you can see
here you have only 14 employee ID and
once again if you want to add one more
employee some name and some surname and
age and save it and as soon as you save
your daughter it's there in the data
grid view so in this way you can float
your data grid view using your visual
basic windows form application from the
table in the MySQL table I hope you have
