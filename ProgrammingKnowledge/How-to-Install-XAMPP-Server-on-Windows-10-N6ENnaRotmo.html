show you how you can download and
install xampp webserver on your windows
10 operating system so let's get started
first of all open your favorite browser
and search for XA MPP so just search for
XA MPP and just press ENTER and in here
first option hopefully which will appear
here will be from Apache Friends dot
o-r-g so just click this link and this
will open this website which is Apache
friends don't Watchi and if you want to
change the language you can change the
language from here for example I want
English version of for xmp's so just
change the language and now you can see
the download options here so we want the
option which is for Windows so I will
choose xampp for windows so just click
it and once you click it the download
will start for this example web server
now it's a relatively big file so it
will take some time to download this
xampp executable file so you just need
to wait for maybe a few minutes and once
it's downloaded we can go further so I
will wait for the download and once it
will be downloaded we will see the next
steps so now my download for this zamp
executable file for Windows is complete
so I can run this executable file so
just click run to execute this
executable file and I'm going to
minimize my browser and I will wait for
the installation to start so first of
all it will give you this kind of
warning you just need to click yes and
then it's going to start the
installation wizard for the xampp so
just wait for one or two seconds and
then the installation will start
so now I can see these kind of warnings
so don't worry about these warnings they
will come while you are installing the
exam server so you just need to click
okay for these warnings so you may be
you know see seeing multiple warning in
your case but it's nothing to worry
about you can just click OK to proceed
further right now you will be able to
see this kind of setup interface for
exempt so you just need to click Next
and these are the programs or apps which
will come with your exempt web server so
Apache will come my SQL files era
mercury mail server will come and Tomcat
will come and the program which will
come with it is PHP and perl and also it
will come with PHP myadmin for managing
your MySQL and other you know options
you can see so it's a good idea to leave
them as default all the checkbox is
checked and then click Next and this
will be the location where example will
be installed so just keep this location
in mind we are going to access exempt
from this location so in my case it's C
colon slash XM ok so just click Next and
click Next and click Next and just wait
for some time to you know complete the
installation so it's going to take some
time so just wait for the installation
to complete once this green progress bar
reaches 100% then we are going to go
further now in between you will see this
kind of warning or alert window you just
need to allow the access so just click
allow access and just wait for the
installation to complete ok so now the
installation for the xampp webserver is
complete
and now after the completion its will
ask you whether you want to start the
control panel for the XM to start so
just leave this checkbox as checked and
click finish
ok and once you click finish it's going
to start the control panel for your XM
web server so the language I want to
choose is English so I will just save
this language and then it's going to
start this type of control panel for
example right now in here you can see a
different kind of services and the
status of these services if they are
running or not
so to start apache a web server what we
need to do is we just need to click
start and it's going to start the Apache
web server on port 80 right now
sometimes what happens is generally if
you have other programs installed and
sometimes this port 80 is occupied by
some other programs then you may need to
change this port right so in my case
this port 80 is not occupied by any
other program so it's successfully
running but in most of the cases this
port 80 is occupied by some other
programs so how to change it and first
of all how to check it so the simple way
to check if this port 80 is occupied or
not is just click this button which says
netstat so I'm going to just click
netstat and it will show you all the
ports which are occupied by some
programs so you can see right now port
80 is occupied by my apache web server
but it will show you the description of
all the services which are occupying
some ports right so you can detect which
app is occupying this right now in order
to change in this port for example I
want to change this port from port 80 to
both 8080 or something else what I can
do is I can just click this config
button here and it's going to show me
some options for con file and the other
files I want to choose this first option
which is httpd.conf so just click the
first option and it's going to show you
this kind of what txt file now when you
scroll down you can see here the Apache
web server is listening on port 80 which
is this one right so in order to change
the port simply you just need to write
the number of port which you want to you
know run the Apache on so for example I
want to change it to 8080 just change
this one to 8080 and then save this file
for example I'm going to just change it
here just in case and then I'm going to
just save this file and once this file
is saved you can once again
stop your Apache web server and start it
again and now you will be able to see
you see here now Apache is running on
port 8080 right so if you face some
problem just change this port from here
okay
so I'm going to just revert my changes
so it will remain default here and this
also put 80 and I'm going to save it
again right and I'm going to close it
and i will restart my apache server so
to stop my server and restart it and now
it's running on port 80 okay so once
this is done what we need to do next is
I will just open my browser and in here
I will just enter the localhost okay so
now because my apache web server
is running so I can just you know enter
localhost and check if it's really
running or not so I will just right here
local host and I will just choose this
option which says HTTP colon slash slash
localhost and it's going to show this
kind of webpage which is for xampp
webserver right so this is the welcome
page for your example web server okay so
now we can see that our xampp web server
is running successfully and once you see
this web page then you know that
everything is okay in your Apache web
server now let's try to open a PHP my
admin so I will click this option which
says PHP myadmin and when I click this
it's going to show me error because I
haven't started my MySQL option from
here so once again open your control
panel and then just start this MySQL
from here so just click this second
button which say start and once your
MySQL is started then just click here
allow access and once this is done you
can refresh this page and now you will
be able to see your PHP myadmin also so
let's see what happens for this PHP my
admin so it's going to open this kind of
PHP my admin interface ok so you just
need to start the you know apps which
you want to run from here
now in case this will be port 80 then
what will happen for example I will
change this Apache to listen on port
8080 for example instead of 80 port 8080
so just convert to port 8080 and I will
just say
this so I'm going to just save this and
once this is saved I'm going to close
this and I will stop my Apache web
server and restart it again
okay and now it rests listens on port
8080 and now this time when I go to the
browser and I will just write local host
here and I will click OK it's going to
give me some unknown web page because
this is now listening on port 8080 and
not the default 80 port so you just need
to write after localhost Poulin and then
port 8080 the port you are using here
right so whatever port you have provided
you just need to write here after the
colon and press enter and then you will
be able to see your Apache or xampp home
page okay so this is how you can
download and install xampp web server on
your Windows 10 operating system I hope
