MongoDB tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can
download Mongo Chef which is a GUI tool
to run Mongo command on this Mongo shell
tool now in the last video we have seen
how we can connect to our MongoDB using
this Mongo chef tool now in this video
we will see how we can create our
database and how we can drop a database
using MongoDB now the first thing which
we have to keep in mind is this MongoDB
is different from relational databases
so it has the structure something like
this first you have the database and
inside your database you have
collections and inside the collections
you have documents right so let's create
our database so to create a database you
need a command use and then yet the
database name you want to create for
example my DB ok and then we are going
to press this button which says execute
statement at cursor or f6 ok so just
press this button and say switched to DB
my DB so what does this mean it means
that if my DB database is already
present it is going to switch to my DB
otherwise if the my DB database is not
present then it's going to create the DB
first and then it is going to switch to
this DB ok now the second command which
we have already seen is to list the
current database so for example we are
using my DB as current database to know
this you just need to write DB and then
press this button once again
and says my DB which is the current
working database right now to list out
all the databases which are present
right now you need to give this command
so just give show DBS okay and this is
going to give you the list of all the
databases which are present so just
press this button and it says local but
we have recently created my DB and this
my DB is not listed by this command
which is show DB s the reason for this
is because our data doesn't contain any
documents so to show the databases or to
show you know in the list of databases
your database need to have some
documents so first of all we need to
insert some documents so what we need to
do here we need to insert some document
in the database so command for that is
DB DB is a general term it's not your a
database you are already inside your
database by using this command right so
DB is the general database term it's not
the name of your database right dot the
name of your collection for example you
can give the name to your collection my
collection so this is the name which can
be given by you so we already know that
our database can have collections which
is this collection and then to insert
the data you just need to write dot
insert okay so just write dot insert and
then in the round brackets you need to
give some key value pair like adjacent
right so just give these two curly
braces and then first give the key for
example
name and then the value okay for example
the name can be max okay like this one
okay so this should be like a Jason and
then you press our execute command
button and then it says write result
inserted one which is the insertion
successful command okay now once again
we are going to give this show dbe's
command to see whether now we can see
our database in the list of databases so
once again execute this command and now
you can see my DB is also listed in the
list of databases right now let's see
how we can drop a database or delete a
database using some command right so to
delete a database what you need to do is
you need to give the same command use
the database name which you want to drop
and we have already given this command
right now we are in this database right
so to drop this database you just need
to give the command DB dot drop database
right and this is going to drop your
database in which you are currently
present right so DB is a general
database term it's not the name of your
database but just DB dot drop database
and what it's going to do is in whatever
database you are currently switched in
it's going to drop this database so
right now we are in this my DB database
so right now when we execute this
command it's going to say dropped my DB
so it's going it has dropped our
database and the result is successful so
now once again we can say show DBS
and then just execute it once again and
it says local because our my database or
my DB is already been deleted so this is
how you can create a database and delete
a database in MongoDB I hope you have
