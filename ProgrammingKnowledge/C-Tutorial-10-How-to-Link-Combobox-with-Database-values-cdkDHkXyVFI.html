last video I have shown you how to use
combo box with your c-sharp application
in this video I will show you how to
link this combo box with your database
for example you want to show the names
first of all I will show you my database
so I have a database and in that I have
this tables ok and for example I want to
show these names in the combo box how
can I fill the combo box with this
column data I will show you right now so
let's go to our application first this I
have shown you in the last video so I
will move it aside I have one combo box
whose name is combo box one so what I
will do is I will go to the code part of
this form here and above your code and
below just below your function or form
declaration and just above your event
functions you need to declare a function
I named it as void fill combo bracket
and bracket closed and in here so this
code you need to write keep in mind this
is not automatically generated by any
event so in here we will write our
so what we are going to do is if you are
watching my videos in the previous two
or three videos I have been showing some
code for connecting the database and how
to pass the query in them so just to
show you I have shown how to save the
out update and how to delete just go
click one of these buttons for example I
am clicking this and double click it and
this code I have shown you in previous
videos how to delete data just copy this
code as it is from string to end of the
catch block and we are going to paste it
in our function which is fill combo
feature is made by us okay so this will
remain the same the connection and all
the connection components we will just
change this query so in I will just
delete all the query and I will write a
new query so I will write it select star
from database dot table name
so my database name is database and
table name is e dot ah that's why I have
written this and then right
where you're no you don't need to write
this we're just right select star from
database dot e data okay and for now I
am deleting this message because I don't
need it and rest of the code remains
same this value which is empty I will go
inside it and I will declare a string
strength whose name is name s name so
string name is equal to I will copy my
this my reader my SQL data read the
component and paste it here dot not get
string this one bracket and bracket
closed okay and inside this get string
bracket I will pass the name of the
column which I want to show in the combo
box so I want to show this name in my
combo box all the list of names so I
will write in my code name by the way
MySQL is not a case sensitive data base
query language so you can write name or
in capital also so it's just the same
and then you will write your combo box
name so just select a combo box and copy
the combo box name and go to the code
and paste it here dot
items dot add and break it and break it
closed and in here you would pass your
name string variable yeah okay so just
write these two things what this code
will do is retake the name column from
the database and place it into this
string variable and then add it to the
combo box because it's a while loop so
it will take one by one names and it
will add to the combo box now I need to
call this method just copy this method
name like this and call this method in
here where your initialize component
method or function is called okay
so it's just in the public your form
name and yeah it's defined initialized
component just below that did you
paste your function name and just close
it so what it will do is whenever your
form starts running it will call this
method straight so you combo box is
filled automatically let's see how our
code looks like
and if it runs or not yeah user name and
password okay and it will open a new
form and in here when I see this I
should see all the names so let's see
yes I'm seeing all the names from the
database let's check it from the
database if all the names are correct so
it's just see here and see this
box John Mark Patrick Jill
Hudson and all the names are like the
same right so in this way you can fill
your fill your combo box with the
database so I hope you have enjoyed this
