last video I have shown you how you can
connect your PHP script to the MySQL
database using PHP myadmin right so we
were having this database called student
then we were able to connect to this
database in the last video now in this
video I am going to show you how you can
get the data so we had this student
database and we created a user info if
you remember and it has some data right
and I want to show all this data on the
browser or using PHP right so how can I
show this in this video I am going to
show you so let's get started
this is the connect dot PHP which I have
created in the last video and I am going
to use this connect dot PHP to connect
to the doctor base and then I will
create a new file and I will save it as
get data dot PHP and I will save it and
in here I will just include my PHP tags
and now first of all I need to connect
to the database in this file right so
what I am going to do is in this file I
have written the code to connect to the
database which is connect dot PHP so I
will just require this file so I will
use this keyword call require and the
name of my connect file which is
connect dot PHP right so this is this
file which I have written in the last
video ok once I have this file then what
I am going to do is I will write a query
to get the data from the database so I
will declare a variable called query is
equal to an inside this I am going to
write a query as a string now if you
know little bit of my SQL you already
know what a query is where E is a small
little string which you can send to your
database to query the data from the
database right for example I have this
table called the user info and I want
the data from the table for example this
data which I have saved earlier in the
database and I want to query this data
from the database base so what can I do
is if you don't know about the SQL
queries I will show you a simple way so
just select your table in which you have
saved your data and go to the structure
here we will go to this SQL tab here ok
so this is the tab you need to go once
you selected your table right and you
will see a query here which is a simple
query to get the data from the database
this is select star or asterisk from
your table name this is a simple query
so I am going to use the same simple
query to get the data from the database
in this video ok so I will just copy
this I will leave this where clause for
now I will just use this this query ok
just copy this query select Asterix from
your table name table name is user info
so this is
user info and I will just copy it here
okay
so this will be my query simple query
and then what I am going to do is I am
going to create a while loop while
because I want to read the data once I
execute this query right so what I am
going to do is first of all let's
execute the query first so I'm going to
give F condition and I want to check
whether if this query is executed or not
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a variable called is very
run for example you can give any
variable name is equal to and now I am
going to use a function in MySQL so
which fetches the data or which execute
the query so just write my SQL
underscore query okay this is the
function in PHP which you from which you
can execute your body and what it does
it returns boolean value so if the query
is executed it will return true and we
will go to the condition or statement
inside if conclusion otherwise if it's
not executed it will return false and we
will be able to catch the else condition
right now I am going to pass my query
which is this one to my MySQL query
function right now once this query is
executed
I can echo echo for now query executed
for example okay else I can and just
show
else I can just say very not executed
right so let's see if we are able to
execute our query or not and then we we
get the data from the database and show
it okay I save it and I will go to
localhost and to my folder and then
database and in here
this was the full file I have made right
get data and it says connection
successful source connection success
which comes from this file connect file
which says connection success for now I
am going to comment this out so I don't
need to see this connection success and
I will save it and I will refresh it and
now it says query executed so now I know
that my query is successfully executed
this query right now once the query is
sexy successfully executed what I want
is I want to get the data okay so that
this I can use by using while loop while
and why I'm using the while loop I will
show you because I want to fetch the
data from the database and it will be an
associative array okay so what function
we can use to get the data let's see so
I will declare a variable called query
on the soap and the score c-cute is
equal to this is a variable name right
and we will use my SQL underscore fetch
a source af-s Oh see which means
associative array right
and in this function MySQL fetch Assoc
we will pass our query run okay this one
this variable so just copy this and pass
it here and once we have our we will
execute this function it will return the
data in the form of associative array in
this valuable okay so what we can do is
we can just cut this from here and just
paste it inside as an argument of our
while loop so we have our associative
array here right in this variable okay
so now what I can do is I can get this
or I can call this associative array
variable to get the data so for example
I want to get all the names from this
user input table so I have this user
input table in my database and I have
the column like ID name surname age
username and password so I want to show
all the names from this database right
now only two names are there mark and
John in my browser right so what I can
do is I can simply echo and just use
this associative array and if you
followed my last video you know that we
can use the key of the associative array
to get data so key here is the column
name so I want to get the value of name
column here right this is my table and
there is a column called name and I want
to get the values okay so the key will
be the column name so I will write here
name okay and I will just save it
and once again I will go to my browser
and refresh it and now you can see two
names let me do a little bit better I
will just concatenate this in break okay
I'll just give a break tag so that you
can see okay
and let me give break here also after
call very executed okay in here save it
once again refresh it and now you can
see your names here right which are
there from in the database okay so we
have named mark and John in the database
and we are seeing those names from the
database in this web browser let's add a
new data in the database so what I'm
going to do I am going to go to the
structure not to the structure but
insert tag here I will go to the insert
tag and I will I will add some more data
so for example you name and surname and
age and user name and password okay and
I we click go and that I have saved I
can browse I can go to this browse tab I
can see there is a new data here right
now I can refresh it and you will be
able to see the third name here which is
added here right so you know that
whatever is in the database you are
getting it here now let's take a little
table
so if you know HTML you know how to make
a table right or otherwise if you don't
know how to make a table using HTML just
browse internet you will be able to find
many go to tutorial there ok so what I
am going to do is I'm going to take echo
and I'm going to take table tags to
create a table like structure for me
right so what I'm going to do I am going
to take for example first of all a tag
called TR TR is the table row tag right
if you remember and I will hand this TR
like this and inside this table row I am
going to insert some table data so just
give two brackets like this and TD and I
will just close this TD here TD right
and in a similar way I am going to just
take two more or whatever a number of
columns you have and in here I can just
insert this data okay so what I'm going
to do I will copy this and I will just
concatenate using concatenation I'll
just insert it here right this will give
us the name and then in a same way we
can concatenate here the surname for
example so just take the surname which
is the second column name here called
surname right so just try it surname
so for now I'm showing this this two
rows you can take all the rules like
this using this example and now I will
just move all the other PD for now so my
table structure looks like this I will
just comment this and let's see I can
get the names and surname in side the
table or not save it
let's refresh it showing some error
let's see what's the error
probably some concatenation error oh I
forgot the table tank without table tag
we cannot use TR and TD right I will
give table start here and at the end of
this row I will give table and ok so I
have this tag and I will just save it
and now let's try and run the program
and we see this here the name and
surname right according to this table
name is mark and surname is this John
and surname Julie and surname so you can
see here but still you don't see some
padding so we require this some padding
in the table so just give border for
example is equal to 1 and let's give
width here width or style for example
style is equal to in the prank its give
width : 300 px okay so let's save it run
it and now you can see the table and the
name and surname so you can play with
the HTML tags what I wanted to say is
you can play with HTML tags to create a
table like this right so in this video
you can get any data which is present in
your database in your PHP script and
show it like this right now that's it I
think for this video in the next or and
the couple of next video I'm going to
show you how to use this MySQL with PHP
more interactively so stay tuned and
please wait from and subscribe and five
