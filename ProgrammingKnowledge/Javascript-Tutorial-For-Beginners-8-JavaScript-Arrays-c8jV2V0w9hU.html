JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how to use arrays
in JavaScript now first of all what is
an array an array is a variable which is
capable of storing more than one value
okay so using array you can store
multiple value in our variable now let's
see how we can declare an array in
JavaScript so you use var to declare an
array as any other variable and then the
name of a variable for example we want
the collection of name or multiple names
in our variable and then you use the
square bracket to declare them and for
example I'm going to add some names here
something like this so this are a name
has four names inside it so it's storing
four different names right now to access
this array for example you want to
access the first element of this array
how you can do it so what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to just print this
value using document dot get element by
ID and I have this paragraph tag here
whose ID is demo which I'm calling here
dot inner HTML is equal to and for
example I want to print the whole array
so I can just call this like this okay
and save your code and refresh it and
you will see here all the names printed
on the webpage right so arrays has some
indexes and indexes is nothing but the
position at which the value is stored
and this value starts from zero in the
case of array so this position of the
first value is zero index because the
index start from zero so the index of
Tom is zero John is one and Bill is two
and Mark is three right so for example I
want to access
this name John so I can just right here
name and then in the square bracket one
and one is the index here okay and save
your code and refresh it it's printing
John now for example I want to access
this name Tom here the index of it is
zero okay and just save it and refresh
it and then it will give you Tom right
so indexes in array start from zero now
if you want to change some item at some
index what you can do here is you can
just call the name of your array and
then the index on which you want to
change so for example I want to change
this name Tom and I want to make this
name starting with capital T not with
small T so I will just use name zero and
then is equal to the new name right so
the new name is Tom with the capital T
right and let's just save your code and
now refresh it and now you can see the
name becomes Tom with capital T right
now using this method you can also add
some items to the array so right now I
have four items in my array and the
index of these items are zero one two
three so I can add at the fourth place
an item so I can just write four and in
here I can add a new item so something
like this and then I can print my array
something like this
save your code and refresh it and now my
array has five items in it now there is
one more way of pushing element in the
array so for example you want to add one
more item in the names so you can use
names dot push and then you can just add
another new name so for example some new
name something like this okay and then
save your code and refresh your webpage
and now you can see one more item is
to your array so you can use push or
using this index method to add to an
array now there are some method
associated with arrays which you can use
to use the arrays now for example I want
to know how many number of elements are
contained inside the array so I can use
a method called the length so just use
the name of the array which is names in
my case then use dot and then call
length method on it and then it will
give you the number of elements inside
the array right so save your code and
refresh it and it says six which is true
because these are four names and these
two names
we have pushed outside the array right
now there is one more method which you
can call on the array which is called
sort and this will sort all the element
in the array for example you have names
here so it will sort the names according
to the alphabetical order right so save
your code and refresh it and now you can
see these names are sorted in
alphabetical order so be first and then
J then M then T right now it's not
necessary that array must have the
elements of same data-type so for
example I want strings and integer in my
array it's totally valid so for example
I'm going to delete this name and
instead of this name I'm going to add
this integer 500 right and save my code
and refresh my webpage and it's going to
add this integer to the array and it's
no problem right now there is a
different way of declaring an array also
and which is something like this so var
name one for example is equal to new
array and then in the brackets you can
provide the
elements okay so for example I can just
copy this and paste it here and it's
totally valid okay and I'm going to
declare it above here and I'm going to
call this name one here and save it and
refresh my web web page and it's going
to give me the same result as we have
seen earlier okay now you can use some
more examples with arrays for example I
will delete this array declaration and
this also and I will use this name and I
will call a method called pop okay and
what this method does is it removes the
last element from the array okay so I
will just call this array here and save
my code and refresh it and you can see I
only have three elements in the array
fourth is removed okay
now if you want to remove the first
element from the array Uppal a method
called a shift here okay and it's going
to remove the first element from the
array so let's save it and refresh the
webpage and now you can see the first
element tom is removed and the second
third and fourth elements are here okay
now if you want to add some element to
the first place for example at index
zero you can use unshipped methods so
just write names dot on shift and then
you can add the value here for example
Ben and then save your code and refresh
the webpage and now you can see at the
0th index this name is added so in this
way you can use arrays in JavaScript I
