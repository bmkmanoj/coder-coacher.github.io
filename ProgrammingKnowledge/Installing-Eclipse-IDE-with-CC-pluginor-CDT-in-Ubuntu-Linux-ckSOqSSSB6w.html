video I will show you how to install
eclipse with CDT plug-in on your Ubuntu
operating system so ycdt plug-in is
important is because if you want to run
build and compile C and C++ program in
your Eclipse IDE you need to have this
plug-in installed which is called CDT so
I will show you only a single command to
install Eclipse with this CDT plug-in so
open your terminal and just write Swatow
apt - get installed Eclipse space
eclipse
- CDT space G + + so this is the command
you need to write on the terminal and
just press ENTER and it will ask you
whether you want to allocate the memory
so say yes and + Enter
and it may take few minutes to install
eclipse with this CDT plug-in depending
upon the speed of your computer
so you can see it's still installing and
the progress is about 99% now and 100%
and it's extracting the templates
once your installation is complete you
can go to here and click this - OH
and search for Eclipse and you can see
eclipses here you can drag this icon and
drop it here on your bar menu bar and
it's already here
just cancel and you can see eclipse is
installed on your open to operating
system let's see if it has CDT or C++
program support or not so open your
Eclipse
for the first time it may take some time
to open
I will ask you to use this default
workspace if you want this workspace
then click OK and now our Eclipse IDE
will open
so our Eclipse IDE is open now let us
try to make a new C++ project so I go to
the file new project and you can see
here you can choose a C and C++ project
from here without seat the CDT plug-in
this option will not be available to you
and click C++ project and click Next
and you can give the name to your
project test in my case I will choose
the hello world project next and give
the author name I do not want to give it
I don't want release I just want debug
next and press finish
and it's taking some time to create the
project say yes
and now your first C++ program on
Eclipse IDE is ready to be build and run
so in this way you can install eclipse
on your Ubuntu operating system with CDT
plug-in I hope you have enjoyed this
