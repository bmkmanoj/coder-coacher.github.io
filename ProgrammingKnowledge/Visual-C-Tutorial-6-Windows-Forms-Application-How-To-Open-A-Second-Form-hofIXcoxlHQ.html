last video we have seen how to make a
login page in your visual C++ windows
form application with MySQL database so
we have seen that if you enter your
username and password and click this
login button it shows whether your
password and username is correct or not
now we will see how to open a new form
when you logged in so for example when
you click this login pay button this
page form must disappear and it must
open a new form in which you can show
some other data so if your user has
provided correct username and password
it will open a new form for you so let's
see how we can do it so go to your
project and go to your solution Explorer
and in here click on your project and
right click it and go to add new item
and it will create or display you've
list of new items so these are the new
items which you can make so we are
interested in making new windows forms
you just click this and give the name of
this form so I will name it as form
and I will click Add and it will create
a new form for me yes so it has created
a new form for me and here also a new
form is created for me now just
go to your first forum and go to its
source code of first forum and go at the
top and in here you have to include your
second from in your first forum so just
sorry
so in your first forum here you must
write this include STD a FX dot H and
once again you have to write include
double quotes double quotes and in this
double quote right form 2 dot H okay so
this form 2 dot H we have included in
our form 1 dot H so it can be exist and
let's check our program if we are
correct
till now yes we are kicked in yo and now
go to your first form in which we have
made our login button and click double
click it and in the last video we have
seen that if my password is correct it
will show me a message that username and
password is correct so this time I want
to open my pass my second form when my
password and username is correct so go
to this if count is equal to 1 statement
which I have shown you in the last video
and press ENTER and in here write this
this
and wide arrow pointer and right hide so
what it will do is it will hide this
form and in the next line right here
right form to this name so name of the
form
horrible to you and provide this gap
symbol and then write a variable for
your form too so I will write two four
four two variable is equal to GC new and
just copy this form to once again and
paste it here and just close the bracket
so write this line and now we have this
variable so copy this and paste it here
and right arrow and then right
show dialog and bracket close so what it
will do is it will hide this form from
this code and it will open a new form
filled with this code okay so when you
are username and password is correct it
will open your new form and hide your
previous form but one thing you need to
know that when it goes to the next form
and when you close ok I will tell you
when the problem comes so right now we
will just run this program so run it and
press ES and my form is running I will
provide a correct username and password
and I will press login and it says
username and password is correct and
when I press ok my old form is gone and
my new form is appeared so in this way
you can open your new form with the code
and when you click this close you will
observe that your program is still in
debug mode and it's not return to its
original condition so just go to debug
and press stop debugging
and it will come to the original
position so to avoid this condition -
you can go to this form - dot H and take
a button here and name this button as go
to the properties and in the text you
can name the button else exit this is
what exit and just double click it and
in here you can write application and
then these points and right exit and
bracket and bracket choose so this when
you press the exit button this cup code
is executed and you will exit gracefully
from the program so once again we will
run our program build it and run it and
I provide the username and password
login my username and password is
correct so it will open the second form
and it will hide this form okay and when
you click this exit button you see it
will no more hang in the debug mode it
will come
to your or it will exit from the
debugging and run mode so in this way
you can gracefully exit from your
program so I hope you have enjoyed this
