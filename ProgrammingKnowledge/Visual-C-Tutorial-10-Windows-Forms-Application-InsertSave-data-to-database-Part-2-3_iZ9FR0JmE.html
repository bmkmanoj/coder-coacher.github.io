this semicolon this semicolon we are
using to close our query so query looks
like this insert into database dot e
data and the for field which we want to
save and then write values and make a
bracket and corresponding to each field
we will enter the values here so what I
will do is I will go to my form once
again and this is the force field E I D
so I will just select this text field
and I will copy the name of this text
field so I have given the name a I D
text copy and once again go to your
source and paste it here and before this
Eid I will write this and then this
arrow sign and after this arrow and
write text
and I will cover this with single quote
double quote Plus and on the other side
also plus double quote again single
quote okay value 1 this is our value for
employee ID 1 the same I will do it for
names or lemonade so I will just copy
this in order to save time and I will
paste it three more times
one thumb
and I will just replace this Eid text
name with the other field so I mean to
select this and just copy the name of
this name text field and I will copy
this name and then I will place it to
the next position
viii name text once again third field
name last name and copy the name once
again and go to the code to a third feed
surname and into a force field Age text
so once again one last thing
select this text field copy its name and
paste it on the last page
so are called query is insert into
database dot e data and in the bracket
are for field which I have taken from
this whole field e ID name surname and
age here also the ID name sir
name so this is like this and age and
then values
and
in the single quote double quote plus
this arrow point your text field named
arrow pointer text this is for a
employee ID name last name and age have
done and then this was from the previous
code so let's see our code votes or not
everything else will be the same if some
error comes this try-catch block will
take care of the error so let's try and
run the program go to this Run button
yes and says something is missing so
let's see what is missing
okay so if I see my god it says this is
undeclared this this one here this
should be small t this so I will make
changes small T this also into
and this so in a all our whole field I
have done the same this this this this
and now let's try to run the program so
what was the mistake this this instead
of small T I have taken capital T so I
have corrected it now let's try and run
the program yes it once so for example
long endure the right username and
password click OK it goes to the second
field and then it asked me to enter some
data so I will pass some data in our
database I can see that eight fields are
already there so I will enter ninth data
here employee ID nine and some name and
age so nine employ eighty nine name is
that right last name is tu age is 43 and
then I will press the Save button same
and I think the data is saved it's not
showing me the data is saved but I think
it's saved so I will go to my database
to check yeah it's not showing any data
but when I press this refresh button
refresh yes you can see the dotted save
9 metric key lam 43 okay so our code is
working you are successfully able to
insert data from your form to your mysql
database one more thing you can do into
your code is show a message when your
query is executed so when this is
inserted just copy this message field
from your catch block and paste add the
here in between this while loop and then
write double quote and we can write
saved
you know this message box shows saved
should come above the oh boy loop so
after your try block when this
connection is opening and this is
executing your query after the execution
of query you should show the message
that yours
data is saved and this while loop is
blank so let's see if our code is
working run yes username password is
correct and I'm entering some new data
deploy number 10 nights a just 56 and I
will press save and it shows me the
message box that asked that is saved so
I will press ok and now we see into the
database if the database is ready
refreshed so just press this refresh
button and yes your doctor is saved here
you can see so in this way you can
insert data into your database with the
help of visual c++ windows form
application I hope you have enjoyed this
