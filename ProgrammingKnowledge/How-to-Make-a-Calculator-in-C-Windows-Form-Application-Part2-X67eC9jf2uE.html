and base there okay so whenever I press
any button for this plus minus or
multiplication division this will or we
also are going to catch the button
action and we will just take this like
this here and we want to store this
button operation in some variable so we
could at the top of our class and we
will declare to two variables one will
be the double and which will contain our
result value so it will be double and I
will say this will be our result value
and I will initialize it with zero and
second will be the string which will
contain our operation
so operate or operation perform so
reiation performed and by default i will
initialize it as lang
okay and we are going to need one more
variable which we will we will see later
but yeah now once we have this operator
performed operation performs variable we
can just take this operation perform
variable and we can say this operation
perform is button dot txt right so copy
this button is equal to button dot txt
okay
now I also want to pass the value from
my textbox to this value variable so I
will just say value is equal to and to
come
but my textbox value to the double value
because this result value is a double I
will write double dot bars and now I
will pass the text in the textbox with
whatever text is in the textbox I will
convert it into the value right now
whenever I click so we'll just let's
write the code for these two clear entry
and clear button so double click this
clear entry button and this will just
clear our entry so just we can write
textbox dot result dot text is equal to
0 right and clear what this will do this
will perform the same action plus it
will make our result value is equal to 0
is equal to 0 okay so we have done that
now what action is remaining this equal
to action so in here
thus double click this equal to action
or go to just select this equal to
button and go to events and in the
button click event just double click
this button click event and we reach to
the button take event of the of this
button equal to and you can just use
switch cases switch cases depending upon
the value in the operation or this one
operation perform variable okay so first
of all the case can be case for not here
but case for the addition
and this can be so what we want to do we
want to just in our text result we want
to pass the results right so we will
just write text result is equal to is
equal to value plus because we are
performing addition that's why I am
using plus here right and whatever in
the text box so whatever I have written
here dot double dot pass double because
we want to pass the value and then make
the addition of those two and then
convert it to text so just surround it
by bracket and just convert it to text
so this is our double value let's see so
this value will be result value instead
of value and then we convert it to the
tank to the string and we have the scale
okay so this is the case one and we need
to provide break and in the same way we
can provide the condition for the
subtraction multiplication division and
we can provide the condition for default
operation default and break okay so in
this we will subtract just write
subtract and perform subtraction here
here we will perform multiplication and
here also and here we perform division
and here also okay so now we have all
these things
we need one more value that whenever we
perform some operation or whenever we
click this button or we need to have
some variable to store that it's
performed or not so if I click this
addition button I want to know if this
button is clicked or not or what is the
status of this button so what I'm going
to do is in here in my code I will say
bull is operation performed and by
default its value will be false okay
and after every click of this operator
plus minus multiplication or division I
want to make this value as true so I
will go to the operator click event and
after this or let's make it at last I
want to make this as true okay and after
every number click event I want to make
it as false
so I after every number click for
example seven eight nine or zero point I
want to make it as false here and the
button click event make it false
okay now we have this label in which we
want to show some text right then
whatever operation is happening so now I
will clear the text of this label left
and we give null no text to the label
and
the name of this label is label one I
will change it to label what can be
changed
operation current operation for example
label current operation okay and this
cable current operation just copy this
name and whenever I click any operator
here I want to have this in this text
box right so on the button click event
or of this operators what I want to do
here just in the operator click event
you just need to make the well take the
value of the label label current
operation dot text is equal to the value
you have result value plus plus in the
concatenation operator in this case and
then we will provide a little space and
then we will give the value performed or
operation performed this string which we
have declared here right so here will
come this string okay so let's see what
happens now when we run the program so
two plus it shows here right three so
now the addition is not happening you
can see here because here we are not
clearing this right on the one this
click event so what we can do here go at
the top and whenever we click any number
the button we can add this text of
result dot text
equal to zero condition in addition we
can add one more condition so just add
one more condition if this is true or
our operation performs or we have some
operation perform okay so now when we
run the program we can see 22 plus 53 is
equal to 55 66 or when we need to clear
it first and for example 66 plus 55 okay
so it's giving us the normal results but
still we need to do some more things for
example let's multiply it by two that's
happening so first of all it's too dark
and when we perform some operation here
you see it's little bit light so I will
change the font size of this label or
font color of this label select this
label and go to the fourth color and
change I will change it to little bit
button shadow or little bit brash
control down okay and what I need to do
here again I will run the program and
let's see what I need to do so when I
click this 2.3 right I can see the
result like this once again I will run
the program so to point you see here
you cannot limit your points right now
okay so you can have as many number of
points like this whenever I click it
click this so I need to take care of
this also so I go to my button click
event and in here I have this button
button text in here but I will provide a
special case for this point text so if
this text in the text field is this
point or decimal is equal to decimal
this one and let me provide this basis
else I will perform this okay and in
hand the if condition what I need to
check is if this text already contains
so this text result already contains dot
contains this point or not so I will
just copy this and paste it here and if
it contains if it doesn't contain then I
will just make opposite of this so if
this text doesn't contain this point
already
then only I need to provide this text
otherwise I do not need to provide this
and once again when I run the program
and when I click to point point point
point still it's doing it let's see why
okay so this if condition I need to take
the text from the button not from the
text box so like this and now let's see
hopefully we'll work point point point
nothing happens right so we take care of
this point also now let's try to run the
program so for example 78 x 3 gives us
the result
are we clear the text 33 3 33 point
three three x 6 gives us a correct
result or twelve point eight nine eight
plus five five five two five gives us
the result for example I divide
something by zero so clear nine divided
by zero which will give infinity okay it
gives so basically our operation is
working but I want to make it a little
bit more interactive in order to for
example I click here 3 plus 3 plus 3
plus 3 it's not showing the addition
here right 3 plus 3 should show people 3
is equal to 6 then plus 6 is equal to 9
here plus 9 right so it should show the
addition of these so how can I achieve
this so once again I will go to this
operation click event and in here when
when I have this button captured or
button text what I can check here is if
my value which is this one result value
is equal to 0
or is not equal to 0.so is not equal to
zero in this case I want to perform the
same operation I'm performing in my
equal to operation so I want to perform
the same operation as this button
because this will replicate the
functionality of this addition or
multiplication whenever I add this right
so just go there copy the name of your
equal to button which is button 15 in my
case so button 15 dot perform click
perform click so this action will
perform the click event of this equal to
button and this action will be taken
right and once you once this is done
basically you want to do the same just
copy all the operations and paste just
below this but I just want to remove
this value is equal to double pass so
operation perform is equal to button dot
text and this label will be will be
modified with the result and the
operation performed and this will become
true else I want to perform the normal
operation okay so now let's try to run
the program so 3 plus 6 you see here
comes 6 and when I click plus it's a is
9 plus 4 and when I say - it's a it
converts it to 7 plus
mine for example class so it's showing
the result to us right key + 2 op 32 +
36 + still it's not showing the correct
result because this is not changing
right so when I click + + + it's only
adding 3 to it so to correct this I will
go to my equal to button click event so
just select your equal to button go to
button click event of equal to and I
will make this value is equal to
whatever is the value in the text box so
this copy this result value and go
outside your switch condition equal to
double because we want to convert from
doubles to force so string to double we
want to convert so whatever is in the
text box result of each transfer it to
the to my result and I will just make
whatever text is inside my label I want
to make it as blank or clear this text
so just make it is equal to blank equal
to blank ok so just add these two things
now I will run the program and let's see
if it's working or not
98 + 6 98 + 6 is 1 0 4 so 1 0 4 should
come here and the result also should
come here + okay right now I will say +
6 so result is
result is 1 0 10 - so 1 0 10 - for
example hundred ok and I will once again
I want to multiply whatever there is a
result which is 10 multiplied by 6 for
example and I will say equal to 60 so
now our calculator is working like we
have expected there are still more
functionality - you can add to a
calculator like square root or some
other mathematical operations but this
is how you can make a simple calculator
this can be your starting point to make
a calculator and you can play with this
calculator you can add more
functionalities like key plus events
right now it's just listening for these
events but you can add key press events
and other events also and make it more
advanced so I leave it on you how you
can use this calculator and make it
advanced and I hope you have enjoyed
