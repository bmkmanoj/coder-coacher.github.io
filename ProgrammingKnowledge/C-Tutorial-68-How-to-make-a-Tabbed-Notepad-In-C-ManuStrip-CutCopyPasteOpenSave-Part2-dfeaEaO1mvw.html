open a different
x-file so I will just click Open Text
and let me see if I yeah I have second
file txt file so I will just double

file here this is different and this is
different okay so in this way you could
be able to open the new text file in
these text or tabs now the code for
saving the file so just double click
this same button or menu item and in
here I will write the code for saving
the text file so if you are following
this video in the last video itself I
have shown you how to save a text file
using a button so in the video I will
just refresh this page and in the last
video which is video number 66 how to
save file using save file dialog in that
video I have shown you how to save file
using a button so I will just copy the
same code in this save button click item
click yeah so here in saved will strip
menu item click I will just paste the
code from the last video in here I have
just changed this get rich text box so
here we generally pass the rich text box
name and right now I'm just passing the
function which I have declared here this
rich text box function which we have
written earlier
okay so just pass it here like this
so this is the code for saving the file
okay so now we will check we will open a
new document in here I will open a new
text file this text file for example and
now I want to save this file so I will
just click this save and it will open
the save dialog and I want to name it
something
bla bla bla dot txt file and I will save
it so when I check on my desktop this
file is already saved okay so this file
is saved so you have made the program to
open open a new tab open a text file in
this tab and save a file in this tab now
I will show you how to use this tool
strip in this notepad application so
just drag and drop our tool strip here
cannot ok so just I need to so I just
need to undock this this one and sorry I
just select this and I will just so I
just selected it and I have just
unlocked this so doc go to doc and press
this none okay and once again here I
have dragged and dropped tool strip so
once again I will remove this tool strip
I will go to my tool box and drag and
drop
to strip here and once again select this
tool or tab control and once again I
will just dock this swords go to doc and
doc to the middle so now I have this
tool strip also just tab also and this
menu strip also and in here I will add
the search or highlight the text so I
will add a button which I will just
right click it and I will set our image
so I will just import image which I have
already downloaded and I will just click
click the search image and click OK so
it will give me a search image button
and I will also add text box and in here
I will add the text which I want to
search in the document so this text box
you can just increase the size of this
text box by go selecting that text box
and go to the size and I will just enter
here 150 instead of 100 and now when I
see here my text box length is increased
Oh
which is increased whatever you say now
I will write the code for searching and
highlighting the word in the text file
so I will just double click this button
and if you are following this videos in
the video number let me see
video number 26 I have shown you how to
search words in the rich text box and
highlight
them so I will just copy the same code
from there and I will paste in this in
this search button double click event
here okay
so this code is from video number 26
if you don't know so this is the code
which I have shown you in the video
number 26 and this is showing error
because instead of this rich text box I
need to enter this get rich text box
function which I have made earlier so
instead of this I paste this rich text
box everywhere I just replace this rich
text box by this rich get rich text box
function and here also and instead of
this text box in which we will write the
search word I will just select this text
box and I will just copy the name of
this text box which is tool strip text
box and instead of this text simple text
box I will just paste it this text box
okay so this is the code from the video
number 26 if you don't know this code
and now I will once again run the core
and I will just open a file text file
here what is the problem okay so I
haven't opened a new tab for that so
once again I will run the code I will go
here I will just first of all I will add
a new document by pressing new
it's not showing because it has hidden
in this tool strip so I will just select
this text box and I will just go to doc
once again and in here I will select
this one okay
so it talks like this and I will just
drag and place it like this now when I
run the program and I will just open new
document it shows me the new tab now now
I will open a new document so I will
click on file open and new text it shows
me a new text and you can just anchor it
and when I press any item for example I
want to search for this word da th e da
so I will write da in this text box and
I will just press this search button and
you see all the word which are th e are
highlighted in this text box so you can
search for and search and highlight
