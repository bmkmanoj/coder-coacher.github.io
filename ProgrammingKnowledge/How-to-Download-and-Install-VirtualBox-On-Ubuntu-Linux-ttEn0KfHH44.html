show you how you can install latest
version of VirtualBox or nobody - now if
you want to install older version of
Ubuntu you can install it from open to
Software Center
so I'm going to show you first how you
can install the old older version of
Ubuntu if you want from this open to
Software Center you just need to go to
this open Software Center and just write
VirtualBox here and you will be able to
see the spiritual box option and when
you go to more info here you can see the
version here the version available on
Ubuntu Software Center is 4.1.1 - which
is not the latest version so if you want
to install this old version you can just
click this install button and it will be
installed in your system but I'm going
to show you how you can install the
latest version of open VirtualBox on
your open to operating system so what
you need to do is just open your search
option and just write VirtualBox and we
are going to download VirtualBox from
its website so the first option here you
will see here is www.virtualbox.org II
just click this link and just go to the
downloads now in order to download
VirtualBox you need to know the
operating system bits so let's see how
you can find if your operating system is
the 32-bit system or a 64-bit system you
just go to this small icon here and just
go to system settings
and system settings will be open and
just go to details here and you can see
my OS type is 64-bit but if you have the
32-bit you need to install some other
file which I will also show and you can
see I have open two 12.04 LTS so just
remember this will do version also now I
will go to this download page and I will
go to this VirtualBox four point three
point one two for Linux host just click
it and see my version open two 12.04 LTS
and this i386 for is for 32-bit and AMD
64 is for 64-bit so I'm going to choose
this but if your operating system is of
32-bit
just choose this so I will just click
this option and this will be downloaded
in my system so I will save this file
and this will down this download will
complete in some seconds now for using
some utilities of VirtualBox you need to
install this extension pack also so just
go to return to this VirtualBox four
point three point one page download page
and just see here you need to install
VirtualBox four point three point one
two Oracle Virtual VM VirtualBox
extension pack from here so just see
this
yeah and just click all supported
platform just click this
here and you need to install a download
virtualbox extension pack also so just
click ok and now we have both the files
open to installation file and open to
extension pack now I will go to the
folder where I have downloaded these two
files so you can see here this is the
extension file and this is the
installation so because this is Debian
file dot DB file I can just right click
it and open it with Ubuntu Software
Center ok I'll just double click it
simply and it will open this file in
your open to Software Center and what
you need to do is you just need to click
this install button here and that's it
what your box will be installed you just
need to give your password once and just
wait for this to complete but for
installing the extensions and other
configurations you need to install one
more thing which I'm going to show you
after this completes so in some moments
hopefully it completed
let's wait for it
virtualbox 4.3 is now installed and now
what you need to do is just click this
all software button once again in here
you in order to configure your
VirtualBox you need to add this to your
open to operating system which is genome
system
tools okay so just write genome system
tools and if you have this installed
then it's okay but if it's not installed
here you will be able to see install
button right now I have already
installed this genome system tools so I
have this remove button but if you have
this not installed then you will be able
to see this install button you just need
to click this install button here and
this genome system tools will be
installed and now you will be able to
configure your system with these
extensions so now go to the second file
which is Oracle VMware virtual box
extension pack just right-click it and
just click open with other application
so I will click this open with other
application and by default it will
recognize Oracle VM VirtualBox so just
select it and this will turn into green
now and it will open this VirtualBox
window here we just need to click this
install and you just need to read the
document here and if you agree with the
license condition just click I agree and
give you a password
and this installation of extension pack
will be successful I hope oh yes this is
successful Oracle VMware extension pack
was installed okay now you are ready to
install any virtual machine on your open
to operating system let's go to new and
just select your operating system which
you want to install if you have its
installation or ISO file and enjoy a
virtual machine one more little thing I
want to tell you that if you want to add
this VirtualBox to this bar here just go
to dash home and search for virtual box
and drag and drop in to your this bar
left bar here and then you believe you
will be able to see this icon here so
