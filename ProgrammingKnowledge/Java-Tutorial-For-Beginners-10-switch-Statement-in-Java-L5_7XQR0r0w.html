tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last few videos we have
been seeing how we can use if statement
which are condition based statement in
Java now in this video we will see other
kind of conditional statement that are
called switch statement in Java so
whenever you have to make multiple you
know condition checking then you can use
switch statement you can use switch
statement in place of if-else statement
also but generally we use a switch
statement where you have multiple
expression to check so let's take an
example for example I have a data type
called store a score which is integer
and whose value is 90 so let's consider
this is the score of some student so in
Java
let's first see how we can you know
write switch statement it's simple you
just need to write a keyword called
switch and then comes the round bracket
which evaluates the expression and then
in curly braces you write some condition
so here comes your expression and this
expression can be following so for
example this expression can be a byte or
can be a short value or integer or
character value right so our value is
integer so we can write or evaluate this
score value and on the basis of the
score value we can define some cases
inside our switch condition for example
case 90 and then comes this colon and
then you can execute your code so we
want to print for example system dot out
dot print line and in here we will print
for example very good this is on the
basis of score so if the students goes
90 we will print the message very good
and after this message will print we
just want to break out of this switch
statement so just write break not this
one but this one and this semicolon so
in this way you can define multiple
conditions in side your switch statement
once again I copied and pasted it same
statement but I can define some other
condition for example if it's 60 or if
it's 40 then I will say the score is
good and if it's 40 the score is okay
and so based on the score we are
evaluating the score inside this switch
statement and if the score is 90 we will
print this one and we will break out of
this switch statement so what this break
does is it breaks out of the switch
statement we will see when we run the
example and if this condition or this
condition where K score is 90 or 60 or
40 all these conditions are not met then
we will start the finest default
condition which will catch all the other
options other than the defined condition
and this is done by the keyword default
okay and in this default we can define
that for example this condition is not
defined or the grade is not defined for
example we can write the grades are not
defined something like this okay and
then we can break out of the loop or not
the loop but a statement break okay so
let's run the program and let's see what
will be the output I will just compile
the program and run it it prints very
good because we have defined integer
whose values 90 and this variable we are
evaluating with our switch statement and
then your program or switch statement
evaluates whether the case so case
becomes if the score is 90 then it will
execute this code whatever you write
after this : and before this bit break
keyword all the code with whatever you
write inside this will be executed okay
and whenever this break is called it
goes directly out of this switch
statement so this condition or this case
is not checked and this case is not
checked in this case is also not ghent
so your switch statement waits for the
condition to be true for example we just
write 60 which is this case and run the
program it prints good right or we
define some weird condition for example
33 which is not defined in either of
these cases then the message is the
grades are not defined so your
this code will be implemented so this is
like an F condition in switch statement
not else not if but the else condition
in if statement right so whenever these
conditions are not met then the default
condition is called right now there are
other ways of writing switch statement
or there are some properties of switch
statement for example you can define
case without the break statement like
this so if you define case where score
is equal to hundred and you don't give
here break keyword see let's see what
happens and in this case we will define
score is equal to hundred and we will
run the program and it says very good
and why this is happening is whenever
you define something or some case
without a break it goes to the evaluate
the case it sees that score is equal to
hundred 100 which is okay and
immediately it goes to the next case
where case is equal to odd scored is
equal to 90 and it prints the next case
statement which is this one and then
immediately it sees that break is called
and then it breaks out of the switch
statement so whenever you want to
evaluate multiple condition and you want
to print or you want to execute the same
code you can define multiple conditions
like this without a break keyword for
example 95 and you define 95 here also
then it will print very good okay so
it's evaluating 3 condition at a time
and if the score is 100 or 95 or
90 this statement will be true okay in
the same way you can define different
case here also for example if score is
80 for example or 60 and less defined
score is equal to 80 then it will print
grow good okay so you can check multiple
conditions without you know adding the
switch or without adding the break
keyword to any case so in this way you
can evaluate conditions using switch
statement I hope you have enjoyed this
