will show you how to link a second form
with your first form so suppose you want
to open a second form using your first
form by clicking a button for example
how can you achieve this using Visual
Basic I will show you today so let's get
started first of all I will create a
second form right now I only have one
form which is form 1 and 2 may create a
second form I will go to my project so
this is my project
I will right-click my project and I will
say add new item and it will open a file
dialog and then from here I can choose
my windows form application so go to
windows form and choose windows form
here and you can change the name of your
form also and I will leave it as default
but you can change the form name right
now its form 2 and add so once you click
add button a new form is added to your
project so now let's add some kind of a
label to your form and let's change the
text of the form as second form and
let's change the font size also so we
can see that it's a second form so I
will give it bold and let's say it's 26
ok so this is our second form now how
can we open this form using our first
form so I will go to the first form
and I will take a button this is a
really simple way to open a second form
from first form and what I need to do is
I will I have to just click this button
double click it and I have to say form 2
dot show and give these brackets and
that's it now when you run your program
and when you click this button it will
open the second form for you ok so it's
that much easy to connect to form using
Visual Basic I hope you have enjoyed
