video I will show you how to create a
new control for example I want to create
a button by pressing a button so what
does I mean by that for example I have a
button called create new button and when
I press this create new button a new
button is created in this way you can
create any control which is present in
the toolbar or at least more most of the
controls so this is just a simple
example how to create a button control
by using a button so let's see how did I
do that so first of all I have taken a
button from my tool box and I have named
it or changed its text as create new
button and then I select this button and
double click it and I write this code
button cap your variable button is equal
to GC new button and then we will set
the parent controller of the button in
this case we are having this mean so we
will right button arrow point of parent
is equal to this and then we will set
the location of this button so right
button arrow point the location is equal
to system WLAN drawing double colon
point
and provide the points or location of
the button where you want to produce
your button so for example if you go to
your forum and you select any button so
I am selecting this button and when you
go to the properties you see the
location of this but its location is 285
by 247 right now so if you want to
create a button somewhere you can take
help of this putnis selves for example
you want to create a button here so just
drag and drop your button here and now
go to the properties and see the
location right now location is 91 by to
0-7 so note that location 91 by to 0-7
and place this button to its original
position once again and I will go to my
code once again and I think I have 91 by
to 0-7 so I just copied the location and
pasted my location here and now in the
same way I will set the size so button
arrow pointer
size is equal to system double colon
drawing double colon size and right now
I have given 118 by 32 I will change it
this also I can take a reference from
this button for example I want to create
a same
height and width button so I will just
select it and I will see its size
right now it's 118 by 32 I will just
make it bigger so it will change and now
it's 118 by 59 so I will right there the
size of my button 118 by 59 for example
and then you set the name of your button
so
here this is the name of your button
so for this button I have the name but
Newton in the same way I'm naming my
button as new button as button
underscore one and what text you want to
represent on your button or what caption
you want to represent you will write
here so right name arrow pointer is
equal to L and in double quote write the
name and in the next line write button
arrow pointer text is equal to L double
colon new button
okay so just you need to write this and
now when I run the program
and when I press this create new button
it will create a same sized button and
the location is the same where we
desired it to appear so in this way you
can create any control which you want to
desire you can also take a reference
from the code here so whenever you take
any tool from in your frame check box
button or anything it will create a
default code here so it will by default
creates its size its name and many
attributes color also and so you can
take a reference from here also this
code and create a new component or
control with the help of a button doors
and in other event so I hope you have
