video number 42 to video number 48 I
have shown you how to create a PDF file
and how to insert lines lists or images
or charts or tables inside that PDF with
the help of your ITEX shop DL in this
video I will show you how to read the
PDF file and show it in the form of
string inside a text box or rich text
box so in this video I will show you how
to pass your PDF file into a string and
show it into the text box or rich text
box with the help of of course I
TechShop DL so if you don't know how to
include the I text shop
DLL in your project then you need to see
the video number 42 I think in which I
have shown you how to create a PDF with
the help of I pick shop because you need
that DLL file in your resources and then
you could be able to read and the file
so now what I will do is I will take a
rich text box in which I will show the
converted PDF to string text and I will
take a button and I will change its text
as read PDF
okay this is a text box and this is the
button to read the PDF and the name of
this rich text box I will leave as
default and now let's start coding so
just click this read PDF and double
click it and you will reach to the
button next action perform of this
button click event
first of all go at the top because we
need to import a namespace and in here
we will import a namespace or write
using I text shop dot text dot
PDF dot parcel
okay so just import this file in order
to pass your PDF and once again I will
go to the code and double click this
button once again and in here first of
all I will write the code for choosing
the PDF file from your PC already from
your computer so so write this code for
choosing the file so write Open File
dialog this will open the file dialog
this code hole code so pry it open file
dialog dialog is equal to new Open File
dialog bracket and bracket closed and we
will declare a string variable in which
we will copy the path of the file and so
I have declared string file path and
semicolon and then I copy that open file
dialog variable pasted here dot filter
is equal to double quotes PDF files in
the bracket star dot PDF bracket closed
and this or symbol star dot PDF then
once again this or symbol all files in
the bracket star dot star or star dot
star so this is the filter for your open
file dialog and it will just show the
PDF file initially or if you select all
files then it will show all files okay
so this is the filter for only choosing
the PDF or only showing the PDF files
and then just give a condition if your
dialog variable dialog dot
show dialog bracket is equal to dialogue
dialogue Brazil dot okay then in the
bracket right final path which is this
variable is equal to dialogue this
variable dot filename to string so this
will copy your selected PDF file path
into this string variable so this is
only to select the path of your PDF file
and transfer it into your string now we
will write the code for passing the PDF
okay so first of all here after your if
condition is complete below that I will
write a try-catch block first so this
will catch any exception if exist in the
code so write this try catch block it's
simple try and bracket open close catch
exception e X and then match message dot
show X dot message so write this and
then yeah on the top of your try block
declare a string variable which is this
string string text is equal to string
dot and empty so this is a string
variable in which I will contain my
string which is which I have passed from
the PDF file so declare this above your
text file and now I will go in the text
try block and then here I will write
this code so in the try block I have
written PDF reader and I have given
of variable name to PDF reader is equal
to new PDF reader bracket and bracket
closed and in here in the bracket I will
pass a path of the file so in the Open
File dialog code here I have declared a
string variable which is this file path
which contains the path of the PDF file
I will copy just that variable and I
will pass into this PDF reader and it's
showing me some error this error is
because it's a local variable and this
is not recognizing this string variable
inside this try-catch block so what I
will do is I will just go here if
condition and I will just cut this
bracket for the if condition so what I
have done is I have just copy and cut
this if condition and I will go below
this catch block code and I will paste
this here okay just go below your catch
block brackets and just paste below here
so now it will take it as a local
variable which will which it will
recognize okay so write PDF reader
reader is equal to new PDF reader in the
bracket pass the path of the file and
then write a for loop here to here and
in that we will declare int page is
equal to 1 semicolon paid is less than
equal to reader which is this PDF reader
dot number of pages semicolon page plus
plus
and then right I text extraction
strategy IT s is equal to new I text
sharp dot text dot PDF dot Parsa dot
location text extraction strategy ok and
then I will declare a string s is equal
to PDF text extractor dot get text like
texts from page and in the bracket pass
this reader variable comma this page
variable and comma this I text strike
extraction strategy variable here okay
in the next line just copy this string s
paste it here is equal to n coding dot
utf-8 dot get string and in the bracket
ASCII encoding dot convert and then in
the bracket we will pass some argument
which are encoding dot default comma
encoding dot utf-8 comma encoding dot
default dot get bytes and in the bracket
just passed this s string variable and
just close all the brackets so write
this and this here
and in the next line right string text
which is this variable in which we will
contain our past thing string is equal
to string text plus S which is this
string variable and now just copy the
name of your rich text box which is this
rich text box name dot text is equal to
string text STR text this one okay I'm
like it closed and after your fall loop
is complete just write reader dot close
okay and this is all the code for
passing the PDF file into your rich text
box so if you want you can just copy
this code this is the try catch block
code and this is all in the if condition
right if our file is PDF then it will
execute this code
and if you don't see this line now you
can copy this line also now I will try
to run the program
and I will give username and password
and now when I click this read PDF
button it will open the file dialog and
see here it shows the filter which
chooses only PDF files right so I will
go and choose any PDF file for example
this file and I will select it and if
you see all the data from the PDF file
is copied into my rich text area it will
not pass your images if we just pass
your text only so if you are expecting
much from this I TechShop parcel then it
will not be useful to expect more things
from this I text parser but of course it
will pass your PDF text and convert it
into string and show it into the rich
text box okay so this is all the PDF
contain which content which it has shown
in the rich text box so in this way you
can parse your PDF file in the form of
string and show it into the rich text
box I hope you have enjoyed this video
