video I am starting a new video series
on Java EE or Java Enterprise Edition so
by using Java Enterprise Edition we can
make a web application on Java and you
can literally make any web application
on internet you can think of with the
help of this Java Enterprise Edition so
for more information you can always go
on Wikipedia and read about Java
Enterprise Edition and so all the basic
information you can gather from here and
I will start this video series from Java
server spaces or JSF so JSF is a new
technology related to Java server pages
and this is used for building component
base user interfaces as you can see here
and so we will start learning this JSF
first and then maybe in the later in the
series we will also learn other
technologies related to Java EE because
Java EE is a very broad technology and
it requires time to explain everything
and I'm also not an expert but I'm also
new to this technology but gradually and
slowly I will show you how you can
develop your web based application using
JSF so if I do any mistake in X in the
words related to Java or
related to this technologies you can
just correct me and you can always leave
a comment that you are wrong or
something wrong is going on okay so now
I will start this video and in this
video I will show you how to install
NetBeans ID it is a platform on which we
are going to develop our je JSF
application so go on the browser and
search for NetBeans dot o-r-g and the
page you will see like that and you just
need to go here on download and when you
go on this page you need to download
this you can either download this j ee
edition or this all edition so this all
will cover all the technologies which
you can make in NetBeans like C++ also
PHP also so it includes so many
application or technologies so I prefer
to download this all and for after you
download this NetBeans installer if you
are new new to Java you also may want to
install this jdk in your system to run
java application and plus you also
required to install JRE to run your java
web applications so just download this
installer and just download when you go
below in this page
of this download page you will see here
this is used for JDK
so this JDK is required to run Java
applications so you need to install this
first and then install your NetBeans IDE
okay and now I will show you from where
you can install GlassFish it's a server
and this will we will use in our
applications in je so go to GlassFish
dot java.net and in here you go just go
to the download section so this is the
first page GlassFish store java.net and
in here on the right hand side you will
find all downloads and which download we
require is the open source distribution
because we want the free edition not the
commercial one so just go here and just
choose this and on the right hand side
when you see here there is a download
button so just download it it will
require maybe a some registration so
just do that registration and just
download this GlassFish latest GlassFish
for windows because we are building our
application on windows and make sure
this is a exe file so it will execute
automatically and you don't have to
worry about any other things and when
you install this GlassFish on your
computer
it will ask for the username and
password so you just can remember that
username and password and that may be
required in the later stages when you
execute or when you install this glass
so after you install this GlassFish you
may also when you run your first JSF
program you may also require JRE so what
is JRE JRE is a Java runtime Edition so
right j re-download and in here you will
find the JRE download from here so you
can download JRE from here and it it is
required to run these Java Enterprise
editions so install this JRE also and
now I will show you how to setup
GlassFish on your NetBeans IDE so if you
have successfully installed GlassFish
you will see this GlassFish in the C
Drive of your computer so C and
GlassFish 3 and when it asks for the
location make sure it's C and it's in C
Drive your GlassFish installer is
installing ok so this you have to
remember now
on the NetBeans IDE how you can
configure this GlassFish so when you
open this NetBeans IDE if you have
installed all version of NetBeans IDs
then it will in it will include all
Edition or all technologies will which
you can develop in NetBeans or if you
have installed je then you can only run
or or make je e programs so open this
means IDE and go and this toolbar and
click this tool and first of all we will
go to the server to setup the GlassFish
server for making our first application
and here I have already configured
GlassFish 3 server so it's already
configured but when you are configuring
it for the first time what you need to
do is go to add server and in here you
need to choose this GlassFish server 3
then click Next and make sure this part
is same wherever you installed your
GlassFish so this part and this part
should be same don't click this checkbox
because you have already installed this
GlassFish and just click Next and it
will give you this default page dont
enter any username or password here we
will if require if required we will
enter it or edit it later so when I
first may enter some username and
password here
I faced a problem related to
connectivity to the GlassFish server so
in the next time when I run the program
without this username or password it run
perfectly so just leave them blank don't
fill anything here and just click finish
ok and I have already configured this
GlassFish on my NetBeans IDE which is
like this so I will cancel
but you need to do like that okay and
after configuring you will see GlassFish
server here now when your GlassFish
server is already configured what you
need to do is go to file and go to new
project and in here you need to go to
Java web and java application okay and
after clicking this web application
click Next and in here I will leave this
name as default you can change this name
and give the name of your project here
and click Next and in here you have to
choose your server or GlassFish server
so I have already configured this server
so I can see this if you don't see this
you just add this from here and just
follow the steps further and click Next
and configure GlassFish server and make
sure it's je e Java EE 6 web selected
here by default it will be selected and
now click Next and we are interesting
interested in developing JavaServer
faces
so click JavaServer faces and now click
finish and it may take some time to
configure your project and start your
project and now if you can see here or
java application one is
started okay so once if you can see here
this scanning is complete in this
section you are ready to test this web
application so right click it and click
run
and when you run this you just can see
the output from here it's opening the
web application your java database
process GlassFish server and when all
these processes are running after these
processes it will open your web page
hopefully which will so show this hello
from facelets
so it takes about one or two minutes to
configure so don't worry let it run and
wait for the configuration
and it's still configuring
and now you can see here in here you can
see the new page here saying hello from
facelet and if you can see here it's on
localhost 1 2 9 3 2 port and your URL
path his web application which is the
name of your project right so in this
way you can run your first web
application this is just the start and
if it creates any problem in running
probably you have not set your java DB
database so what you need to do is if
you face any problem related to this you
need to check here in the services go to
database and go to java database java DB
and right click and go to properties and
make sure this path is correctly set up
so your GlassFish server is in your c
drive right so choose c drive and then
go to GlassFish folder and you need to
select this java DB from there so make
sure this path reflects in your C Drive
go to GlassFish and go to Java EE so
this part should be reflected in here ok
so make sure it's correct and if you
face any problem it will go ok so that's
how you can install and configure
grassfish on NetBeans and run your first
Java JSF
applications I hope you have enjoyed
