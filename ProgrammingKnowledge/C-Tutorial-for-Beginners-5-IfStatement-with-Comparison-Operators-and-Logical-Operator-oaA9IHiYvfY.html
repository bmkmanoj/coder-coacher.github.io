show you how to use if statement in
c-sharp in addition I will also show you
what is a comparison operator and what
is a logical operator so let's get
started what I have in my code here is I
have declared two integers these are 1
and integer 2 and I am Telling or I am
asking the user to enter these two
numbers as we have done in the last code
so we are saying console dot right enter
the first number and this line will
expect the user to enter the number in
the same way we are telling the user to
enter the second number and on the basis
of those two numbers we want to show
some message if the number 1 is greater
than number 2 or number 2 is greater
than number 1 so what we can do is we
can use if statement for that and what
is a if statement if statement is
nothing but a conditional statement
which take checks the condition so let's
see how we can use if statement in C
shop to declare if statement you just
need tips here and then you need this
here these brackets here and inside this
bracket comes the condition but here
also you need to give these two curly
braces
in order to give complete the condition
this will hold the condition and this
will in these brackets you will write
the if the condition is true whatever
you want to do or whatever code you want
to perform if the condition is true will
come here so these conditions can be
logical or these conditions can be
comparison so right now we want to use
comparison
operators to compare number one and
number two so let's see what options we
have to compare the two values so we
have something called comparison
operator and basically we have these six
basic comparison operator which is less
than greater than less than and equal to
greater than n equal to and equal to and
not equal to these are the sixth
comparison operator we have and notice
that this equal to
whenever you use with this less than or
greater than sign this equal to comes
always after this this less than or
greater then it doesn't come before this
greater than or less than
okay so let's use this greater than and
less than comparison operator so if num1
is less than num2 we want to show the
message and what message we want to show
you want to show the message that num1
is less then num2 okay so if number one
is less than number two we are going to
show this message number one is less
than number two and if the number one is
greater than number two we can just copy
this and paste it here and we can say if
number one is greater than number two
then we can say creator then number two
and now when we run the program and the
program ask us to enter two values of
length or two values 35 and 46 for
example
and it says number one is less than
number two which is true right number
one is 35 and number two is 46 number
one is less than 2 so what this code is
doing it's checking the condition if the
number 1 is less than number 2 then it
prints this value but in the second case
number 1 we have provided the condition
number 1 is greater than 2 true 2 and
this condition was not satisfied that's
why this line was not printed so if and
only if the condition is satisfied which
is there in the bracket then only the
code inside these curly braces will be
executed otherwise this code will not be
executed now we have seen that we have
entered two numbers number 1 and number
2 and if this condition is true
obviously this condition will not be
true but your C shop program will is
going to execute this also and check
whether this is true or not and this is
slightly inefficient because if this
condition is true why this food is
executed if this condition is even not
true
so what we can do here is we can use a
statement like else statement with if so
when you write else statement with
if-then what will what it will do is
first of all let's see this as statement
okay so what this code is going to do
here else by the way does not take any
condition because it's the consequence
if this is not true then what should
happen this else will come here so if
this is not true this is true if number
1 is less than number 2 then this
condition will not be executed
otherwise if number one is less than
number a number I am sorry if number one
is greater than number two then this
condition will be executed otherwise
this condition will not be executed if
there is no need to perform this
condition so let's see what happens
let's run the program and this time we
will provide number one will be number
will be greater than number two 46 for
example and now it's a number one is
greater than number two which is the
else statement condition which is this
condition right so in this way you can
perform this if-else statement there is
one more condition called else if which
you can use it like this so you can use
else if number one equal to number two
then we want to perform some or when we
want to print some message for example
okay so what we can do is we can here
print number one is equal to number two
okay so this is if-else condition else
if condition so what is the sequence of
program will be first your program will
check if this is true or not if this
condition is not true then it will go to
this condition and checks whether this
condition is true or not
else it will throw this message right so
let's try and run the program and this
time we will give two equal values for
the two for 34 and this sales number 1
is equal to number 2 so this sequence
will be followed first this condition
will be checked and if this condition is
not true then only will the program will
go to this code and if this condition is
not true then only this code is executed
so that's the use of L's if the
condition is not true
then it will not be aggregated okay now
there is one more thing you can do in if
condition which are called
logical operations and there are mainly
two kinds two kinds of logical operator
one is or operator and one is and
operator so op or operator will be used
by writing these two pipe symbols and
and operator will be used by writing
these two and the symbol okay and let's
see how we can use it use them so right
now we have given this condition if
number one is less than number two then
we want to print the value but for
example we want to check whether
number one is less than number two and
and for number one is equal to twenty
right and we will try the message and
number one is twenty okay so we want to
check where the number one is less than
number two and we also want to check
where the number one is equal to twenty
then only we want to print this message
so let's try it and run the program
first of all let's give number one is
equal to 20
number two is equal to twenty thirteen
and it says number 1 is greater than
number two which is true right this
condition is Matt here now in order to
satisfy this condition let's try and run
the program once again we will give 20
and we will give 36 and press Enter and
now it says number one is less than
number two which is true and number one
is 20 right so when we use n symbols
your program or this condition if tube
it has to be true and this condition
also has to be true so both conditions
has to be true when you be used this and
symbol and if you want if we write this
pipe here double pipe then your program
will check either this is true or this
is to either one of the condition is
true then it will print this country
then it will print this message okay so
here you can write or I run the program
and once again we will write 3445 okay
and it shows the message number one is
less than number two or one is number
one is twenty so note that this
condition is not satisfied here but only
this condition is satisfied then also
it's showing this message that means
this symbol means either this is true or
this is true okay if any one condition
is true then this will be your program
or your condition will be executed now
there is two ways of using or and end
with these two pipe and with a single
pipe also you can use this if conditions
but when you use this single pipe what
will happen is your program will come
here and check this condition and if
this condition is even true it will go
to this condition to check if this
condition is true or not and if if this
condition is not true then also it will
go to this condition to check whether
it's not true - or not so it's it will
do its whole cycle it will check this
condition this condition of and whatever
condition you will give and what these
two pipe when you give these to pipe
this what what this will do is your
program will come here if you check this
condition and if it's true it does it
will not care about these this condition
and it will directly come here and it
will directly print this message so
using these two pipe symbol is more
efficient because I one condition is
true your message will will be printed
and this will not be executed so it will
save your time if it will save your time
your program is trying critical program
right so same thing you can do it with
these and symbols also you can use one
symbol and the concept will be same okay
so in this way you can use if-else
conditions and logical operators and
comparison operators in C shop I hope
