science we will write so what we will
write we will click this username text
box and go to the properties and copy
the name of this text box which we have
written or which we have provided
earlier and I will paste it here in
between these two text boxes okay I
think I provided this codes in different
manner
so just they leave this double quotes
from here and after your single goat
provide this double quote so is equal to
single quote and then double quote and
then plus and then your variable name
and we will do it here also until meet
this double quote here and provide this
inside the single quote single quote
double quote and plus and this is my
text box variable name before this text
box I am write this and provide this
arrow pointer and after this Xbox
variable I will point once again our
arrow variable and write text okay
so select star from database dot table
where username is equal to this so what
it will do is take your text from your
text box and pass them into the query
where you use a name is present and
after that when user name is equal to
this and write and password is equal to
once again single quote in between them
double quote and in between them plus
sign and once again we will go to our
form and this time we will click this
password field and then we will copy its
name and just paste it in between this
plus sign and after this I will write
text and before this text box variable I
will write this this at a point okay
so we have written select star from
database dot table where username is
equal to whatever you have when you
enter Indian user text text box and and
password whatever you enter in your
password text box now we have created
this trying catch block and we have
created this while loop in the previous
video so just above your while loop you
will declare a variable which is a local
variable int count okay and just
initialize it is equal to zero and now
go to your while loop inside your while
loop which we have created last time and
in here why
count is equal to count plus one okay so
what it will do is it will search for
the password and if it reads the
password and user name into your
database it will count and increase it
by one the initial value of your count
variable is zero so if it reads the
password and it find its find it it will
increase the count by one so if your
count will become one when it will find
your username and password into your
database but for example you have more
than one username and password which are
same so if you have duplicate username
or password it will increase the count
by one more or what how many whatever
amount of duplicate values are present
so if you have duplicate username it
will count two or three times depending
upon your duplicate values and it will
transfer this into this variable so now
go outside a while loop and here you
will write if bracket and this curly
bracket and if you will provide the
condition count is equal to one then
give me a message
so if count is equal to one that means
your password and username is correct so
you will show a message
so you will write message box double
colon and right show and in between this
you will write double quotes and write
user name and pass word is correct okay
and if if once again provide us if
statement so if count is equal to one
username and password is correct
else if sorry else if count is greater
than one then what we will show you your
username and password are duplicate okay
so just write this message box message
message box double colons show and
username and password is correct instead
of this is correct
we will write duplicate username and
password okay and you can also write
access denied so if you
duplicate username and password is
present into your database then you can
deny the access else you can write the
message or in any other condition
username and password is not correct
okay and right please try again so let
our code is complete now and let's try
to run the program so I will just click
this and click yes and it will run my
code so I will go to my SQL database and
I can see I have one n1 username and
password so I will try to enter username
password one and one yeah
username is one password is one and I
will click login and it says username
and password is correct okay so it
verifies my username and password you
can see here I have duplicate password
um username 5 and 5 there are two times
same username and password is used so 5
&amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 5 so if I provide here
username is 5 &amp;amp; password is fine it
should show me the to placate username
and password so I will click login and
it says duplicate name username and
password access denied
so that's also true
and in the third condition I have
username and password up to seven so for
example I provide some other username
and password for example something
anything instead of which is not
matching my username and password and I
will click login and it says username
and password is not correct please try
again later so in this way you have made
unlocking page with the help of your
windows form application in the math
next video I will show you how you can
open a second form when you click this
login button and how to hide this and
open our next form when you login to
your system so I hope you have enjoyed
this video please rate comment and
