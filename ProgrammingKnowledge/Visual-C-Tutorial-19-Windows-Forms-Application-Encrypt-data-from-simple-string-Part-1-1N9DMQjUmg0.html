video and in the next
a couple of videos I'm going to show you
how to encrypt and decrypt the simple
text by using your visual C++ windows
form application so first of all let's
see what is encryption and what type of
encryption in the encryption we are
going to do so if you go to the
Wikipedia page
here you can see in cryptography
encryption is a process of encoding
messages in such a way that some hacker
can not read it but the authorized party
can read it so this is a gist of what
encryption is and what you encrypt the
opposite of encryption is the Egyptian
so you encrypt the simple script and you
the and decrypt the encrypted form by
using the decryption now let's see which
encryption technique we are going to use
in this we are going to use AES or
advanced encryption standard which is
widely used in cryptography or
encryption or decryption of the simple
text and we are going to convert a
simple text into this fiend evil Shiva
if you want to learn more about this you
can of course go to the Wikipedia page
and learn more about encryption
cryptography and what are a yes and then
Bill shivers so now let's make our code
so go to your toolbox first and I'm
going to take two buttons
and two text boxes for showing the end
clip to them decrypted text and I rename
them so I renamed my buttons as encrypt
and decrypt so when I press this my text
potage and in this text box will be
encrypted into a shiva text and when I
press decrypt button the text or Shippo
which will be presented here will be
converted into her original form here
once again okay so let's see how to do
that first of all go to your code
section if there you can double click it
or simply go to a for section and go at
the top of your program where your
initialize component function is there
here
and just below that you see the
destructor of your form which is
initialized like this till they form
tilde symbol and just below that declare
some variables which I will show you
here move to declare some variables so
first of all white string and this cap
symbol and
and we will decrease or re-raise
right
cap symbol here
and shit
okay so string Schaefer data and we
might chief of mind I will copy this I
replied and pasted four times and this
will be second variable of light will be
white and toward will be lame night
maybe and a pod will be clean
right now I think we need only these
things if we need some more variable we
will declare them later and just below
that you need to declare an object which
is
symmetry
and good and then this cap symbol and
your object so des des des obj
so declare this and then go to the top
where you'll use using namespaces are
declared here we will declare some more
namespace components so I will copy this
one and paste it three more times and
first name space system namespace we
require is the text the second is i/o
and the thought is security
cryptographic okay so these things you
need to do and the third thing for
declaration you need to do is go to your
mean function and where you'll
initialize component on the client and
in here you need to write this object
which we have declared symmetric
algorithm object copy this and paste it
here and write equal to
big deal it okay
I hope I spelled everything correct so
let's try and run the program we have
some errors are we good to go
and I think I don't have any other
so it drums that means I don't have any
arrows till now so I would written back
to my coat and we are done with the
declarations and we will once again go
to our forum and just press this encrypt
button double click it and we will go to
the forum event or function button click
function here you need me to write your
code so go to the pump where you have
declared your variables and just copy
this shift for data variables from here
and go to the form once again and double
click this and click button and paste it
here
is equal to
your plain text
you know this X button name so whatever
you have named your text box we just
copied that I have my text as encrypt
text and then arrow point text like a
closed and then second thing you need
tonight is just go to the top once again
and copy your plain key or first we will
copy our plain byte variable and once
again go to the phone go to the method
and right here play invite is equal to
then white is equal to
encoding the big boats auskey and
awesome new get might make it close and
in this bracket we will pass out
Schiphol
dr. variable okay and now we will take
name variable which we have declared
above is equal to once again copy this
encoding and asking and once again copy
this and for the key key is your
personalized key which you have so the
sender will have the key which is
defined by him and on the decoder side
also have this key so with the help of
this key we decrypt the text on the
other side so it's a 16 bit long key so
you can provide anything I'm providing 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e i think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
