video we have seen how to update your
data with this update button and in this
video I will show you how to delete your
data when you select or when you select
or enter something into this employee ID
text field and you want to delete that
employee ID then how can you delete that
data I will show you today so first of
all we will go to our tool box and take
a button and I will go to my property
fields and I will rename it as delete
button and will also edit the text as
delete
okay
and now I will select this Update button
because I have shown you some code for
the update button so just double click
it this update button and if you don't
know this code just watch the last video
for how to edit or update your database
and I will copy all this code from this
string constraint to this to the end of
this catch block and I will use this
code thing to my delete button in order
to save time so just go to your delete
button and double click it and we reach
to its method or function and in between
this delete button click event just
paste your code which you have copied
from update data so once again by this
time you must know that this is for
creating the connection with the
database and this is username and
password and in this field we write our
query to connect with the database ok so
we will edit this query in order to
delete or not obvious previously we have
written update query and now we will
write delete when so I will start from
here right delete from your database dot
your table name which is this database
and this table database name and table
and then between here delete from
database dot e data and right where your
employee ID is equal to this arrow
pointer added text which is your this
text field name and arrow pointer text
so we have written delete from database
dot e data where your employee idea or
eid which is my column name from my
database this one yeah I do
and this is this dot text field name
arrow point of text and after this all
the code we don't need so we will delete
which we have written in the last video
so my final query is delete from
database dot e dot aware ye ID is equal
to single quote in between double quote
in between plus and then this arrow
point your text being named for with my
ID arrow point of text okay and nothing
much you need to change just change this
message box instead of updated which we
have written in the last video you can
write delete it so whenever your data is
deleted then you can see the message
that it's really deleted now so let's
try and run the program run
and it's funny my user name and password
it's correct and now for example I want
to delete here you can see I have 11 and
entries in my database and for example I
want to delete this 11th employee ID
from my database so I will write 11 here
love and I will press Delete and you can
see the message it's deleted press ok
and when we check in the database it's
still there but when you refresh your
database with this button for the fresh
you can see your employee ID 11 is gone
once again for example I want to delete
this boy Eddie 10 also just write it
here
then and press delete and it shows that
I've deleted ok and once again I will go
to refresh or Nautilus from this and
your bottle is deleted so in this way I
have shown you how to delete your dog
with the help of a button I hope you
