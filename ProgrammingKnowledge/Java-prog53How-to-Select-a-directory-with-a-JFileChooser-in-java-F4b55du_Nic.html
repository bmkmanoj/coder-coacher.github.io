last video I have shown you how to
attach your selected file and save it by
this button and how to open that file by
clicking here
in the table so why I will go today I
will show you how to attach the folder
instead of file and open that folder
instead of file for example you want to
open the folder in which the file is
present and when you click the table
like this your file containing folder
should open not the file itself so I
will show you today how to do that you
don't need to do much in the last
tutorial I already shown you how to save
a document and open it from your table
so what you have to do just right click
on attach button and go to its
actionperformed
method so this code I have shown you in
the forty-ninth video how to use
jfilechooser
so if you don't know this code go to go
and see the video number 49 so now what
you have to do in order to open your
directory instead of feo file you go to
the third line in which pile F is equal
to choosers dot get selected file you
need to change it
if you get selected file and the jeweler
got and you have to select get current
directory just this you have to add it
in your code which I have shown in the
forty-ninth video and you can open the
directory not the file itself by just
changing this into your code so let's
try and run our program
and now I mean take one
holder for example with Interpol and
this and I will select any of document
it doesn't matter so I want to open the
folder in which that file is present and
I will name it as hold the one for
example and document number three I save
it document is saved and you can see
three folder one and it's part and when
you click here your folder containing
that file is open not the file itself so
in this way you can open the directory
in which your file is present and I hope
you learn from this something and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
