tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use lists iterators in Java so
Java has basically four main list
iterators which we can use with
ArrayList or other classes and these
list iterators are DS for first is has
des next which returns the boolean value
so it checks whether our list has next
value and if it has the next value we
can print the next value or we can
access the next value by the function
called next and similarly by using hash
previous it checks whether our list has
a previous value related to the current
value or relative to the current value
and if it has the previous value then we
can print or access this value using
previous so let's declare an array list
array list and we make it the array list
option name so P make it string string
and our array list variable name we will
need as names is equal to new array list
and this will be string also and we will
initialize it as a default constructor
okay so now we can add to this array
list some names names dot add
name's dot add and we can add some
values for example mark and Ennis in the
similar way we can add some more values
right so we copy it and paste it three
or four times second name is for example
Tom third name is John check and Patrick
for example so we have added five
elements to our ArrayList now to use
these list iterator function we need to
use list iterator so we will define list
iterator okay so list iterator and we
want to have the list iterator of string
same as your array list so give the dot
type same as your other list and then
give a variable name for example I TR is
equal to and then take the list itself
dot list iterator okay with small L okay
so now this creates an iterator for your
list and using this iterator you can
check whether you can you have the next
value or the previous value in your list
so you can do something like this while
or iterator has next value so I dr dot
has next then we are going to print
something so says Oh control shift and
we will print ITR dot next okay so what
this is going to do it will check first
if our iterator has or if our iterator
has the next value or so this points to
the for example first element of the
list and then it checks if the litter
iterator has the next value which is
tomm and if it has it prints the next
value or if we can access the next value
by the function call next so this has
next returns boolean so it returns true
or false and this returns the object
itself so when we run the program we can
iterate over the list and print the list
in this format okay similarly you can
check or you can iterate over the list
in the reverse order okay so what I am
going to do is I am going to give some
line break to our console here so that
we can iterate over the list in reverse
order so let's use while once again
while and then this time we will use
this grater to iterate over the list in
reverse order
right so I TR dot has previous so search
for has previous or just copy this has
previous from here and then if we have
our iterator have the previous value we
are going to print the
the previous values so we can just write
iterator dot previous okay so once we
run the program we can see we can print
the value of the list in reverse order
from Patrick to mark right Patrick to
mark and above it has printed from mark
Patrick which is in the normal order
right so whenever you check iterator
with hasnext your pointer or you or you
will start from the top or and whenever
you are used has P previous your pointer
will start from the last value and it
checks the previous value and until and
unless it has or your iterator finds the
previous value it will print the
previous value okay so these are some
useful lists iterator method in Java I
hope you will use them in your
programming and I hope you have enjoyed
