video I will show you how to use context
menu with your windows form application
so first question arises is what is
context menu so for example we are in
Visual Studio IDE and when I right click
and the first thing this menu you see
here is the context menu so if you go
the to solution Explorer and right click
here you see the context menu of the
solution Explorer or you can go to the
tool box and right click here and you
can see the context menu of this toolbox
ok so this is the context menu so when
you right click and whatever you see
here is the context menu so in the
solution solution Explorer you can build
your program or add new files and you
can go to the properties also from em so
let's get started so for example I want
to choose a context menu for this form
so I will go to the toolbox and I will
take a context menu from here so I will
search for it this is here context menu
strip and place it here once you play
place your context menu here you will
see it will it goes here also and it
goes at the bottom strip here also so
this is just for designing and it's not
going directly into your form when you
complete with this design and when you
run it it will not show in your form so
for example I will add some new item in
this context menu I will add a menu item
and this menu item I can double-click
and I can go to the item click event so
I will go to its property or I will
select this and change its text as close
for example and you can go to the second
menu and you can give the second menu
item an exit or you can give new or
something else once you are done with
that you can just double click this menu
item and you can go here in the men tool
strip menu click event and for example I
write this dot close so this will close
my form so this is first and in the exit
you can write the this dot F plication
exit and once you are done with that
just select your form so when you select
your form you can see this context menu
strip is disappeared so what you need to
do is just select your form and in this
property of the form you will be able to
find context menu strip which is by
default none what you need to do is you
just need to select this context menu
strip from here so now you can see a
context menu strip one which is this
context menu and now when you run your
program and when you
right-click your form you can see close
and exit context menu comes here okay
and when I click close my program closes
right one more example I can give for
this is for example I will take a button
from here and for example I want to
change the background color of this
button by context menu so I will go to
my tool box and drag and drop one more
context menu in the form and you will be
able to see context menu to 3 is created
here and you can design this context
menu from here so for example you want
to change the color of this button from
your context menu so I will go to this
menu strip and I will change its text as
for example color and you can choose the
sub menus also so you have the menu and
you can choose here the sub menu for
example for foreground and background so
second is background and now I just
double click these two sub menu items I
double click foreground first I reach to
the foreground tool strip menu item
click event and I click background menu
item so I have created two menu item
click events here I will create a color
dialog so for example I will write
colored
dialogue dlg is equal to new color
dialogue bracketing breaking closed and
then I will give a condition if dialogue
dot show dialogue so just copy this dlg
here dot showed dialogue is equal to
system dot windows that forms dot
dialogue result dot okay so if this
dialogue is okay then we will first of
all close the safe condition and what we
will do is for the foreground i will
just copy this the name of this button
so i will go here go to the property and
the name of the button is button one so
i will copy and paste this button 1.44
color is equal to and then just copy
this dialogue here and paste it here dot
color and bracket and bracket closed the
same thing we will do it for this
background color so first of all let's
delete this this should be just color
not with bracket and i will copy this
same code in the black background menu
strip button click event and instead of
this for color i will just change it
button dot back color is equal to DL J
dot color so this menu strip will you
change the foreground of color of the
button and this will change the
background color of the button so let's
try and run the program and let's see
how it works or first of all I forgot to
add this menu item or context menu strip
item
to the button so this context menu strip
- we have assigned it for button one so
just select your button one and just go
to the properties here and search for
this context menu strip and select
context menu strip - because for this
context menu strip - we have assigned
the properties for this button now let's
try and run the program and when I right
click this button you will be able to
see this color and when I choose
foreground it gives me this color dialog
and I can choose the color for example
red or yellow and I click OK and you can
see the foreground of this button has
changed to yellow
once again I right click this button go
to the color and say I want to change
the background and let's try to change
the background as this dark blue and
click OK
and now you can see the background of
this button has changed so in this way
you can use this context menu strip
according to your usage and it's a very
good tool to work with so use it in your
project and just great comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
