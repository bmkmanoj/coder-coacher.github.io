a new video series on using local
database with your C shop windows form
application so what is a local database
local database is a database which you
can use locally on a computer so it
doesn't require any server for it's
working it works locally so for example
you create a project with the help of
local database
you can transfer your project or you can
transfer your software from one computer
to another computer without worrying or
connecting to the server and Microsoft
provides local database in Visual Studio
and you can use inherent Microsoft local
database with your c-sharp windows form
application one of the very good example
of local databases SQLite but we are not
going to use SQLite but we are going to
use Microsoft local database for this
application so let's get started I will
go to the file I will create a new
windows form application so new project
and it will open a project wizard I
select visual studio windows form
application or and I will say this is my
local database app okay and I will say
okay and it will create a project for us
in a few minutes you will see how easy
it is to make a local database and
connected with your c-sharp very easily
so once your project is ready what you
need to do is you need to go to your
project first of all we will create a
new local database so once your project
is created just go to your project and
right-click your project and say add new
item and click new item and here we will
search for the local database this is a
local database you can give the name of
the local database I will give the name
of my local database as employee
database okay so just like local
database give your database a name and
it has the extension SDF dot SDF ok and
add to your project and once it's
created you will be able to see your
file so it will give you this veg word
just select this database and say next
and it will retrieve information and
save finish and once you click finish
here you will see some files or some
references are added to your project ok
and you will be able to see this
employee dot SDF file in your project
right so what you can do is in this
database you can create new tables so we
are going to create a new table for
employee in this employee dot SDF
database so if you see here or if you
don't see this X server Explorer in your
window if you go to the server Explorer
you will be able to see your new
database called employ dot SB SDF which
we have recently created if you can't
see this a server Explorer in here then
go to view and just search for this
server Explorer and just pin it into
your visual studio window okay so now
this employee s dot SDF is here
we will go to this table right-click and
we will say create table and first of
all we will define the name of our table
we will say our table name is Amoy info
table and here you can define the
columns of the table so serve first is
ID for example you can create a ID
second column I'm going to create is the
name of the employee third is the
surname of the employing fourth is age
fifth may be is he married or not so I
will say is married and we will define
the data type of this columns so ID
would be
India so I will select integer name
would be where cap so it's okay surname
also would be where care and age would
be our integer and his married is a bit
so we will search for bit and we will
define here bit okay and you can also
define the length of these where care or
name and you can also define if you want
this to be the unique key or not and you
can also define the primary key for your
table primary key is nothing but a
unique ID for your data so for example I
will say ID is my primary keys so it or
ID will be my unique identifier for the
searching of my daughter okay so we have
created a simple database for the
employee and we say okay and now you
would be able to see our table called
employee info and which has some columns
now we are going to add some data to our
table so just right click and go to show
table data and in here we will add
employee ID one name is mark for example
so name some surname age is 23 is
married we will fill it after creating
our form
okay so just leave it as it is second is
second ID and it will be some other name
and age and
is married we will film after creating
the database on the windows form
application so I have these two rows and
I will say saves so my data is saved now
what I will do is I will open my form
which is form one in in my windows form
application and this is my form now go
to a data so this here go to data source
in here and if you can't see the data
source just go to this data and say show
data source okay and it's already
showing us the data source and you can
click right click it and you can refresh
it so go to this tool once again and not
this tool but this data and we will say
we want to add a new data source to our
project so go to data and click this add
new data source and select database and
click Next once again contrabass next
and now we are going to choose our
database so we have this employee
connection string so we will choose it
and say next and from here we see that
all the data or all the columns which we
have defined is present here ID name
surname and is marriage is present here
I will select whole table so I will
select or check this table here and I
will say finish and our data set name is
employ data set 1 right this one and now
you will be able to see your
data source in this data source tab okay
and now in this data source tab just you
can choose with this combo box you want
to use data grid view or you want to use
details so for example I click this
combo box and I choose details and I
will make my form a little bit bigger
and I will drag and drop my data base to
my form and you see that it has created
some text boxes and some labels and a
checks box for yourself and this is
connected to the database so it's really
simple and what we can do is we can
change the property of this check box as
married and we can delete this label is
married so you can see like this and
second thing you can do is just go to
the dot source data source once again
and once again click this combo box and
this time choose data grid view from
here click it and choose it and now just
drag and drop your data base to your
windows form application of this form so
now you would be able to see a dotted
grid view is created which is connected
to the database once again and you will
see here all the columns which you have
defined in the database ID name surname
age and is married right now
you have seen how easily you have
created a connection with the database
and you have created this form let's try
and run our program for now and if you
remember we have given two data one was
mark one was Julie and this is the same
data which we have defined in the
database right you can flip through the
database by clicking these buttons you
see and you can see the change here and
you can edit your database so for
example we say Mark is married just
click this checkbox and say save so this
data is saved now when you flip through
the database you can see here this check
box automatically checks when you flip
through the database you can add a new
record also so just say this plus sign
and say your ID is 3 name is so name and
age is 44 and he is also married so I
will give this data and I say save and
you can see the data is saved I think we
need to check it and then save it now
it's coming here also ok so in this way
you can create your data also and you
can delete your daughter so just select
your row which you want to delete and
just click delete now I have already
told you that your local database
doesn't depend on the server so let's
see how easily we can share
or transfer our application from one
place to another so just go to your
project right-click your project and go
to open folder in Windows Explorer and
go to bin here and go to debug and you
will be able to see the executable file
for your project here so the same
application it will start from here also
right what you can do is you have this
application and you have this executable
file what I'm going to do is I will just
copy this folder from here and I'm going
to place it at some other place in my
computer for example I will paste it on
this desktop so I have changed the
location of the executable file but
because it is a local app data base
application it will run from here also
because all the files which are needed
is present here and you if you see here
we also have our database file which is
transferred with the debug folder so
this was our database file employee dot
STF and we can also start our
application from here also and we have
the same data right and for example I
just cut my database from here and place
it somewhere else outside this folder
here and now when I run the program it
will give me some errors because my
database is not present so let's try and
run and it's giving me some errors that
you are not connected to the database or
something and you say continue but you
cannot see the data in here
so once again I will just cut my
database and paste it in the folder and
once again I will be able to see my
daughter so this is what I mean by local
database you can transfer it from one
place to another one computer to another
but you don't require any server
connections so I hope you have enjoyed
this video and learned something new
this time in the further videos I will
explain you some more features about
local database and windows form
application so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
