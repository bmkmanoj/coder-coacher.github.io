last couple of videos I have been
showing you how to create a PDF file and
how to insert some data like images
paragraphs or list or table into your
PDF using your c-sharp application and I
text sharp the Yellin so in the last
video I have shown you how to insert a
table inside your PDF using c-sharp code
and now in this video I will show you
how to transfer your data grid values so
for example I have this program and in
my data grid view or table this one I
want to transfer all these values
including the header of the table in my
PDF file okay so how can I do that I
will show you in this video so this all
data I will show in this PDF so let's
see how will I do that first of all let
me close the program and I I have this
create PDF button which I'll double
click and this code I have been showing
you in the last three or four videos to
create a PDF so if you don't know how I
have written this code then watch last
three videos three or four videos and
you will come to know what this code is
and last time we have written the code
for this table so I'm going to comment
this code for just for the table
so that it's easier to recognize which
table I'm talking about so just I
commented this table code and now I will
write the data grid view code in this
create PDF button click event okay so in
here you need to write this code so what
this code is first of all as in previous
video for defining the table just write
PDF table table is equal to new PDF
table and inside your brackets we
defined the column number of columns in
this bracket in the last video of you
remember so in this video because we are
transferring our data grid view that's
why I have written that a grid view
which is the name of this data grid view
so just copy this name from here for
this data grid view and then dot column
dot count so this is counting the column
and placing it in side this bracket okay
now we will add the header to the PDF
table so this is the code for adding the
header to the PDF so right for int I I
or J whatever you like is equal to 0 and
semicolon J is less than data grid view
which is the name of your data grid view
dot columns dot count semicolon J plus
plus so if J is less than column count
then we will pass the header text of
the data grid view inside this table
cell so in the for loop right table
which is this variable dot ad cell and
in the bracket new phrase as we have
written last time also and in this
bracket we are going to pass our header
of the data grid view so right data grid
view one which is the name of the data
grid view dot columns and in the array
pass this J variable dot header text
this header text means the header of
your table or the title of your tables
okay so this loop will create the title
of the table in the form of the table in
the PDF and this will create a table
header now just for the caution I am
writing table dot header rows is equal
to 1 so I am making sure that the header
row is only a 1 here that's why I have
written this and then in the next for
loop we are passing the values which are
condemned contained by the table okay so
write for int I is equal to 0 semicolon
in I is less than data grid view 1 which
is the name of the data grid view dot
Rose dot count semicolon I plus plus so
this for loop is counting the rows and
placing it into the loop and in the next
loop for the for loop write for so there
are two for new one for loop and inside
that there is an second for loop so this
- for loop will create a two-dimensional
array for our tables cells right which
we will transfer into the table so right
second for loop and inside the second
for loop declare int K is equal to zero
semicolon K is less than data grid view
dot columns dot count and semicolon K
plus plus first we are taking the rows
in this for loop and the second loop we
are taking the columns okay and then
inside these two for loop give at this
condition so write if the data grid view
in the array K comma I which are these K
and I variable dot value is not is equal
to null so if the data grid field values
are not null then we are passing these
values into the self of the PDF table so
write table dot add cell and in the
bracket write new phrase and once again
in the bracket data grid view one which
is the name of your data grid view and
inside the array passed these K and I
variable K for column for loop and I for
row for loop dot value dot to string
okay so this is the whole for loop for
two-dimensional array and in the next
line we are just adding this table
variable inside this document which we
have created in the last two video so
this is the document variable if you
remember from the last videos okay so I
will
just shrink this code so it will come in
one screen and just if you want you can
pause the video and you can just copy
this code okay and now when we are going
to run the program to username and
password okay so let's see first our
text so this is a PDF which is generated
earlier and it has old table which we
have created in the last video but now
we are transferring the new table so I
am just closing this PDF and now I will
press load table so this will load my
table here in the data grid view okay
and now when I press this button this
employee ID name surname and age and
hold out of the dis table which has 14
rows will be transferred to the PDF so I
will click create PDF and let's see once
again in the PDF file which we have
generated so this is the test PDF and
double click it and you see a new table
is created here which contains the same
data as our data grid view okay so if
you can match you will be able to match
also like this okay
so in this way you can transfer the
values from data grid view to the PDF
files so these are the values which is
extracting from MySQL database in the
data grid view so indirectly you have
transferred the database values inside
your PDF file and this will be helpful
when you are using this PDF to create
the report or to show some reports so it
will be very useful for that purpose and
about this header column or header row
you can change its font and the column
size and everything which I have shown
you in the last video so if you want to
just highlight this row and these cells
then you watch the last video I have
shown you in that video how to change
the font and background color of the
cell okay so I hope you have enjoyed
this video and you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
