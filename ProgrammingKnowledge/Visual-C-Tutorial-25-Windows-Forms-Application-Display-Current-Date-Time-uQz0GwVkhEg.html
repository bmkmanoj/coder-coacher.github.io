video I will quickly show you how to
show the current date and time into your
windows form application so what I have
done is I have taken unlabeled from my
tool box and drag into my form which is
this label and then what i have done is
i go to my source code of this form here
and i went to the function where my
initialize function is called so this is
your form name like this and where this
function is there and you can recognize
it by this thing wherever your
initialize component function is there
you need to go there and add these two
lines what are these two lines daytime
the variable name is also date time is
equal to date time double colon new and
after that this arrow pointer label name
which is this label so I went to the
properties and I copied this labels name
and paste it there so this is that label
name arrow point the text is equal to
date/time dot two string so these two
things I have done and let's see if I
can see the date and time or not so 2
and 2 which is my user name and password
and yes I can see the date and time but
one thing you can notice is it's
constant it's not moving for the dynamic
time it requires a little
bit longer code which I will show you
later but in this way you can at least
show the static time and if you want to
check the current time when you are
running your application what you can do
is go to your form and you can double
click this label and in the event action
perform you can paste the same two line
which you have written above in the code
in the initialize component near the
initialize component function so add two
line in the click event and then when
you run your program
so whenever you double-click it the time
will change so it didn't this way at
least you can see the current time by
double-clicking it so this is how you
can show the date and time I will also
maybe in future I will show you how to
show it the running time so please stay
tuned and please rate comment to
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
