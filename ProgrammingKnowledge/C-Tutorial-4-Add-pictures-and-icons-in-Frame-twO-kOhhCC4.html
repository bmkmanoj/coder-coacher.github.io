video I will show you how to add
pictures and icons with your form in we
you'll see shop windows form application
for example I want I have this log in
frame and I want to add a picture to
make it look good and basically I want
to make this frame more presentable so
first of all let's select our component
tweets and select all and just drag to
the corner of the frame and then just go
to your tool box and first of all we are
going to take a group box and we will
drag and drop here
and we will resize it a little bit and
we will just once again select this all
to tools and drag and drop into your
road box and just we salute once again
and then they become a part of your room
box which will look nicer and this group
box text you can change from here just
select the group box and go to its text
and I will right sign in for example and
press enter and you can see sign in here
now the question of icons and picture
boxes pictures so go to your tool box
and select a picture box from here this
one and drag and drop here
now for this picture you can make your
custom pictures also and you can find
the picture online also for example I
want to provide a picture for lock in
here and I want to provide
ok icon a small ok I can in my button so
I prefer to use Internet and find them
online the pictures in item so if you go
to Google and search for the icon you
can find many site which provides I can
so click one of them I will choose icon
are chief and its opening and first of
all I will find for login picture so
just search for that and I find the
first picture good what about the second
yeah so second this looks good so I will
click PNG and I will just right click
and save as and save wherever you want I
will save it on my next top places
repository icon so just remember the
name and save it so it's saved in the
same way I will search for the ok icon
for my login button search and you will
find some good ok icon but problem is
this icon is too big and I want a small
icon so I will resize it I will go to
the filters and
want a 16 by 16 px item I will select
this and now they are much smaller so I
will select one of them PNG and I will
once again like click Save As and accept
I can is the name and I will save it on
my desktop I will return to my
application in this picture box I will
click this small arrow button this one
and I will choose the image from here
choose image and then I will click
import
and I will choose my places report with
the trade icon from him just choose it
will be imported in my resources and
then I will click OK and you can see the
picture is now here just resize your
picture box according to your
convenience now the question of icon for
this button comes so I will select this
button and will go to the properties
a little bit bigger so select this
button go to the properties and search
for image this one image right now there
is no image some will select this we
click this button and once again I will
import image for this button this time a
smaller picture which is I think this
except I can i download it I will select
this yes and I will click OK but you can
see login and your I can't lashes so it
doesn't look nicer so what I will do I
will it's just like this button go to my
properties once again go to image align
here and I will select this left side of
my body and now you can see it's on the
left side of my body and in the same way
you can also align the text so just
select this and go to the properties and
you can align your text also text align
and for example I want to place it on
the right side middle right and it's
aligned on the right side and just
resize it and now you can see our
application looks better than earlier
when I run the program it looks nicer
and little bit good in appearance and
professional so in this way you can add
pictures and icon with your C sharp
application I hope you have enjoyed this
