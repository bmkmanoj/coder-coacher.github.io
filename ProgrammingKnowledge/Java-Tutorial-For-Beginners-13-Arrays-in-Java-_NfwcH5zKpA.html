tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are arrays and how we can declare
and use arrays in Java now what is an
array an array is same as a variable but
it can store more than one values at a
time but the only condition with array
is you need to store or you can only
store same kind of values in an array
for example you want to store 10 integer
in an array you can do it but you want
if you want to store or 5 integers and 5
double values you can do not do it so
you can only store same kind of you know
dot type in an array so let us see how
we can declare array in Java it is very
simple you just need to give the data
type first of all for example you want
to create an integer array then we give
the data type and then we use these
square brackets and then we give the
variable name for example my int array
okay and then you can initialize this
array in these curly braces and whatever
comes inside these curly braces for
example 1 comma 3 comma 2 comma 4 comma
5 these are the values or elements of
the array so it can store multiple
integer so we have stored right now 5
integers in this array right and when
you compile it it will work fine
there is other way of declaring array
and which is like this you just use your
data type and then my int array 2 for
example
and then you give your square bracket
and then you can give values to the
array and this will also work fine but
it's not the preferred way of declaring
area so this first way of declaring
array is preferred this is not preferred
way of declaring arrange job but it will
work if you want to declare it so we
compile it and it will compile fine it
will not complain okay now there are
different ways of declaring array or the
most basic one is this one but there are
different ways of declaring arrays like
this the most used ways of declaring
array a are these three ways so first is
whatever I showed you here like this and
which is like this right and you can
declare an array like this integer
square bracket and the name and is equal
to new we haven't learned what is new
keyword here so I will not go into deep
in this and this kind of array this we
will learn when we will you know learn
how to use classes and objects so we
will use this kind of array right now
but I want to show you I wanted to show
you that these declarations are also
possible right so now if you declare an
array these are called the elements of
the array and right now our array
contains five elements and the index so
the position at which these values are
stored are called index and the index of
the array if you think that it will
start from one it will not the index of
an array start from zero so for example
I want to print
the value this one too for example so I
can write system dot out dot print line
and then in here I can print a my array
like this and in the square bracket you
can give the index so if you want to
print this too
you may think that the well the position
is one two three third position two is
at the third position and you can do it
like this but when you run this program
it will give you the value for which is
this one so index of the array starts
from zero so zero one and two so the
actual position of this value is two and
whenever you write index two it will
give you the value two okay let's give
take some bigger values three 31:26
what te something in 52 okay and we want
to print 26 here so the index of this is
0 1 2 so just write write the name of
your array and then is in square bracket
the index of the array and it will print
the index of the array like this ok so
in this way you can access the value of
array you if you want to access this 100
you can just write the position index 0
and then you can access the value 100
like this ok and if you want to print
all the values in the array I have shown
you how to use loops and using for
example while loop you can print all the
values in the array like this for
example we want to print the value of
all the elements okay so on the basis of
its position you can do it
for example I declare one more variable
in I is equal to zero which will be the
index or let us name it as index of the
array okay
and if index is less than five right
because zero one two three four it will
go up to four but as soon as it goes to
5 it will be exhausted
right if index is less than five we want
to print the value of the array so index
we will paste it here instead of zero
and then we will increase the value of
index by one every time in the loop and
this when we run this program this will
give you the value of this array like
this you see all the elements are
printed like using this while loop first
is 100 second is 31 third is 26 fourth
is 48 and fifth element is 52 okay but
if you do something like this for
example you change it to six but your
array value is five then it will give
you an error because the last value it
will tie try to excess is not existing
so it will give you some error so always
remember what is the size of your array
and depending upon the size of the array
you know consider making your program
then it will not give an error right so
size of an array is important now
whenever you use the array so I hope you
have understood the basic declarations
and how to use arrays in Java and I hope
