you how you can download and install
Java JDK
on your Mac operating system first of
all I'm going to show you how you can
check whether Java is really installed
on your Mac OS or not now there are two
ways for checking it first is to open
your system preferences there is this
icon you can see here you can just click
on this system preferences icon and it's
going to open the system preferences for
you right and you can see this is the
System Preferences window and if you see
a Java at the bottom of this window then
Java is most probably installed on your
system
so if Java is installed on your system
you will be able to see the Java I can
like all these other icons in your
system preferences right you can open
system preferences from here also from
this Apple icon and then you can just
click system preferences is going to
open the same right the second way is to
check the Java version using the
terminal now in order to open the
terminal you can just open the spotlight
using this search icon at the top you
can see and then just write terminal and
it's going to open the terminal
I can so just click on this is going to
open your terminal right now in here you
just need to type Java and then -
version and then + Enter is going to
first of all give you this warning
it says no Java Runtime present
requesting install so this means that
Java is not installed on my system and I
need to install it and it's going to
give me a pop-up window like this it
says to use the Java command line tool
you need to install a JDK so the
the help of this pop-up window what we
need to do is we just need to click this
option which says more input so just
click on this option which is more info
which is going to open the Oracle
website okay so you can see it has
opened the Oracle website and in here
just agree to the cookie conditions and
then you will be able to see two buttons
here one for Java and other for NetBeans
with Java so what we need is this button
which is for Java and the version of
Java is this one right Java JDK we just
need to click this button which says
Java it is going to open this download
page here now just scroll down a little
and first of all you need to accept the
license agreement so you just need to
check this radio button so just check
this radio button in front of accept
license agreement and once this radio
button is checked you can just scroll a
little bit down and you will be able to
see this option for Mac OS X okay so
this is the option for Mac OS X and this
is about 226 megabyte file and it's
extension is dot dmg file okay so we
need to install first of all download
and then install using this file our
Java JDK right so just click on this one
which says the x64 dot dmg in front of
micro X OS X and once you click this the
download for this dmg file will start
right now depending upon the speed of
your your internet it's going to take
few minutes right so I will wait for
some time to download to compete
and then we will see how we can install
Java on our system so now this dmg file
is downloaded so I am going to double
click on this file so double click on
the downloaded dmg file it's going to
open the installation of this dmg file
you can see the pop-up window will
appear like this right let me minimize
my browser so we can see it in a better
way so now you have this kind of window
opened when you double-click on the dmg
file now it says double click on the
icon to install so you just need to
double click on this item to install it
and now it's going to start installing
the Java JDK 8 in my case at the time of
making this video and you will see this
kind of a window now you just need to
click continue here and then it says
install for all users of this computer
so I just need just that so I will just
click continue
first of all select this and then click
continue and now it says this will take
around this much amount of space of your
computer so if you you know agree then
you just need to click install right and
at the time of installing it will ask
you to give your computer's password so
whatever is the password of your Mac
computer we just need to give it here so
I'm going to give my password here and
then I will click install software and
now it will start installing the Java
JDK software
and now it says the installation was
completed successfully right so once you
see this message that means Java is
installed successfully on your microwave
you just need to close this window and
to check this we are going to open our
Center System Preferences once again so
I'm going to just open the system
preferences once again using this icon
but this time I'm going to open it with
this option in the under the Mac icon so
System Preferences and you can see this
Java icon here right and when you click
on this job I can it's going to show you
this kind of message the Java control
panel opens in the separate of window
right so you can just see this and you
when you click on this you know icon you
will be able to see this kind of Java
control panel and then you will be able
to see general information of your java
software you can see if there is any
update or not and then you can see some
of the other features of Java so you can
see view and manage Java Runtime version
so if you want to use Java Runtime
version you can view like this so we
have the 1.8 platform the product is 1.8
point zero point something the location
is this one so you can see the Java JDK
and one time is installed at this
location you can just see this location
or you can just copy this location and
we can verify that Java is really
installed at this location right so what
I'm going to do is I will just leave it
as opened and I'm going to just minimize
the fifth System Preferences just and
let let's just minimize this one also
I'm going to just cancel it for now and
minimize it
ah now right now I also told you that
you can also verify the Java version
using the terminal so once again open
the terminal so if you give the same
command on the same on older terminal
before installing the you know Java you
have open this terminal and once you see
it will show you this kind of you know
version of the Java and you can now see
the Java version so it says Java version
1.8 right once again you can also check
the Java compiler by using Java C -
version and then press ENTER it's also
going to give you the version of Java C
so now Java is installed successfully on
your Mac OS now one thing remains is the
setting of Java home environment
variable and this is also very important
so what we are going to do is I'm going
to just clear the terminal for now and
first of all I will switch to my home
directory by the way I'm already in my
home directory but if you are not if you
are not in your home directory you just
need to switch it to your home directory
whatever is your home directory in and
if you don't know how to do it you just
need to just press this tilde and then
the forward slash and before this you
just need to write CD tilde /n + just
that enter and you will be in your home
folder right and I'm going to just LS in
to this folder
which is going to list all the
directories and file in this folder so
to check whether the Java home is really
set on your microwave so you just need
to write this command echo and then
dollar symbol and then Java underscore
home all in capital and if it does not
give any output here then Java home is
I said so for this what you need to do
is first of all you just need to do LS -
al here so it it is going to show you
all the hidden and hidden file also to
the governor I must give I left - al
right and then press enter and I can see
in my home folder all these files and
directories right so I can see dot
history dot bash history is there dot
bash underscore session is there these
are all the hidden files with the dot
extension now generally we set our Java
home environment variable in the dot
Bash underscore profile file but for the
first time if you don't see this file in
this list then you just need to create
this file so if this file is not present
don't worry you just can just create
this file which is dot bash underscore
profile so we are going to just create
this file I am going to clear the
terminal and I'm in the same directory
right so I'm going to just write touch
and touch is used to create files right
and I'm going to create this file dot
hash underscore profile okay we just
need to create this file and then press
Enter it is going to create this file we
can just do LS - al once again and now
you can see this dot bash underscore
profile is created right now inside this
dot underscore profile we just need to
export the Java variable right so what
you need to do is you can just open this
dot profile bash profile in an editor so
you can just write open - e to open this
file in our editor and then just write a
bash underscore profile and then press
Enter it is going to open this dot bash
while in an editor right and you just
need to give this command here which is
export Java underscore home all in you
know capital so Java underscore home is
in capital and then is equal to then the
dollar symbol and then in the brackets
you just need to give power slash user
power /lib e XE c four slash Java
underscore home in smaller and then
close your blanket okay so you just need
to do this in order to set your java
variable I will just paste this text in
the description also so that you can
just copy this and just paste it in your
dot a bash underscore profile file ok so
just get this come on and then save it
so I'm going to just save it you can
save it from here also just go to file
and click save and then close this file
ok and now you just need to close the
terminal also once again and I'm going
to minimize this and once again I'm
going to open the terminal so I'm going
to first of all quit this terminal so
I'm going to just quit so this is the
old terminal on which I was working I am
going to open the new terminal in order
to see the changes right so just open
the new terminal and now I'm going to
just give the same command echo and then
dollar Java underscore ok and then press
ENTER and now you can see this location
which is the location for your Java home
environment variable which is site
automatically by that command which we
have pasted in our bash underscore
profile file so now the Java JDK
and GRE is fully installed on your
system with this Java home environment
variable I hope you've enjoyed this
