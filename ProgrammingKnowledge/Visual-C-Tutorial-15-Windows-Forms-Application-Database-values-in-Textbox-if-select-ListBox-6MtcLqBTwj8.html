I have shown you how to link a list box
with your database and show the database
value into this list box today I am
going to show you how to show the
corresponding value of your database
when you click something like for
example you click John here the
corresponding values of John that is
employee ID 1 first name John last name
Bell and age 27 should appear here just
like we have done in the case of combo
box so when we select a name the
corresponding value will come into your
text fields so I want to do the same
with my list box also so let's see for
for that what we have to do so go to
your design select your list box and
when you double click it you will go to
the method or the probe function of that
list box selected index change event and
in here you need to write a connection
first so I am just going to the combo
box selected index change method which I
have shown you in the video number 13
and I will just
copy all this code from there which is
inside that function and paste it into
my list box one selected index change so
if you don't know this code just follow
the video number thirteen and we will
know how to do this so I'm just grabbing
my code from video number thirty and
just listing it inside the list box
selected in this change and then once
again I will go to my design form and I
will just select list box and in the
property I mean just copy the name of my
list box which is list box one and once
again I will go to my source of list box
one selected index and in the case of
combo box I have made a variable called
combo value which takes the value from
the combo box into the string so in this
case I will I'm taking the value from
the list box so I will replace this
combo box one by list box one and I will
change this variable name also list box
value
and I will copy this string variable and
paste it here select from database dot
table where name is equal to this
variable name this code which I have
shown in the thirteenth video how to
take them and you from the list box take
the value from the combo box and show in
to the text boxes so we are not done yet
because I will show you what is the
problem
Oh
so
you can see that when you click this
thing nothing is appearing here because
we need to select only one column from
here so right now what it's doing is
it's selecting whole text 1 comma John
come on this into your variable this one
list box value and we don't want that we
only want the name to come into this
list box value variable so what we do is
we will go to our fill combo method
which I have shown you in the 12th video
and in the last video I have shown you
how to populate it so in this line list
box arrow pointer item and a pointer add
you need to delete all the things from
here except for the name variable so it
will only populate name into your list
box so only this variable we are taking
to Country consideration which is taking
the name column and placing in it into
your name variable which we are
populating in our list box so I think
this will work now and let's see program
is working or not so to enter the
password yes and now only the names are
showing from the database
just this John John Jack Jill so it's
the same names here and here and when
you click some name here corresponding
value will come here so you can check
these value also one John bal-27 1 John
BAM
27 you can select some other name and it
will come corresponding values will come
into your text box so in this way you
can transfer your database value
corresponding to the list box index
selected so I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
