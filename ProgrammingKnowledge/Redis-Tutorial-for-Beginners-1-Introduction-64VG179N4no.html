Redis tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to give you a brief
introduction about Redis so first of all
what is Redis so rediff is an
open-source BSD licensed advanced
in-memory key value store where keys can
contain data structures such as strings
hashes lists sets and sorted sets so
it's an in-memory key value store with
persistence that means radius can be
used as a database or a caching layer or
a message broker now I already said that
it's BSD license
that means it's open source now rediff
is written in three and it's no SQL
database now what is no SQL no SQL is an
informal loosely defined term for
non-relational structured data storage
systems like MongoDB man cached CouchDB
or Cassandra
so following in the footsteps of other
no SQL databases such as Cassandra
CouchDB or MongoDB Redis allows the user
to store vast amount of data they doubt
the limits of relational databases so in
no SQL databases data can be stored in
non-relational way now what does the
name Redis mean ready stands for remote
directory server it is often referred to
as a data structure server since the
keys can contain strings hashes lists
sets and sorted sets so because the keys
can contains these type of different
data structures it's often referred as a
data structure server right so the name
come from remote directory server now
what is right is used for so as I
already mentioned that it's an advanced
key value store that can function as a
no SQL database or
memory cache stored to improve
performance when solving data that is
stored in system memory and also it can
be used as a message broker so it can be
used in place of caching systems such as
man cached now you must be wondering how
to interact with Radice so Redis can be
installed on a server and it can be
interacted with a command-line tool or
command-line interface which is called
rediff CLI
so using this Redis CLI we can interact
with our Redis server now this Redis
client can be used on any machine and
then when we open this Redis client
which is a command-line client the first
line will look like this so Redis then
this kind of angle bracket this we will
see in the coming videos how to install
Redis and how we can use Redis now let's
talk about some of the history about
Redis so in early 2009 our developer
called Salvatore Sanfilippo he was an
Italian developer by the way started the
raddest project at that time he was
working on a real-time web analytics
solution and found that MySQL could not
provide the necessary performance so in
June 2009 Redis was deployed in
production for a website called log comm
which was our real-time web analytics
website then in March 2010 a company
called VMware hired Sanfilippo to work
full-time on dradis although reddit
remains as BSD licensed subsequently
vmware hired some of the other
developers who also contributed majorly
to assist on the project so this was a
brief introduction about Redis and from
the next video we will see how we can
install Redis and how to use Redis so
