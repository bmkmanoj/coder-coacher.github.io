the second part of the email sending
tutorial why a Gmail SMTP server so in
the last with you you have written this
code and we will go further in this
video I noticed one error in the
previous video I have made in the second
line I have written SMTP gmail dot GOM
which should be gmail.com so I noticed
that I have done this spelling mistake
here so just correct this spelling and
after that you have to write session
this is a new session we are starting
and session dot get default instance and
in here automatically comes props which
is this variable name and after this you
will write a comma and you will
complete your semicolon and just give a
little bit space after this comma and
this code because we are going to write
a long line here so write new Java X dot
Maebh dot Authenticator and this code
automatically comes and in this brackets
you have to write protected
pass would authentication
get password authentication in you and
will end the bracket and make new
semicolon this all code you are writing
inside this session only so don't be
confused and go here and in this you
have to write
sorry so here you write put a new
password authentication and here you
will write your email ID
for example whatever is your email id X
Y that at the rate of gmail.com so you
write your email id and here you write
your password
semicolon
so let's see what is the error error is
here written written java.net so I have
to write i need this code and here also
like this only so write this this is a
one session which starts from here and
ends here
in between you have to write here don't
be confused just write this this is your
actual gmail ID and this is your actual
password which are you are using for
your Gmail and then after this session
closes you have to write our try-catch
block try so if I try cash box
exception B
exception
and right the option bail and you will
show the message and in the PI block now
you will write your message so we'll
write a message message variable is
equal to mine
my message and in here right session
so
I think this should be in small and this
session is this so I have to correct
this spelling I see SSI oh and okay and
what is this cannot find the symbol so I
think it must be at stripe once again I
a mine so this is
ting oh I forgot
yeah so this is the session we are
calling in this message so don't forget
that this session vehicle engine and in
the next line you will write message dot
set prom and in small brackets you might
new Internet
internet endless and string address so
in here you write this and here you will
provide your email ID which you have
written here of whatever name you want
to write so from your email ID you with
me and then you will write message dot
set recipient so you can write set
recipient and message the recipient dot
- comes automatically and in place of
null we will write in term it
Internet address and after that white
dot pass in place update you will write
the email ID of the recipient to whom
you are writing your mails you have to
write your is email ID for example heavy
ideas ABC and the rate of gmail.com and
what is the error let's see okay let's
check so I think I am done mistake here
set recipents and a little s here and
this is the email ID to move your
sending a message now quickly set your
subject subject your subject maybe I
this is me this can be your subject and
then you will write the content of the
message message dot set text and you can
write your message content
like this whatever you want right and
then you will send your message transfer
not per dot notes transference
Jones
sorry transport
transport
all those protein states transport dots
send your message so this line will send
your message this is your message
variable and which we are calling it
here and after your message is sent you
definitely want to show some message
that your messages send so just write J
option pain dot show message dialog and
here you can write message sent so you
know that your message is already sent
now let's try and run this program
I will change this email id to my email
id and here also and I will add other
recipients email id you should do that
in order to run the program so I have
changed the email ID and password and I
have written my email ID and password
and I already added the recipients email
ID and now let's try and run the program
I have already ran the program and I am
when I click this button my message send
message should come so I know that my
message is successfully sent so I am
clicking it and
my message is sent so I know that my
message is sent so this is the
confirmation that my message is
successfully sent so in this way you can
send a message from your gmail ID to any
email ID and you can use this code into
your project I hope this will help and
you know for the assignments and please
