video I will show you how to make the
installer for your NetBeans Java project
so first step you need to do is after
making your D is T on Java file for your
project you need to go to your folder or
your source project where your source
file and newly generated the ast folder
and build folder is situated and what
you need to do now is whatever picture
or report you have used in your project
which are there in your folder for
example I have used I text for my
reporting and I have taken the picture
from here so whatever pictures or the
other files you have taken or you in
used in your project just copy them and
paste them into your D is d folder
because they require the location and
this location if it's present in your D
is T folder then it will take that
location automatically so just do that
and then
go to your browser and I have salt for
the software which is free and with the
help of that you can make the
installation file for your project so
just go there in the google search and
write install creator and the first
option click theme install create
creator just click it and you will go to
its side so this is this have installed
creator has two versions one is a
freeware and other is a purchase or the
license version so we want to download
this freeware version which is free to
use I will click it and my file will be
saved
this is my file and I will install it
into my system so I we click and then
and next next unregistered version next
if you agree with their condition then
click I agree and then next and next yes
and your installer is created and ready
to use now so in the next video I will
show you how you can make or you can
make the installer file with the help of
this install creator so watch the next
video and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
