video I will show you how to use
checkboxes radio buttons and group boxes
with your visual basic windows form
application so let's get started first
of all I will go to my tool box and I
will drag and drop a group box and I
will take two group boxes here to
demonstrate checkboxes and radio buttons
so what I will do is I will in the first
group box I will drag and drop two check
boxes and in the second group box two
which is group box two
I will drag and drop two radio buttons
okay so a group is a container in which
you can group your tools so for example
when I run the program and when I check
this these check boxes you can notice
that I can check both of them at the
same time and when I check radio button
and when I check one radio button and
when I am going to check the other radio
button you see that when the radio
button is in a group we can only check
one radio button at a time right so this
is the basic difference in check box and
radio buttons check boxes you can
generally check multiple checkboxes in a
group and you can check only one radio
button at a time in a group box and by
the name itself
also suggest that check boxes we use for
multiple checking right and radio button
are generally use for one in multiple
options so that said and done
now let's see how we can use them so
first of all this first group box for
example I want to show the age so I will
change the title of this group box and I
will say check box one under 15 check
box to text is under 25 and let me take
one more check box
so the third check box will when I check
it it shows the age on or over 25 I will
say over 25 okay
so I have these three check boxes right
and for example I will add a button also
which says show age so when I press this
button whatever check box is checked it
will show the age so I'll say show age
button and now I will select this button
and double click it and in here I will
give three conditions the three
conditions are like this so check box -
and let's see the name of these check
boxes so check box one second check
boxes check box - and third check boxes
check box three okay so now
we have three conditions here if we
write if checkbook 1s checks then I will
show the message that age is under 15 if
my checkbox - is checked then I will say
the age is under 25 and the third
checkbox is checked if then I will say
age is over 25 so when I run the program
and I check one of these buttons you see
the message ages is under 2015 and age
is under 25 and age is over 25 okay now
if you notice that when I check these
multiple buttons it will only show this
first of the age and not other ages so
to make this more flexible what we can
do is we can write this kind of code we
will just use if and health condition
like this so just let me complete the
code and then I will show you so now we
have the condition like this if first
checkbox is checked then this message
will be shown and this condition is
finished here if second text box is
checked then this condition will be true
and this message will be shown and
accordingly the third message and now
when we run the program
and when we check all these three
options we see age is under 15 edge is
under 25 and age is over 25 so in this
way you can use checkboxes and in the
same way you can also use radio buttons
by using this button but one other way
is just select your radio button this is
also true for checkboxes and double
click it and you can say that when radio
button is checked or when it's changed
then you can change something so for
example button 1 dot enabled is equal to
or radio button radio button 1 dot
checked ok so when you give this
condition then and run your program and
when you click this button and when you
see this it's disabled because my radio
button is unchecked and when I check
this button it's enabled right disabled
and enabled or you can declare a global
variable like this dim or your name
where has whatever integer or message
you want to show
integer and this variable you can use it
here when radio button 1 is changed or
checked and then you can say variable is
equal to 15
right so you can use it like this also
and there are other properties also for
example the select a radio button
you can choose whether it should be
checked true or false for example I J
may mark it true you see here it's
checked and there are other properties
which you can play with and see what
happens when you change these properties
ok so I hope you have understand the
basic use of these checkboxes and radio
buttons and I hope you have enjoyed this
