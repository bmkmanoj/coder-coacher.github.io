show you what are cookies and how to set
cookies in PHP so let's see what is a
cookie so a cookie is often used to
identify a user okay a cookie is a small
file that the server embeds
on your computer the server it can be
your website or some website which you
are browsing and this website embeds
some small file inside your computer or
in a particular browser and this file
will remain in your computer and this
each time whenever your computer
requests the same page it will send the
cookie to write so for example there you
you browse some website and it sets some
cookie inside your computer inside a
particular browser it will remain in
that browser until and unless that wood
cookie expire and that expiration time
can be months weeks or year even right
and how cookies are different from
session is whenever you use session well
it will last for only for that session
that means whenever you use the session
and you whenever you close your browser
your session will also be destroyed so
session will not remain for the long
time in your browser or you in your
computer it will go once you close your
browser but a cookie can remain in your
computer for a long time or a time at
which its you know set to destroyed it
can be one year it can be one month it
can be one day so you can set the
expiration time of the cookie whereas
you cannot set the expiration time of
your session it is destroyed whenever
you close your session right now let's
see how we can set cookies in PHP so I
have this cookie dot PHP file and let's
see how we can set cookies so this is a
small method called set cookie we use to
set the cookie inside your browser and
it takes five arguments first is the
name of the cookie second is the value
of the cookie third is the expiration
time of the cookie and fourth is the
path and fifth is the domain name and
for this demonstration I will just use
these three parameter you can also use
the setcookie function with these
parameters also okay now for example I
want to set some cookie for the student
for example so I will give the cookie
name as student okay and the value is
for example name of the student which is
mark okay and third parameter it's
interesting is the expiration time okay
and how you can set expiration time it
takes the second or number of second
from the reference of the time now right
so in PHP there is a function called
time so for example I declare variable
time is equal to and there is a function
called time also and this time gives you
the time stamp so let's echo the time
echo the time and what this time is I
will save it and
we go and browse here cookie and see
this time here so it's giving us this
one four seven five three five four
whatever so this is a time stamp and
what is a time stamp a time stamp you
can say is a it's called a POC time if
you know about a POC time its reference
is nineteen seventy right and and it
calculates the relative seconds from
1972 till now and this is the value of
seconds from that date so reference for
the a POC time is 1970 I think and this
value is the number of seconds from that
date in 1970 whatever is the reference
okay so in general we use it as a
standard time stamp anywhere in PHP or
any in any other languages right so in
PHP you can just display the Stein's
stem like this using time function so if
you want to know about this this time
stamp you just search for epoch date and
time just search for epochs date and
time and you will be able to you know
see many links on web by using which you
may know about this
a by a pump date and time right so you
you can see a for converter and if a
pork reference date in Wikipedia you can
see here what can be the reference date
okay so I will leave it on you how to
know about this epoch Diamond time right
so just remember that this time is the
time from epoch left
date which is nineteen seventy I think
okay now to set the expiry date this is
the time now right this will give you
the time now okay
time stem now and now you need to use
this time and set the reference
according to the time or relative to
this time and this code parameter takes
the X pi the you know expired time so
this is the time now and you can set
that you want to destroy the cookie
after five seconds for example or 10
seconds right so this cookie will remain
in your computer for 10 seconds from the
from whenever you open this page right
okay now how to you know display or use
cookies he'd be here is the setting of
the cookie right and how to use this you
can use this by for example you can
declare student is equal to then you can
just use this underscore cookie okay and
in here you can give the name of your
cookie and the name of the cookie is
student here right and then you can
display this cookie if I can just say
echo student okay I save it and I will
go to my browser and then first of all I
will set the cookie by using this cookie
dot PHP so this will set my cookie as
like this so set cookie name is equal to
student value is equal to mark and this
cookie will
remain for 10 second in my browser right
so I can quickly go to view and now
cooky is destroyed because 10 seconds
are over once again let's check it once
again ok i refresh this I set cookie go
back and view there is some mistake in
here let's see what is it oh yeah here I
have two single goats
so I corrected it once again let's see
so refresh set cookie cookie is set and
now when I view I can see the name for
10 second so i refresh the browser
refresh the browser refresh the browser
and after 10 second key is destroyed
right
once again site cookie and go to view
dot PHP I can see the name and i refresh
the browser until 10 second and after 10
second I will see the result like this
that says cookie is destroyed ok so in
this way you can set cookie and set the
expiry time of this cookie so that
whatever time you want to set you can
set it like this so I hope you have
