tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I'm going to
show you how to use variables in Python
so I'm assuming that you don't have any
prior programming knowledge so I'm going
to tell you the basics of variables
first so basically what is a variable
variable is a container for some value
this value can be an integer
if this value can be a string of words
this K value can be a float value or
different kind of values so what is a
variable variable is a container for the
values so for example how you can
declare variable in Python first of all
you need to give a name of the variable
so for example I can declare a name of a
variable like my variable is equal to
and this is equal to sign you use
between the value and the name of the
variable okay so this is the name of the
valuable is equal to you can assign some
value to the variable for example 30 now
my variable has the value of 30 so my
variable is a container for the value 30
right and generally it's the convention
that whenever you use or declare a
variable it's not necessary but it's a
good programming habit that you separate
your variable name if you have something
like my variable the first word of your
variable name start from small letter
and then the second word first letter
starts from big or capital case and the
other letters are small and
this way it will work like for example I
want to give the variable name my
variable name it will be like this okay
so it it's like camel case it's called a
camel case declaration so start with
small letter and then the second letter
second word first letter is the capital
third word first letter is the capital
just like this okay so just follow the
convention like this it's not necessary
but it's good now when I press ENTER now
my variable has the value of 30 so once
again when I call my variable and press
Enter
it gives me 30 because my variable is
equal to 30 now now python is a case
sensitive language so if you write my
with a capital m variable and press
Enter
it will give you an error because this
variable name is different from this
variable name because this is case
sensitive so just remember this okay
so these are the two things now why we
exactly use variable in any programming
language so variables are generally used
whenever you don't know what values you
are going to deal with so for example
you are going to deal with some values
which are inputted by the users now
first of all this variable you can use
it as for example for adding something
so I can just call
my variable + 4 + 44 and it will give me
the result yeah this is you see I
haven't spelled this my valuable correct
so it gives me an error okay so my
variable plus 24 and it gives me 64 okay
so now you can perform math operation
using this variable also okay
now the real use of this variable you
can you can perform every math operation
on this variable because it has some
value which is an integer right so you
can do variable to the power or exponent
3 give the answer and in the same way it
will give you an answer for every math
operation now the real news let's see
some use for variable so for example I
declare a variable called value okay and
this value is equal to whatever user
inputs from the user so how you can
provide a user input in fight you just
use the inbuilt function called in put
so this is the in volt function in
Python which will allow you to enter any
value so you can just write and the
value but there is a problem with this
that this input whatever user enters
will be a string okay so let me give you
an example when I press enter now it
gives me the prompt that enter the value
and I can enter any value for example
two key and press n
and now this value which is a variable
value has the value of 50 so whenever I
call a value it has the value of 50 but
notice this value is a string it's
between dump this single goats
so whenever I want to perform some
addition so value plus something 20 that
will give me an error seeing it give me
an error why it's giving me an error
because this value which is 50 is a
string because whenever we use input
function for input value it takes this
value as a string okay and whenever you
see something in single code that means
it's a string
whenever you have the single quotes
around your value it's a string okay now
in order to convert your string to an
integer you can cast the string so I'm
going to just copy this just you can
just pop it in this and paste this here
and in order to cast this value to an
integer what you do just go before your
input so value is equal to just write
int so this is typecasting of string to
the integer okay and just close it from
them okay
so when you do this this will be your
string so input will be taken as a
string and this int will convert your
string to the integer okay and now when
you press ENTER and you give some value
for example 60 values equal to 60 and
now you call value not value but value
it has the value of 60 m notice that
earlier this 50 is enclosed in single
quotes but this time it's not enclosed
in single quotes that means it's number
right now I can perform some math
operation on this like this value plus
50 x 60 something that will not give me
an error this time so always remember
whenever you want an integer as an input
you need to cast this into the integer
and casting means to convert your string
to the integer you can cast this to the
float value like this for example you
can just copy just once again paste it
here and you can cast this like float so
the float is a decimal point value okay
so you can cast your value as a float
and now when you enter you can just
write 50 point 1 3 4 whatever and then
call value and it has the value of 50
point whatever okay so variables are
useful whenever you don't know what
values you are going to deal with okay
so that's all about variables I hope you
