show you how to make a program for
Fibonacci series so first of all let's
see what is the outcome of our program
so first of all program will ask you
something and the value of number so
whatever number you want to enter for
example you want to enter 10 and it will
show the buggy series until 10 additions
so when you press ENTER it'll show see
your number 1 is 1 number 2 is 2 and
then 1 plus 1 is 2 1 plus 2 is 3 2 plus
3 is 5 3 plus 5 is 8 8 plus 5 is 13 and
so on so it will show like that
and once again it will ask the user if
you want to continue you should press Y
or if you want to exit your program and
you should enter any other key other
than Y Capital y so if I want to
continue press Y ask once again into 5
it will show addition up to 5 in this
time I want to exit so this H any other
number or any other character or wy
capital X it
so let's get started first of all as
always include you know I'm a stream and
using namespace STD standard fire and
then inter main bracket void this is
your main function and then we take
variable int a is equal to 0 which is
the first number of the Bernanke series
which is 0 B is equal to 1 which is the
second number of her felony series and C
is the other variable which we are going
to use in addition to take the result I
is we are using for the for loop and n
is the number which we which we ask the
user to enter up to which number you
want to calculate the prevalently series
so these five variable you need to
create and then can we do this variable
we have declared in order when our
program is webinar series is shown you
will have seen that it will ask that do
you want to exit or press Y or Capital y
to continue so it will ask this variable
is for that so we can do while loop this
is do-while loop right do create a back
bracket and in below yeah I am fine so
one do one loop you have to write this C
out enter Y or capital y to continue and
then you know input the Rideau character
and change the line close the bracket of
this in this
and in a while you might redo it will do
small bio capital by then it will ask
you once again to continue so after do
you write is equal to 0 and B is equal
to 0 because these are or to initial
numbers and then will ask the user to
enter the window and until which value
you want to see the webinar series
so CIN and input end and if C if n is
greater than 100 we will output under
some lesser value because above hundred
it will cross our storage value so it
will be not it will be a big number so
we boom one that in the else condition
first of all print your first number
which is a which is zero I can also
right yeah
this see a number zero is equal to 8
which is our first number and then make
a for loop I is equal to 0 is less than
or equal to n and I plus plus and in the
bracket right C is equal to a plus B so
it will add a plus B and store it in C
then we will transfer the value of B
into a and we will transfer the value of
C into B so once again we have C as I'm
empty variable once again in the low
when I is equal to 1 it does it'll add 1
plus 1 is equal to 2 and it will
transfer into this and then we will be
we do its value a and C will give its
value to be so in such a way thing and
this for loop will have an and print the
value whatever is the value of I it'll
print
see out always a so the value a after
adding and then close your bar loop and
then close our and slope also which we
have made and do-while loop so these
things we are closed and this we have
already discussed above and the night
system pause and return 0 return 0
because we have declared our main
program L end so return 0 we have to
return something and then close your
main program
once again you tell them I lose ten and
when I press ENTER button it will show
all the numbers see the number zero is
equal to zero
see you don't know 1 is equal to 1 2 3
till 10 additions so it will always show
11th number one more than this number
because these are the addition and then
program will ask do you want to continue
if you want to continue y66 values then
this time I don't want to continue so I
will something this is the C++ program
