node.js to troll for beginners and in
this video I'm going to show you how we
can use filesystem module in node.js
which is a built-in module now node
implements file i/o using simple wrapper
around the standard POSIX functions and
this is done using node file system
module or simply FS module in no js' now
let's see first of all how we can add FS
module so just write var FS is equal to
require and then you just add FS ok and
this is how you can add FS module now
this FS module you can use for various
input/output functions related to file
system in this video particularly we are
going to real see how we can use this FS
module to read and write to a file
synchronously and asynchronously right
so first of all we will use this file to
read from a file synchronously but for
that we need a file txt file which we
can read so I'm going to create a text
file for example I will name it as test
dot txt and in this text file I'm going
to write some things and let's you know
copy and paste this line ok so this is
what we want to read from our file
system object which we have you know
created using this file system module so
for reading this file synchronously what
we can do is we can just use file and
first of all we need to assign this
output which we read so we can just
write to our
and then we can just say red string is
equal to FS dot read file sync ok so
just write read file sync and this
method will allow us to read our files
synchronously okay and then give the
name of your file and because this file
is in the same folder you just need to
give the name of the file not the part
because it's in the same folder so just
write test dot txt and the second
argument which we want to pass here will
be the encoding type so just write for
example utf-8 and now let's try to print
whatever we have you know read from the
file to the console so just write
console dot log and we will just print
this string here what ever we have read
so it should be red string and then we
are going to run it so open your
terminal and just run it using node app
dot J's and you can see our file is red
so our file content let's see what was
the file content and what the terminal
is showing right so same content as the
file so this file system module enables
us to read the file synchronously and if
you want to write this file to another
file or write the content of the file
which you have read to another file new
file for example what we can do so we
can just write FS dot right file sync so
just write right file
sink and then just pass this result to
the argument okay
so right right file sink can be used to
write to the file synchronously right
and this file right file method takes
two arguments the first will be the name
of your file so let's create the name
for example test to dot txt
and the second argument is the content
itself right and let's run our code and
let's see what happens this time so just
see here what happens here whenever we
will run this code and you can see this
text too is created when we run the code
and the content of text too is same as
test1 dot txt or test dot txt right so
in this way you can use this to read and
write to the file synchronously now FS
mode you'll also have the async method
and this will allow us to read or write
to a file asynchronously right so this
for this we just need to use the method
called file name without sync so by
default if you know about node.js
node.js is a asynchronous you know
program so whenever you write the
program it runs asynchronously and what
I mean by asynchronous is I'm going to
show you in just a second so just write
this once again we want to read the
content of test a txt file and just call
a method read file and the first
argument will be the same and the second
argument we want to pass here
is the callback method well let's say we
can do it in the last argument also
right so just write function and then
just say error as a force argument and
data as the second argument okay and
then give a curly bracket here and press
ENTER and in here for example if there
is some problem in reading we want to
return error so just call this argument
first argument which we have passed in
the callback function which is this one
and then we can console era right so
just write return console dot error and
then pass this error here as an argument
okay otherwise if there is no error in
reading we can just console.log the
content so instead of console.log
outside the you know read file method we
can just you know call it inside or call
back okay something like this and this
argument which it takes now is data
because data will contain your content
of your file which you have read okay
for now let's remove this line of code
and in here we will just call
console.log and let's say we just want
to print the pile is red for example
okay and let's run the code once again
and let's see what happens so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to run the
program once again or code once again
and you can see the output here it's a
little bit different from earlier that
first of all
terminal prints or this program prints
the file is Redis which is this line and
then it trends all the content of the
file which was there inside the file so
this is done in a synchronous manner
right so what's happening here is
node.js starts the server for example
and this method is reading the file if
the file is for example very big so what
happens then so you want to you know in
a real-life situation when you are
dealing with real data you need to do
your stuff a synchronously right because
otherwise your code will block this you
know running of your server and other
things cannot happens if one process or
one you know file reading is taking very
long time but this way of you know
executing your code asynchronously will
help you to you know run you know your
code you know very good manner because
your code is not waiting for the reading
of your file but it's executing the next
step and the next step once again if
there will be some more you know useful
code below this also then it's going to
execute it and once the file is read
it's going to print the content of the
file using this console log so the
callback function this function is
called callback function and it is
triggered whenever the you know file is
read completely right so this is how
asynchronous you know way of reading
file works okay in the same way you can
write to the file asynchronously also
and you just need to you know call FS
dot right file and then the you know
name of the file within which you want
to write to so let's do that and let's
see what happens so FS dot right while
and the first argument will be this
argument the second argument would be
the content which we want to write for
example we want to write this data which
we are reading from the first file for
example and the third argument will be
the same as we have done here the
callback right so you can just copy this
much amount of code before the bracket
and then pass it here and we can just
add the semicolon here okay and this is
just checking whether your file is
written and if it's not written it's
going to you know console.log the error
and if it's written then we can say
success for example we can just print
success right something like this and
when you run your code once again it's
going to write it so let's run it and
program is done and at last it print
success and you can see the file is also
created text dot txt right so in this
way you can use FS module in node.js
there is more you know functionality in
this FS module which you can find on the
node.js sites or go to node.js dot o-r-g
slash api /fs dot HTML and in here you
can go here file system or you will be
able to you know find more method
related to this FS module here and there
are so many method which you
and use sojust or go through this
documentation and then you will be good
to go so I hope you have enjoyed this
