last video I have shown you how to
connect your QT GUI application with the
SQLite database so the connection with
the database I have shown you in the
last video in this video I will show you
how to make a simple login application
with the help of your database which is
SQLite database and your QT application
so first of all I want to show my
database to you which is like this so I
have a database name called database
called database DB and in that database
I have one table called employee info
and I have 6 column in this database one
is employee ID e ID name surname age and
user name and password I have these 6
columns in there so if you don't know
how to make SQLite database you can just
go to my channel and you can search for
the SQLite video tutorial for the
beginners and you will be good to go so
now let's get on with the program I have
this main form and here in the last
video I have taken a label and I named
it as status so in this label I am going
to show the status what is the status if
the username and password is correct or
not or whatever the status is now I will
go to this layout section and I will
search for first of all a group box I
will drag and drop on group box and in
this group box I am going to place some
labels so this group box I will name it
as sinus so just double click this group
box label and I write here
sign in okay and just go to your palate
once again and search for labels here so
this go to display widget and drag and
drop two labels one is for username and
one is for for password okay and this
label I will change its text as user
name and second name and label password
so I have taken two labels and now I
will take two line edits so go to input
widget and take this line widget from
here one line widget or line added and
second line added I will just change the
name of these line edits first is for
username so I will select this line edit
and go here to the properties and I will
change this name as line edit underscore
username and the second line added I
will select second in line at it and I
will name it as line at it underscore
password okay just do that and if you
want you can align these line edit and
label as like this so select this
username label and this username line
label line add it and just click this
layout horizontally so they will be laid
out horizontally same is for you
password just select them and layout
horizontally okay now it looks better
now I will take a button so big for
login button so I will drag and drop
this push button and I will change it
text as login and I will right click
this button and I will say go to slot
and I will select click and click ok and
in here in the last video I have shown
you this code in which I have written
the code to connect to the database in
this code I am going to change one line
of code which is this declaration of cue
sqli SQL database my DB so what I will
do is I will copy this cue SQL database
and my variable name and I will delete
this cue SQL database from here keep
this my DB as it is so this code if you
don't know I have shown you in the last
video so just copy this and go to your
header file for your project so in my
case login dot H and go below where your
UI double colon login pointer UI is
there in the private and here I will
declare this cue SQL database my DB so
it will be seen by my push button event
also so just change the program a little
so if you have watched the last video
just you need to change this okay now
once again to the UI once again go to
slot and click and this is my login
button
push button click event so in here I
will write or declare a string called
cue string first is user name second is
password password should be like this
and I will assign this username and
password
- so username is equal to UI underscore
my line added name for username so line
added user name underscore text same I
will do for the password password is
equal to UI line added password and
text
okay so just do that and in the next
line I will write the code to check
whether my database is still open or not
so I will write F not this but this if
my my DB variable which is my Q SQL
database variable copy this my DB
variable and just give is not equal to
sign before that and write my DB dot is
open so if my database is not open then
I will show the message queue
q debug which is starting from small q
bracket and bracket close and give this
sign and I will show the message which
is failed to open the database okay and
I will just return after this code we
are going to write the query so write Q
SQL query and give it a variable named Q
or Y for example and we will provide a
condition call F so if my query dot
