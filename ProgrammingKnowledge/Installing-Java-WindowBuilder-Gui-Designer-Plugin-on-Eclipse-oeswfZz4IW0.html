show you how you can install a window
builder plug-in in your Eclipse IDE it's
also called GUI plug-in and this cui
plug-in enables you to develop your Java
GUI applications in Eclipse so let's see
how we can install this window builder
plugin so fire up your Eclipse and go to
the help tab here and then go to install
new software and in here in the work
with space here you need to click this
combo box here this one it'll give you
some options and what we want to choose
here is HTTP colon slash slash download
dot eclipse.org e it will be there also
in your Eclipse also slash release slash
I have the latest version which is Luna
but if you have some other version it
will show you that version of Eclipse
for example Juno or Kepler so just
select this option which says HTTP slash
download dot eclipse.org e / literally
release slash whatever version of
Eclipse you have I have Luna so I will
select this Luna ok
and this will give you some options here
what option we are interested in is
called general purpose tool this one ok
so just select this general purpose tool
and then search for so go down a little
in here we are searching for swing
designer so everything which is under
this sweet swing design or below this
swing designer you need to check this so
there's a swing designer and I will
check all the option below swing
designer up to the end of window builder
okay
all these things windowbuilder
so all these option which says
windowbuilder or spring designer you
need to check okay window builder and
swing designer okay and once you are
selected all these options related to
Windows builder and swing designer what
you need to do you need to just click
this next button it will calculate the
requirement and dependencies it will
give you this list here and you can
review your items once again and click
Next and this is the license terms and
condition you say I accept terms of
license agreement and click finish
and then the installation of software
will start
so it'll take some time depending upon
the speed of your internet and the
selection of your files so if you have
selected more files or more software to
install it will take more time and let's
see how much time it takes here if it
will take more time I will just pause
the video and restart it once its
installed
so I think I will pause the video once
it these is this installation is
complete and then I will continue with
this video okay
or it's already finishing yes it's
finished okay so it says you will need
to restart eclipse for the changes to
take effect what do you like to restart
so I will say yes I want to restart and
to restart my Eclipse
you see I have Eclipse Luna installed
which is the latest version at the time
of making this video
and we'll load all of your plugin you
have installed
and now eclipse has started okay so once
you have successfully installed at these
window Blake bender plug-in and swing
designer plugin you can develop project
using these window builder and swing
designer so how you can create a new
project using these windowbuilder just
go to file new Java project
and in here you will be able to see the
options to make the Java project but I
think I should go to new and in here you
should go to others here right so go to
new and then it will show the options
others so go to others or other and in
here
search for window builder so this is the
window builder and in here search for
swing designer and select application
window ok so go to window builder swing
designer and select this application
window here ok and click Next and now
you just need to give the part or give
the part to your or give the name to
your project I will give the name to my
project as
hello world project and for example I
want to change this location of the
folder I can choose the location right
now I already have this project hello
world here so I will not change the
default location but yeah I can do it
with and it says type the name with same
name but different case exists so I will
say
hello world
class for example and this is the use of
default package is discouraged I will go
and finish this
and now I will have
this designer tool here
so it has generated me this code and
when I go to this design tab it we are
run right now in the source tab so when
we go in the design tab
we will be able to see the design view
of this code so this is what Eclipse
windowbuilder has generated for us it
will take some time to go into the
design of you for the first time
and you see we are in the design view
okay so this is the frame which you get
whenever you create a new window builder
project right you can drag and drop
these pallet tools from from this
palette to the to this frame so for
example I can drag and drop this J
button here in order to drag and drop
this J button I need to have this
absolute layout so this all I will show
in the next video but let's see what can
we do with this so for now I'm just
going to run the blank frame here and in
the later video I will show you how you
can design this frame with J button or
jtextfield or J radio button or other
tools which are there in this palette so
what I'm going to do is I will just run
this and you will be able to see this
frame which is blank right now but when
we design our frame with some buttons or
menus and all the other things this will
look really interactive and you will be
able to design your GUI with this window
builder tool so I hope you have enjoyed
this video please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
