show current date or time on your
NetBeans software jframe so let's get
started first you must think where you
have to show the date for example I want
to show the date on this menu bar so I
right click it it's not essential that
you should show the date on menu bar or
something you can drag a label also and
show the date in that also but I prefer
to show the date in say menu anybody so
I just right click the menu add menu and
just rename the menu and state date
and also change the variable name has
date
next
okay okay
then go to your source code and you need
to import to file import and just import
from the report
don't you dare not calendar
and
report Joe Newton thought
the golden calendar this to file import
first and then in program make a new
method public void an emitter current
date date
man third time tonight
Calendar
cow is it going to mean
oh yeah
okay Monday
click the spelling mistake okay
I'll write this then wait and month we
come to town not get
just click this and what do you want to
get
and almost the mistake in the span not
month
okay
and oh yeah and they also just focus a
man just copy form it all the year you
not hear from the
you need to write here D
what
day of month okay
now
just copy your date variable name date
text paste it here dot set text
and
and some text right here first of all
you if you want to show the year dl+
ch+
and I want to show the month month
last one you need to do month plus one
to show the actual month I don't know
why this is but you need to do this plus
slash plus day you need to do this
this is the current date form it and
just call the method in mean employee
info method maybe have already called
our connection file and update table
previously and call it here and let's
see if we get the date or not
yes we can see the year the month and
the date so in this way you can show the
date and if you also want to show the
name which we also want to show the time
just add another menu item give it a
name kind if variable name also text
time
in the sauce
just write the same thing for the time
also like we need second we need second
telling the dot second we need minutes
so calendar don't
OOP
and we need off
Oh
okay and just
copy base Delta in the blazer over the
minute pasted and the place off
minute
and second case of second and instead of
East lashes I think
this
Koen me look good so let's see
just one more thing our variable name is
next time yeah the text date and here we
want to show type in text time very more
manual to you just run the program you
can see the time is 0 23 minute 57
seconds in this way you can show the
date and time you can also make it a
little bit present a blue all right
thing here
neat
and here also at home just run it and it
looks good date and time that was a
