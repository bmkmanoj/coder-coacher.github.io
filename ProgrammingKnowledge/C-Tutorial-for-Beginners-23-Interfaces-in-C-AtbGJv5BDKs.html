show you what is interface and how to
use interface in c-sharp so let's see
what is interface an interface contains
definitions for a group of related
functionalities that at loss or a struck
can implement so in a way using
interfaces we can invoke functions from
different classes through the same
interface reference whereas using
virtual function we can invoke functions
from different classes in the same
interface hierarchy through the same
reference so let's see how we can define
interface in c-sharp and how we can use
interfaces in C shop so for the
definition of interface how to define
interface interface you can define with
a keyword interface and then the name of
the interface I just I always like to
declare the definition of the interface
or name of the interface by starting
with the capital I so that I know that
it's an interface and for example I want
to define an interface for meters okay
and then I just close my definition from
here using these curly braces okay and
so let's see what are the properties of
Internet
interface this is how you can define
interface but how we can use members in
interface let's see so the first thing
is for example I define in a in
interface will it work let's compile our
program and let's see if it's possible
or not so I will just run this or start
debugging this and I will see an error
there is error and I will say no and it
says interface cannot have fields that
means you cannot have fields like int a
or bool something bool X or double
double so you cannot have fields in
interface you can only have methods in
interface so let's define a method in
interface for example I want to define a
method called public public void print
so I have defined this method in
interface this should be public and then
also when I compile this let's see what
happens I run this and I will say no and
this time also I get an error so I
define a method and then also it gives
me an error and what it says the
modified public is not valid for this
item that means you cannot initialize
the member methods or members of
interface with a access modifier so you
just need to declare the method in the
interface like this okay and now when
you compile this over now when you run
it it will work fine okay now for
example you want to give any definition
to your method in the inside interface
can we do this for example I want to
print something console dot write line
and I want to print something here so I
will just write print
is it valid let's see we went on the
program and it says error and let what
say error interface member cannot have
definition so you can only define the
prototype of a method inside interface
and you cannot define the definition of
the method inside interface so interface
just contains the prototyping of method
of prototypes of method okay now how we
can use these interface so for example I
will define a class class meter and so
this loss at point and I will close
these curly braces and how we can use
this print method or how we can give the
definition of the print method we can
just inherit from interface so this me I
meter or this meter will inherit from
this interface like this so how to
define and inheritance of this interface
you can just write like this :
and then I meter okay and then you can
just give the definition of this method
and now let's see I have the same
prototype and the definition and here I
want to give some console line right
line
will it be valid let's see so for
example something I want to provide him
okay and when I run the program it still
shows me error why because it's saying
that this method does not have a
interface member definition so I have
told you that interface definition or
interface prototyping does not have
access specifier but when you provide
the definition to the interface method
you need to specify the specifier public
specifier or member burps pacifier and
by default all interface members are
public method okay to just remember this
by default all interface members are
public okay so just write public and
when I run this it will run fine okay
because I'm not using this class in my
main so it will not print anything but
it doesn't give me any error so that
means I'm on the right path so this is
how you can define the prototype of
interface and how you can inherit from
the interface and now you can just
define for example meter object meter m
et is equal to new meter
and I can use this object to print or to
use the print method okay you see I have
the access to this print method and I
can just print like this run the program
and it prints what ever I want to print
okay so this is how you can define
interfaces let's see if we have two
interfaces at the time interface I meet
the one and I meet the two for example
can I inherit from both of them in a
same class let's see if we can do it
meter interface 1 meter 1 comma meter 2
so yes I can inherit from multiple
interfaces in a same class ok now for
example this meter one has method print
1 and this meter 2 has method print 2 so
I can just define 2 method inside my
class print 1 and printer - and I can
say this is print meter 1 and the other
is print meter - okay
and so I can do multiple inheritance or
I can inherit from multiple interfaces
in a in my derived class and I can use
these method like this so in the using
the object I can print one I can use
print one and even print two also and
when I run the program both will run
fine print meter 1 print meter 2 so that
means I can inherit from multiple
interfaces but in the last video I think
or
in the earlier videos I have shown you
you cannot inherit from multiple base
classes in your derived class so if I
say that you you have some one more
class class meter some some class
okay can you inherit from this and this
in your example one let's see
meter comma second class okay it will
not be valid okay so you cannot inherit
from multiple base classes or multiple
classes but you can inherit from
multiple interfaces okay
so just remember this fact now the
question is can we define the object of
an interface so for example I will
delete this class from here which I have
used for the demonstration so for
example I want to create the object of
this meter one infant of this can I do
this let's see I meter one is equal to
Nu ID meter one okay so when I do this
as soon as I do this I get an error and
it so shows an error cannot create an
instance of abstract class or interface
okay so it's logical also because your
interface only contains definition but
the implementation when you create an
object and when you want to use this
print one you cannot find the
implementation or definition of this
print one only by using this I medium
right but what you can do is you can
create a reference to interface which
points to the object of your there I
class so you can do it like this I meet
a 1 and whatever you want to give the
name is equal to new meter this is at
last which is inherited from meter 1 and
here you have the definition of the
member method of this meter 1 also okay
so you can inhale you can create an
object which can point to the you can
create and reference which points to the
object of your derived class and you can
use the method like this also so Matt
dot you can see print 1 you can easily
find this print 1 and you can print it
okay but you cannot access print 2 here
right because print 2 is a part of meet
I meter to interface and it's not a part
of this I meter 1 okay so only print 1
is available for the use right and you
can do the same for the same for the
meter to object also a meter to
reference also you can use meter to I
mean T is equal to new meter but this
method will be print - because meter -
own loan only have the prototype on
print to and it will work fine here okay
now can we define same prototype in two
different interfaces for example I have
a meter one i meter - I want to have
only print method in meter one and meter
- also in both the method okay so this
method and this method are same in both
the interfaces and this meter is
inheriting from those
to interfaces and I delete this method
definition also so I have meter one
which has the member method print I also
have interface meter 2 which I have the
member method print 2 same method and I
inherit from those close to interfaces
in my meter class and I provide the
definition of this print so can I do
something like this so I can define
interface meter 1 I am
mat one and I will define interface for
meter to met to which points to the
object of this meter glass and can we
use this print in both cases match 1 dot
print and here met 2 dot print okay and
when you do it it's completely valid
when you run the program you will see
print meter 1 and print meter 1 2 times
right so you can have the same method
name in two interfaces and you can
define you can give a same or you can
define one definition for both the
method in your derived class and you can
use it like this also so this is how you
can define interfaces and this is some
of the rules how to use interfaces in
C++ so let's let's do some revision how
to define interfaces interfaces cannot
contain fields I have shown you it
cannot contain fields like in a or
double a or string or something it only
have methods of
then the second rule is interphase
member cannot have definition okay so
you cannot give the definition of the
method inside interphase
okay by default all interphase members
are public so you don't need to
explicitly define that it's a public
method right you see here we haven't
defining a public
it's just void print but when you define
the implementation of this method from
the interface you need to give the
public specifier of public modifier here
access modifier but beg your pardon
so you need whenever you give the
definition of the member of the
interface you need to give extra
specifier here right and the last is a
class can inherit from multiple
interfaces you can see here we can
inherit from multiple interfaces so I
