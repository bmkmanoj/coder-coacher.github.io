shown you how to perform math operations
in your PHP script in this video I am
going to show you how to perform
conditional operations using if-else
condition or FL statement and nested
if-else statement so for example I have
these two values of variables number one
and number two both have some value
inside them so number one is initialized
with the value of 10 and number two is
initialized with the value of 20 for
example and you want to compare these
two numbers and on the basis of
comparison you want to show the result
for example so like any other good
language PHP also has this if comparison
statement which compares the values okay
and it always gives the result true or
false and if the condition which
whatever you pass in here is true it
will perform this operation otherwise it
will go out of this condition right for
example I want to compare the Equality
of these two numbers I can just write
and don't forget to add and and equal to
double equal to so whenever you want to
compare the IQ equality this is called
the comparison operator which is double
equal to and when you provide single
equal to it is called an assignment
operation and it will assign the value
to this variable so to compare just
always use this double equal to here
okay for example I'm checking whether
number 1 is equal to number 2 which is
obviously it's false then I can echo for
example two numbers are equal for
example okay I will also provide this
break tag to
break the line and don't forget to give
this semicolon here and now I will when
I perform or when I run this so I will
run this in my browser I will open Mac
and I will see nothing because this
condition is not true
number one is not equal to number two so
only and only if this condition is true
the code inside this two parenthesis or
these two curly braces will be performed
otherwise it will go out of this loop or
out of this condition so I can just
print here out of loop or or statement
statement okay so I can just refresh it
and it says out of statement that means
my condition is not true that's why it's
it's going out of the statement and it's
printing this now if you also want to
catch the other condition whether this
if this number is not equal to the
number two what you want to do in that
condition you can perform this by else
it's just like this okay and when you do
it like this everything which is not
followed so for example the condition if
the condition is false this will skip
this curly braces and it goes to the ABS
condition and whatever is the else
condition you can print it from here
okay
so you can just say two numbers are not
equal okay so this is if-else statement
now suppose you want to check some other
kind of other kind of compare
so for example you also want to check
where the number is number two is
greater than number one right so you can
do it like this after your if condition
you can just add else if and you can
check the second condition whatever you
want to check inside these two curly
braces you can a part of your statement
and for example I want to check whether
a number two is greater than number one
okay and this is called comparison
operator and in this case when number
two is greater than number one I can say
here
number two is greater than number one
for example right so I will just save it
and when I run the statement say number
two is greater than number one okay so
in this way you can perform nested if
conditions or if-else conditions in this
way so whenever you would just only to
want to compare two numbers and you
don't want to show any other conditions
like else you can just use if this and
this or otherwise you want to check some
other condition beside your main
condition you can use else--if and
otherwise these two condition or or
whatever condition you have provided are
all false then your statement goes into
this condition with this else condition
and will go and print this as statement
here so this is a simple conditional
statement which you can use in PHP I am
sure that you if you have learned any
other language that all language also
includes this conditional statements so
that's it for this video I hope you
