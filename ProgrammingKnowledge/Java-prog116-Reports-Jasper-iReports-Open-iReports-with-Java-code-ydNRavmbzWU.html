video I have shown you how to generate
this kind of a report with the use of a
report designer and in this video I will
show you how you can open this report
using your NetBeans Java project or your
NetBeans IDE so first of all go to your
NetBeans project and what I have done
here is I have taken one button just
drag and drop from the palette just that
and I have named it by reporter and now
we right click it go to event action and
action perform
once again action connection performed
and here I have already taken a
try-catch block so you just write this
blank
try-catch block and after that we will
start with our code before writing your
code you just need to remember that this
J frame is already connected to your
database and which is like this corn is
equal to Java connect dot connector DB
database so I think I have already shown
you and if you are making the your
software using the videos I have shown
you you know what is this and the simple
way is to see that if you have used some
query into your program that means you
are connected to your database it's
simple as that so just remember that
your frame is connected to the database
using preparedstatement result set and
connection once again I will go to my
report here I already have try-catch
block and now I will write the code here
go here and first thing I will write
we'll take a string string and rename it
as report is equal to is equal to and
double quotes and this and in here you
need to give the path of your I report
file so for example my I report file
with X extension of J our XML is saved
in the folder somewhere I will right
click it go to its properties and I will
copy the whole path of the file
including the extension which is JR XML
and I will paste in between these two
ports and next thing I think you know
what to do why this is showing some
error because you need to add two
slashes instead of one in order to
provide an absolute path so you have
done that now the second thing is right
Jasper
yes per report and I will name it
variable as JR stands for Jasper report
is equal to just pour compile manager
right after that dot compile report
and after that here double code and
instead of null you just copy your
report string variable in which you have
transferred your path and just paste it
here okay now in the next line what you
need to do is write just print this
variable as JP or just by print is equal
to just
Phil manager dot Phil report yes and
that close it and instead of this null
we need to pass in three variable first
is this JR variable just for report
variable I will copy and paste it first
second is null we don't want to write
anything and third is your connection
variable which I have shown you above
which is gone I will show you once again
so
at the first very first few line you
have defined something like these
connection corn is equal to null result
set RS is equal to null and
preparedstatement PST is equal to null
this corn I will copy and I will paste
as a third variable okay so what I have
done is I am written just for report JP
is equal to just per fill manager dot
fill report first variable is jr. which
is this jesper import variable second is
null and third is your connection
variable now in the next line write just
viewer thought
you report and in this bracket this JP
will come which is just per print
variable so these four lines you need to
write in order to show your just per
report or your J our XML file
when you click New York button so what I
will do now is I will try to run the
program and see it runs or not run
and it's taking some time
so my pro program is running now and
when I click this I report button my I
report which I have generated with the
help of I report designer should open so
I will click it
and first of all you can see 2 warnings
here these are normal warnings so don't
worry about these warning and here you
can see your report which you have
generated with the help of my report
designer is here you can see now so this
is a very simple J report I've made and
I have opened with the help of NetBeans
Java project in the coming videos we
will make or add some more things new
things in our report and I will also
show you how to pass the parameters from
Java to I report directly so you can
generate your report more easily and
more dynamically so I hope you have
learned something new this time and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
