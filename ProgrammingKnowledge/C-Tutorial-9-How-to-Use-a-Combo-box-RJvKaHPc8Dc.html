video I will show you how to use a combo
box so I will show in this video how to
add some items in the combo box and how
to basically use it so first of all take
a combo box from your toolbox and I will
take a button from my toolbox and I will
change the text of my button as a string
and I will also take for example you
know I will take this I will use this
text box so I will use the name textbox
to enter the values from here or enter
the values of this text box in this
combo box with the help of this button
so first of all I will select the combo
box and I will copy the name of this
combo box like this and I will double
click my ad string button and I will
reach to the event of this button and I
will paste my combo box name here second
thing I will do is I will copy this text
box name from here
and once again I will copy the name of
the text box and I will just paste it in
here for the reference now what I will
do is before this name text text box
name I will declare a string string name
s T oh this is name of my string
variable is equal to name string dot
text and then we close it and then I
will take the combo box name I will
write dot item items dot add and bracket
and break it closed and in this add
bracket I will pass this strength okay
so just these two lines what these two
lines will do is we take the text
whatever is present in the text box of
name and add it into your combo box as a
item okay so now let's run the program
and username and password is correct and
now whatever I will enter here and I
will press add it should add in this
combo box right now it's empty right so
I will add the name here for exam mark
and I will press this add string and you
see mark is here once again I will enter
other named paul and i will press this
add string it's added okay
once again and it's added so in this way
you use the combo box okay one more
thing for example I choose any name from
here and I want to show it in the other
text box for example in employee ID text
box I want to transfer this whatever
name I will choose here I want to
transfer in this other text box so how I
will do this I will show you so go to
your form just select your combo box and
double click it and then just copy your
combo box name and paste it here and
just copy your employee text box name
this is just for the example how to use
a combo box that is why I am using this
so I will use the other text box name
and we copy the name from here and I
once again paste it here so I have two
one combo box name and one text field
name now what I will do is I will after
my text box name I will add dot X is
equal to combo box dot txt
okay and close so let's see what this
line does for us let's run the program
once again username and password and now
for example first of all I will add some
names in the combo box first name second
name third name so three names and now
whatever I select whatever name I will
select from here it should appear in
this box so let's see yes
it's changing right so in this way you
can use a combo box for your application
and in the next video I will show you
how to link your database and show your
names from the database in your combo
box
