going to show you how to send an email
via SMTP server of Gmail so first of all
let's see what is an SMTP server so when
you go to Gmail information you can see
SMTP server is a Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol which is used to send mail or
transfer mail or messages and it is used
by Gmail and Yahoo also so we are going
to use SMTP server and we will send the
or we will transfer the mail from one
email ID to another email ID using Java
programming so let's get started this is
by jframe so I will take a button
which is which I will use to send the
mail so I will name it as me
okay and one more thing you need to have
Java male library in order to use this
male code so let me tell you how can you
get Java mean API library so what you
have to do is just type on your Google
search Java meal and first result will
show Java male API on oracle.com click
downloads and you will directly go to
the download page and you just have to
click this download button and your Java
male API will be downloaded I have
already downloaded this API so I don't
need to download it much but you should
download it and after downloading go to
your project and
this is my project and library
properties and you go to add jar folder
jar or folder so I have saved my gmail
library at a specified location so just
select that location and include mail
jar file and open and then library click
library and you can see five more jar
file in which SMTP jar file is also
there so just select all of them and
click open
in this way you will add these jar file
into your library and click OK so these
library will be added to your food so
now let's get started with the code so
right-click your mail button event
action and action performed and you will
go to your
perform
so first of all let me tell you how or
what libraries you need in order to
write this code so we will go to the top
of code and import some libraries so
first of all you need to import Java dot
util dot
properties
second you need to import job ox
mail dot message third unit to amore
messaging exception
oat
we dot password
and basically if you can write important
dot mil dot star this will also include
these all extensions I have just wanted
to tell you which are the extension you
need to includes that's why I have
written these imports you need some more
imports which we can add by
right-clicking are fixing the imports so
just do that and then once again go to
your action perform event this is your
action performed given it so let's begin
our code first o´clock all right
properties props is equal to you
properties
and
and then props dot put object and in
here you will write your SMTP server
host so me dot sm d p dot host in the
next section right SM T P dot G mail.com
so we are using Gmail's SMTP server to
send our mail then you will write props
dot
put
not put our chipped and in here you will
right
your socket new so mail dot sm t e dot
socket
to be
got odor so this is your you will
provide here your socket port and which
is 465 why I have written this 465
socket port I have checked on Java me
Java male information block and I'm
right now I am using port for SM SSL so
I have written port numbers 465 so right
now I am using SSL protocols
so it's port number is 465
that's why I have written 465 here now
once again right props dot put
and here you are today mil-dot SMTP
dot rocket Factory
not the class
and this good factory class is we will
write here Java X dot dot dot SS and
because we are using SSL protocol so SS
n dot SS n
fuck it
country
and
semicolon so you have written this
socket class which is Java meal by using
SSL and then write drops dot dot put one
more object you even write
mil-dot smtp plot
au th and you will write true
once again copying this I will replace
one more thing
instead of Java not SMTP au th you have
to write oat
which is 65 now I think the time for
this video is over so I will continue
this code in the next video so please
see the next video in order to complete
this code and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
