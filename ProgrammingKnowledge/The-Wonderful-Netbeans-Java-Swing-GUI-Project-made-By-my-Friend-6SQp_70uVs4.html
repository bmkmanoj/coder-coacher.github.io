I'm making for showing the project of my
friend this project is made by my friend
and colleague and he made a very
wonderful project using Java NetBeans so
as you can see his GUI very very
interesting and very very attractive you
can see progress bar in very good manner
these these are the report generated
with the help of Jesper report so he has
done very good job with just but reports
also and you can see dates he can
generate graphs and very good crops he
had generated using this project
and this is one of the most
comprehensive project I have ever seen
and he has used each and every thing
which can be used in that beans gel this
is the very interesting thing I want to
point out that he use here the jade tree
which is not very easy to understand and
here he has used jlist also and see the
icons in Jade Jade filechooser these are
also specially set by him by programming
and in the table also he managed to set
the icons on the table title also he
said the icons so it must have been a
very painful job painful journey for him
and here you can see he can find any
word which is located in the folders he
is searching in so he types in any word
and he searched for the word and it can
be small letters or capital letters and
his software searches for the document
containing those words or those lines so
this is
also very interesting maybe in future I
will show you how to do that
he cancels PDF document he can search
for document here also he has used meal
Java meal which I have already shown so
he has sent his mail successfully here
he's logging in little and his meal
there is his meal so I think this
software he has made is wonderful and
please see that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
