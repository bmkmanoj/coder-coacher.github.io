have to make a C++ program to read these
values which are written with the help
of JavaScript and patch them by using
C++ program and insert into my SQL
database and I have to insert these
lines such that for example I have to
insert only some of these lines for
example five lines per one minute or
some seconds so what I have done is I
have made a JavaScript and HTML program
which when I run
makes a log like this for time and some
more values and every five second it
registers one more entry
so you can see here the log is getting
larger every five seconds
when this long will become large enough
I will export this log into a CSV file
by clicking this button this button I
have provided so that I will export this
log into the CSV file and I could be
able to download this CSV file and that
CSV file I will read with the help of
C++ program and then insert those CSV
file data into the my SQL database
and we wait for this log to become a
little bit large so I can show the C++
program in a good manner
so I think this log is large enough now
so now I will export this by clicking
this button will generate the file here
and I will just save this file by
downloading this file so this file is
downloaded and I will go to the folder
in which it is downloaded and I will cut
this and I will paste this on my desktop
now this is my file which I have
downloaded now I will run the CSV probes
sorry C++ program to fetch the CSV file
into
my C++ program what I will do is now we
go to the properties and I will copy the
part of this
while CSV file and I will paste this
part into my program just this and then
I will build my program
this is the program which I am made in
C++ and this will demonstrate the
project
so now task has built now and I had run
the program it takes five values at a
time and then insert into database and
wait for more five seconds and then
insert more five values in the database
I can change this time for the weight
for example close this and
for example I want to wait for 15 second
instead of five second and I want to
insert four values instead of five
values so now I will build the program
and then when I run the program it takes
four value at a time and wait for 15
seconds
then it will reinsert another next four
values into the database and it will
keep on going or inserting these values
at the interval of 15 second until my
daughter is and
so now I have to check these values into
my SQL database to see that these values
are really inserted into the database or
not so for example these values are
inserted into the doctor base and I mean
close this I will go to my SQL database
and when i refresh this database you can
see all the values in my database I
could be able to see
so this was my project what project this
was my task and I was working on it I
hope this will help you somewhere and
thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
