video I am going to show you how you can
declare your classes in different file
other than your main dot CPP and use
those classes from different files in
your main dot CPP and why it is
important and useful to define your
classes in different files is because
whenever you write a program or whenever
programmers write a big program which
can contain hundreds of classes and if
they write each and every class on the
same file it becomes really overwhelming
for the other programmers for example
the colleagues or the for the boss to
read those classes in the same file so
in order to make your program readable
and more accessible we define our
classes in different file so we can find
those classes really fast and this makes
your program really readable and
understandable so let's see how we can
create files for the class and then we
will see how we can use this class in
our main dot CPP so if you are using
code locks or any good IDE it has a
mechanism of making those of those file
class files for you so for example this
tutorial series I'm doing on code blocks
there in here you need to go to file new
and you will see the option class here
in every good IDE you will be able to
find this option class and in here you
can define the name of the class so for
example I want to make the book class so
I will say books
and here you can provide other other
options like if you want to have
destructor or if you want to have
virtual destructor which I haven't
taught you yet so I will just uncheck
everything because I would like to write
my code by myself and not by this wizard
so I will just use this visual wizard to
make the class and everything else we
are going to do by ourselves so it will
be easier to you know remember things
now the second thing is you need to do
is if by default this checkbox is
unchecked which is had an implementation
file shall be in same folder just check
this checkbox and what this mean is you
want to create this class files in your
project folder for example I have my
project folder here and this project
folder contains the main dot cpp and
this project file and i want this class
while also in the same folder okay so
this check boxes does death and then
just click create and just say yes and
you can say yes okay and as soon as you
do that just go to your project file
once again and you see here there are
two new file generated here one is
called book dot CPP and one is books dot
H and you will be able to see them here
also book dot H and book dot CPP okay
before explaining this these classes to
you and header file to you
I would like to compile my program so I
will compile this and in code blocks
whenever you create this class by this
wizard and whenever you compile it it
will give you this error I I am getting
this error if you are in case you are
getting this error which is undefined
reference to when main at the rate 16
then what you need to do you just need
to close this your project so I will
just close my project and I will save
all my changes and I will once again
open code locks and then this problem
will be solved so I will reopen my
project once again and once I once again
I compile this and you see there are no
errors now so I I don't know if it's a
bug or what but this is the solution I
found for this for problem okay once
this is done you have your book dot CPP
file so how you can open these files
this right click and just say open books
dot H or books dot CPP okay so we have
two files here this code block wizard
has created two files for us one is
called books dot H which is called
header file and one other is called box
dot CPP which is called the source file
and we haven't seen this declaration of
classes so what header file is doing
here is it contains the declaration or
prototyping of your class or your method
so whatever declaration of the class you
want to do you will do in this header
file of books dot H file ok and this
source file we can will contain the
definition of those
functions or those classes so here you
will write the method definition so I
have I think in the earlier videos I've
explained you what is member form not
member function but what is function
prototyping what you do in function
prototyping you just make a prototype of
function at the top of or above your
main function and you can define the
definition of the function below your
main function so this above which you
define is called the prototyping same
this header file is doing its only
containing the the prototypes and this
will contain all of your code for your
function so let's see what is this class
containing this code I will explain you
later so just leave it as it is for now
but this is the class definition and we
know that this is how you declare the
class and it has three preprocessor
directives or this public protected and
private and this I will explain you
later in later video but we have learned
how we can use public access specifier
right so I will use only public and this
is constructor if you are followed my
last video so let's define some member
variable in this public domain so I will
define in book ID for example so I will
say book ID and I want to define the
getter and setter function for this book
ID I have also explained you this
scatter and setter functions in the
previous videos if you remember so I
will define first of all set
so set book ID and what it takes
it is initialized by a void so we are
not returning anything and it takes an
argument which is same as book ID so I
will say book ID but with an underscore
so we know that this is argument then
this is our member variable in a similar
way I will define a ket Quetta so I will
say int get a returns the type which we
want to return so we have book and it
has a type or datatype in so we are
returning int and I will say get book ID
okay and it doesn't take any parameter
so this is called the prototyping of the
function right and in header file we do
the prototyping of these function and
the definition or the source code of
these functions will come in this book
dot cpp in here now before moving
further you might be wondering what is
this why it's written here book colon
colon books so this double colon is
called binary scope resolution operator
and why we are using this binary scope
resolution operator because you can
define different classes which can have
the same function set ID and get book ID
set book ID and get book ID so how you
will recognize that this set book ID is
a part of this class so you use the name
of the class coolin coolin the member
function so this is the constructor
which is this one and first one is the
class name so class name and the member
function and
this is books because this is the
constructor and this is also a member
function of your class right so same
thing we do with our set book ID and get
book ID so just remember this double
pool is called binary scope resolution
operator okay I will copy this and this
comes just after or just before the name
of your function so this is the name of
our function just before the name of
your function you use this name of the
class and then this binary scope
resolution operator and then name of the
function now you can easily say that
this function is a member function of
this book class right that's why we are
using this and same we are doing with we
will do with the sketch book ID but this
is our CPP file so we need to define
these function or we need to write the
source code for set book ID and get book
ID right
so in setter function what we do we just
take our argument here and we will just
pass it to our member variable so I will
just do this equal to this okay and what
get others it only returns your member
variable which is this one so you can
write return
poka ending okay so this you know how to
declare or define member functions now
whenever you see this main dot CPP you
see here we have defined these files
here so it has include this iostream and
include this string and using namespace
STD so what you need to do is
you need to copy this all these
conclusions and paste it in your header
file also so that your header file or
class will also know that if you use a
string or iostream or standard namespace
your you know this number variable
doesn't get confused that where this
comes from we need to include these
includes I streams and whatever files or
headers you want are including in the
main file you need to include it in the
header file also and if you see in the
Box dot CPP it's including books dot H
which is this header file so your source
file will always initialize by this
inclusion of your header file and why we
are including this we are including this
to tell your source file which is your
book dot CPP that we have declared the
prototype of this class in the header
file so include all the all the all the
classes or the declaration from the
header file in the CPP file so this line
will include your your classes or
whatever declaration you have done in
the header file now your CPP file will
know that yes I need to have this I will
see this declaration here and yes I can
then give the source code for these
member functions here so always include
this in the CPP file so you are
including this in the CPP file bookstore
CPP file you need to include this just
copy this in your main file to in order
to call this class in your main door CPP
okay so just include this book dot
header file in your main dot CPP
now your main dot cpp knows that there
is some header file and we'll go to this
header file and it will see there is a
class d Kuril declaration hit there so
now it knows that there exists and a
class in this header file which i can
use okay
now everything is symptom whatever you
can make the object of the class I have
already told you how to use classes so
just copy the name of the class go to
your main function and we will define
the object of the class books and for
example book once this is the object
declaration and then we can use this
object to call our function member
function of the glass so first book dot
I will call the set book ID so this will
set the book ID and this will take some
argument so I want to set book ID is
equal to hundred for example and I will
use get book ID to print this ID of the
book right
so I will write C out and then I will
write book one dot get book ID so this
will return you the book ID right and
then once again endline okay so this
will return you 100 because we have set
the value of book ID is equal to hundred
and we are getting this here and
printing it let's compile at our code
and it's compiled successfully and when
I run this program you will see hundred
here okay so now you can declare your
classes in this form of source file and
header file and use these classes in
your main main nose dot CPP file so that
it's easier to you know see and
you understand that you have this class
declaration here and you can use these
classes here so this makes your code
really simple in terms of understanding
and in the long run when you have you
know ten of fifty classes it will make
your you know programming really easy
when you define these classes in
different header files and source files
okay so I hope you understood the basic
concept of these classes which we
declare in the other files and I hope
