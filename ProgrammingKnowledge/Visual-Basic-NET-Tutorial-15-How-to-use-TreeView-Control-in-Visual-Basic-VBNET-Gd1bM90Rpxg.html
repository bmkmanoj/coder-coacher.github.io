video I will show you how to use tree
view control with your visual basic
windows form application I have already
created a sample project and I have
taken a button and I have changed if
it's a text to add node now I will go to
my toolbox and I will search for the
tree view and drag and drop into my form
so this is a tree view and I drag and
drop into my form okay and if you want
you can change the name of this tree
view to your desired name but I will
leave it as default which is tree view
one now I will select this button and I
will double click it and in here I have
two lines of code already written which
is I have declared a string variable
which is N and I'm taking a input from
an input box and I am transferring or
assigning this input to this n so right
now when I run the program and when I
press this add node it asks me as an
input box what I want to enter and when
I click OK it assigns what I have
entered to this n variable okay so write
these two lines of code to initialize
the input box now to add a node to a
tree we will write first of all the name
of our tree view which is preview one
right tree view 1 dot nodes because we
are adding the nodes right dot add ok so
add node and what are we going to
add here there are two argument
basically which this ad takes first is
the key of this of the treeview node so
for example I am going to give the key
the whatever I enter in the input box
right so I will pass this n as a first
argument and as a second argument also
you can see it here if you have this
description
this is taking ki as a string and text
as a string the second argument is a
text as a string okay
and right now I'm taking the key and
text as same so we don't get confused
and now when I run the program and when
I click this Add button and I add some
text for example some name
and once again some name and once again
some name so it adds as a node to our
tree view right we can select that but
we haven't included the functionality
for selecting these item so let add
let's add the functionality for
selecting now after these two lines of
code where we have declared the input
box just go just go below that and right
here if preview one which is my tree
view dot selected node is nothing then
then what I will do is if something is
not selected then I will add a new node
to the tree view otherwise what I will
do
else I will write else I will add a sub
node or child to the selected node right
so I will write tree view 1 dot selected
node which is the node we have selected
dot nodes dot ad okay and now we will
pass the same to and variable which is
the string form from the input box right
and now when I run my program I can add
names or nodes as usual
second name and the third name but I can
add a sub node now when I select any
item or any node from here for example
I'm selecting this first name which is
mark and where now when I add a node
mark is a boy for example so you can see
it has created a child
to your node okay now I want to add a
child to this sub node also then I will
say 15 years okay so when you select
some node it's adding a child to that
node once again right so now you know
how to select and how to add a sub child
to your tree view now for example you
want to add some image to your tree view
so I will show you how to add images to
your tree view nodes what you need to do
is just select or not select but go to
your tool box and we will use image
container image box or image list from
our tool box search for the image list
okay this is the image lift drag and
drop into your form and you will notice
this image list goes down below here
what we will do is we will just click
the small triangle button from here and
we will say choose images okay and in
here we can choose images so what we
need to do just click this Add button
and whatever image you want to choose in
the list of image so when we
drag-and-drop image list we can choose a
list of
image and contain this list of image in
this image list right for example I
choose one two three and four images
right now and I click open and you see
all the four images are there in my
image list and if you see it carefully
we have the number assigned for these
images these are called index of the
image list right first image has index 0
second as one-third as true and both has
3 okay now just click OK and you can set
the image size from here also
so you see here amid science right now
is 16 by 16 which is a smaller version
of images let's make them bigger for
example 32 by 32 so we will be able to
see the images better all let's make it
64 to make it make the images more
bigger 64 by 64 okay so now you have
said that you can also set the depth of
the images which I am leaving as default
and now we have the images in the image
list now what we need to do is select
your tree view and go to the image
collection property okay we have this
image list here when when we select this
tree view right so we have image list we
select the image list 1 which is this
image list in which we have the images
right and so now we have the image list
in our tree view lets see once again
okay we have the image list right and we
have the index for the images which we
know now once again I will click this
add node button
and in here what I just need to do is I
need to add extra extra argument to the
node so just when you have where you
have a tree v1 dot node dot add and
after these two this key and this text
we will make one more argument as image
index as you remember image index 0 1 2
3 right so I will give the image index 0
and comma selected image index so fourth
argument is the selected image index
which is 1 so this will show the image
number 0 and this will show the image
number 1 right ok here also in the
selected image I will add 0 comma 1 okay
now when I run the program once again
and I want to add a node once again you
have this image and you have this name
mark once again some other name you have
second name but when you select any any
of the node the images changes so this
is index number 0 which is not selected
and this is index number 1 for the image
which is selected right let's add one
more node and the same phenomena will
occur for this also right so whenever
you choose some image it changes
according to the selection ok now for
example you want to use all the images
which is there in the image list one by
one so what I will do is once again I
will go to the this button double click
it we have this code already I will
declare outside the
method for button click just below this
glass form one I'll declare them eye as
integer is equal to zero okay so I have
declared a variable I which is integer
and we will loop this integer in a loop
okay so I will write here I is equal to
in the brackets I plus 1 which will loop
my images and I will say mod 4 because I
have four images so it will loop every
four images right and this I I will
replace it with these index 0 and 1 so I
will reseed i here i here i will go here
and i will also go here okay so what i
have done i have declared this integer
and I am looping this integer one by one
in the loop of four and I just replace
this index of the image by this integer
once again I will run my program add
some node and once again add some node
and once again add some node and once
again add some node okay so you see
whatever images I have selected these
all four images are different but when I
now add one more images it will start
looping the earlier image so this post
image and this last image is same
because we only have four images and its
start looping once again right
now even when we add it we'll add the
second image this image and this image
will be same right this image okay or
when we add a next image because we have
selected this node it will add the next
image here so in this way you can loop
your images also so I think you have now
understood how to use a tree view
basically with your visual basic windows
form application I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
