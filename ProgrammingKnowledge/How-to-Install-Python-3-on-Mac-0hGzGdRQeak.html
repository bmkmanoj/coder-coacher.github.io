a legacy version so I'm going to show
you how you can install Python 3 on your
Mac operating system now in order to
exit from this Python command you can
just type exit and then just give these
parentheses and then press Enter or
return which is going to just exit out
of this Python shell right or you can
once again give this Python command and
what there is one more command to exit
out of this Python shell which is quit
and then these parentheses and this will
also let you to quit your Python shell

system or not so now I can see this
