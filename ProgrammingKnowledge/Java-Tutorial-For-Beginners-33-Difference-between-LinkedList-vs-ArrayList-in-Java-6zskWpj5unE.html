tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in this video we will see what
is the difference between ArrayList and
linked list we have seen both kind of
lists in the last two videos and now we
will see what is the difference between
them and when we can use them so let us
see the first difference first
difference is linked list element
insertion is faster compared to
ArrayList so whenever you try to add
element or your frequent operation in
your program is insertion then it is
better to use linked list okay so when
you want to use few frequent insertions
or adding of element in your list then
linked lists are preferred
now why insertion is faster in linked
lists and compared to array list because
linked lists are doubly
length list so linked list uses doubly
linked list you can google what is
double linked list basically it means
that it maintains two pointer one is
right before the element and one is
right after the element so the insertion
is faster but whenever you try to add
something to the ArrayList it has to
resize its size and it has to shift the
element because it uses index based
lists so that's why linked lists is
faster in terms of insertion in a same
way whenever you want to delete
something or your frequent operation is
deletion I'm talking about frequent word
here and I am stressing on this frequent
word because a normal condition where
you have to add you know hardly once or
twice or I mean not more than ten times
both performance-wise you cannot measure
but the frequent operation by pre
contrived operation I mean somewhere
around 10 to the power 5 addition or
deletion or something like this so it's
frequent right so whenever you have
frequent deletion also linked lists are
faster than array lists ok so whenever
you have frequent deletion operation or
whenever you have frequent insertion
operator operation in your program then
use linked lists okay now
when arraylists us are good to use
so whenever your frequent operation is
searching in the list then arraylists
are better so arraylists search
operation is pretty fast compared to
link list search operation search
operation means whenever you want to get
some value from your list which is quite
big and your frequent operation is
searching inside the list for example
your list is 10 to the power 5 element
so your list contain 10 to the power 5
elements and you want to get exactly the
element at the middle of the list then
this ArrayList is faster because
ArrayList I have already said that it's
indexed index based right and it's
faster to get the index of the array
list then - you know retrieve it using
iterator because linked list I already
told you uses these a doubly linked list
that means it uses double pointers and
for that you need iterator but the
ArrayList are only index based okay so
whenever you have search operations you
use array lists but these search
operation if they have frequent search
operations right now fourth and last
difference is linked list has more
memory overhead because linked lists
work on pointers or doubly linked list
pointers they have more memory overhead
and because array lists are you know
index based lists and they only you know
contain or they only use
is the number of element or addresses
equal to the number of element that's
why ArrayList consumes lesser memory
than linked lists okay
so linked list has more memory overhead
than ArrayList because in ArrayList each
index only hold actual object right but
in linked lists each node holds both the
data address of next and previous node
this is the basic concept of linked
doubly linked list which is the pointer
which holds next and previous value okay
so whenever you are concerned about
memory then use array lists okay so
these are the four difference main or
major differences between linked lists
now how can we prove these four points
what I have done is I have made a
program here and I will try to insert 10
to the power 7 element then a 1 e 7
means 10 to the power 7 elements I will
try to insert into the list also and
insert into the linked list also so
ArrayList and linkage
I will insert same number of elements
and I will compare the time taken by
them and then I will see which is faster
and this is not a small number 10 to the
power 7 is quite big right so I am going
to see how much time in millisecond it
takes so I am measuring time using this
current time in millisecond using system
dot current time in milliseconds and
then I am printing the time using the
current time minus the time I have
recorded before this insertion in the
same way I am
doing the same for the link list and I
will see the time taken by them okay
similarly I am trying to remove the
values from my list so once I insert
some value in the list I will try to
remove the value and let's try to remove
the value from the middle of the list
okay so you can say 10 to the power 7
let us remove the value from 1 e 1 e 5
for example so 1 e 5 okay not the middle
but it's quite random and you know it
has to do lot some work to find this
value right to remove it okay and then I
will try to search some value inside the
list okay so these three operation I am
going to do and I will try to run this
program and see what is the time taken
by all three operations
so now I get the insert result and
deletion result and the search result so
insertion you can see the result in
insert operation ArrayList take 6 1 1 4
milliseconds and in insert link list
takes 1 6 1 7 milliseconds right
that means linked list is faster in
insertion operation right now in case of
deletion it should be a linked list
should take less time than this
ArrayList but sometimes it can happen
but this operation I have was not doing
frequent by deletion I have only called
only once here right not I have done any
frequent operation so only 1 deletion
takes lesser time in our a list in this
case but more time in linked list but
this if the remove operation is a
frequent then the faster will be the
linked list right so let us try to
remove the first element itself and then
see what happens
so in removal once again ArrayList take
more time which is 11 millisecond and
deletion of a linked list for the first
element takes 0 may almost 0 millisecond
that is linked list is faster for the
removal also or deletion if you have
frequent deletion right now in the third
operation what I was doing is I was
searching in the list basically I was
searching in the list of exactly the
middle element in the list so this
search or
gives me the results something like this
whenever I try to get some value which
is exactly at the middle or whose index
is exactly at the middle of the size of
the array then it the ArrayList takes
less time which is almost zero
millisecond but linked list you see
takes more time okay so this proves more
or less our point deletion and insertion
linked list is better but whenever you
want to search then this is better which
one link ArrayList is better okay so
these are the difference between
ArrayList and Lincoln Gorge video please
