show you how you can install Ubuntu
operating system on VirtualBox I'm using
Ubuntu operating system as a host for
this video demonstration but this
procedure or all the steps which I'm
going to follow will be same if you have
a Windows operating system and you have
VirtualBox on Windows or if you have
VirtualBox on Mac OS right so let's see
how we can download the Ubuntu operating
system from Internet so go to your
favorite search engine and search for
ubuntu download and the first link you
will find here is www.opm.gov the
desktop here and you need to choose what
flavor you want for open do so you can
choose 32-bit or 64-bit I'm choosing
64-bit but you can also choose 32-bit
also and click download and in here you
can choose if you want to make some
donation which currently I don't want to
make but it's your wish so make them
zero or whatever you want to not donate
and click this download it will take
around 10 minutes I think to download
this ISO file from this open door'
website because it's a relatively big
file about 900 MB so be patient and wait
for 10 minutes to download and after you
have downloaded this ISO file on your
computer you're ready to start your
virtual machine and install ubuntu in it
so just open your VirtualBox manager and
go to new here and just in the name just
right
Ubuntu you need don't necessarily need
to give this name but yeah when you
search with the name open to VirtualBox
automatically recognizes that you are
looking for open door operating system
and by default it gives you this option
the version is 64-bit version but you
can choose 32 bit if you have downloaded
32 bit version so I will leave it as a
64 version because I have downloaded a
64 bit click Next
in here you can allocate the memory
which you want to provide to your open
to operating system by default it's 5 1
2 MB I will make it as 1 0 to 4 MB click
Next and this will I will leave it as
default create a virtual hard drive now
and this also I will leave it as default
VDI which is VirtualBox disk image and
in here you can choose if you want to
allocate the dynamically allocated
memory or you want fixed size memory you
can just read these advantage of fixed
size and dynamically and allocated
memory from here I will choose
dynamically allocated because it's more
flexible I will click Next
and in here you can provide the name for
your operating system
and the hard drive size ok by default
it's 8 GB but you can increase it on the
basis of the available size of your hard
drive and click create
after that once it's created you can
just need to select your Ubuntu what
which you have created and then go to
settings and in here you need to give
the part of that ISO file so go to
storage and go to empty here in the
controller ID and click this small CD
button here and click Choose virtual CD
or disk ok and choose whatever file you
have downloaded open to file you have
downloaded so this is the ISO file I
have downloaded so just select that you
just need to search for this ISO file
which you have downloaded and click open
and you can also do some settings for
example if you want to give some shared
folder which you want to share between
your host for example it can be Windows
host or and open to guests so you can
give the location of this shared folder
and you can share the file between your
guest and the host ok so for example I
can make a new folder for open to guests
and I can choose this here and you can
you know share the files in here ok and
I will click OK
and now I will start my
operating system and it recognizes that
ISO file which you have given the part
off and it will start installing this
operating system in your virtual machine
it will look like this first of all
and you see it's starting open to 14.04
at the time of making this video this is
the latest version available so it's
starting
and now you have this
screen in some moment this will be the
your installation wizard will start you
will see the screen
okay so now here you can choose the
language of your choice I will choose
English as default but you can choose
whatever language you speak and then you
click install Ubuntu
and in here we'll show for best result
please ensure that this computer has at
least this much amount of hard drive
space and you are plugged in and you are
connected to internet which I am right
and I can also choose these download
updates while installing and install
third-party software so it will install
mp3 plug-in and other third-party
software with overdue okay so click both
keeps options and click continue
and now the installation type by default
you need to choose this arrays disk and
install Ubuntu oh and don't worry it
will not erase your you know actual
actual operating system it's just asking
so just choose this and don't worry
about your actual or host operating
system it will not erase that ok so just
choose this option and install now
and choose the location of where you
live and whatever time zone you want
click continue
and in here you can choose the keyboard
layout okay by default it's English but
my keyboard layout is German so I will
search for this German layout and you
can even test this keyboard from here
okay so just choose German layout and
choose this if you are you if you have
German layout or you can choose other
keyboard layout from here okay click
here continue
and in here you can give the name to
your operating system I will give my
open to opening systems the same name
but you can choose it depends upon you
what name you want to give and choose
password you need to give a password and
confirm the password and click continue
and now the installation started so it
will take some time to install this amon
tobin - so you see here it's right now
copying the files and it will take a
while to install this operating system
so wait for some time and I will pause
this video and restarted if any
important step happens okay so once you
have completed the this installation
this message will be shown that you need
to restart your operating system now so
all the processes once they are complete
you will be able to see this message so
just click this restart now and once you
will do that it will try to restart your
operating system and then you will be
able to use Ubuntu in your virtual
machine so just wait for restart
and generally I have seen that this
restart for the first time it takes some
time so what you can even do is you can
just cancel this virtual machine which
is running and restart your bundle once
again by yourself just cancel this and
click power off the machine
and or you can give this send the shut
down signal I'll choose this power of
the machine and click OK and now you can
restart it by this button once again
start button
and this time it will show you probably
the login screen
so starting
open to starting now
so it depends upon this speed of your
computer also how fast this open to
operating system starts right so it has
nothing to with you know it's taking so
much long time on my computer because
it's a little bit slow but if you have
passed then restart very fast so now we
can see the login screen just give you a
password which you have provided earlier
and click enter and you have this
operating system
so
that's made for starting
okay so now you have this open to
operating system as a guest on virtual
machine installed okay and by the way if
you are curious why this size of this
desktop is not resizing as you expand
this VirtualBox because you need to you
know install some more VirtualBox
drivers in order to make it you know
stretch this desktop so size will remain
same for the first time when you install
it but I will post a link below this
video or I will just give a link with
this video how you can resize this
desktop size with you are you know open
- or VirtualBox so whenever you will
just maximize your VirtualBox this will
be also maximized so I will paste the
video so just watch that and this
problem will be solved so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
