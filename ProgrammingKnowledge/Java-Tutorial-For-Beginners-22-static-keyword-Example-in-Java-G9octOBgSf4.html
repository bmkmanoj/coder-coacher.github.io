tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
what does the static keyword to in a
Java class now in this video I am going
to give one more example so this meaning
of static will be more clear to you so
for example I have a class called
student and in this class I have two
member variables one is the name of the
student which is a string and one is the
age of the student which is an integer
and I have made the getter and setter
functions of this class variables okay
so if you do not know how to make it
make these getter and setter function
they can be made automatically so just
go to your class and go to source and
then source you will be able to see here
generate getter and setter and in here
just select all and click OK and your
Keter and setter method for age and name
will be generated automatically by
eclipse for you okay so now what I want
to do is I will declare a static number
variable which will be int and this
variable name I will say is the number
of students okay and whose value is I
will initialize as 0 ok and I want to
keep the record of number of students
and I will make it as or I will declare
this as static so that it can be shared
by all the instances okay
still star thick so it is a static
member okay and now I am going to
constructor which is same as the name of
your class student and here whenever
this constructor is called I want to
increase the value of number of student
by one so whenever somebody makes or
initialize a student class I want to
increase the value by one so that we can
keep the track of number of students
right and for this we are going to make
a function to get the value of number of
student okay so we are going to make a
public function public int and I will
say get number of students and this
basically is going to return the number
of student which is this variable right
so number of students return okay so
whenever we call this function let us
define this function also as static
function so that we don't need to call
it by any instance we can call it by the
class itself okay now we go to the main
class and in here we are going to define
some instances of this student class
student
for example mark is equal to new student
and once again student Tom is equal to
new student right and now we are going
to call our get number of students
because whenever this
instructor is called we are increasing
the number of student by one right so
now we will just write says Oh control
shift and in here we will call the
student class itself because it is a
static member function this this F so we
can directly call it with the class
itself we don't need to use any instance
right you can use instance but it's not
necessary okay and when we run the
program you see the answer is two right
so it's shared by your instances so this
member variable can be shared by your
instances and two you know verify this
we can call these this member function
using instances also okay so for example
when we add mark instance and when we
call this get number of student by Tom
instance then what is the value of the
the number of students right so run the
program and it says first time when we
add first student its value is one
that's right because when we added the
first student the number of student will
be one and when we added second student
the number student will be 2 so this
member variable which was static was
shared by both the instances and also
this can be called by the class itself
right so this is the very basic and
important property of static member that
it can be shared by the instances also
and you can call it using your
our class itself so I hope you have
understood now the basic concept of
static and hope you have enjoyed this
