last video I have shown you how to use
open file dialog with your c-sharp
windows form application in this video I
will show you how to open a text file in
a text box or a rich text box using your
open file dialog application which I
have used last time so for that I'm
gonna need a rich text box so I take a
rich text box from here and I will
resize it and for example I have a text
file which I want to show in this text
area or rich text box so I will select
the path of the text file from this
button and I will pass this dead text
file and show it into this text box so
let's get started
just double-click your button and this
is the code for Open File dialog so
opening up for opening a file dialog and
copying a file path this code I have
shown you last time so if you don't know
this code just copy it as it is
or for explanation go to the last video
so just copy this code I will just add
it this code to pass a text file into
your text box so this is the code to
open Open File dialog so I think you
have copied this code now let's improve
this code so at the top declare a stream
variable so I will bite
string
and give it a variable name I'm naming
my variable as my string and by break it
closed and if you see this variable
declaration it's showing us some error
this is because we need to import some
system files so just import these two
files go at the top and write these two
lines using system dot text and using
system dot io just write these two
declaration at the top of your program
and when you go back to your code this
is gone this error is gone right
so I declared this stream variable and
inside this if loop I will declare if
loop once again and we just close the
Skip if loop and in that lip nope I'll
leave these two lines of code and then
this cliff loop right copy this variable
and paste it here first of all make one
more bracket in hip carnation and paste
your my stream where you will be here is
equal to your Open File dialog where you
will names right here open file dialog
not open PI bracket and bracket closed
and outside these bracket for my string
declaration right not equal to
sorry so like this okay
so it's showing error so I just delete
the PDR so we have made a if condition
in here we have written my stream which
is this variable is equal to open file
dialog which is this variable not open
file bracket and bracket closed is not
equal to null then what we are going to
do is we are writing this copying the
part of your file into a string and then
in next line write declare a new string
and this is my text variable is equal to
PI dot read all text bracket and bracket
closed and in bracket we will pass the
path of our file so copy it and paste it
here we don't need this show message box
because we don't want to show the text
in the message box we want to show the
text in the rich text box so I will just
copy the name of my rich text box from
here which text box 1 and once again to
the code and in here I will write which
text box dot next is equal to your file
text where you do bracket and bracket
closed
so we have written this much code to
open a file dialog and select the file
and then pass the text of the file in
the rich text box so if you want you can
pause the video and you can write the
code and once you are done with that
let's try and run our program so run and
it's open up and when I select this Open
File button and I select a file from
here so I select this text block dot the
text file and you can see all the text
in the text file is appearing in this
rich text area okay so it not only it
can open a text file but it can open XML
file also so it can read our XML file so
yet that shows that it can read XML file
but it cannot pass our XML file it just
literally copy the XML text and just
show it into your text box so parsing is
different but this literally copies the
text of the XML file and just show here
you can also show the docx file also you
can also open a docx file but if it
contains any pictures then it will show
in the form of some bytes so that will
be the problem while opening a dot d or
C file same is the problem with excel
file you can
all open the X in Excel file but if it
contains some binary or pictures it will
not open here so I can guarantee for the
text file and rest of the file you can
try and open in this rich text box so in
this way you can open a text file into a
text box using Open File dialog so I
hope you have learned something new this
time please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
