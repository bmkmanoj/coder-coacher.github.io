video I will show you how to add Google
Maps in your Windows application forms
in c-sharp so let's get started I have
this blank project made and in this
project first of all I will go to the
tool box and I will search for the split
container and I will drag and drop here
so I have two panels in this split
containers which I will use this bigger
panel I will use for showing the map and
this smaller panel I will use for
entering my search data second thing I
will take is the web browser and I will
drag and drop in this second panel this
web browser
and now I will take two text boxes
actually you can take text boxes
according to your requirement for
example I'm showing you how to search
Street and the city
you can search Street city state and zip
code and whatever latitude longitude
whatever you want to search you can
search and then maybe I will add the
labels so label one two three and four
so I have four labels and I will quickly
change the names of the labels so I have
changed the name of the labels one is
Street City then state and then zip code
and in the same way I will change the
name of these text boxes so text box
Street then text box city
then xbox state txt on the score state
and text box zip okay so that's done and
now I will take a button which I will
click to search my downs so this is the
button and I change its name search data
and I will change its text also such
okay so I have everything available now
I will click this search button and
double click it here and in here let me
make it bigger so you can see in here I
will write my code so first of all what
I will do is I we make our try catch
block so in this button click event I
will make this kind of a try catch block
so bite try and then catch exception and
in the message box I will show if any an
exception I will show the message and I
will show this as arrow and in this try
block first of all let me take all this
data from the text box in the string so
I will declare string string
Street first is equal to text on this
course
sweet dot txt this is the data which I'm
getting from the text box okay so I will
just copy it four times for city state
and zip so city state zip and here also
city paid and zip file would much the
file but the zip code now in this try
block watch what I will do is I will
make a string builder so I will write
string builder and here I will pass a
query address so I will write query
query address is equal to new string
builder ok and here break it and record
closed and now I will add to this
strength query so this is a string and I
will add this string so i will write
query address dot append once again very
dot address dot append and in here i
will write the address of Google Maps in
which we are going to search this is the
primary link which we are going to use
from the Google Maps
so I will write here double quotes and
in this I will pass this link so write
HTTP colon slash slash maps.google.com
flash Maps question mark Q is equal to
this is our primary link and in this
link or URL we are going to add our
search data okay so this is our link so
write this and just below this we will
give a condition so right
if Street not equal to string dot empty
then what we will do this not equal to
will come here so sweet so whatever dot
R we are taking from the street text box
if it's not empty then we will add in
our query address the street so write
query address dot append and in the
bracket we will pass our street strength
so copy this paste it here and write
plus
double quotes and in this right , and
plus all you can do it like this also
double quotes and plus okay in a same
way I will copy this if condition for
city state and zip so I will copy this
and paste it three more times one two
and three and earlier this was for
Street now we will make it for city so
second is for city is not empty then we
will add city name and then the state so
third is the state here and fourth is
zip code so Portis zip so we have street
city and state and zip we can search
street or city or state or zip or either
of them or all of them you can use so
this is the simple code for search for
showing the map and searching the data
in the Google map using tea shop let's
run this program and let's see if it
works or not so I run this and for
example I want to search city Frankfurt
Frankfurt
such and when I click search picture
shows search me the data so nothing is
happening let's see what's the error so
I found the error in this a try-catch
block I have given the URL and all I am
searching the data but I'm not passing
this URL to the web browser so what I
will do is after my if conditions all my
for if condition just below my if
condition I will pass my URL which is
this plus the search URL so I will write
web browser which is this web browser so
just go there and copy the name of this
web browser and then right dot navigate
in the bracket we will pass our query
address write query address dot to
string okay so now it should work so I
forgot to give this lines so it was not
showing the data in the web browser
let's run the program once again and
search for the city Frankfurt
fine put and click search and now you
can see you will be able to see the
search Frankfurt City in the map now if
you want to sort some Street and
Frankfurt so for example I want to
search the XIV Street in Frankfort and I
will click search and you can see so
many options in Frankfurt City for this
the street zeal in the same way you can
add the name of the state you can add
the zip code and search the data so I
hope you enjoyed this simple but very
useful tutorial and keep watching these
