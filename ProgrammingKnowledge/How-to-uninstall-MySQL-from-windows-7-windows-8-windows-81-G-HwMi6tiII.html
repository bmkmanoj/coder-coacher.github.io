how to install your MySQL so and MySQL
workbench from your Windows 7 computer
so let's get started first of all to
uninstall your MySQL go to your Start
button here and go to control panel and
then go to programs here and then click
programs and features and in here you
will find your MySQL software so let's
see these are my MySQL software so I
will click click it and press uninstall
so it will
remove this file from your PC but it's
not enough to remove these files from
here itself
but you need to delete all the file from
other location which I will show you in
some seconds so it's preparing to remove
the software
and it removes Microsoft in the same way
my SQL work bench I will remove
and it's moving
so basically what you need to do is
whatever file related to MySQL you need
to remove why of this process and when
you are done with these things then go
to your C Drive computer and go to this
folder program files 86 to see this I
will show you once again this is my
computer C Drive and in here I will go
to program 86 and in here you will find
this MySQL folder just delete this
folder okay it's deleted and then once
again go to your C C folder and go to
Program Files this thing and in here
also search for my SQL folder if it's
there at all in my case I cannot find my
SQL so if you have any MySQL folder just
delete it also and the third thing is
go here
go to this folder in your C file go to
program data some times for example in
my case I could not find directly this
holder into myseif see folders let's see
if I go there I cannot find that folder
here so I what I generally do is I will
just go this here and I will paste this
link see slash program data with no
space in between and I press ENTER and
it opens my folder program data and here
search for my SQL and if it's present
there just delete that folder also okay
and the third thing is
go to your computers see try and then go
to users and if this folder is present
app data click this and in here if you
find any my SQL folder just delete it
also so from these four folder you have
to delete your MySQL files and just
uninstall any MySQL software from here
and if you do that you have successfully
uninstalled your MySQL from your
computer so from the next time you will
be able to install a new MySQL software
or reinstall your new MySQL version of
software once again so I hope this will
help you and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
