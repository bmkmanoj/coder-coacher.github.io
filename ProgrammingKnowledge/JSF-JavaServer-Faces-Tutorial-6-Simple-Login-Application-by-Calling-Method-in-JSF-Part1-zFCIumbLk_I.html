video I will show you how to make a
simple login page with the help of your
JSF web application so till now what we
have is when I run the program in the
last five videos what I have made is I
have set the background I can go to the
next page by clicking this button I can
submit any text and it transfers it to
the next page and I in the last video I
have shown you how to use a checks so
that page doesn't refresh but here the
text refreshes right now in this video I
will clean some of the code which I
don't need and we will make a simple
login page so let's do it
so this Ajax code I have shown you in
the last video I am going to delete it
because in this video it's not required
and this navigation to the second page
also we don't require so we have this
image right now and we have this input
text and command button so this code I
have shown you in the fourth video when
I show you how to use managed bean and
this code I have shown you in the third
video I think when I showed you how to
set background image and foreground
images so I little clean my code and now
when I run the program it
has this submit button this textbox and
this image and when I click this button
it goes to the second page and it shows
some output whatever I enter inside this
box it shows here okay this also I do
not want I I don't want to show this
whatever I text show this enter text
here I don't want to show here but I
want to show if I enter some name here
name for example and when I click this
button it validates the name and it show
it will show the output whether my name
is correct so for example I have and the
right name and right password it shows
me the message that your username and
password is correct otherwise it will
show me the error message so let's see
how can I do this so in the second page
okay so in the third book I think in the
fourth video I have shown you this user
dot Java class and in this user dot Java
class I have this instance string
instance and I have made this getter and
setter method of this instance right in
the user class so if you don't know how
can how did I made this user dot Java
class and how I set this name instance
inside and get the setter then you can
go to the fourth video and see how I use
that now with this name I will also
declare one more string called password
for password so i will write string
password okay
and in the same way what I have used for
this name I will set the getter and
setter method for this password so I
will right click and then I will click
insert code and then I will choose
setter and gets getter and setter and I
will click this user and password okay
and I will click generate and it will
generate the getter setter method for my
password also so I have name I have get
us at the method for name and I have
password and I have get a setter method
for password I will declare one more
string for showing the message so I will
write private string and this is the for
example output I am as G this is the
variable name so this is the output
message variable and for this I will
create a getter method so I will just
right-click it inside gold getter and I
will just click this and I will generate
this getter method okay so I have a name
password and output message and for
output I have getter and for name and
password I have getter and setter method
now what you do is inside this user
class we will make a function so just go
below here so you don't need to go
outside this class just inside this
class we will make a method so here we
will make a method called
public void and let's say this method as
login okay and just this bracket and
break it closed and inside this method
we will declare a condition what
condition if your name dot equals
some name so you can give any name to
validate your name so for example I give
name itself so when I enter name in my
text box it should validate this name
and then what I will do is if this is
equal to name then I will set my this
output message as equal to
user name is correct
okay the same condition I can define for
password also so when my user name or
name and password is correct so I will
in this if bracket I will also provide
and password dot equals and inside this
let's say my password should be password
itself okay so these are the values
which we will validate so you can give
these value any value according to your
convenience so you will write user name
and pass word is correct okay
otherwise you can give else/if and like
it in bracket close else if name dot
equals
nothing null
or sorry or or we can define and
condition here once again password dot
equals null then we will show the
message output message same
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
