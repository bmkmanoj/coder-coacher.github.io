Java effects tutorial for beginners in
the last video we have seen how to use
unidirectional binding in Java effects
using properties in this video we will
see how to use bi-directional binding
with an example so let's get started so
I have created this sample project in
which I have this main dot Java class in
which I have added this main dot F XML
which I have created here ok and I also
have the main controller ok and by now I
think you know how to create them
everything right now is blank so I'm
going to first of all open my main dot F
XML file using the scene builder now in
the scene builder what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to the controls and
I'm going to take a slider from here
slider can be of two type horizontal
slider and vertical slider and both
works in the same way so right now I am
going to take a horizontal slider okay
and I'm going to take our text field
from here so take a text field and now I
am going to give them some ID so for the
slider I will go to the code and I will
give the FX ID slider to it and to the
text field I am going to give the ID
field for example okay and save your
code and one more thing I'm going to do
here is I want to link my controller
class to this F XML file so go to this
controller category on the left hand
side and then just choose the
application dot main controller from
here okay and then save your code and
then go to your Eclipse IDE here first
of all we are going to implement
initialize able so just implement
initialize able and implement the
unimplemented method from this
initialize able interface and now we are
going
to declare this slider field and the
text field so I will just create these
two fields and I will import the slider
javac scene control from here and one
more thing I'm going to do here is I'm
going to just declare a private static
variable so private static final double
and I will say this is my initial value
for the slider okay and I'm going to set
it as 50 for example okay now I'm going
to go to my initialize method and in
here we are going to first of all take
the slider object and we are going to
set the value here so just call a method
called set value which takes the double
as an argument which is the initial
value we want to provide an initial
value in our case is 50 so just pass
this initial value here and then you
need to take this field from here and we
are going to set some initial text to it
so just call set text and it takes the
string but we want to pass this double
as a string here okay so we will just
write new double and then take your
initial value from here and pass it here
and then call a two string okay so it
will convert this double value to string
now next what we want to do is we want
to set the bi-directional property to
this text field so that whenever we
change the slider the text field takes
this change or whenever we change the
text on the text field then the slider
value will change okay so take your
field and then call a method called text
property okay so just call this text
property and then we will call a method
called bind bi-directional which is for
setting the bi-directional property okay
and we are going to take
this and now this takes 2 arguments 1st
argument is the property of the element
which we want to set so we will just
take this slider and then call value
property of it ok and the second
argument is the format of the property
we want to change and in our case we
want to change the numerical property
right so we will just call number format
and then we will call a get number
instance property on it ok so just call
get number instance ok that's it our
code is finished now so what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to save my code
and I'm going to right click on my
project and refresh it and then I'm
going to run my project and my app is
running now and you can see the initial
value we have set to the text field and
the slider is 50 so slider is in the
middle because the minimum value of the
slider is 0 and maximum value of the
slider is 100 okay so we set 50 so it's
in the middle now let's change this
slider value so see if what happens in
the text field so whenever I change the
slider from here it's reflected in the
text view right now because it's a
bi-directional property we can set some
value here for example 70 and the slider
goes to 70 right or for example 10 and
the slider goes to 10 okay so it's kind
of bi-directional binding so it's value
is set in the both ways whenever you
change the slider it changes the value
in the textbox and whenever you change
the text box exchanged the well value in
the slider and this is how
bi-directional binding works in JavaFX
so that's it for this video I hope you
enjoy
