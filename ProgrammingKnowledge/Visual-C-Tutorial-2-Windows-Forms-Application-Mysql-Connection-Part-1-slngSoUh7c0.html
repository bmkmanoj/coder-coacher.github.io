we have seen how to make your first
visual C++ windows form application and
we have created a project called first
app and we have seen how to run this
project now I will show you how to
connect your windows form application
with a database and I'm gonna be using
my SQL to connect with my windows form
application in C++ and gradually as you
proceed with these videos you can see a
fully developed app with the help of
windows form application and MySQL will
be double developed so let's see how to
connect your windows form application
with MySQL and then we will see how to
make a log in log out page with these
two together so what you need to do in
order to connect your my SQL with your
Visual C++ form application is go to
your solution explorer C here and go to
your project
and right-click it and go to the
properties
and in here there is a first line called
common properties go here click it and
go to framework and references ok click
it also and you can go down and you can
see here add new reference and remove
reference so you need to click add new
reference and it will give you a list of
references yeah but in here also you
need to go to dotnet it contains five
tenths but you just click dotnet tab and
you can see so many applications before
that you make sure that you have
installed MySQL into your system MySQL
is a very good database to start with
and it's very easy to understand also
and if you don't know how to use MySQL I
have some time ago I have made a SQL
video for beginners so if you don't know
how to use it just go there and see
those videos I will also show you how
you can find my videos just go to my
channel programming knowledge you will
see some videos and on the right hand
side you can see featured playlists and
in here
can see my SQL tutorial for beginners so
you can just see them and make an
install MySQL and when you're my screen
is installed then you are good to go
with our application so we are on add
references and we have clicked dotnet
here and just go down scroll down and
find my SQL dot and data okay it has my
SQL dot dot CF but we don't want that
we'd want my SQL dot dot ax okay this
one and click OK from here okay and you
can see a new reference is added to our
application called MySQL dot and data ok
and just click OK once again
now we need to write a code to connect
to our database so go to your form dot H
which we have created this is a design
window and this is a code window so just
go there and if you don't know how to go
there just click on any component and it
will guide you to the form 1 cottage so
just go at the top of your program where
program pragma once is there a name
space your app and using namespace is
given now in here below your using
namespace system drawing you need to add
one more namespace so I will just copy
this namespace and paste it down and
then I will delete this in system
drawing and I need to write my SQL
remember this is case sensitive so
remember to write your code in case
sensitive manner
my scooter and then s Q client okay so
once this is done we are ready to write
the code to connect to our database so
just go to your design not etch and for
example if you want to connect to our
database when we click this okay button
so how do we do that we will see just
double click this okay button and by
default you can go to its action
performed method and this is it's action
performed method go in between this
method this will be blank so just make
some space here and in here we need to
write
string
campsite
you can find this sign below your exit
escape button so if you in case if you
don't find it and then right
Khanh strength is equal to L and then
make double quote and close your quotes
and then these double quotes we will
make a connection to our database so now
you need to open your MySQL database
which is here and it looks like this
MySQL development and if you don't know
how to open it just go and open my SQL
work bench from here and just go to the
top here and in these menu bars go to
database okay and then I then go to
query database
okay and any of you will find some
details of your database okay so this is
your host name this is the port name and
this is a user name and you must have
provided your password also so just
remember your password when you have
installed your MySQL so
you are going to be neat this this this
and your password for connecting MySQL
to application so we will go back yeah
and we will right here and between
double quotes we will write dot source
is equal to and go there and you can
write this also in your data source or
if you are running on the same computer
or same PC your MySQL and your app on
the same PC then you can write localhost
also for that so just try it yeah I am
writing localhost because I'm running my
MySQL database and the app which is
Windows C++ app on the same computer so
I will write local host here and then I
will
right a semicolon then I need to write
the port port is equal to you can see
both here port is 3 3 6 0 and username
is root so you go to our application and
we'll write 3 3 0 6 I think and then
white a semi colon and white username is
equal to my username is root and then
once motion semicolon and white password
and my password is root also so my
username and password is root and root
which I am running on localhost so just
write that and in the second line right
why
still connection
and just this gap sign
slowly okay
and then right on database is equal to G
