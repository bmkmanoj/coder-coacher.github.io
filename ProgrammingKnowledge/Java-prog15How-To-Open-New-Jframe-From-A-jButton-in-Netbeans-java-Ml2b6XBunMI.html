going to show you how to open a new
jframe by clicking J button so let's get
started first of all create a new jframe
imitates user for
theme
and click finish this is a new jframe
I'm going to open this frame by clicking
the button shows drag button from
palette name it new for example I
mimicked things new because I'm a new
jframe right-click it not relevant
action action performed and in this
method in the source code you have to
write
our new J frames name which is user Eno
my mistake I made spelling mistake so
let's use a Eno slash underscore frame
so write the name use no underscore
frame and give any name and parameters s
is equal to zero
same name user Eno
break it and ragged claws and
right s which is this s after user frame
this as s dot set
s dot scepter sorry
that
visible
it's equitable you are 22 this is the
simple way you can this is the just two
line code which you have to write and if
you want to close the previous window
before opening this jframe you have to
call the close method which already
teach you I think the eight tutorial how
to close the previous jframe when
opening new jframe so if you have any
doubt refer to with your number eight I
think this three line code you have to
write and you can open new frame by
clicking the gym so let's run the
program
five
and this is a problem when when I click
new it comes but it goes
instantly because one direction you have
to make and making them you jframe is go
to the property and in default close
operation instead of exit on close just
click this pose ok once again instead of
exists on close you have to select this
pose and enough previous fifth flame
also click the frame whole frame and in
the properties you have to select
default close operation this is the
whole frame I I was clicking so this is
the property of the whole frame so click
any pre space go to the property and
change it from exit on close to dispose
now let's try to run the program
and now when we click new a new deer
frame opens and our previous different
closes that was a small tutorial how to
open new jframe by NJ button
I think you have enjoyed I hope you have
enjoyed and please rate comment and
subscribe thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
