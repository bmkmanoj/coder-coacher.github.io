video I am going to show you how to use
if conditions and what RF conditions in
C so as the name suggests if condition
or if statements check the condition
whether it is true or false and on the
basis of the condition it executes some
code or it will not execute some other
code okay so how we can declare as F
condition now I will give you an example
first for example we want that we want
to check some person's age and if this
age is equal to 18 you want to print
that the age is 18
if this age is greater than 18 we want
to print that the age is greater than 18
and if this age is smaller than 18 then
also we want to print that this age is
smaller than 18 so how we can do this we
can do this by if conditions now to
write if condition the structure looks
like this you need to use this if
statement or if keyword and then these
two brackets and inside these two
brackets comes your condition so this
condition can be true or false so we
evaluate our condition inside this
bracket okay and then in these curly
brackets we execute some code on the
basis of the you know validity of this
condition if this condition is true the
code inside this curly braces will be
executed otherwise this code will not be
executed now let us see how we can check
the age of some person now for taking
the age from the user at runtime we use
can
F and you know I have all also you know
shown that this can f you can use to
take the inputs from the user right so I
will just tell the user first by
printing this message that please enter
the age and in using the scanf I will
take this input and because this age is
an integer I will use this modulus D to
take the integer and then comma then the
age okay but the correct way of using
scanf with any value is to use this and
the symbol before your value variable
name and what this and symbol indicate
is the address of this value okay so in
somewhere in your computer memory your
variable will be stored okay and
whenever you write this end in your
before your valuable name it indicates
that your you are scanning the address
of this variable okay so whenever some
user will enter some value it will be
stored at this address and we can access
this age value after that so whenever I
will execute this program you will
understand it better so it will take the
input and depending upon the age the
user has entered for example the age if
the age is greater than 18 or 18 we will
print that the age is so if the age is
greater than 18 we are checking the some
condition here this is our condition age
age is greater than 18 and in here we
are going to print or execute some code
for example print
something that the age is greater than
eighteen greater than eighteen okay now
for example we want to check that if the
age is equal to eighteen then we can use
some more F conditions so if the age is
equal to eighteen now to calculate or to
compare equal to we need to use double
equal sign because when if you use
single equal to sign it will assign 18 -
H but we want to compare these two
values and to compare these two values
we use double equal to here okay
now if the age is equal to 18 then we
will print the age is equal to 18 okay
equal to 18 and here greater then now
for example we want to check if the age
is less than 18 once again we can use
this by F condition and this time we
check if the age is less than and less
than symbol is this one less than okay
if the age is less than then just write
less then okay so we are going to check
these three conditions if this condition
is true this will be executed if this
condition is true this one if age is it
equal to 18 then this will be executed
otherwise if this condition is true then
this code will be executed so this is
condition based code execution I will
build the program and run the program
and first of all we are going to see
this message please enter the age and we
are going to enter the age so it says
please enter the age I am going to enter
the age for example
enter the age 21 21 is greater than 18
so we are expecting this message to be
executed and because these condition are
not met match then these code or these
printf messages will not be printed so
let us see the output just write 21 and
press ENTER and it says age is greater
than 18 which is true age the age is
greater than 18 so this condition is
true that is why we can see this message
and because this condition is is not
equal to 18 21 is not equal to 18 then
this one is not executed and 21 is not
less than 18 so this condition is not
executed as well but 21 is greater than
18 so this condition is true and this
message will be printed now let us try
to run this program once again now this
time we will enter 18 okay
and now this time we can see the message
the age is equal to 18 okay so age is
equal to 18 because 18 is equal to 18
this condition is true and this is
printed and other conditions are not
true so their code is not executed once
again we enter the age 15 and the third
condition is true this time age is less
than 18 15 is less than 18 so it says
the age is less than 18 which is this
message so in this way you can use if
conditions in C I hope you have
understood this concept please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
