video I will show you how to make your
report in landscape form so normally
when you run your program and when you
click the report I have shown you in the
last tutorials it shows in this form
which is a regular form so its height is
bigger than its width in the landscape
form we are going to rotate it and we
are going to show this report into the
landscape form in a pore size page so I
will show you how to do that in your
report so go to your report
event action action performed and here
you have written your report code and
this I have shown you in the last videos
on I text and here you have to go in
this try casual vlog and when you
declare your document document is equal
to new document this line this is the
first line of creating a document go
here and here you have to write document
document is equal to new document and in
the bracket you should write page
sighs
not
people here you can set your
paid sighs in what which size you want
to wage and here you select rotate so
this you have to write in the document
declaration page size dot a 4.0 date and
this is just a small code which will
convert your normal report into the
landscape size report so let's see run
and see how our program looks like and
when I click report
my report is saved and it opens in the
landscape form you can see its width is
bigger than its height so in this way
you can convert your normal PDF report I
text report into the landscape home so
this was a small tutorial I hope you
have enjoyed and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
