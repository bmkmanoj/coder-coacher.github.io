tutorial on android app development for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to install android studio on our
Windows operating system and how we can
to the Android studio SDK configuration
so in this category we have done some an
SDK configurations and we have
downloaded some default packages right
and the most important package was this
one which was Intel x86 emulator
accelerator so if this is not installed
you may want to install it because our
emulator will run on this ok so in this
is in extras so make sure it's installed
now once this is done we are ready to
create our first Android application now
in here in the Quick Start menu you will
see some options the first option is the
start a new Android studio project so we
will click this option and then you can
give the name to your Android
application now its encouraged to start
the name of your application with a
capital letter for example my
application or I can change this to my
first application for example my first
app right but if you do or if you start
the name by a small letter you can see a
small little warning here which says the
application name of most app begin with
an uppercase so it's encouraged to you
know give your app name with a capital
letter
now here second thing here is the
company domain name right now we are at
the starting of our you know learning
cycle so we will leave it as default but
in the later
you know later exercises or later videos
you may want to change it to your
personal domain name this is the
location where your project will be
saved so see user name Android studio
project and the name of your project so
just click Next and we are going to
develop our application for phone and
tablet you can even make a Android
application for TV or variable
technologies like watches or Google
glass but right now we will concentrate
only on this phone and tablet
application and in here this is in
stress interesting in here it says the
lower API level target more devices but
have your feature available right so
it's on you
how much audience you want to reach so
right now by default this Android 4.0.3
is selected which covers 87% of all the
devices right so for example if you
choose the latest version which is
Android 5 it covers right now 0% almost
0% devices and if you go to KitKat it
covers only 24% of the devices and
generally you may want to make some
application which covers almost all the
devices and have a backed backward and
forward compatibility so for example if
we choose this Android 2.2 it means that
it will cover 100% of devices which will
run on your newer devices and on all the
devices so choose the one which covers
the most percentage of devices for
example this Android Froyo right click
Next
and in here this is the name of your you
know blank activity and in here you can
give the name of your activity now what
is activity activity is nothing but you
can say up section or page of your
application similarly if you consider or
if you compare this activity with our
Android app with some website an
activity can be a home page or about
page or some other page so an activity
you can compare to a page of a website
right now once everything is done you
can just finish
you
and now this is for the first time we
are running our application so I will
just try to you know run this
application and I want to you know print
this hello world on my running Android
emulator right so of for the first time
when you open this Android studio you
can even do open your Android SDK
manager from here itself this is the
small Android button here which says SDK
manager you can just open this and in
here if you haven't done your SDK
manager or if you need to do some
settings for SDK manager you can open it
from here itself right so right now
nothing is required so I will close this
now the other button here is for AVD
manager and AVD manager is the full form
of Android virtual device manager and
this AVD manager you can use to set your
default Android device for which you are
going to run your application so by
default its Nexus 5 in my case this can
be different if you are watching this
video in future but by default it is
going to give you a default device right
so we will leave this device as default
for now but you can you know create your
own devices by clicking this create
button and this we are going to see in
the further videos but for now we will
just concentrate on our default device
now in here in the default device in the
actions you can take three actions one
is to launch your AVD emulator second is
the added you can add it your
configurations of your device so you can
just click this pencil button and in
here all the settings of your device you
can see okay
and in the show advanced settings you
can even do some advanced settings for
example RAM settings or VM heap or
internal storage right so for now by
default I can see this Ram is 1 5 3 6
which I think we need to change but for
now I will leave it as default because I
want to run my application and see if
any error occurs we will change this Ram
because sometimes whenever you for the
first time run your emulator it gives
this error ok so I will just close this
and I will press this green triangle
button here which is for running our
application just click this and now it's
so wait in for abd which is end a abd
and now it will run or execute your
asked so it's the second intuition thing
which isin to choose and we only have
one device which was the default day we
will choose that so I will wait for this
device manager to appear so this is the
launched emulator and the default
divided a device is Nexus 5 which was
our default device I will just leave it
as it is and click OK and now hopefully
it will run but sometimes you can see it
gives you this error and the error says
that x86 emulator currently requires
hardware acceleration please and show
that haxm is properly installed
so this is the common
Android you know problem whenever you
run your first Android application so
don't worry we are going to solve it and
to solve it what we need to do is just
see the location of your SDK file which
is the phone in the first line so this
is the location where your SDK folder is
there so just copy this path until as DK
which is which will be something like C
colon slash user just use a name slash
app data slash local slash and roy slash
sdk so just copy this part from here and
open your file manager and paste this
path and this will open your SDK folder
and your SDK folder there will be a
folder called extras and X in this
extras folder there will be a folder
called Intel and in this Intel folder
there will be a folder called hardware
accelerated execution manager which has
the short form of haxm right so that we
will go inside this and there is a
executable file which we need to install
in order to install this Android
emulator so we will click this
application executable file which is
intel haxm - Android executable file I
will just run this and just click Next
and this can be different for different
devices the default value of ram can be
different for different devices if you
have the you know larger RAM or memory
you can have more you know memory here
or otherwise or depending upon the you
know space you have so right now for me
its 2gb it can be 1gb for you know other
devices or it can be a 4gb for
some other just click Next and install
so now the ins
of haxm is complete so we will click
finish and now we will close everything
and we are going to run our application
so I'm going to close this browser for
now and now I'm going to run our
application once again so this one is
finished minimize it and let's run our
application by clicking the screen
button and hopefully this time we will
not see the same error we will choose
the default application from here and
now we will wait for the message and
some seconds we are going to see the
response so in here we are going to see
the response any movement and here we
can see now the application is
successfully launched so it says HX is
working and it's started so now for the
first time this Android will load this
is an emulator on which our application
will run so now Android will start or
Android emulator will start and once
this emulator starts our application is
going to run on it so it will work like
an Android application or Android you
know device and we just need to unlock
it when this is you know ready
so now just drag this up upwards and the
lock will be you know open and now we
just need to click OK and just wait for
our hello world - you know compile and
appear here so now it's going to up
yeah hello world and you can see the
hello world message we are able to see
so this is our application which is
running on this Android emulator so I
hope you have enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
