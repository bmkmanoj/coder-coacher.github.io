you how you can configure and set up
Scala on your IntelliJ IDEA IDE so let's
get started so here is my IntelliJ IDEA
IDE welcome window so first of all what
I need to do is I need to install the
Scala
plug-in and then we are going to create
a scholar project so to install a Scala
prague mean you just need to go here
where it says configure and then you
need to choose the plugins option here
so go to configure and then choose the
plugins options and then here just
choose this option which says install
JetBrains plugins ok so when you search
here
Scala you will not see any result
because you need to search in this
section which is called install
JetBrains plug-in ok so I'm going to
just click this option first of all and
then you can see Scala I can see this
option which is called scholar language
ok so just select this option and then
click the screen button which says
install which is going to install this
plug-in on your IntelliJ IDEA IDE so for
now I will wait for this installation to
go on and once it's finished we are
going to just create our first caller
project so now the Scala plugin is
installed in IntelliJ IDEA IDE and it's
telling me to restart the IntelliJ IDEA
IDE so I'm going to just click this
button which says restart IntelliJ IDEA
which is going to restart this IDE once
again and now once this IntelliJ IDEA
IDE has been restarted we are ready to
create our new Scala project so what we
need to do next is we just need to
create a new project so we are going to
just click this button which says create
a new project and now when this new
project window opens you will be able to
see Scala option here and let's say we
want to create a SBT Scala project so we
are going to choose the SBT option here
on the right hand side and then we are
going
- click Next and here you just need to
give the name to your project for
example hello Scala for example is the
name of my project and then the project
SDK is automatically selected for me if
you want to change it you will see the
options to change it in this drop-down
menu ok
the SBT version is also selected
automatically and Scala version is also
here selected if you want the older
version of Scala you can choose it from
here but for now I'm going to choose the
latest version and now you can see this
option which says create directories for
empty content route automatically ok so
I will leave this as default and then
download sources sources for SBT plug-in
is going to just download these sources
for SBT plugins and sources so I'm going
to leave them also as default and I'm
going to just click finish which is
going to create my Scala project so now
this project has been created I'm going
to close this tip of the day option and
then on the left hand side you can see
hello Scala option here just click on
this option which says hello Scala just
double-click on this is going to open
this kind of window here and then we are
going to just open our project you can
see there are some directories here
which is project for example or build
dot SPD file is there and you can see
here at the bottom it's installing some
plugins or some files related to SBT so
you just need to let this process to go
on once all the SBT plugins or SBT files
are installed we will be able to you
know create our Scala files also right
by the meantime what we are going to do
is we are going to create our source
directory and
directory so just right click on your
project and then go to new and then
select the option which says directory
and in here we are going to just create
a directory structure which is SRC
forward slash main four slash Scala and
then click OK and you will see this
directory structure is created here
similarly for creating the target
directory we are going to just right
click on the project once again and go
to new and then directory once again and
here just right target power slash Scala
ok and then click OK
who is going to create this directory
structure also right now you can see
this download what is going on so I'm
going to leave this to finish so once
this SBT downloads are complete we are
going to start creating our first Scala
file ok so let the process to complete
first of all you can see the progress in
the bottom bar here so once this process
is complete we are going to just create
our skull of files right this is one
time process so you just need to let it
run for the first time and from next
time hopefully it picks up automatically
all the required files now in between
this process you will see this kind of
pop-up window which says project
structure and then you will be able to
see this ok button you just need to
click OK here and you will see some
extra directories generated inside our
source main directory so these this
directory structure we have created
right and some of drag trees are
generated by SPT and Scala plugin for us
which is Java directory and the resource
folder similarly in the targets also
some of the directories and some of the
files are automatically generated by
this plugin for us so next what we are
going to do is we are going to just
right click on the directory which we
have created which is Scala which is
under source main so just right
Scala and then first of all let's create
a package let me name it as demo for
example and then click OK and inside the
demo directory we are going to just
create a Scala object for example so I'm
going to just click on Scala class and
then I'm going to change it to object
first of all and let's say this object
is called demo once again okay and then
click OK
which is going to generate this demo
object and you can see this object is
created here under the package demo so
inside this demo object we are going to
just create a main method first of all
and then we are going to just print
hello world using print Ln and inside
the brackets just write hello world in
double quotes okay so this is the main
entry point for your scala project which
is the main method as you may know also
from java language for example so now
the last step is to run our project so
what we are going to do is we can just
right click on the file itself so just
right click on this file itself and then
just click run demo is going to compile
and then run your project and now I can
see hello world printed on this console
here so this is how you can configure
and set up scala
on your IntelliJ IDEA IDE I hope you
