last video I have shown you how to show
the corresponding value in the text
boxes whenever you select some item in
the combo box so for example I have
selected this name in the combo box the
corresponding values for example the
employee ID surname and age will appear
here in these text boxes I select some
other name the corresponding value will
occur appear here or some other name and
the corresponding value appears here now
in this video I want to show you how to
do the same for example I select some
row in this table and I want to show the
corresponding value in these in these
text boxes or text fields how you can do
it I will show you in this video ok so
whenever I selects for example Julie the
employee ID of Julie should appear here
and the age or Julia should appear here
and the surname of Julie will appear
here so how we can do it I will show you
in this video so if you are following my
video whenever I have shown you how to
link at this Jay table
with the database value I I told you to
enclose this with a scroll pane so
whenever you select this table for
example whenever you want to select this
table you will not see this table here
in the properties and so you you are
unable to see the table view because it
is enclosed by the scroll pane right so
you cannot select this table directly so
what you need to do is you need to go to
these components here and find your
scroll pane and it just expand this
scroll pane and you will find the table
here now you will be able to select this
table item from here okay so go to
scroll pane and go to table component
here and then right-click your table
okay so right-click your table in this
component and go to add event handler
and then go to mouse and mouse click
event
so on the basis of mouse click click
event on table we are going to show the
values in the text field okay once again
I will show you go to the scroll pane
search for the scroll pin and inside the
scroll pane you will find the table
because we have enclosed our table
inside the scroll pane just right-click
this table add event handler go to mouse
and click mouse click click ok and we
reach to the mouse click event of this
table here and is in this small click
event of this table we are going to
write our code ok so I will just take a
sample code which I have written in the
last video so what was that sample code
in the last video I have shown you how
to show corresponding values in these
text boxes right on the basis of
selected value so I will go to the
action perform of this method or this
action perform of this combo box and
once again I go to the extreme perform
method or this I will go to this table
here once again right click add event
handler
mouse mouse click and in this mouse
click event I will paste this all code
okay so the code which I have written in
the last video I will be using the same
code in this video but with a little
change okay so by now you already know
what this code is doing I have this
try-catch blog which handles the
exception I write the query and then I
prepare a prepared statement pause the
query in this prepared statement with
the help of this connection and this is
the result I am getting with the help of
result set and then I show the values in
here but for the value which is selected
in the table we need to have the row or
some values from the row so that on the
basis of that we can select the select
the or you can show the value in the
text field okay so what we need to do is
outside my try block or you can do it
inside your try block it does not matter
what you need to do is just declare a
variable called int row and we will take
a row value from the table so then just
select the name of your table dot get
selected row okay
selected row and this will return you
whatever you row you selected or
whatever row you selected by your mouse
okay
this is mouse click event right and then
we pass the selected row and we will
find the value of for example I want to
find the employee ID and on the basis of
employee ID I will find or I will query
the database okay so I get the row now I
want to get the for example string
e ID because I want to get the e ID from
the selected row and I will give a
little underscore here on the score is
it call on the spoon okay whatever and
then I will say is equal to and the
bracket and then I will close this
bracket and inside this bracket I will
pass the name of my table which is table
itself dot get model okay
get model dot get value at so write get
value at and then this takes two
argument right first will be so this
this two argument will be the column
value and the row value so first
argument will be the row value so I
already have the row value right row
which is selected so I will just copy
this and pass it here as the first
argument and the second argument is the
column which we have selected so we will
write column 0 okay and then this is an
objects we need to convert this to the
string so just write dot to string okay
so it will convert your whatever value
you have selected the row and the 0th
column which is a employee ID column
right so column 0 is an employee ID
column that is why I have taken 0 and
the row will be given by the selected
row so in a way I am getting the
employee ID from the table ok on and on
the basis of this employee ID I will I
will query the database ok so now our
query will be in the string query select
all or star from employee ID where then
e ID because I am squaring the database
on the base
of Eid because I have a Eid from the
table so I will ride e ID e ID is just a
column in my database if you do not know
okay I I D and then is equal to the
value which is there in this string so
is equal to single code inside double
quotation inside plus plus and just pass
this Eid inside these plus plus sign
okay
a mistake just pass I want to just copy
this and pass it here okay
so now my query is select all from my
table name where E is
because I got a ID from my table which
is whatever row is selected and Eid is
equal to whatever we selected in the row
right then we create a prepared
statement connect connection got
prepared statement query and then we do
not need this line so we delete this and
then we execute the query result set is
equal to RS is equal to PS T dot is the
cute query so we executed the query and
in the while loop until analyst we are
getting the values from the database
what we have done in the last video we
are transferring the values which we get
from the database for example we get RS
dot get string from employee ID column
and we pass it to the employee ID text
field same we have done for the text
field for the name so we pass the value
to the text field whatever value we get
from the database from the column name
to the text field name so this will be
our code to show the corresponding
values in the text field whenever we
select some row in the table let us try
and run the program run the program
and for example I select employer ID 6
just see here if it changes or not
employee ID 6 and changes their
corresponding value appears here
employee ID 5 corresponding values of
here say 4 3 2 1 ok so in this way you
can show the corresponding values in
your text field whenever you select any
row or any cell in your table
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
