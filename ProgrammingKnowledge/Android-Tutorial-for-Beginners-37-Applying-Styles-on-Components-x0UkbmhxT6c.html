tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will learn
how we can apply styles to the
components in android so for example I
have these two large text and two
buttons here so I want to change the
style of these text boxes and these
buttons one way of doing this is just
select your text area or text box and go
to the property here and change the
properties as you wish the other way of
doing this is go to the folder called
values here and then go to the file
called styles dot XML and here we can
define the styles to our components
right so let's see how we can do this so
first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remove all the styles which are
by default given to these text box and
this button so I will go to the text
section of this activity and I will
remove the layout width layout height
and text appearance from here okay for
each and every component so I will do it
for text view and I will do it for a
button like this okay
now you will notice when you go to the
design it will give you this rendering
problem because we have just deleted the
layout width and layout height and
appearance of these text boxes and
button right now to give the styles
which you want you just need to go to
this styles XML file and in here we can
define a style for example first of all
you just need to give this style
attribute here and then the name of the
style so the name of the style depends
upon you but it should be unique name
for example my tile one for example
right and then just close the style
right and inside the style you can add
some items related to
appearance or width or height or
whatever right so we can add an item and
then we can decide what item or what
attribute we want to add so for example
I want to add the text style to the text
view right so I will do this and then
inside the textile I can write bold okay
in the same way I can add one more item
for example item and this time I want to
change the text color right so text
color now for the text color what you
can do is you can search on your browser
the web color Wikipedia page and in here
you can find all the web colors and
their code right so for example I want
to choose this red color I can choose it
from copying this hash and FF and then
for zeros from here right so copy it go
to your project and paste it here and
with the hash and you will notice it
will show a red color here right so we
know it's red color right now we will
add one more item and this time we want
to choose the text appearance
okay so choose text appearance and close
it here and for the text appearance you
can give Android style and then the text
appearance and then the large text
appearance so you can just choose large
okay and now we can define the layout
width and layout height of the style
okay so just add an item here and then
we will choose Android layout width
first so layout width and this will be
for example match parent and in the same
way we can just copy this
this time we can choose the layout
height right so layout height and this
will be for example wrap content okay so
this is our first style which we can do
in the same way we can define multiple
styles with different names so for
example I want to add one more style I
can do it like this but this time I will
give it a name my style too and this
time the textile will be for example
italic and this color let's choose some
other color from here for example I want
to choose the green color I will just
copy this and paste it here right so it
will become the green color okay now in
order to give the style to your button
or text boxes you just need to go to the
text here and in here you just need to
give the style attribute so give style
and then style and then choose your
style so if your style is my style one
for example you can do it like this and
in the text view second also you can
inherit from this style and for example
for buttons I want to give the style too
so my style two here right and for the
second button also I want to do this
okay and now when you go to the design
you will see the text with bold and red
color and button with italic and green
color right so in this way you can apply
styles to your component in Android I
