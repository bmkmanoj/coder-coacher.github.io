show you how you can download and
install and activate Microsoft Office
2013 Pro Plus on your Windows 7 or
Windows 8 operating system so first of
all you need to download Microsoft
Office from official Microsoft website
so I am going to give the link in the
description so that you can directly
click that link and you can go to this
Microsoft website so just click that
link and after clicking that link it
will open Microsoft webpage and in here
we need to sign in to download our
Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013
so if you already have Microsoft account
you need to sign in to you know get the
axis of the download so just click this
sign in button from here and it will
open the this webpage where you have to
sign in otherwise if you don't have
Microsoft account you may choose to
create a new Microsoft Office account or
otherwise you just need to give your
username and password so I am going to
give my username and my password for
Microsoft account and once I have
entered my username and password I am
going to sign in and once I have been
sign-in this Microsoft website now I
will be able to register and continue so
you will be able to see the screen
button called register to continue just
click this button here and will open our
registration form you just need to fill
this registration form this was really
easy and the important stuff here is to
choose the version you want to install
so the version I want to install for my
windows is 64-bit and just choose that
and go
down and just fill all the form and just
press this continue button once you
click this continue button you will be
redirected to the next page where you
will be prompted to choose the language
of your choice so in here you can choose
from these different languages I am
going to choose English and just click
this radio button called English if you
speak English and click this continue
button and this will redirect me to the
download link ok but one thing is if you
don't have this official installer it
will prompt you to download the official
installer so by the meantime this is
redirecting to the next link I am going
to create a text document and why I'm
creating this text document is because I
am going to copy my key which I am going
to generate from this Microsoft website
and I am going to copy this in this text
editor so text the document so that I
can you know use this key to install
Microsoft Office ok so once this is done
and it says if you don't really have a
Microsoft installer you just need to
need a an installer first to install
office ok so I am going to install
installer for installing Microsoft
Office first and then I will be able to
download the Microsoft Office ISO file
so this is just installing or
downloading that installer first ok so
once this download is complete what I am
going to do is I am going to run the
executable file but just copy this key
this we are going to use in the later
section so that this is the authorized
egg activation key so you this need this
key you need in order to activate your
Microsoft Office right so just copy this
key by the meantime my download is
complete so I'm going to run the
executable file for the Installer and
it's really a straightforward
installation so you just need to agree
with the terms and conditions and you
just need to click Next and once the
installation is complete you will be
ready to download Microsoft Office ISO
file
so I will wait for this installation to
complete and once this installation is
complete what I am going to do is I am
going to once again go to the Microsoft
Office website the same website and I am
going to or I'm going to try once again
downloading that Microsoft Office this
installer you need to install to install

will press close and once again I will
go to the website and in here I will

button so that this time I will be able
to download my microsoft access or not

same procedure you need to fill this
form
press Continue button and once you press
continue button you will be redirected
to the language page continue once again
and now you will be able to see this
Microsoft Office ISO file you just need
to save this file at your specified
location so you can save it anywhere of
the local for the location you can
choose any folder and once this is saved
you can extract it in three ways you can
either mount it or you can use WinRAR to
extract this file so I am going to use
WinRAR to
correct this is Oh file and I will
extract this file to the same folder but
first of all I will make a different
folder to extract this file so I will
make a folder called
office I will name it as office and in
this folder I am going to extract my ISO
file which I have downloaded this is
image file also you can say it's IMG
file also it's also called IMG file so I
am extracting this file to the office
folder which I have recently created and
once this extraction is complete I will
go to the folder once again and in here
I will be able to see this folder and
these many files inside this office
folder so what I want to do is I want to
go to this folder and I will be able to
see the setup application file here so I
just need to double click this setup
executable file it's right at the bottom
so just click it and click yes and now
your installation for the office is
starting just accept the agreement
continue and install now and it will
take about few minutes five two to five
minutes to install it so this process
will complete in few minutes and once
this process is complete you will be
able to see the installation is complete
and that when you go to this tile menu
once again and go here you will be able
to see these office outlook Word or
documents here so you just need to click
one of the office tool
