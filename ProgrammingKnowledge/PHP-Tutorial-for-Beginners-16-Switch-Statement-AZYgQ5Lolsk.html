show you how to use switch cases in your
PHP programming switch cases is also one
of the conditional statement in PHP and
generally you can use switch cases if
you have multiple conditions to check so
let's see how we can use which cases so
for example I have for example a
variable called the number and I
initialize this value a is equal to 1
and I want to check whether this whether
the value of this number is 1 or not or
whatever ok so I can use it using I can
use switch cases to evaluate death for
example I can write switch and then it
should be switch like this with a
keyword switch and then it ends like
this
so I already told you that whenever you
want to evaluate different condition or
more than one condition you can use
switch cases so we have case in switch
like this and we can evaluate this case
but first of all switch cases takes an
argument whatever you want to evaluate
first so for example I want to evaluate
the value of number and on the basis of
this value I want to decide some
messages for example so I can do it like
this switch case 1 and this would be :
and then I can just echo this echo and I
can write number is 1 ok and then I can
just break the switch cases whenever my
condition is met I can just write break
keyword for them and in the same way I
can evaluate multiple conditions for
example 1 2 3 here I will write 2 3 and
I can just save it and let's see what is
the result so I just click the switch
for PHP and the result is number is 1
right so you can check multiple
conditions using switch cases so if the
number for example I assign this number
a value of 2 then I should see this
message right I'll just refresh it and
number is 2 in a similar way number is 3
save it and number 3 but for example I
provide some net random number here 344
then what should happen nothing is
happening right now it because no
condition is meant that means you cannot
print any result ok so you can just
catch this condition which is a no
condition is true by using this keyword
default okay and this default says that
if none of the above condition is true
this default will be executed right so I
can say number not found okay and then
let me make it a little bigger big
little bit smaller so you can see this
and I will save this
and now when I run this it says number
not formed so this default is like else
condition when none of the above
condition is true then this message will
be shown and it's not necessary that
this switch case will only work with
your numbers it can work with for
example the string values so for example
I want to show some grade of the student
okay and for example this grade is
capital a right and in here also I can
just provide capital a and in the same
way capital B and capital C and if
student get capital a here I will just
echo excellent and if he gets me I just
echo very good and if he gets C I can
say need improvement for example right
and in this default condition I can say
no grades found right so right now I
have assigned grade is equal to a but I
need to pass this variable as a
condition here and switch cases and then
when I save this you will be able to see
excellent
because grade is a right now for example
I want that if grade is capital a or
small a I want to print excellent okay
so I can achieve this by writing
something like this a small a and
Capital a case small a case capital a
but in between these two cases there
will be no break sign so what this break
does is it evaluate the condition and
for example this condition is true it
prints the matched message and breaks
from this statement and it goes to the
last right but whenever you don't
provide any break then your condition
will go here or the your program will go
here it will see that the grade is a but
not there is no break so it will jump to
the second condition and sees that grade
is capital a and it will print this and
now it sees that it the grade the there
has been a break so it will go out of
this statement okay so this is also you
can say it's a replica of or so if grade
is small a or capital a you will print
this message right so you can say
whenever you don't provide any break
statement in between it will jump to the
directly to the next case and this two
cases are considered to be in or
condition case a or capital case a is
true then this map this will be printed
in a similar way I can just use this and
small P and here small C right save it
and I will provide for example small B
let's see what happens I can see very
good right so if I provide small B or
capital B I will see this message but
the condition is you should not provide
break in between these two
so in this way you can use switch cases
to evaluate multiple conditions in PHP I
