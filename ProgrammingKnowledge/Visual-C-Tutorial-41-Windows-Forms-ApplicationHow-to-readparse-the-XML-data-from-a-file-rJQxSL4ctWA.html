video I will show you how to parse XML
file with the help of visual C++ windows
form application so right now I have
this XML file and in this I have some
data so I think if you are watching this
video you already know what are XML
files so I just want to show that this
is a list of breakfast menu and it has
some food data so for example food
Belgian waffles its price and its
description and then how much calorie it
contained and then the other break first
name and the price and description and
calories so this is the root breakfast
menu is the root and this is the
elements and this inside the elements
this is the text right if I'm not
mistaken
so I want to pass this data I want to
list out all the elements this and all
the text which it contains so let's see
how I have done I have made a program I
have taken a mocking list box 1 and list
box to in list box - I am going to list
out the elements and enlist boss 1 I am
going to list out the texts which the
elements contain so I will choose XML
file and when I select the XML file you
see all the value of elements like food
name price description comes here and
all the text of these elements come here
so food name is Mel Jean waffle and
price is five point nine five and
description as this so let's see what
how I have done that so I have taken two
list box for that list box one and list
box two and name I have left the default
which is list box one and mystery list
was to have taken a button to choose a
file dialog and I will choose the path
of the file by clicking this button and
then pass the XML file and show into
these list boxes so now what I will do I
will double click this button so I will
go to the event of this button click for
XML pass and here here I have written
the code for
the first line is for opening the file
dialog so this is the Declaration of
Open File dialog this is the variable
name is equal to GC new Open File dialog
and if the path is correct
so I will write if Open File dialog
which is this arrow point the show
dialog is equal to system double colon
windows double colon forms double colon
result dialogue double colon ok so if
the path in the dialogue is okay then I
will go to pass the XML file and then I
declare XML text Vida is equal to a X
reader this is the variable name is
equal to GC new XML text reader and I
will pass the path of the file into the
XML Reader which is this variable here
ok and then I have made a while loop y
x-reader continues reading so X reader
arrow pointer read bracket bracket close
and in the while loop I have provided
two cases by switch conditions so make a
switch condition and in switch condition
I will I am reading the node types so X
reader arrow point the node type in the
case 1 if the node type is the element
then it will print the values into the
list box too and if it's a text it will
list out the value in
the text list box form so right case XML
node type is equal to element or a
double colon element this is the case
then this box arrow pointing items
you're going to add all the names so
x-reader which is our this variable
arrow point the name so all the names of
the element will be printed in the list
box too and in case two xml type node
type physical double colon text then the
values will come english box one so
let's box one arrow point the items
arrow point to add x-reader at a point
of values so write this and then after
your while loop is complete and your
switch conditions are complete and you
need to close this reader so x-reader
arrow pointer close so this is the code
for passing this XML file so if you want
to copy the codes just pause the video
and just copy the code from here
okay and
now when I run my program and I will
select XML file obviously and all the
elements comes on the list box too and
all the text will come in list box 1 so
in this way you can pass the XML files
as you know as XML file contains data
which can be very useful for our
application so I hope you have enjoyed
