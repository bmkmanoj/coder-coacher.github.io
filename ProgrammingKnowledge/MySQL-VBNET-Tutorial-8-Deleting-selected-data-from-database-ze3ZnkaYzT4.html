last two videos I have been showing you
how to save your data and how to add it
to your data in your MySQL database
using your visual they see windows from
application in this video I will show
you how to delete your data using your
Visual Basic windows from application so
first of all I am going to take a button
as I have done in the last two videos to
save an update and I will change the
text of this button as delete and I will
also change the font size so it may look
good bold and 16 and now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to copy the code from
the last video and because all the code
is going to be the same just a query
will be different so I will copy all the
code in the sub of this update button
and I will go to this delete button and
double click it and just paste my code
here so if you are watching these videos
you know what these lines are doing
because I have been explaining you
several numbers of time what these lines
are doing so first line is for the
connection with the server and we write
the server name and root and password
and all and in the tribe catch block we
are going to catch any exception if any
exception occurs and once the query is
performed we are going to dispose our
query
finally right so just copy this skeleton
and now the important part is the query
to delete the data in the database
so I'm going to just delete this line of
the query and I'm going to write the
query to delete the data from the
database so just right here
delete from your database name which is
database dot e data which is my table
name and then write where and then once
again single quote in between double
quote in between this and this sign and
in between I am going to write the name
of my text box for Eid or first of all I
need to write e I D is equal to single
quote double quote and this n sign and I
will write the name of my text box for
Eid solve write text box see I D dot txt
okay so this is the query to delete the
data so I will explain you what this
query is doing this query is deleting
the data on the basis of my employee ID
so whatever I enter employee ID in this
text box it will delete the data related
to that employee ID and it's the concept
behind deleting the data so you need to
give the reference where you want to
perform the action you can do it on the
basis of the name you can do it on the
basis of the surname the only thing is
it should match the content in the
database so that on the basis of that it
can delete the database so for this
example I am going to
take employee ID from the database which
is this one and on the basis of this I
will delete the data so just I delete
from the data from your database dot the
table name you have in the database
where E is the column name one of the
column name is equal to single quote
double quote end and the textbox named
dot texts whatever text you enter in
here to delete the data corresponding to
that okay and I will change a message
here deleted dot are deleted okay it
should be capital D okay so that's all
you need to write in order to delete the
data from the database if we want you
can just copy this code and I'm going to
run the program and check that the it
works a lot I'm going to open my
database also so that I can show you
that the data is really deleted or not
so my program is running okay and so for
example I want to delete the employee ID
17 which is this one so let's login to
the system first of all and for example
I want to delete employee ID 17 so I
will write here 17 and I will click this
delete button and it gives me data
deleted and when i refresh my database
my employee 17 is deleted you can see
here once again for example I want to
delete employee ID 16 so I will write 16
here and I will just click delete and my
daughter is deleted and
when I press refresh and implied e15 is
not here anymore
so in this way you can delete your data
in the database using a visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
