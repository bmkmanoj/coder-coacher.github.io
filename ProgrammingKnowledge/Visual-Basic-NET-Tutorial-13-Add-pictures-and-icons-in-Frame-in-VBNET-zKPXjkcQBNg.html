video I will show you how to use images
and icons with your visual basic windows
form application so suppose I have a
situation so that I have this login form
and I want to set a nice-looking picture
with suits my login form in my project
so how can I do that or I have a
situation that I want to show icon on
this button so all this I will show you
in this video so let's set a picture on
this form first so go to the tool box
and there is a tool called picture box
in your visual basic tool box you can
resize it just drag and drop and resize
and when you click this small arrow
button you will be able to see the size
mode and the dock in parent parent
container and choose image so first of
all we will choose our image and I will
choose image from local resource so I
will just select this radio button and
import an image and I will simply import
an image here and I will click OK so you
can see a image is set in your picture
box but when I stretch my picture box
you see that the image is not totally
fitting to the picture box so how to fix
it once again there are two ways you can
go to this arrow button or once again
and you can choose the size mode from
here so there are some size mode so for
example there is auto size which makes a
picture bigger or according to the size
of the picture your picture box will be
sized but if your picture is bigger and
your picture box is smaller I will
suggest you to use stretch image so that
it
the picture will be adjusted according
to the picture box size oh okay or you
can use this zoom also to stretch your
or stretch or size or image according
the picture box but the best is stretch
image okay so now this is done now I
will show you how to set an icon on this
button so first of all let me show you
how you can get icons and other things
from Internet it's very easy and free so
just go to your browser and say free
icons okay and the first option that you
will see here or there are some options
available which provides free icon
online but generally I go to a site
called icon archive which is a large
amount of icon you can find here and I
go inside it and I can I will find
according to my need for example I need
ok icon so here you can find all the I
can relate it to okay and the other
thing is the size of the icon so my
button is sized and I a little button
and I want to want to have a icon which
is sized as my login button so I can
choose my icon size from here so go to
this size and for example generally a
small button take 16 by 16 px or you can
choose this 24 by 24 px also and when
you choose it
it will give you bigger image option and
then I will go to the first option PNG
image and I will right-click and save as
and I will save my this image in my
desired location once you have done that
just select your login button and go to
search for the image property here so
select the button and go to the image
property this is image property and
click the small button and now this is
the same way we have imported the
earlier image I will choose my ok icon
image and click OK and you see here your
icon is placed into the login button but
you also see that it's placed in the
middle and your login text is also in
the middle so how you can resolve that
so that I can will be on the left side
and the login text will be on the right
side so just choose the icon aligned
property from here and you can choose
the alignment or the icon so I choose
the left middle and now your icon is on
the left middle okay and once again I
will go to the button properties and now
I will go to the text align from here
and I can choose the text alignment from
here also so for example middle right ok
and now you can resize your button and
it will look good now so in this way you
can change the property and you can set
the icons on the buttons and you can
inside the image with your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
