video I am going to show you how to use
data grid view with your usual basic
windows form application and in this
video specifically I am going to show
you how to add a row to your data grid
view so let's get started for that I am
going to take a button and two labels
and two text boxes first and I will take
a data grid view control from my toolbox
so search for the control called data
grid view here and drag and drop into
your form okay now first of all I am
going to change the text of these of
labels first label will be named and
second label will be so a name for
example and the button text will be add
row for example and I am going to change
the font size so you can see what I am
doing so I will change the font size
bold 16 okay so I have this these two
text boxes two labels and one button and
I have this data grid view now just
select your data grid view and sill just
click this small triangle button here
you can see here and I'm going to add it
columns or I am going to add columns
first of all so I am going to add column
and first column name I will choose as
default which is column one but I am
going to change the header text of this
which will be named and the second
column name will be the sunny okay and
click add and then click this cancel
button or close button right and I'm
also going to disable this enable adding
and I'm also going to disable this
enable editing and enable deleting so
just uncheck this button for this
example and just resize your data grid
view okay now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just double click this add
row button in here and I will double
click this button here and I will say me
dot dot grid-view
one which is the name of my data grid
view so MA the name of my daughter grid
view if you can see here this data grid
view one right so in here me dot data
grid view 1 dot rose dot add and in this
bracket it will take the argument for
the rows so right now our rows contain
two columns one is for name one one is
for surname so we have to add two
argument for this row which is one
column each so in here first of all just
copy the name of this first text box
just Xbox one and paste it here dot text
not test but text
and the second text box name just copy
the name of the second text box name and
just pissed as a second argument dot
text okay so and this will be adhere
okay so just try this line me dot dot a
grid view dot Rose dot add an argument
just write the text in a text box name
of first text box dot text comma
text box name for second text box for
comma so this argument will be the
number of columns which the data grid
view has now when I run the program i
have my program running and i will enter
some name and some surname and I will
say add row and you can see one row is
added now one more name and one more
surname and I will add this row and one
more row is added in this way you can
add more rows to your data grid view
right so in this way you can add rows to
your data grid view I hope you have
