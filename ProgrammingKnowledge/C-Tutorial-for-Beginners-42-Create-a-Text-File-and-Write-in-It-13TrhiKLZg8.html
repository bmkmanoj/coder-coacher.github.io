show you how you can create a file in
C++ and write in this text file in C++
so there are three pluses in C++ which
you can use to input and output
characters into a text file and these
three files are first is called of'
stream which is a class which you can
use to write on a file second class is
called AF Stream which you can use to
read from a file and third class is
called F Stream which you can use to
read and write from a file or to the
file so we are going to use this third
class which is f Stream okay so what we
are going to do first of all we need to
include this F string class into our
project so just include this F stream
into your project now in order to create
a file we already know that we need to
use this class called Oh F stream so
just take oh f stream in order to create
a text file and first of all we will
create an instance of this web stream
for example I can name my instance as my
file or simply file it depends upon you
what name you want to give to your
instance now in order to create a file
you just need to take this instance then
dot and you need to call the inbuilt
function called open which takes
constant character string as an argument
and which we will give as the name of
the text file so for example I can say
my text dot txt will be the name of my
file and
whenever you open your file or create a
file you just need to close it in order
to you know safely close your file so
always remember whenever you open a
flower file you need to close it this is
a rule of thumb and it doesn't take any
argument okay I will compile my program
and compile successfully and what I need
to do is I will go to my project folder
so this is my project folder it will
contain my project file and a folder
called bin which contains the binary
file in this bin there will be a debug
folder if you are in debug mode or a
release folder if you are in release
mode so I'm in debug mode so this will
be the folder where my executable file
resides and this is my executable file
and watch carefully what happens when I
run this program for from here and I
have used STD CIN dot get to pause the
screen otherwise screen will disappear
as soon as it's go it goes out of scope
so I will I have included this
intentionally to pause the screen okay
so I will go to the executable file in
the folder and I will just double click
it and it doesn't output anything to the
terminal but you can see it has created
a file called txt file which is blank
right now so it's blank right now right
once again I will delete this my text
dot txt file and I will run it once
again and watch carefully here double
click and it has created a text file
here
okay now once you have created a text
file you can write into the text file
simply by copying the instance of this
and between open and closed functions
just need to insert some text so just
take the instance called file and just
use this brackets or triangular brackets
or whatever you want to say there and
then you can just give your string or
sentence here so this is my first text
file and in order to change the line you
just need this backslash and N and this
backslash and N will change your line on
which you are working on so for example
I want to create some other line I can
just copy it copy it and copy it so then
I will be having four lines one below
another if I use this /n so let's see
what happens if I don't use this /n and
I will just use one line one two three
and four and I will compile my program
and I will go to the folder where my
binary is once again once again I will
check there is no text in this text file
right now I am going to run this file so
I will run this double click it and it
runs and now I am going to open my text
file once again and you can see it has
my text but this text is in one line and
it's not changing the line Accor which I
want right so in
order to change the line you just need
this backslash once again and and so
this backslash and will change your line
this simply means next line okay compile
your program and I will run it once
again and open my text file once again
and now I have four lines one below
another right now in this way you can
create a file and write into the file
but generally there is one more good
practice people use which is this one so
whenever you open your file always check
if the file is open and then perform
some activity on that file so just use
if and then just check the condition if
this file dot just call is open is
underscore open and this is a function
which returns a boolean value true or
false and if the file is open it returns
true or if the file is closed it returns
false so always check whether your file
is open then only perform some action to
this file okay so it's a good practice
to check whether this file is open first
and then perform some activity and there
is one more thing you don't need even
need to use this extra line to create a
file which is file dot open this will
this is of course more explanatory as a
code but in order to create a file you
can just create it with the creation of
instance you don't even need this file
in this line in order to create the file
so this
will work fine it will create of pile
and it will write the text file once
again so text in it once again so what I
am going to do I am going to compile
this go to the folder I will delete this
file once again and I will run it once
again and terminal is not showing
anything because we are not printing
anything to the terminal but we are
creating this text file right I will
open this text file once again it has
same text but these are the some good
practice always check whether your file
is open and then perform the action on
this file always okay and it's better to
you know include this closed code inside
your if condition so that as soon as
like the writing into the file is
complete it flushes all the you know all
the files streams and it flushes all the
characters in this file so in this way
you can create a text file using C++ and
write in it in the next video maybe I
will show you how you can read from a
text file so stay tuned and please rate
