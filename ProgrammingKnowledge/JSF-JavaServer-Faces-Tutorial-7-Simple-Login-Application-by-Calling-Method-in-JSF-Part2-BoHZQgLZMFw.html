message same is equal to
and the name and password okay
please enter name and password otherwise
else we will show the message once again
message is equal to name and
password is not correct right
so we have made this login method and
inside we have defined these conditions
so if the name and password message we
show this if it doesn't we show this now
we go to the index dot H XHTML we
already have the text box for the user
so for the name we already have this for
password we will make a new input text
okay so for password you define here
sorry H and input secret
when you select input secret it will I
will show you just a moment ID you
define ID and you can define I SEC okay
and then the value where a value is your
hash then this curly brackets and inside
this user dot password right because you
are using password so you are entering
the username and the password and you
press this submit button and it goes to
the second page right so it takes the
username and password and it validates
your username and password and it goes
to the second page so we have this
second page also if you are following
this video we have made this second page
and in here we are showing the output so
the output in the output text we are
showing edge and then output text then
we have provided the ID and the value
so instead of this name which I have
provided in the last videos in this we
will show the message right so in the
index dot XHTML we enter the username
and password and then we click this
button and it validates your data and it
opens the second page and it shows the
message whatever message you will get I
think I did some mistake here instead of
this user dot output message I must show
user dot this login message so I must
call this user dot login message because
this login message should give me the
message right and in my user dot Java
class in which I have defined this login
condition I think I need to return this
drinks instead of void I need to return
this output message so in here in your
method which we defined earlier this
login master go here instead of this
void right string and it will return
string and go just below when your
method complete just above that right
return and just copy this output
variable which is your output message
and just close it so this login method
is returning you the output so that's
why string and return string so what I
will just run the program and then we
check and when then after we will see
what we have done
so run the program so this is my program
and when I click this button when both
of these username and password field are
empty I press this button it shows me
the message please enter name and
password so I enter the name name is
same as name and password was password
so if you see this password is working
like a password text field it's not
showing your password so that is why I
have used that input secret I write and
then I click submit button and it shows
me username and password is correct okay
and when I enter some random values
which is not correct and when I press
this button it shows me username and
password is not correct okay so in this
way you have made the login page for
your JSF application I so what we have
done here is we have defined in our
source package we have our user class in
here we have declared three variables
string name string password and string
message so if you don't know how to make
this user class you can just go to the
video number phone in which I have shown
you managed beans and there you will be
able to understand how I made this user
class so inside this user class I have
name password and output message I said
get getter for this output message and
getter and setter for my username and
password and then I define a login
function in which
I am returning the output message right
and inside this login function I have
defined these condition for checking the
username and password then I have gone
to the index dot XHTML which is my first
page main page and in here I have
defined first of all this input text tag
which takes the name of the user and
then I have defined the password tag so
for password input secret and which take
the password of the user and then I
press the submit button and after my
submit button it goes to the next page
so here in the action I am calling the
second page which is the name of my
second da test XHTML so this is the same
name as this second okay and when I
press this button it goes to this second
page so I go to the second page here it
shows me the outputs message and what is
the value of the message whatever my
user dot login returns so my login
method will check if the username and
password is correct and it returns and
it will show you the value right so this
I have done you can just make your code
better like this so you can give user
name and semicolon and after this
completion right give break BR and in
the same way here give password password
semicolon add and at the last provide
the break okay so this will
give a good appearance to your code so
now when I run the program I have this
username and password and I have this
submit button so I have give my username
which is name itself and my password
which is password and when I press this
button it gives me the output username
and password is correct so this is the
login page which I make without using
the database but in the future when we
will see how to connect your database
with your JSF pages with the help of
hibernate then we will see the database
login page also so stay tuned and keep
watching this video please rate comment
