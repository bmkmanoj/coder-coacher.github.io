Java effects tutorial for beginners in
the last video I have shown you how to
use tree view in Java FX and I have
shown you how you can add the root and
nodes to the tree view in the last video
right and I have also shown you how to
add these icons to the tree view now in
this video we will see how we can add
some mouse click event to these nodes
right and I'm also going to show you how
you can you know expand these root nodes
in the tree view so for example right
now when I run the app my root node is
collapsed right so I need to expand it
and expand it once again to go to the
sub nodes right but for example I want
to present the user the expanded nodes
then how can I do that so let's see how
can we do that so in my initialized
method which I have created in the last
video I have created this root so I want
this root to be expanded so I can just
take this root and call the method
called set expanded and make it true
okay and just save your code and run it
once again and now you can see our root
node childs are expanded so root node
choice for node a node B and node C so
they were expended but right now node a
also have some child nodes so we want to
expand these also so how we can do it we
can do in the same way just copy this
code and paste it here
and now we want to expand the node a so
just call node a dot sight expanded is
equal to true and then run your code
once again and now your whole tree is
expanded okay now suppose I want to add
a event to this tree view so that
whenever I select some element I want to
access the name of the node so what I
can do here I can just create
method public void and for example I can
name my method as mouse click and as an
argument I'm going to pass an argument
called Mouse events so just pass an
argument called Mouse event and name it
and inside my method first of all what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
an instance of tree item and then I will
say this is the item object and then I
will take my tree view object which is
this one and just paste it here then
just call get selection mode and then
call get selected item okay and now you
can just print the value for example you
can just write this out and then you can
just call this item here dot get value
and this will give you the selected item
name okay now one more thing we need to
do here is we need to take this mouse
click event and we will need to connect
it with our F XML file so just copy this
method and open your scene will der
where you have this tree view select
your tree view and go to the code
category here and search for the event
called context menu requested and paste
this method there and one more place you
need to paste this method name is on
mouse clicked here okay so just you know
call this method mouse click on context
menu requested and on mouse click OK
save your code and then go to your
Eclipse project refresh your project and
run it once again now when I click on
some item here it's going to print the
value of the item in here right so for
example I select or single click node
a is going to print node a for example I
single click node C one is going to
print node C one or I can just click
node C is going to a print node C so
this is how the single click is working
for example you want to print the value
on double-click so when I double click
here right now it's printing two times
right so let's add a double click here
so you just need to add this condition
here so just add an if statement and
call this mouse event here and then call
a method called get click count okay and
we will count these clicks and if this
mouse click count is equal to 2 which
means double click then we want to you
know execute our code here ok so just
add this condition here and save your
code and run it once again and now when
I single click on any item it's not
going to do anything but when I double
click on item then it is going to print
the value of the item okay so in this
way you can add this mouse event to the
tree view I hope you enjoyed this video
