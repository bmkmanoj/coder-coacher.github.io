last video we have seen how to update
our table and in this tutorial we will
learn how to clear data in from our text
field for example if I click join
anything and when I want to enter new
name I have to delete everything and
then under something or the other
what happens if a button is added called
clear which clears all the tanks to be
simultaneously so it would be very
beneficial for us so let's try drill on
how to do that first of all go to a
permit take a button name it as clear
and also change the variable name in the
clear and just right click it go to
event action fiction performed and when
we go into the source code of command
clear except action performed you just
have to write for example that variable
name of employee text field is text
employee ID so copy that paste it here
after pasting you should write dot this
set text
and subtext you just have to write
nothing that means blank double quotes
so we will do it the same way all four
text fields text names set text blank
double quotes once again for surname
text so name listed here not not set
fixed
length and one last time next page is
equal to
dot-shaped text
and blank double quote must fly to run
the program from my
now when you click anything when you
click clear button all texty texty will
be cleared more time you will try click
anything just clear so it was a small
tutorial how to clear your text fields
with a single button I hope you have
enjoyed this tutorial please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
