show you how to use global variables
with your functions so what is a global
variable a global variable by the name
itself you can understand that global
variable is available everywhere in your
program so whenever you declare a global
variable it should be or it can be used
everywhere in the program right but
whenever we've tried to use this global
variable inside our function it behaves
little bit differently and I will show
you how to use this global variable with
a function so for example I declare a
variable called name for example and
name I assign this name as mark okay and
I can just echo this name right this is
simple but for example I want to make a
function to the display name so I make a
function function and I can say show
name and this will be my function and I
just want to display this name using
this function so I just can say echo and
in single quotes I can say the name of
the student is and this concatenation
symbol I can use names like this okay
and if you know that by calling this
function in here I will be able to show
this message right so let me save it and
let's see what is the result
I'll just refresh this and
we'll call my global dot PHP and in here
you will be able to see that undefined
name here and the name of the student is
and you will not be able to see the name
which we have a sign which is mark right
and why is this happening the name is
not available you know whenever we want
to see here name is not available
ideally we should see the name of the
student this month because we are
printing this name of the student this
or whatever this name contains and we
can just prove this that this name has
the value of mark by just echoing this
like this so I will just save it and
I'll refresh this and you can see it
this name variable holds the value mom
but inside your function you will not be
able to print this name and there is a
small little line which you need to
write to specify that this name is a
global variable and you want to use this
inside your function and you just need
to add this line you just need to write
global and the name of your variable and
once you specify that this name is a
global variable so this is the same name
as this name but now you specify in the
function that this is a global variable
and let's see what happens now I will
refresh it and now I can see that the
name of the student is mark right so in
order to use a global variable inside
your function you need to specify that
you want to use this global variable and
not just one global variable you can
just
use different global variable name 1
comma name two so like this you can
specify multiple global variable inside
your function and use them unless and
until you have declared those names as a
global variable outside these functions
ok so just remember that whenever you
want to use a global variable if this
global variable can be in other PHP file
also and you may wish to you know
declare all of your global variable in
one PHP file and you can call these
global variable inside your function in
other files by just using this
declaration that this variable is global
and you want to use it ok so just
remember this in your mind and you will
be good to go
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
