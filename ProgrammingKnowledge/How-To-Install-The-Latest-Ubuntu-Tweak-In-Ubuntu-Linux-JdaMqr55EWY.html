show you how you can install ubuntu
tweak on your Ubuntu operating system
ubuntu tweak is a tool by which you can
you know customize your desktop and
system options and even you can
customize your you know default desktop
environment with this open to tweet tool
I personally use it for changing the
themes in Ubuntu so let us see how we
can install Ubuntu tweak on Ubuntu so
just open your terminal and we need
three commands to install Ubuntu tweak
and all the three commands are listed
here I will also paste all these three
commands in the description below so you
can just go there and copy them and
paste them first is to add a repository
so just copy and paste this here which
is sudo apt - cat - repository PPA colon
tutorial or tu a whatever this spelling
is slash ppm okay and press ENTER and
give you a password
and press ENTER once again
and
repository is added just the second
command you need to give is to update so
just give this sudo apt - cat update +
Enter
and the third command is to install this
open to tweak itself just copy the third
command I will clear the terminal first
of all and once again I will give this
command sudo apt - cat install open to
tweak and press ENTER and press Y and
and in some moments open to tweak will
be installed in your system
okay so once this is done you can go to
your dash home here and search for
Ubuntu tweak which is this one you can
drag and drop this icon to this here on
the sidebar and you can just open it
and you can see here
you can change or your overview or you
can tweak and change the themes from
here wallpaper
Dexter icons so for example I want to
change the theme just click here and
from here you can choose the themes okay
and you can even install new themes and
change those themes from here itself
so maybe in some other video I will show
you how you can change the themes in
Ubuntu using open to tweak I hope you
