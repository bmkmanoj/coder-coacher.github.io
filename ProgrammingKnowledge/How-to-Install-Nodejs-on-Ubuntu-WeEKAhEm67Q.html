video I will show you how to install
node.js on your open to operating system
so first step is to open the terminal so
just open this terminal and the first
step in the terminal you need to type is
this so type sudo apt - get installed
Python
- software - properties and press ENTER
and if it's already there in your system
it will say it's already in the newest
state otherwise it will install this
Python software property in your Ubuntu
operating system the next step is to
type this so we will install the node.js
repository from chris e and for that you
write write sudo apt - add - repository
space PPA
: Chris - le a slash node dot J's and
hit enter and it will say press ENTER to
continue so I press enter and it's done
now we will install the sorry this
updates so we will not install but
update our repositories and it may take
some time so just wait for it
maybe I will pause the video until it's
finished
once your update is finished now we are
ready to install node.js so just first
of all let me clear this window so now
after all these installation we are
ready to install node.js so just write
sudo apt - get install space node.js
with npm so we are also installing node
package manager so hit enter and it says
unable to correct problem you have to
hold so NPM is giving me some conflicts
so let's install it no install node.js
without NPS and let's get into install
and say yes and it's installing fetching
the data
and it's finished so now I know Jas
hopefully is installed in your Ubuntu
operating system let's check if it's
really installed so just write node node
- - version and you can see node version
is V zero point ten point nineteen so
that means node is installed in your
open to operating system maybe in the
next video I will show you how to use
node.js with your open to operating
system so stay tuned and please rate
