to make the J table click to do
different things for example if you
click anywhere in the table so all the
data if you want in these text boxes so
how can we do that I will show you today
first of all just drag text boxes and
give them a level which I have already
shown you previously then right click on
the table go to event and go to mouse
and mouse click
you will automatically go to the saw
spindle here then we will make a quick
walk first
breakage
exception e
and just right the option paint not so
messy Dalembert null comma E now and try
block
first of all declare a variable int int
Rho is equal to whatever is your table
name our table name is table employee
sequel to death will employ don't
select intro
then legally on a string string
mmm consider the spring in anything then
it is table click
is equal to
in the brackets table name
don't
do
don't
get
when we went
and in the when you went right row which
is this variable and here right
zero I'm taking zero because I want to
consider employee ID or zeroth component
of the table then not to string because
you considered as data string now
as usual right PhD cannot prepare
statement
and here
might be a state-owned home dot prepare
statement or forgot to write very first
so I enter query string Q is equal to
select star from our table name which is
employee info
paint
we're employer ID is equal to which is
this employee ID name is equal to a
string variable name which is table
click just paste it here
select star from employee ID when boy I
taken employee info they employ ID is
equal to a variable string then right
prepare statement is equal to corn the
problem statement SQL and RS annual PSD
dot insecure query invited him
statements
in this statement it is dot next
let's talk next
consider any string string I got the
celeries and 1 and 1 equal to dot dot
get string
looks right
the name of one of these columns right
now we want to employ ID name surname
and age so one by one we will write in
the box
first of all employee ID
1880
and you want this employee ID into this
text field copy the name of the text
field and paste it here dot set text is
equal to add one which we have taken
here
so for all four text field we have to do
like same copy pasting three times three
and change the variable add 2 &amp;amp; 3 also
all right and we have to change this
text field and to make these names so
funny my variable name is text names or
replace this name is texting then what
will my name is text server will place
it here just solely my both field name
is text age replace it here text age
and here you want to show take data from
data tables so named called names
I think and let's see column names are
my ID name surname and age name surname
and which
we have written this code as trying to
run it
we won the program
okay it says no such column called
employee ID okay so I have to check
check my column name what is my column
my column name is in instead of employee
ID I by mistake I've taken the column
name employee ID EMP Oh Y double e ID so
I have to change the spelling here yeah
and also here now let's try to run the
program
and when you click
this table it shows two data once again
link the table
it shows the data
so this was the simple tutorial to use
Jacob will click and show the data into
the text field thanks for now on
watching and please rate comment and
subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
