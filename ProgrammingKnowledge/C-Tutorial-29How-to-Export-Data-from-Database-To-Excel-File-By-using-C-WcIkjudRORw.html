last video I have shown you how to
create an excel file with your c-sharp
application using excel library by
Google codes so I will extend that
series in this video and in this video I
will show you how to transfer your
database value which we are working on
we are using MySQL database in this
video series and we have till now
written so many things using MySQL
database so if you are following this
these videos in this video I will show
you how to transfer your database table
values into an excel file using your
your c-sharp application so for example
I have this table in my database which
you have seen earlier also because I am
using this same table in every database
video so I want to transfer each and
every value which this data table
contains in the excel file how can I
achieve that by using excel library I
will show you so if you don't know the
how to create an excel file just go to
last video because it's very important
to understand how to create the excel
every and where to add and find the
excel library dll so go there and if you
haven't watched that video just watch
that video and this is just the
continuation of that video so
now I have this project and now I want
to transfer the database value into the
excel file so if you have seen the last
video I have added this excel library in
my resources and I have added
these two files Excel library combo
compound document format and Excel
library dot spreadsheet here into my
code earlier and this also I have added
right now so just add these for Excel
library imports in your code now just go
to a form once again and first of all I
will run the program to show you
something so here in the 13th video I
have shown you how to load this table
using MySQL database and using this
button so I will show you the video
number and title also this is the
thirteenth video show database values in
tables or data grid view and it's in my
c-sharp visual studio tutorials so I'm
using the code which I have used in that
video with your number thirteen and I
will just click this load table button
once again and this is the code which I
have written in video number thirteen so
if you don't know this code just pause
this video and then copy this code once
again otherwise watch the video number
thirteen and you will be able to
understand how to write this code in
this code I am going to add some new
code so all the this connection is okay
all these queries are also okay so when
I run the program it will load the value
in my data grid view or tables and in
this trycatch after this SD r dot update
DB database data set line which I have
written up to video number thirteen I
will add I will make a space and I will
add some new lines to create and export
those values in the excel file so I will
add these four lines in order to export
my values to that that excel file first
of all let's see the query the query is
select a ID so whatever your table name
is I am basically transferring or in a
simple way I just make this thing simple
very simple so you will not be confused
so for example this is my query select
star from database dot your table name
okay this is database name and dot your
table name so I have this query this
query will take all the values from my
database and show into this table if you
have written this code and now after
this SDA dot update data set port right
this dotted set D s this is a variable
name is equal to new data set okay and
give any name to your data set so I have
given new underscore data set then
copy this variable and paste it here dot
local is equal to system dot treading
dot thread dot current thread dot
current culture right this line and then
just copy your this my SQL data adopter
variable which I have written in video
number 30 and paste it here dot fill and
just copy this data table variable
that's all so I have shown you in the
video number 30 and copy and paste it in
this film bracket in the next line write
data set which is this variable dot
table dot add data DB data set which is
this dot or table variable okay and then
in the last write Excel lab ready this
is the lag ready code from Excel library
dot data set helper dot create workbook
and in the bracket give any name to your
excel file so I have given my excel file
dot XLS to my file name so if you have
read the document the document says it
can till now it can create XLS file so I
have given my excel file extension XLS
comma this data set variable so just
write these four lines add these four
lines into your 13th with your code and
this will create an excel file of name
my excel file and it will export all the
values from your database into that
excel file okay
now I will run the program once again
and username password and now right now
this table is empty but when I press
this load table button and it's showing
in well it's L values because some of
the values in the database here are
missing right that's why but it has
loaded all the values in this table now
let's see it has created excel file or
not yes it has created an excel file in
my project folder and here this is my
solution folder go to inside and go to
bin and go to debug and in here it has
generated my file wherever your
executable file is there so I will right
click it and open it to see if it's
really important the database values and
it will show the warning say yes
I mean unable to read the values so it
is unable to read the values because
some of the values are null here okay so
now I will try to just show employee ID
name surname and age because they are
all complete values and I will leave
these four columns from showing into the
excel file because there are some
so I will just add it my query first of
all I will close it and I will add it my
query here select the ID comma name
comma surname and comma age so I will
show these four values instead of
showing all the values and all the
column values from these four column
should go into the excel file just run
the program once again to unload the
table once again and this time it hasn't
shown me any exception and let's go into
your folder debug folder and let's open
this file once again
open once again the warning so just
click yes and this time it has imported
all the values from the database so here
employee ID name surname image and it
contains the employee ID number da
turtle employee ID 12 and you can see in
the database also it contains the data
to employee ID 12 okay so this data and
this data if you can match are same okay
so in this way you can export your
database value into the excel sheet I
