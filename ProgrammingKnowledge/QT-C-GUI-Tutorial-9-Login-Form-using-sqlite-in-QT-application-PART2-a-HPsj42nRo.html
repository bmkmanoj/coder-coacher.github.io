an argument
so we will write double quotes and in my
database you can see I have table name
employee ID and the column called
username and passwords
just remember this table name is
employee ID and the column names are
username and password which we are going
to use so i'm i will write select star
from my dot the table name so copy the
name of the table select star from the
table name where and now we will copied
we will copy the name of the column
called username and password so i will
write where username is equal to and
write single kool coat and double quotes
and in here
plus plus and just copy the username cue
string username variable which is this
cue string user name and pass it here
same we will do it for the password so
after this username right and and this
double quote will come after and so end
password is equal to single colon and
double quote then plus plus and in here
we will pass our password to string
variables just copy this password Q
string variable and pass it here okay so
our query is complete select star from
employee ID where username is my
username which is which I am taking from
the line edit username and password
which I am taking from the line edit
password so if this condition is true I
will write while qry which is my query
variable dot next while query executes I
will write above this while loop I will
declare int variable and give it a
variable name count this will count the
number of time it executes the query and
I will in the while loop just write
count and increment it by 1 now outside
this while loop and inside this if
condition I will write if
count is equal to one
in this case I will pass or set in mild
status label the status
so I will write you I my label name for
the status which is label itself and
then I will write set text and what text
I will write username and password is
correct
so username and password is correct okay
this code I will copy it this condition
if condition if count is equal to zero I
will copy and paste it two more times
one and two and here I will in the
second condition I will say if count is
greater than greater than one then I
will say duplicate username and password
okay
and in the third condition if this is
smaller than one smaller than one I will
say username and password is not correct
okay so I have written this code so I'm
checking what number of username and
password are there and if only one and
unique username and password is there I
will say username and password is
correct or otherwise if it's greater
than one then I will say duplicate
username and password or it's smaller
than one I will say username and
password are not correct so let's try
and build this program now so I will say
go to my project build it save all and
see here it's building and it's built
correctly now run the program go to run
and my program is running now so let's
see our database first so I have
username two and password - you can see
here so I will pass this to username and
password here username is - password is
- I will click login and see it says
white sing duplicate username and
password okay so let's see why it's
showing duplicate username password it
should not show because it's a unique
password so let's check our program I
think I know the mistake
I haven't initialized this count so int
count is equal to zero now it knows that
first of all it is initialized to zero
and now I will run my program once again
and let's check if it works now or not
okay so go to the database
so I have to as unique username and
password so I'll add two and two and I
will press this login button and now it
says username and password is correct
now I have this duplicate username and
password which is one and one which is
assigned for two employees so it's an
error in our condition so I will pass it
and let's see if it shows the error or
not so I'll pass one and one and I will
click login it saves me duplicate
username and password which is correct
and now I will provide username and
password which is not there in the
database
some random username and password and I
will click login and it says me username
and password is not correct so in this
way you can create a simple login
application with your QT and SQLite
database and in the next video I will
show you how to open a next page or form
or window menu your username and
password is correct so stay tuned and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
