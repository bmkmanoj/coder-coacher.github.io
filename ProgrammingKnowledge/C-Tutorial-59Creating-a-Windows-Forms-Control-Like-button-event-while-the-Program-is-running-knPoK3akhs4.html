video I will show you how to create a
control while your program is still
running so for example I want to create
a button while my program is running so
I want to write a code so that when I
click some button it will create some
other button at the runtime and then
when I click the new button which is
created at the runtime it should perform
some tasks so let's see how can we do
that first of all I will take a button
here and I will change its text as
create BTN for button and I will just
copy the text and I will provide the
same text in here as the name also okay
and then I double click this button and
first of all if I am creating a button
and I want to use it anywhere else also
that button click event when I click
this button so I have to declare a
global button variable so not inside
this button click event but I have to
declare that button outside my event so
you can go above your code and in here
after your form declaration you can
declare this button
and then give it a variable name in my
case BTN is equal to new button bracket
and bracket closed ok so this is the
Declaration of the new button which we
are creating right and then once again I
will go to the code once again button
click event and here I will write the
code so hey here in this button cake
event I will write this these five lines
of code what are these five lines this
is the butt button event or button
variable which I have created above
which is this BTN variable button
variable and then right dot parent is
equal to this and then in this next line
write the same button variable dot
location is equal to new system dot
drawing dot point and inside this
bracket we will pass these two argument
which indicates the location of your
button so if you are not sure where you
want to locate your button or where your
new button will be located when it's
created you what you can do is for
example you have this button and just
select it and you can see here the
location of the button so 249 by 173 so
249 by 173 is this location and you want
to create your new button at this
location for example so just place this
button at this location and just note
the location from here so 75 by 151 I
will
once again replace the position and then
here my button location was 75 by 151 so
you can use this trick to find the
location and create the button at the
exact location right in the third line
right button dot size is equal to new
system dot drawing dot size and in the
bracket we will pass the size of your
button so width and height so the same
thing you can also use for button width
and height size also so just resize this
button and just select this and for
example this is the desired size you
want to create then go to here
properties and just note the size 94 by
42 so here I will pass 94 542 and my I
know the size of my button which I
create okay in the next line right
button dot name is equal to button name
so this is the name of your button which
every thumb control has for example I
have this button this has this name so
this name is equivalent to this button
name okay and in the next line button
dot text is equal to new button or
whatever text you want to show this is
the caption which will show on the
button so let's try and run the program
first and when I click this button it
creates a new button
on my desired location okay now for
example I want to create or perform some
action when I click this button then our
coding or our purpose will be successful
so let's see how we can create this
button click event so what you can do is
just below the button click event which
you are right in which you are writing
your create button code just go outside
that event function and just below that
we will write our new button this button
click event so for that the easiest way
is to just copy this button click event
which you have created earlier from
above or any button click event and
paste it here and just close this from
here right so this has created our
button click event now you what you need
to do is you need to replace this by the
name of your button so this is the name
of my button just copy this name and
just replace here okay so button
/name button click and write like this
sorry not this button name but this is
the declaration for button
so this is our button variable so just
copy this and paste it here right so
this is our button click event for the
bottom we are creating there is one more
thing you need to do first of all let's
do something with this button so I will
show the message dot show inside this
some message so and queue okay but our
code is still not complete because this
button click event will not be executed
automatically so what you need to do is
just go at the top where your
initialized component function is there
wherever your form is initializing just
below this initialize component function
you need to write this so this is the
code you need to write in order to
actualize your button click event so
write this dot button dot click button
is the variable of button which we have
written earlier this dot BTN dot click
plus is equal to new system dot event
handler and in the bracket write this
dot button click so this button click is
the same
as this button clicks oh this should be
remembered and now when I run the
program when I click this create button
it creates a button and when I click
this new button it shows a message okay
so now you will be able to create the
control and you can also provide event
handler to it
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
