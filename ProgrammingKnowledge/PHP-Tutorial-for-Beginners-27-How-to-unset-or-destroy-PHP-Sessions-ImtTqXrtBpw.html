last video I have shown you how to set
sessions in PHP so I have made the
session dot PHP and view dot PHP and
this session dot PHP what it's doing is
it's just setting this session variables
name age and weight and from this view
dot PHP we were accessing those sessions
using this view dot PHP right so what I
have shown you in the last video this
was the session dot PHP whenever I click
this it's setting the sessions and
whenever I want to use the all the
values from the session I was just
calling this view dot PHP right so if
you don't know how to set the sessions
just watch watch the last video now in
this video I'm going to show you how to
unset session so for example for some
reason you want to unset some value of a
session or all values of a session how
can you do it so for example I will make
one more PHP file called destroy dot PHP
which we will use to destroy our
sessions ok and in here I really quickly
make this PHP file PHP tags and then in
here I want to unset the session right
so what I can do directly mean what we
have learned in the last video we always
need to use the session start whenever
you want to use this keyword session
okay so we need to use the session start
and then what we can do is we can unset
there is a function called unset by
which you can unset a particular session
so for example I want to unset this name
session from here ok so I will just pass
this name
session here with a dollar symbol and
this session and which is which has the
value of name will be unset so let's try
and run the program once again so I go
to my browser I just refresh it and any
hair falling first of all I said the
session by session dot PHP the session
is set and then I can view my session by
view dot PHP so I know that this name is
equal to mark AZ age is equal to 21 and
weight is equal to 45 and for example I
want to destroy the session for the name
so I click this destroy dot PHP which
destroys the or unset the session name
right so when I just open this I know
that name is unset session name is unset
now I can go to once again to view dot
PHP and now you can see here I can only
see this age and weight but I am NOT
able to see this name here right and
this is because we have unset the
session for name okay now for example
you don't use this start session what
happens quickly we can see here that it
will not work so once we set the session
we can view all name age and weight and
once we destroy the session and once
once again we go to view it will not
destroy your session so you need to use
this session start in order to use any
kind of session right now in some cases
you want to destroy all the sessions
which you said okay not one not two but
all the session in ago right so how you
can achieve this there is a function
called session dot unset or session got
destroy so I'll just call this function
just session underscore destroy and this
is a function which destroys all of your
sessions okay so I save it and I'd go to
my browser and I set the session so I
shouldn't have set and I can view those
session value so I know that name and
age is weight is set and now I call this
destroy the PHP which destroy all the
session now I can go to view dot PHP
once again I don't see any session set
here right so in this way you can unset
a particular session or destroy all the
sessions using this session destroy'
okay so I hope you have enjoyed this
