video I will show you how to display
current date and time into your c-sharp
form so for example I want to show the
system time on my form and I want to
time to run with the actual time so I
want running time and date so how can I
do that I will show you today so first
of all I will go to my toolbar box and I
will search for the timer so just drag
and drop into your form and when you
drag and drop into your form you will
see it will go down it will not directly
come or disappear into your form but it
will go appear below of your form so
that's all right you don't have to worry
for that and one more thing we want here
is the label so we will search for the
label and for example I want to show the
time here ok so I will just change the
text of the label time so it will look
good time
okay and you can also change the name of
the label is time time LPL so we know
it's a label okay then just copy your
label name and just select your timer
and double click it and you will reach
to the code for the time here right
the time your daytime variable name so I
will write it time is equal to date time
once again dot now and bracket and
bracket closed and so it's not a bracket
I think yeah right like this and then
then right here this dot your label name
which is time underscore label dot text
is equal to copy or day time variable
and paste it here dot to string and
bracket closed
and here you need to write voltage so
liya write these two lines in time take
event okay and then just go to your form
once again just see the variable name of
name of the timer which is time of one
okay so just copy this and you can
change the interval from here
it's unread millisecond right now and
it's okay because it will take every 100
milliseconds so our time ticks with
thousand milliseconds so it will refresh
faster than we want so it's okay yeah
and just go to the code once again and
go up
and here I have already shown you go to
your initialize component function
wherever it is called search for this
function every function has that and
just go there and go below and just
write your timer name dot start okay
break it closed just you need to write
or call your timer dot start in your
initialize component function wherever
this function is just call ya and this
function is just below this declarations
so you know that so I have written this
one line here and I have written this
two lines of code in timer tick event
okay and let's now see what is the
result of our code and if you can see
you are seeing the running time
right so in this way you can show the
actual date and time in your form I hope
you have learned something new this time
please rate comment subscribe and bye
