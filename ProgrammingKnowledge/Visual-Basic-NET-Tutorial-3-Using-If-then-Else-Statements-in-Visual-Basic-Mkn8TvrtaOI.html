tutorial on visual basics in this video
I will show you how to use if statement
in your Visual Basic and I will also
show you how to use text boxes and
labels with your visual basic windows
form application project so let's get
started first of all I will take a label
from here
and second thing I will take our text
box from my tool box so this is the text
box and I will take a button from the
tool box so this is a button ok and I
will change the text of this button has
check if statement okay so it this
button is going to check if statement
and this text box name is just select
this text box and you will be able to
see this text box name is text box one
so remember this and the name of the
label is label one you see here name of
the label is label one you need to
remember these two things so just select
your button and double click it once
again check if statement and in here we
are going to write a if statement so we
write if which is this if and then we
write the name of the text box so right
text box 1 and dot text because we are
going to take the text from the text box
so take the text if your text box text
is equal to and let's give a condition
so we will give that if my text box text
is equal to 1 for example then what you
will do is then and it automatically
ends the F condition and it the visual
studio adds the code for ending the F
condition so whenever you initialize F
condition you need to give this and if
to end the condition and inside this if
condition we are going to perform our
code if this condition is true
so I will write label 1 which is the
name of my label dot text is equal to
and I will say on the label 1 I want to
show the message message 1 okay and for
I will just copy the same code and I
will just go down below this end F
condition and I will paste it once again
and now I will say if my message textbox
dot text is equal to 2 then I will say
this message is message to in a same way
I can just add one more line of
condition message 3 for 3 so now I will
check what is the condition in the
textbox and according to it you will be
able to see the message but before that
let's change the font of this text box
so that you can see it and the label
font 16 bold and the button fault point
sorry which is 16 okay now you will be
able to see all these things when I run
the program and when I say
one I am giving the condition in the
textbook one and when I click this check
if statement I see message 1 when I
enter the condition - I see message -
and when I enter the condition 3 I see
the message 3 so in this way you can use
if conditions with your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
