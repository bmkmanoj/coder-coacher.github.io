video I will show you how to convert
your SQLite database table to a CSV file
or excel file so in the second video of
this series I have shown you how to
download and install this SQLite manager
to manage your SQLite database and this
is just an extension for Firefox and
it's free so it's really good to install
this and it makes it very easy to
convert your table to a CSV file or a or
a excel file so let's see how we can do
it so go at the top here and the select
view and just select export view and it
will open our new tab here which is
called export wizard and for example I
have this database called database dot
DB and I want to export this table which
is called employee info which have this
data to a CSV file first so I will go to
my export wizard if here I don't see any
table so what I will do is I will right
click this table from here right click
and click export table ok and now you
can see this table name here ok and then
what we will do is because CSV file is a
comma separated file here pin separated
by just select this comma and field
enclosed by just select double quote if
necessary and then
I will click okay and then here it will
you can change the name of your table or
you can leave it by default like this
but don't forget to give the extension
dot CSV because it's a CSV file right so
just save it like this and click Save
and you can see here nine records
exported to the location and once you
have exported your file you will be able
to see it in your saved location
wherever you have saved this X CSV file
and just right-click it open with Excel
and you will be able to see all the data
here which is separated by comma now
suppose you want to export your table to
a excel file you don't want this CSV
file because for some reason it's not
useful to you so let's go to our
database once again and once again for
example I want to save this or export
this table as a excel file now so what I
will do is in this CSV tab I will select
first of all first row contains the name
of the column okay so if this row or
first row will contain these name of the
columns and then because your excel file
is separated by tab so just select this
tab here and this will remain the same
and I will click OK here and this time I
will give my file the extension dot
XL s p-- which is our extension of excel
file or you can give the ex extension of
excel es which will work pine also so
just give the extension XLS and save
your file and you can say see here nine
record are exported and once again I
will go to my save the location and you
can see it here your employ info table
is now saved as a excel file and I will
right-click and open it once again with
Microsoft Excel and click yes and you
can see here your database is or your
table is exported as an excel file here
and first row contains the name of the
columns ok so in this way you can export
your database or database table to a CSV
file or excel file I hope you have
learned something new this time please
