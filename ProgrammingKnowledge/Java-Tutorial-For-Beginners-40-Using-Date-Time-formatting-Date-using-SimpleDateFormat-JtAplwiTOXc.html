Java programming tutorial for beginners
in this video we will see how to use
date class in Java day class we can use
to display date and time and manipulate
date and time in Java in addition we
will also see how we can format date and
time in Java so first of all to add this
date and time class we need to import
this class from a package called Java
dot util z' so just import Java dot util
dot date okay and after importing this
class you can create an object of this
date class like this date is equal to
new date and you can use this date
object to print the current date and
time for example and how you can print
current date and time you just need to
use for example sis out and you just
take this date object from here and call
a method called to string on it so just
call to string okay and I will save this
program and I'm going to run this and
it's going to give me the current date
and time so when I see this it's going
to give me this date and time okay so
it's printing the day today's Tuesday
June 23 and the time okay and it's going
to print the year and full let date and
time like this okay so this is the
default date and time it's printing now
there is a term called epoch time
Apoc time if you don't know it's a time
from 1970 first january 1970 and this is
the number of
seconds from 1st January 1970 so this is
the reference time we take in order to
you know use time so to print this epoch
time in millisecond what you can do is
you just need to write this out and use
this date once again and call get time
ok so just call get time on it and it
will give you the number of milliseconds
from 1st January 1970 so let's save it
first and run it once again and it's
giving us the number of milliseconds
right now suppose you want a particular
day or month or year from this current
date for example so how you can get it
you can get it something like this so
once again I'm going to use this out to
print it and on this date object when
you do this dot and you can see get
month get here and get date so there are
different method you can call on this
date to get different kind of you know
date/time or month so for example I want
to know the current month or print the
current month right now so I will use
this get month and this when I save it
and run it it's going to give me the
current month but remember when it gives
you the current month you need to add
one to it because this prints the
current month from zero okay so for
example January it will print the
current month is equal to zero
February current month is equal to one
so it starts from zero not one okay in a
same way you can call multiple methods
like
save the program and run it and it's
going to give you the get here so right
now it's 2015
okay and you need to add 1900 to it in
order to print that you know 2015 value
and they for example day it's going to
give you the day of the week so today is
Tuesday so it's giving me two because it
the week starts from Monday and Monday
is equal to one and Tuesday is equal to
two okay
in the same way you can print our
seconds and time also okay so there are
some method for example you want to
print current hour so just get and just
call our get our on it
okay so let's search for get our and
save the program and run it and it's
giving me 23 because right now the time
is twenty three thirty eight forty nine
you can see here okay so just play with
this object and see what you want and
you will be able to get it okay and for
this year you just need to add 1900 to
print the current correct here save it
and for the month you just need to add
plus one to it okay save it and run it
and it's going to print 2015 and month
is six okay because this is tuned now
for example you want to print the date
and time but in different format so you
want your customized format to print the
time so how you can do it so for that we
just need to include one more class
which is import Java dot txt okay
and then we will use our class called
simple date format okay and for example
s DF I'm going to give the name to the
objects you simple date format and in
the constructor it takes the format in
which you want to print the date okay so
first of all what format we can give
here so first of all just copy this
class simple date format and open your
favorite browser and search for it and
the first link most probably will come
from oracle.com and the search result
will be simple date format okay and in
this page you will be able to see
different formats so whenever you use Y
it will print here whenever you use m
capital M it will print the month in
here whenever you use week it will print
week in here so from here you can take
the reference which letter stands for
what okay so first of all we are going
to take this e letter to print day name
in week okay so let's take a and then
for example we want to print here so
what we can do we can just print why why
why why and why we are doing this
because we want to print for example
2012 or 2015 then we need to use four
times this this via okay and then you
want a - or / - separate month and year
and for month we can see Capital m so mm
for month and then for day we can use D
small D you can see here small D is the
day in month in a same way you can use
capital H for
or other and small as for second
so let's print that time so we want to
print our then let's separate it by :
and this is your customizable you know
letter okay
so it will print as it is if you want
instead of : you need slash or you need
- or whatever letter you need you can do
it so let's do it with - okay and then
small m which will print minute and then
small s which will print seconds and
after this you can use this SDF object
and call a method called format okay so
I'm going to just write this out and
then use SD f dot format okay and give
your date object here so just copy this
data object and give it here and save
the program and run the program and you
can see it's giving us our customizable
date okay so it's printing 2015 which
comes from here Tuesday which comes from
this e06 which comes from this mm 23
which comes from here and the other from
here minute and seconds okay so for
reference you can go to this oracle
website and see all the formats
you may use okay so in this way you can
use date and time and format date and
time according to your requirement in
Java I hope you enjoyed this video
