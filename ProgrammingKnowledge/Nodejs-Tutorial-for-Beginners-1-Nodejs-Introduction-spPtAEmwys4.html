node.js tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to give you a brief
introduction about node.js so let's get
started
node.js was originally written in 2009
by Rhian dell the initial release was
supported only Linux but in the later
years of node.js it also started
supporting Windows operating system and
Mac OS also now its development was led
by of course R and L and later the
development and maintenance was
sponsored by Joe and Joe and was his
employer now let's see what is node.js
so nodejs
is an open source cross-platform runtime
environment for developing server-side
web application so normally you would
link JavaScript with client-side web
applications but with node.js you can
develop server-side applications also
now node.js is an event at i/o and this
evented IO we will learn in the later
videos what is event at IO and how we
can use it ok so although node.js is not
a JavaScript framework many of its basic
modules were written in JavaScript and
developers can write new modules in
JavaScript the runtime environment
interprets JavaScript using Google's v8
JavaScript engine which is also the
JavaScript engine behind chrome which is
a web browser which makes it really fast
now node.js is released under MIT
license so it's a cross-platform
open-source
you know framework
so let's go next now what node.js is not
so as I already told you node.js is not
our web framework it's a server-side web
application right so you can write
server-side web applications with
node.js not the client-side right
node.js is not for beginners so whenever
you are you know starting node.js you
need to have basic understanding how you
know JavaScript works mainly object
oriented JavaScript and event did
JavaScript so you need to have some
knowledge of JavaScript but don't worry
I will you know start with very basic
level so you will be able to understand
and mostly most of them are you know
servers if you think about servers you
may link servers as a multi-threaded
application but node.js is not a
multi-threaded application it uses the
concept of asynchronous IO which we will
also see in the later videos now what is
unique about node.js so javascript is
used in client-side but no JS puts
JavaScript on the server side as I have
already told you thus making a
communication between client and server
will happen in the same language so the
learning curve for you will not be you
know so steep because if you know
JavaScript you can write the front end
and the back end of your web application
both in JavaScript
right now servers are normally a thread
based as I have already told you but
node.js is event based node.js serves
each request in a invented loop that can
able to handle simultaneous requests so
node.js is not a multi-threaded
application okay so it only have one
thread which uses event and the last
this is also I have already told you
that JA node.js program are executed by
v8 JavaScript engine the same engine
behind the Google Chrome browser also
now why you want to learn node.js
because node.js is really fast it can
handle tons of concurrent requests and
it's written in JavaScript which means
you can use the same code on server-side
and client-side so this is the brief
introduction about node.js and from the
next video I will start explaining how
you can install node.js and how we can
you know write our first code for
creating our first node.js server so I
hope you've enjoyed this video please
