tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use images in your Android
activity and also we are going to make a
cool app to change a major images on
button click so let's get started
first of all we are going to add some
images to our app so go to your project
and search for the folder called app and
inside this folder you will be able to
see this folder called re s or resources
folder and inside this resources folder
there will be a folder called drawable
so all your images you want to you know
keep inside this drawable folder so this
is the folder for keeping all your image
resources so go to this drawable folder
right click on this drawable folder and
go to new and click the option called
image asset ok so click the option
called image asset and in here you can
add four type of image or whatever image
you choose it will be converted into
four types one is hdpi which is high DPI
second is medium DPI or mdpi third is x
TPI or H X H dpi which is extra high DPI
and xx the XX h DPI
so high quality dpi this is also so I'm
just going to click OK just choose one
of them it doesn't matter which one you
choose because whatever image you will
choose it will be converted into all
these formats right so just click OK and
in here you will see oh there is a PNG
or default PNG of file already
provided by our project and in here now
we want to add our new files so I have
two Android icons here in my folder you
can find the Android icons easily on
internet or on some sites so download
these icons from here
these are PNG images in my case but they
can be different now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to give my resource name
first so for example a and D underscore
image 1 so this is the resource name you
need to give for your image ok and asset
type is launcher icon and in here in the
image file you just need to give the
path of your image okay so for example
my image path for this is I will just
copy the path here and paste it here and
then I can see my folder and in here I
can choose my PNG file one is PNG file
and other is jpg file so I'm going to
take both of the files and show you that
both of them works so first of all I
will choose this Android 1 jpg file from
here and then this file will be
converted into these four formats right
and then I will click Next and all these
options are ok and I will click finish
and once you click finish you will be
able to see there are four type of
images generated which is HTP I am dpi
xhdpi and xxhdpi four types of images
inside your drawable folder these four
types of images are generated because
you know your app will be able to resize
these images on the basis of
the phone sighs right that's why it has
generated these four type of images I am
going to add one more resource in the
same way
click Next and finish so now I have
added two images inside my drawable
folder right now in order to add these
images to your Android activity there is
a widget called image view so you can
drag and drop this widget here and in
here you can resize this widget also but
first of all what we are going to do is
we are going to add some resource to
this widget so just double click this
widget and then in the source you just
need to choose your source so just click
this small button at the side of this
source and in here you will be able to
see at the bottom your two images a and
D image 1 and a and D image 2 ok so I'm
going to choose the first image and
click OK
and now you will be able to see that
your image here what I am going to do is
I'm going to add a button here ok and
I'm going to change this button name as
switch image so I'm going to use this
for switching image switch image ok now
you can notice that the size of this
image is not you know fitting to your
Android activity so you can drag the
this side of your image and resize it
like this ok and it will be resized but
by resizing this image view you will
also notice that this size of this image
stays the same which is small size right
now in order to stretch your image
according to the size of this image view
what you can do is there is a property
here in your property so select your
image
view here and search for the property
called scale type and in the properties
there will be a property called scale
type in here and by default this will be
Center
you know scale type so when you click
this section here in front of the scale
type property you will be able to change
your you know scale type so I'm going to
choose fit Center and it's going to get
a little bit bigger according to the
center right and you can choose other
properties of scale type to fit your
requirement
for us fit center is okay for now okay
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to add a click event to this button and
we are going to choose the second image
using this button so we are going to
make an app when our users click this
button a is going to change this images
again and again and again okay so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my
main activity dot Java file so just
click this file and in here first of all
we are going to declare our two image
view and button of variables right
you
so now we have declared our two
variables and now we are going to create
a method which we are going to call in
our on create method so let's create a
method public void button click method
for example and inside this first of all
we are going to cast these two variables
one is for image and we will assign the
ID of the widgets to them
you
so now we have casted our variables and
now we are going to take this button
submit and we are going to set one click
method to it so button some submit dot
set on click listener and inside this
one click list now we are going to call
our new on click listener now inside
this on click method what we are going
to do is first of all let's declare two
more variables at the top and these
variables will be one for current image
index so this will be private int
current image index and second we are
going to declare an int array for the
images so images is equal to and we are
going to initialize this array by the
images themselves so we are going to
find the ID of these images these images
are in the drawable folder you can see
here so we can just find them yr dot
drawable dot now the name of this so my
first image name is an image one in a
same way you can find second image so so
I am going to add this third image
called IC underscore launcher which was
already present so r dot drawable dot IC
underscore launcher ok so now we have
array of three images in this image
variable right so now in our on click
method what we are going to do is first
of all we are going to increase the
index of
this current image so current image plus
plus and then this current image will be
we are going to assign it to the current
image modulus the length of your length
of your image array so we are going to
take this images variable dot length
okay so now what we are going to do is
on the basis of this index we can you
know call this index which will indicate
this these images one by one right
so what I am going to do is in this
image view variable I am going to set
the image so image view dot set and I'm
going to set the image and this will be
the image resource so set image resource
and then we are going to take this array
of image and then we are going to call
these images on the basis of index and
index is this one right so now our code
is ready one more thing we need to do is
we need to call this button click event
inside our on create method right now we
are ready so we are going to run our app
so now our app is running and you can
see this image on our activity and let's
click this button and let's see what
happens while clicking this button so
I'm going to click this button and the
image changes once again I'm going to
click this button and the image changes
so every time you click this button this
index changes in the image array and we
can see new array
or if you want to just set one image
what you can do is instead of writing
this code and in here you can directly
call your r dot drawable dot whatever
image name you have inside here okay and
this will just call your one image and
it will not switch our images one by one
by one okay
so this is direct calling of image using
this set image resources so I hope you
