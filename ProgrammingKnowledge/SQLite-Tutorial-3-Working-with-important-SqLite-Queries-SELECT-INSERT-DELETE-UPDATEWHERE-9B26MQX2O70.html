last video I have shown you how to work
with SQLite manager how to download it
on Mozilla and how to create a new
database with SQLite manager and how to
make a new table and insert data in this
video I will show you how to pass some
important queries so I will show you
what queries which you must learn in
order to kickstart with SQLite so open
your SQLite manager in the last video I
have made this table called employee and
in that table I have employee ID name
surname and age for columns and this
first column is automatically generated
by this SQL SQLite manager but this we
will not consider and it is not the part
of the table it's just for the reference
and now we have some eight employee IDs
and their name title and age and now I
will show you how to pass some queries
to manipulate this data so go to your
execute query tab this one in your s
collide manager and in here you can
write the queries right so first simple
query you can write is I will show you
in a moment but first of all I will show
you a very good suggestion tab which
will give you suggestions while you are
making queries so in this execute query
tab go at the right and you will see
select data manipulation create altered
drop
reindex and pragma these tabs at the
right of this execute SQL tab when you
click them they will give the suggestion
for passing the queries for example you
press this select star from table name
and will give you how this very
structure should look like so select
star from table name our table name is
employee so just replace this table name
and pass this query it will give you all
the table data now this star means all
the data whatever is present in the
table now you want some specific data
then write the name of the column for
example if you want only the name to
show in the table just write select name
from your table name when you run this
query only the name column will appear
and nothing else or the column will be
tolerated so now if you want to show
name and age for example just write name
comma age from your table name and just
click it and this time only name and age
will come here now for example you want
the data of the employee number 1 0 3
only this data or you want the name of
the employee whose employee ID is 1 0 3
so how can you get with the help of this
escalate so just write select name from
employee and we will we have to use
where Clause here
so if you want you can take a suggestion
from here cilix with where clause just
click it and it will give you
suggestions so it says select this all
or distinct so we want only name so we
will select name and this will be the
result from your table name this will
this is what your employee table so
replace this with employ where and your
expression instead of pair so you want
the data of the employee whose employee
ID is 1 0 3 so you will write here where
this EMP ID EMP I D is equal to 1 0 3
right and just run this query it shows
me some error so it's showing me some
errors this will alert you with error
and as far as I can see I haven't
provided the space between select and
name so I will just change here and I
will give the space between select a
name and now when I run my query it will
give me the data of the employee ID 1 0
3 only the name right and once again I
want the whole data of the employee so
just right select star from employee
where employee ID is 1 0 for this time
for example I want to search for and now
you can get the whole data I mean for
column all columns of the data so in
this way you can use where query now in
another condition
you may want to find the employee data
where the employee age is between for
example 32 and 38 all the employees you
want on the list of all employees whose
age is between 32 and 38 this is an
example so what you can write is select
star from employee where your age age
between 32 and 38 so 32 and 38 okay and
run the query and you will get the list
of all employees whose age is between 32
and 38 only three employees are there
okay when you are passing the string
instead of these numbers for example you
want the data of the employee whose
title is DBA okay so when you want to
pass string you always cover it with
single quotes so first I will not cover
it by single quote and let's see what
error it gives dB where title is equal
to DB a and I run and it gives me the
error and it says it's near DBA but when
I cover this DBA data which is this
title DBA data and when I run the query
once again it gives me the data okay so
the employee whoever is there whose data
is whose title is dB
a their information comes here so when
you pass some string just cover it or
enclose it in the single quotes now you
may want the list of employees in some
order for example in ascending order of
age you want the list of employee it's
not in ascending order so right now you
can see it worth twenty to thirty to
forty five twenty seven this is not in
our descending order of age so we want
to list out the data in ascending order
so you will write select star from
employee and right order by according to
the age you want so you write order by
age and run the query and if you notice
here the age it's in ascending order so
22 27 32 36 so it's increasing now if
you want descending order by default you
don't want don't need to write that you
want the order in this ascending it
takes the order by default ascending but
if you want from largest value to the
lowest well uses this value you want at
the top and this 22 at the bottom then
you just add de SC here and when you run
the query once again it will give you
the age in descending order so from the
biggest edge to the smallest age now
what we can do more is our select is
almost over
here you can the right or you if you
want to delete data so just go to this
suggestion tab and just click delete and
here it will give you suggestions delete
from your table name so I will insert
instead of table name and where where is
our clause and after that what data you
want to delete so for example I want to
delete the data of employee ID
1:08 so you right selects from employee
ID where employee ID is equal to 1 0 8
and just execute it and when you go to
this browse and search tab once again it
will delete the data of employee ID 1 0
8 you if you notice here if you want to
insert data just go to insert query so
here you can see the suggestion from
here and it says insert into your table
name which is employee then the list of
the column list so if you want to add or
insert new data then you need MPI D
comma name comma type two and comma age
so in the first bracket you will pass
the name of the columns and then write
values and in the second column you
write the value list so value list for
example employee ID is 1:08 comma the
name mark
and the title CEO for example and AJ is
58 and just click run and it's saying me
some error you notice that I haven't
enclose this string in single quotes so
I also forgot to add and it gives me
error so just add this string in single
quote and here also single quote and one
the query and it's run and now the new
employee ID 1:08 mark Tessa is added
into the static goal here and you will
notice this employee is added here so
now delete is okay and insert it is okay
now if you want to update some data so
just see the suggestion update and it
will give you the update query
suggestion so update table name which is
employee set and assignment so whatever
you want to set and then where
expression so for example I will once
again take this
1:08 employee ID and I want to change
the name of this employees so how can I
do that
so I will write update employee set and
then assignment so name is equal to
single quote single quote yeah and
instead of mark I want the name John
okay and where where your employee ID is
1:08 right so EMP ID is equal to one
zero eight so I will update this name
instead of this mark I want to add John
here so run this query and your query is
executed and see here the name is
changed now so update delete and insert
is complete once again let's see what's
all there so if you want to create our
table then here is the suggestion if you
want to create a new table so write
create table if not exist and the table
name so for example what can I add pump
data for example and now the column
names okay so in the column names first
give the definition of your column so
column name and then in the bracket give
the column data type and give constraint
if any so for example not null or
primary key you can enter so I will give
this bracket and I want pump I D and it
will take data type integer for example
and pum
daata and it will take the Bearcat
datatype and I click run and it saves me
error
why because pump data you need to give
table name you cannot give space in
between the name of the table so now run
the query and query is 1 and now here
you can see one more table here when you
click and go to browse and search it has
two rows pump data and pump ID so in
this way it's I have shown you some of
the basic important query how to pass
them but you can always go here and see
the suggestion according to the
requirement and you can pass the queries
so I my basic aim is to make you aware
of these basic queries and now if your
foundation is better then you can pass
other queries also by just seeing these
suggestions so I hope you have enjoyed
this beat video and you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
