going to show you how to insert data
from your jframe into your database or
from java to your database so we have
already made these text P with
respective names for example if you
write employee ID named Solomon age and
if you wish to save this data into the
database by clicking this button today
we are going to learn that so we have
already made art Save button in a
previous tutorial I just want to change
its variable name CMD save it's good
practice name your J component and just
right click event and extraction
performed we go to the source block I
have already made triangle a catch block
in order to save time so just write Phi
and click catch block and and try block
write string s ql as we always write
and in this we have to write a query so
query for saving or inserting data into
database is insert into whatever is your
table name our table name is employee
info and they employ info and now we
have to write which component you want
to fill the dot oven which column you
want to fill the data so for example in
our table I want to add employee ID name
surname and age so I will write here
name
the name and page I hope I spend all the
things correct and then write value
and the racket do you have to make four
values your answer for question marks
three and four so this is the query you
have to write in order to insert your
data and then write PS T is equal to con
dot prepare statement as always we write
and PS T dot execute query and write
execute these two codes without the
right and between these two you have to
put est not set string
into first place you want to add
data because first place is a employee
ID so you have to just copy the variable
name text employee ID hi Addie text
feels variable name and just paste dot
cat text
and in the same way all four columns we
have to write the same first second
fourth or of both the name x field
variable name is X names to copy and
paste it here then surname table name is
text surname copy paste it here one last
time really - age copy paste ten
this is the simple code save your
program include automation let's check
the program now
last thing I forgot to write here I
think is when the data is saved you want
to show some message so right here
actually copy this thing which is
already written in catch block paste it
here and instead of e you must write
your string and write it here saved so
we know that our dot I saved now let's
try to run the program employee ID for
example we have already - and we add the
third employ his name is Sam for example
Sam no I am certain age is 23 and press
see if
I think I have some erroneous syntax
let's check so I think I have made
mistake here instead of value I should
have written value so add one extra s in
value so it will be values and then
let's try to run the program
once again three and so name 23 is the
age and let's just data safe and it
shows that data is already saved but you
can see in the database yeah you have to
display fresh in this thing in order to
see you data so you know what say 3 sam
pam and 23 it already goes into the
database once again let's try some other
number 4
lucky cat 24 and save that is saved
press ok and refresh terrible so our
data is saved
one more problem here is when we save
our data it doesn't instantly shows
thrown into your table for that you can
simply take your
update table method
and just pasted below your code here so
once again right-click save action
perform here and below type try catch
block just paste the method update table
so now if you save data
the home 23 for example and if you press
save
the table automatically refreshes itself
because we have added updated map of the
method into our safe action perform
method so that was the small tutorial
for saving or insulting data into your
database I hope you have enjoyed and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
