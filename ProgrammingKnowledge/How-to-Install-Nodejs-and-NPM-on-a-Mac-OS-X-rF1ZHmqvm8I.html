you how you can download and install
node.js on your Mac operating system so
let's get started and let's see how we
can do it so first of all open your
favorite browser and search for node.js
and the first link which will appear
here will be from node.js dot o-r-g so
I'm going to click this link which is
going to open the website of node.js
which is node.js og directly on this
landing page you will see two versions
of node.js you can download for your Mac
operating system so at the time of
making this video six point eleven point
four is the LTS version and eight point
six point zero is the current version so
I'm going to just use the current
version so I'm going to just download
the current version of node.js so I'm
going to click this button which is for
current version which is eight point six
point zero at the time of making this
video and once this pkg file is
downloaded we are going to install it so
I'm going to wait for the download to
complete so now this dot pkg file is
downloaded so I'm going to just double
click on this dot pkg file which I have
downloaded and I'm going to minimize the
browser now we can see the node.js
installation wizard and this is the
location where node.js will be installed
so I'm going to just click continue here
and this is the license terms and
conditions and if you agree with these
lines and stones and condition you just
need to click continue so I'm going to
just click continue and then I'm going
to click agree and now it asked me how
do you want to install this software
install for all users of this computer I
will just click continue here and then I
will just click install and now I will
just give the password of my Mac
operating system and then press install
software and now the installation of the
software will start and you can see in
few seconds node.js has been installed
on my system so the location
node.js is installed is this one so user
for /local bin forward slash node so
this is the location for the node chairs
and the second location is for the NPM
NPM is node package manager which is
really useful when you want to install
any package related to node.js so these
are the two location where they are
installed I am just going to click close
and just say move to trash now to check
whether node.js and nbm has been
installed successfully on our system we
can just check it using the terminal so
just to open your terminal you can just
search for the terminals from here and
then open the terminal from here also
and here you just need to write node - V
for knowing the version of node we have
installed and you can see it will return
this kind of version which is version
eight point six point zero which we have
installed and in the same way we can
find the version of NPM so just write
NPM minus V and then press ENTER and it
will return the version of NPM installed
on your system which is five point three
point zero at the time of making this
video so this is how you can download
and install node.js on your Mac
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
this video please wait come in subscribe
