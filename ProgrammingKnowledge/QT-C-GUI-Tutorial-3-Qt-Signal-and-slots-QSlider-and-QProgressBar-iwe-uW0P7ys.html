last video I have shown you how to
create your first C++ graphical user
interface with Qt framework in this
video I will show you how to use signals
and slots in your Qt framework because
it's a very basic framework and we will
use the signal and slot concept again
and again with our cute C++ GUI
programming so let's get started first
of all to demonstrate this signal and
slot concept in the last video itself we
have used this concept we have taken
this button from this design view and
for the action perform or for making
this button to perform any action we
right-click it and we click this go-to
slot so we use the signal and slot count
concept where our button was a signal
and we are performing this signal to
slot and the slot was when the button is
clicked then what happens right so there
there are two ways of using signal and
slots with your cute creator a cute
framework one is visual method and the
second is with the code so I will
explain you both the method so first for
this example I will use a progress bar
so let's search where is it there is it
in this play widget drag-and-drop
up progress bar and take a horizontal
slider from here it's in
this input widgets so drag-and-drop this
signal and now you can select both of
them and here is some buttons and you
can see layout vertically Li layout
horizontally and there are some buttons
here so when you select these two
together and when you say that layout
vertically
they will lay out together vertically
and then you can resize them so this is
one thing here right now when you you
just enter into your design view by
default this button is clicked edit
widget so this button is by default
clicked and you can see just next to it
it's a added signal slash slots so when
you click this button it converts your
design into signal and slot view so now
when you select this slider and just
click it and you drag and drop your
signal to your progress bar from from
your slide bar to the progress bar it
will connect like this so just click and
just drop on the progress bar and it
will open this signal and slot
configuration so what we want is we want
when our slide bar value changes or when
we move our slide bar so we want this
function value change functions when its
value change we want our
value to be set on the progress bars the
same value so when the value of slide
bar change it should appear on the
progress bar also so I click set value
it's taking the value from here and
setting the value in the progress bar
and I click OK so it has created a
signal and slot configuration to us
slide bar and this progress bar we
haven't done anything programmatically
we just use this visual method now when
you click this Run button it will build
first so it will open the Save Changes
say save all and it will build your
program first see here and once it's
built your run program will run here so
notice when I move the slide bar this
progress bar will also change see when I
move this slide bar this progress bar is
changing so this is a signal and slot
combination ok and we haven't even coded
anything it's just the visual method so
this was the visual method if you want
you can just select this signal in slot
and just click or press delete button
and
so just go here just sorry just
selecting again again but so just
right-click on one of these signal or
slot and say select all and once again
right-click and say delete so it will
delete your signal and slot
configuration view which you have done
on these signal and slots and just go to
the normal state which is added widgets
and now your normal form will appear
with without signal and slot
configurations so now this time we are
going to run this program or write a
code for this program and it will
function as same as earlier which it was
running with signal and slot
configuration so this time we are going
to write a code so what you need to do
is just go to your edit view and because
we are using main window so our main
form is called main window so go to main
window CPP file and here we have a
constructor and adding constructor here
so what you need to do is go to this
constructor here and just make a space
and here you write connect and it will
give you or suggest you the appropriate
method so what we are going to use it is
this method we are going to use to
connect our
horizontal slider to our progress bar so
signal is our horizontal sliders when we
change the value of this horizontal
slider it should appear on the progress
bar also so our first line of code is UI
and then this arrow pointer and you say
horizontal slider because we are using
horizontal slider and this is our signal
so write comma and write signal and what
signal we are providing here is the
value change value change okay and now
for the slot this was the code for the
signal for horizontal slider and then
write comma and write UI and once again
this arrow pointer and now this time for
the progress bar so select progress bar
so this is our slot so progress bar is
our slot it's taking the value so write
comma and write slot
and give brackets after this lot and
just select set value we need here set
value int okay so we write this code
connect and in the bracket right UI
arrow pointers horizontal slider which
is our signal so we provide this signal
and what we need to do what we want is
when we change the value of our signal
which is our horizontal slider it should
appear on the progress bar so it's our
slot so we want to set this value to the
progress bar that's why we have written
this code okay
and now when you run the program just go
here click this green button it will say
do you want to save changes yes I want
to save changes it builds the program so
while building I am getting an error and
it's saying unexpected end of file in
macro expansion so let's see what I did
wrong here I think the bracket closing
is not uniform so let's see here I close
the bracket and here I think this
bracket I have enclosed so I close this
bracket from here okay now it's closed
and I haven't closed this whole bracket
also so I close this bracket from here
and now I think my code should work so
remember the closing of these brackets
and once again just copy this same line
and now when I
run my code I save all changes and it's
building and now my build is successful
and once again when I move this slider
this progress bar is changing so we have
seen two ways of doing the same thing
one by using visual method of signaling
slots and one by using the actual code
so you can use either of them to run
your program so this was a simple signal
and slot explanation I hope you have
learned something new this time please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
