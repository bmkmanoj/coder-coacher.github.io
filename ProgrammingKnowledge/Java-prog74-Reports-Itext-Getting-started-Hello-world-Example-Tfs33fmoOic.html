show you how to add your I text Java
files to your library and how to make a
simple hello world example using I text
so let's get started first of all go to
your project and whatever your project
is go to your libraries right click Add
jar files and in here there is a folder
called
I text
and you must select all of them and open
and I think the files are already added
yeah you can see all the files are added
in the library so we are going to start
our example so in here this is my
project
I will add one more button for I text or
report so whenever I click it I will
generate my report or I will save my
report in the form of PDF so go to your
palette take a button and crank it to
your jframe I will name it as a porter
and then as always my click 'add go to
event action action performed and you
will come to the coding area of your
program and in here you should write
documents this is a very simple example
I'm gonna show you today so this is just
the starting document
document like this I think it is showing
some error I right-click and fixing boat
and I need to fix this import so I will
click OK and my ever is gone up then
right etf PDF writer dot get
get instance and in the bracket just in
between the bracket you must copy your
document variable name paste it here
comma new file output stream
and just a bracket and inside this
bracket you have to write what is near
the name you want to give to your PDF
file so I will name it as report dot PDF
you can give a name whatever you like
you can like I forgot to enclose it in
the double quotes so I've done that and
don't worry about this ever this will go
and we write the full code so I have
given name to my report and then after
that to write or copy your document
variable paste it here dot open this
will open your documents after this
whatever you write will be shown into
your report so you must write document
dot open and second thing is document
dot whenever if you are opening your
document you also have to close your
documents so document open and document
close and in between whatever you write
will be included in your reports so for
example I want to add a small paragraph
into my report
so I will write document
dot and dot and in the add semi-colons
sub knots and brackets you must write
new sorry mistake you must write new
paragraph and now brackets and in the
brackets whatever you want to know right
for example I want to write hello world
so whenever I will write this in my
report I must I should be able to see
whenever I will generate my report hello
world in the form of PDF my program is
showing some error here it's due to the
library ever
I haven't end it so I will right click I
will go to fix import I will click it
and I was like okay so hopefully this
error will go and once again some error
is coming because I haven't got this so
I have to include it in try and catch
blocks
record plate
and
job should be in dot okay semicolon and
here also a semicolon so now the errors
are gone because I just cover my code in
the try catch block so our hello world
example is ready to be executed so let's
see what happens when I run the program
so I right-click and click run flat file
and my laptop is really slow so here
comes the one screen and I click my
report button you can see nothing
happens but the report is automatically
saved into your project file so where is
your project file the project file is
the file where this your project is
saved so in your project file we can
find your report dot PDF file so I will
go to my project file it's in NetBeans
project projects and this is my project
name and in here you can see the report
this is the report I've generated right
now so I will click it and you can see
hello wallet here so this is the small
HelloWorld program I've made for the
Java report once again this report you
can find into your wherever you have
saved your project NetBeans project in
that folder you can find your report so
don't be confused just go to your
project and in that project you can also
find your source files and build
whatever these files also so that's all
for now
I hope you have learned something new
and in the next tutorial I will tell you
something more about my reports
so thanks for watching and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
