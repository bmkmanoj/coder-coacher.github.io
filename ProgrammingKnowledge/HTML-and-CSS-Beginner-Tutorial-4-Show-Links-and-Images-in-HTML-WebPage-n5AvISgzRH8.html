last video I have shown you how to add
text formatting tags to your HTML codes
so right now my page looks like this
I've shown you how to write different
type of text in HTML code in this video
I will show you how to add a link and
how to add a image with your HTML code
so let's get started this was my
previous code in my last tutorial and in
the next line I want to add a link of
some website or something which I click
and it should open so it should be a
clickable link so how can I make it so
for that you write as always greater
than in smaller than and inside this a
and same like this you also close it so
whatever inside this you will write it
will be a link so for example I want to
give the name of the link first so I
will write
so here I will write some link so Li and
link or you can write this is a link
okay so this whatever you write inside
this a tag will appear as a link but
still you haven't provided a link like
Google link like this HTTP slash slash
www.google.com/mapmaker a and this sign
greater than sign go after that and
right here h r EF h ref and equal to and
double quote and inside this double
quote just enter your link here okay so
now when you run your program first we
need to save this before running so so
just save and run the program run in the
firefox and you can see this last line
which we have written as a link shows
this underlined they below this text and
it kind of indicate that this is a link
so we wanted to open when we press this
link we wanted to open a Google page
which was this link right so just see
when I click it should open a Google
page I click it
and it has opened me a Google page so in
this way you can use this link tag with
your code okay now I will show you how
to add a picture with your HTML code so
for that you right here in the next line
first of all smaller than in greater
than sign and in here you write I M G
this is a image tag and in here first of
all you will pass the source of the file
so I have in my folder in the same
folder I have a picture so this is my
HTML file and wherever I saved my HTML
file I have our image called HTML dot
PNG image right and it opens and opens
our image and now I want to show this
image inside this HTML code so first
thing you need to do is put your image
in the same folder as your code wherever
your code just place your image there
itself in the same folder so now I will
go to my code and in in here I will add
a source to my image so i will write SRC
equal to and in the double quote I will
write HTML dot PNG which was the name of
my image HTML was the name dot PNG is
the type of my image right now in after
that I will give a width and height of
the image so what size I want the image
to be I will write that so write with
equal to and double quote and space how
we hide equal to n double quote and
first see when we don't give any width
to the image so let's try without giving
any width so just write IMG source and
the source file ok and save and run the
program and it will show the image in
the original form whatever its size is
it will show the image in the same form
same size as the image so original size
of the image now for example I want to
reduce the size of this image to fit
into my web page so how can i edit its
image right this width and height
element and in here write the size of
this image whatever size width and
height for example 142 so this is the
width and this is the height and now
when we I save this code and I run the
code once again you can see the size of
the image is reduced so in this way you
can reduce the size of your image okay
so in this way you can use this link and
image with your HTML code in the next
video I will show you some more exciting
code for HTML so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
