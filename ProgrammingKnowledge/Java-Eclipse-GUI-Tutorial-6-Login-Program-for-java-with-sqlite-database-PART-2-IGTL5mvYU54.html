whenever I execute this query this query
will be executed and the result will be
transferred to this RS object okay so in
the next line what I am going to do I
will make a while loop because this RS
object gives the value one by one
so I will use while and close this while
loop here and I will copy this RS which
is the result dot and then I will write
next so this will this will give me the
result one by one and if you see here
this method returns me boolean value
that means until and unless this and
next is true or unten analogous we are
we are getting the values from the
database this while loop will go on
otherwise whenever this method will be
false then it will go out of the loop
right okay so in this while loop what I
am going to do is first of all above
this while loop are we create integer
int count is equal to zero okay and this
count I will in the while loop I will
increase this count so I will right
count is equal to count plus one you can
use other type to increment this like
for example count plus plus so it
depends upon you right for now I am
using count is equal to n plus one okay
and then depending upon the count I get
I want to show the messages so this
count I will tell you why I have done
like that but I want to show the message
on the basis of count first
so if
if this count
is equal to 1 this will be double equal
to right is equal to 1 then I want to
show the message here I will copy this J
option pain not show message dialog in
the if condition and I will I will say
this one user name and password is
correct okay and else else if I get the
count greater than 1 greater than 1 then
I will say I have
to placate user and password I will
explain you why I am writing like this
duplicate user in name and password and
else else I want show username and
password is not correct so I will show
the message username and password is not
correct okay and I will also show you
maybe some message like try again
or whatever so why I have declared this
count here is so once this query is
passed and username and password it
checks from on the basis of whatever I
enter in these text boxes text box name
for the username and text box name for
the password and it will go it will keep
the result in this RS and whenever
whatever result RS this this counter
will increase okay so if only if our
result so whenever we pass the query we
get the result and if we get only one
result that means it has matched the
username and password because we only
have one result as a as a result that
means it's our username and password is
correct if we get no result then we say
the username and password is not correct
but if we get multiple result greater
than 1 that means there is some mistake
there there are duplicate username and
password in our database ok so I will
explain all this condition or I will
show demonstrate all these condition one
by one when I run the program but the
one of the most important thing is
whenever you write a query and execute a
query you need to close the connection
after you execute the query
so after this try catch block which you
have written
what you need to do is you're you your
query is executed you get the result and
after getting the result you need to
close the connection with the database
because SQLite is only providing one
connection at a time okay there is a
constraint with SQLite you need to make
one connection at a time with SQLite
database
so after this try/catch block at the end
of this catch block you may write
finally and then and finally you can
once again write try
and catch
catch
and in here
you can close the connection in the
catch or in the try sorry so in here I
will write the exception which is which
I will show you here once again this
will be exception and in the try I will
close the connection so I have created
this preparedstatement here right so how
I can close the connection if I have
these outside these try block because it
will not recognize if the they are in
side this time block because of the
localization constraint okay so now I
can use this prepared statement like
this and if it's not showing unhandled
exception okay so let us see do it here
and instead of using this so you can
simply do one more thing which is more
easier at the end of this try block so
just at the end of this tribal and above
this catch block what you need to do is
you just write RS which is our result
set RS which is this one result set
object dot close
and PST PST which is our prepared
statement right
PST this one dot close
and what these two line will do is after
executing your query they will close the
connection with the database so that
whenever you want to use this connection
once again in the other method you are
ready to use the connection and the
connection is not open so these two line
take care of that now we will run the
program and you see I have this database
open here so I will show you what
happens when this database is open I
will run the program and I will say
login dot Java okay first of all I will
get the message connection successful
that means I am I am successfully
connected to the database then I have
these username and password field and
let's see what's there in the username
and password so I have the username is
equal to 1 for the first employee
username is equal to 1 password is equal
to 1 right so I enter this username is
equal to 1 password is equal to 1 and
you see here this my password is masked
with this dot symbol because I have used
password field for that and I will click
this login once again or I will click
this login button and what happens Java
long array out of found exception so I
want to see what is this
so I will pause the video and I will see
what the error is and then I will come
back so I found the error which I am
facing so in this try-catch block if you
remember I have written this query
escalade query then I have prepared the
prepared statement which is PSD then I
was passing this set string here
PST dot set string and I was writing the
index here right so index of the text
field or username was 1 or 0 and index
for the password for was 1 right 0 &amp;amp; 1
so I checked it and this index start
from a 1 not 0 so this should be 1 &amp;amp; 2
okay so this index should be 1 &amp;amp; 2 not 0
&amp;amp; 1 so username for index username start
from 1 and password will be 2 okay now
when we run the program once again from
the program connection successful let's
see what username we have user name one
password 1 okay I'll write user name one
password one password is masked login
username and password is correct because
it matches the username and password
from him now suppose we enter some
random username which is not there in
the database okay I will just click this
and now you see the message username and
password is not correct try again okay I
will try again so if you see here
for employee ID - and employee ID 3
I have duplicate username and password
this I have done intentionally to check
whether it gives me the result duplicate
to username and password so I have four
employee ID - two username and password
- and - and same for employee ID 3 - and
two username and password so i will
write username - password - and let's
see what happens I see I get to placate
username and password
that means the username and password for
employee ID 2 &amp;amp; 3 is duplicate so they
has to be changed so we have
successfully created a login page using
our windowbuilder GUI application in
Java and maybe in the next video I will
show you some other useful tricks for
with windowbuilder so I hope you will
watch the next video please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
