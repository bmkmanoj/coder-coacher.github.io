JavaFX tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can apply
styles to our components using style
sheets so if you remember in the last
video we have created a project and when
we create a project there is this line
of code which is automatically generated
for us which is right now interesting
for us which is this one scene dot guest
style dot ad and in the bracket get lost
get resource and this application dot
CSS is added so we have a CSS called
application dot CSS so we will open it
you can see in your application package
there is a application dot CSS file
which is right now empty now this file
we can use to give styles right so let's
see how we can give styles to our
components inside our JavaFX using this
CSS file now this works same as CSS
files work so for example let's open our
F XML file so I will open my F XML file
and I have this button and a label here
so using the ID of the button I can give
the style to the button so this is the
ID click me so this is the ID click me
and I can just take this ID and with the
hash and this ID I can give styles to
this particular button which has this ID
so for example I want to change the font
size first of all so I will just give -
FX - font and you have these options for
style font size font family so you can
choose right so for example I want font
size right now and I will just give 20
px okay and just give this semicolon
let's give 30 PX for now okay
now in the same way
we can provide some background color for
example FX - background color and we
will use a method called RGB SOR G ba
and then we can give these parameters
here 255 255 255 and point eight zero
right now for example I want to give the
foreground color I can use FX - text
fill so just use this option and for
example I want the foreground color of
blue something like this right now I
want some padding and some border color
also so what can I do here I can give
the padding something like this FX -
padding and then just give 6 6 6 6 -
every side ok let us give a border
radius so FX - border radius and let's
give the border radius of 8 here okay
now for example I want to change the
weight of the font so I can just use FX
- font weight which can be bold or
italic or something else for example we
use bold here ok and now just save your
code and run your application and let's
see how it looks like so you can see our
button looks like this right nothing
fancy but this is just the demonstration
how you can change the styles of your
button ok now similarly if you want to
change the style of your label you can
just use the ID of your label which is
this one my message go to your
application dot CSS and give hash and
then your label ID and in the curly
braces for example I will just
- the same style here and paste it here
and I will just save my code and run it
and when I just click this button I can
see this number random number generated
in the label here right now for example
you want to change the background color
of your scene so what you can do here is
you can just use dot root so just use
dot root here and then give the styles
to your root for example background
color so just write FX - background
color and for example I want to give the
background color of grey right so just
save it and then run your code and now
the color of my scene becomes grey right
now for example you have multiple
buttons and you want to apply the same
styles to all the buttons so instead of
using this ID you can just use dot
button and it will apply to all the
buttons so something like this save your
code and run it and it will be same so
it will apply to all the button the same
styles if you have multiple buttons
something like four or five buttons the
same styles will be applied to every
button and similarly you can do for the
labels so if you have multiple labels
you can just use dot label and then
apply the same styles to all the labels
okay now let's open our F XML file using
the scene builder so I will right click
on my F XML file and open with scene
builder and here you can see the style
is not directly applied here so when we
run our code we can see this style but
this style sheet is not applied to this
project and
you can add a stylesheet to this scene
builder you can just go to preview here
and then choose this option called
stylesheet and then add a stylesheet and
then you can browse to your project so
my project name is JavaFX
test source application and choose your
application dot CSS file from here and
open it and now your style is be visible
here right so you can just preview this
style okay so in this way you can add
this application or CSS or CSS styles in
see in builder right now if you want to
learn more about this styling and CSS
file for JavaFX we have a reference so
just open your browser and search for
JavaFX CSS reference and the first link
which will appear here will be from all
article calm slash JavaFX slash the link
to this JavaFX CSS reference guide so
you can open this CSS reference guide
and here is the documentation for the
CSS you know styling right so for
example i want some color for example
this color so i can just copy it from
here
go to my style sheets and instead of
blue i can just apply this color here
right save it and run it and this color
is applied here okay so this guide is
really useful in you know finding out
how you can tweak your CSS file and
apply the style sheets okay so in this
way you can apply styles to your JavaFX
components i hope you have enjoyed this
