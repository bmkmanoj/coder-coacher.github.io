we have made a login page in our
previous tutorial in which venue and the
password and username and you have to
click the login button in order to login
today I'm going to show you how to login
with a Enter key or by pressing the
enter key so if you click login button
then also you can login otherwise after
entering your password if you just press
the Enter key then it will also plug
into the page so today I am going to
show you how to login with the enter key
pressed so let's get started
so what you have to do is whatever is
your last entry for example you enter
your username and then enter your
password you can also enter the level so
that this user name and password matches
and level also matches then sometimes
login page opens but in our case only
after entering username and password and
you can we click login the block we are
able to login to the software so
whatever is your last entry in our case
this is password like click the text
field of that and go to event so go to
event then go to key and gate click key
pressed once again I will show you how
to do that in the password field text
field this field right click event in
that key and key plus even just click it
and here
the key press event will open here you
have to write if condition if this first
of all make SF statement then we will
give the F condition later and now go to
your design jframe and go to the login
action performed method you have written
supplement action action perform in a
login action performed third we have
written public or this code just copy
the whole code which is in the log in
action perform method I copy
holy code and
I paste it in the F condition in these
two parentheses just paste the whole
code per log and what I have done is I
copied the log in actionperformed code
whole code I copied from here and what I
have done is I pasted in the password
event key press event in here in if
condition I have and I have pasted all
my code here and now in here write the
condition if e VD dot
kept key
code is equal to K T event dot V k VK go
down down so much for me k underscore
and you have to write this EVT not get
keycode is equal to t event dot VK
underscore enter so in this way when you
run the program and after entering your
password when you hit Enter key then you
will be able to login so let's run our
program and see our code is working okay
or not run and here in screen so I enter
login ID and password and you can see my
cursor is here so I'm not clicking this
login button by of my cursor and I am
just pressing enter and here you can see
my username and password is correct
and when I press ok why I am able to
login to the screen so once again what I
have done I tell you first of all go to
your password right click password text
view right click it go to event key key
plus event and in the key press event
you have to write a condition if EVT dot
get code is equal to key event not VK
enter and in the air condition you have
to paste your login code which we have
copied from login event action action
formed Anya I copied whole method and I
have just pasted in between my hip
conditions I hope you have learned
something new today and please recommend
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
