teach you about operator overloading in
C++ so we all know that C++ has some
operators which we can use to perform
some algorithmic tasks or you can
perform some comparison tasks from these
operator so for example we have some of
these kind of operator which you can see
here so we have this plus operator equal
to operator minus or Astrix or this flag
backslash percentage and we also have
these comparison operators in C++ and by
these operator we can use this operator
too for example we can use this plus
operator to add two integer values or
two double values or two float values
right so we can use it like this we have
two integer for example x and y we can
use this plus operator to add these X&amp;amp;Y
and store it into this Z variable and
this is also a equal to operator and
equal to operator we use it for
assigning the value so these are the
some of the inherent properties of these
operators so C plus vs. they find that
we can use plus to add two values or
equal to to assign the values but for
example we can we have some values or we
have some object which we want to add
for example so for example I have this
class called vector and I want to add
the to object of this class ok so I will
define two vectors like this vector 1
which has object back 1 and second class
object back two and I want to add these
back 1 and back 2 and assign it in the
third vector called back 3
is it possible using C++
well when I compile it and when I see it
it it will give me an error because C++
doesn't know that there is a class
called vector so C++ libraries doesn't
have these kind this class this class is
user-defined class right so it doesn't
know if we use plus it has to add these
to a two object of the class okay so we
can use a concept called operator
overloading and sin it's same as method
overloading what is Method overloading
we can define two functions of same name
and these two functions can perform two
different tasks but they can have the
same name and this is called a function
overloading in the same way we can use
operator overloading
to perform the same or perform two
different tasks from from a same
operator for example I want to add these
two object I can do this whenever i can
if i define a operator which can be
overloaded so let's see how we can do
this so for example I want to add two
vector values which are the Cartesian
values and I will give you an example so
for example I want to add these two
Cartesian values for example 4 comma 2
and 2 comma 2 I can do it in in
mathematic it's done by like this so 4
plus 2 which is 4 plus 2 is equal to 6
right and this Y 2 plus 2 here 2 plus 2
is equal to 4 so I want to add these two
cartesian value using a class and I want
to use plus operator for that and I want
the result like this
can we do this let's see if we can do
this by operator overloading we can
certainly do that by operator operator
overloading so let's see I have defined
this class called vector it has two
public number variable which are integer
X&amp;amp;Y and I have this default constructor
which doesn't take any values in it okay
so what I am going to do is I am going
to define one more constructor so I will
overload this constructor so this is the
default constructor and I will overload
this constructor this is the same
concept as function overloading but we
can use the same constructor of same
name to perform two different tasks and
I can write int a comma int B so what
it's doing it is initial I am
initializing this vector constructor by
two values a and B and these two a and B
the value of a and V I will assign to X
and y so X is equal to a and Y is equal
to B okay so this is simply doing this
okay and now how we can define operator
overloading so whenever you want to
define operator overloading what you
need to do is first of all you need to
make a prototype of this and operator
overloading returns when you define
operator overloading it returns the same
class as your class so we are in vector
class the Soviet will return operate the
vector right and then we specify that we
want to do operator overloading by the
keyword called operator and then just
after this operator keyword we need to
give the operator from for which you
want to operate or overload this so for
example we want to overload plus
operator okay and we want to add these
two Cartesian values with this plus
operator so I will use plus you can use
some other operators like minus here for
this percentage here or any other
operator which you can see here or any
other operator which exist in C++ you
can use all these operator instead of
this plus which I'm using in this case
okay and then I will pass argument here
which will be the class okay so I will
write Const and the class object so I
will just copy the name of the class and
I will use this address of the class
okay so this is the prototype of
operator so we want to overload plus
right now in order to define or write
the source for this operator what we can
do we can just we also need okay we can
just copy this prototype from here and
just outside your class we can define
this here right
I will just copy this and paste it here
and I will write definition of this
function or operator okay and because I
have already told you in the last video
we need to give the scope for this
operator right so we need to give this
class of the operator in which class
exists and then these two double colon
which are scope resolution operator
right so now you know that this by
this vector : : you know that this
operator is a part of this class which
is a vector class okay now we can write
the definition of in this vector
function so I will copy the same class
here I will name it as them so I created
a temple object of this class and what I
want to do I want to do the addition of
the two vectors using this so I will use
temp dot X this one which is a member
variable of the class is equal to is
equal to X plus temp or param which I
have to pass here pra m our parameter
okay so which whatever parameter we will
pass which will be of object or an
object of this vector we can use it like
this dot X okay so what this is doing
this is also an object of class vector
and this is also an object of class
vector right and whatever we pass here
we want to add it to our temporary
object which is this one okay similarly
I want to do the same for the Y variable
Prime member variable so I will do why
why and why because we have two
coordinates right and what I want to do
next because this is expecting the
vector object return I will return this
temp like this for
Reitan tamp like this okay so what this
code will do it will just add the
parameter which you pass here to the
temp and it will return okay and this
operator will over I mean addition
operator will be overloaded by this one
okay now how to use this in the class so
in the same way I can define two object
of a vector class so back one and I'm
going to use this constructor which
takes two integer values okay
so I will pass two integer values I will
pass first coordinate here so 4 comma 2
here okay 4 comma 2 so I will pass 4
comma 2 and I will make second vector
and I will pass my second value here so
vector 2 and my second value is 2 comma
2 for example right and I can add these
two values in a third vector so I will
say vector result and I can add these
two vectors like this result is equal to
back 1 plus back to okay and this will
now not give you an error because we are
we already told the our C++ libraries
that there exists a plus operator which
is able to
two classes a two object of the class
vector okay now we can display the
result for example like this see out and
how we want to display the result let's
see see out and we can say in double
quotes the result is and in the bracket
we want to give first of all the X so I
will say result dot X okay and then I
want to give the comma so I will give
this once again and double quotes I will
say comma and then the value of y okay
so result dot Y okay so now result dot X
and result dot Y will contain the
addition of these two six comma four in
our case okay and then once again I will
use this bracket to close it and I will
use and help to end the line and first
of all II forgot this okay so now this
will show the result like this let's try
to compile and check whether it it's
okay or not so this is showing the error
let's see what's the error is okay so
this spelling of Const is wrong it
should be like this I will explain you
what this Const mean what is the I mean
purpose of using this cost but for now
just take it as it is okay I will long
we compile my program
and yeah same spelling once again okay
so our program runs successfully or
compiled successfully and let's try to
run this and you see the result is 6
comma 4 so we have successfully added to
vector object using this plus operator
in C++ ok so in the same way you can
subtract or you can use all the
operators which you have in C++ to
overload you can overload equal to or
double equal to or s tricks or whatever
we have in C++ we can overload ok so I
hope you understood the basic concept of
operator overloading and I hope you have
