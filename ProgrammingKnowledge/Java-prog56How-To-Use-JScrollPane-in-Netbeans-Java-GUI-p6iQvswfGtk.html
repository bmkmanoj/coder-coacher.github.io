going to show you how to use scroll pain
so for example if you have a jframe
which is more than the height of your
window or desktop screen so you can use
this J scroll pain in order to see your
whole J frame or whatever is your panel
if the panel is bigger than your window
size so let's get started and see how we
can use small pin and our program this
is the scroll pin in the palette you can
drag it and place it into your j-3 but
as it is it is of no use if you want to
use it you have to put it something
inside it for example I have put or I
dragged my info point opening and place
it inside my scroll pain and when I run
the program
you can see my employ in for any here
and when I scroll the bar not angle is
shown
so if your space is less and you want to
show a whole panel which is bigger than
your space you can use scroll pane
so now the question is if you are um
already have a big panel or something
big you have made already like this I
make a big text text or tabbed pane so I
cannot resize my tab pin and put it
inside this so the easy way is
right-click your panel or whatever in my
case this is j-dub pin right-click and
go to in close swing containers and in
swing containers click scroll in so it
is my hold tab wholly tabbed pane is
automatically is enclosed by the scroll
pay so when I run my program let's see
what happens so my tab pane in this case
is not or my scroll pin in this case is
not visible because my time pin is not
bigger than the height of my window size
so
in order to see the scroll bar in your
scroll pane you can just click your
scroll pane and go to its property so
this is the properties thing accepted
and scroll pin incorrectly so I click
that
maybe to the properties and you can see
some properties here and these are the
properties of small pins if you want to
see the scrollbar always you can just go
to horizontal scroll bar policy and
press always and same you can do it with
vertical scrollbar policy and click
always so you will be able to see your
strong bar always like this and now I
will make my panel or J tab pane bigger
than the size of my window and let's see
what happens so this is my scroll King
like we click the tab pin which is
enclosed by my scroll pin and make it
bigger
so I'm driving it down and making it
bigger in height and then let's see for
example I place it at the bottom so if
you have this much of bigger panel or
campaign and you want to show it in your
jframe of whole panel then let's see
what happens when we run the program our
tabbed pane is enclosed by our scroll
pane and when you drag the scroll bar
you will see I think
done my changes in this damsel my scroll
down you can see employ in for and also
and above the table also so this is the
use of your scroll thin viewers lesser
space and larger data you can always
enclose it in the scroll pane and you
can be able to utilize your space by
using it so that's all for now I hope
you have learned something new today

bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
