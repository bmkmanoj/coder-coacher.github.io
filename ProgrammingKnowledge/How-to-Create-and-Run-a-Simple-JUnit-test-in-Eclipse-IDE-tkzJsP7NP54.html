show you how you can set up a very
simple J unit test for your java program
now what is J unit J unit is a unit
testing framework for java programming
language and it has been important in
development of test-driven development
process
so using j unit you can set up a test
for your program so that you know if
your program is really large and you
don't have the time to test each and
every function you manually J unit can
be used for this these kind of tests or
GI unit tests can be used for nightly
tests so that you can write your code in
the in the day and you can run these j
unit in the night so that you can check
if your program is you know correctly
working with other you know classes or
not so let's create a simple j unit test
first of all we will create a simple
project for java and then we will create
j unit test cases for this project so
put two files new and java project
and first of all we will create our new
java project and i will name it as my
class for example okay and make sure
this option in project layout use
project folder as root for sources and
class files is selected click Next Next
and click finish
so this will create a simple project for
us and in here we are going to create a
package first so just right-click your
project and click new package and this
package we will name it as for example
programming knowledge okay click finish
and inside this package we will create a
class so create new class and this class
name we will name it as my j-unit class
okay and click finish
so this will create a class for us and
in here we can write our program right
so let's create some simple functions
inside this class for example public int
add so we are going to add two numbers
int a int B and it's just going to
return
the addition of a plus B okay and let us
create one more function and that's
going to give us the concatenation of
two strings so
you
so these are very simple functions the
purpose of this video is not you know
not to show how to write functions or
other things but how to set up a simple
J unit test on our functions okay so now
we have created the simple class and
some functions inside our class and now
let's set up some J unit tests on this
these functions so what you can do is
you can just go to your project and go
to new and in here you will be able to
see a section called J unit test case
and these cases you can define multiple
click cases for multiple functions okay
and these test case combined together to
make a suit so you can also create a
suit for your test cases so just first
of all we will create this J unit test
case for us and you can you know gave
the name to the test case and in here
you can choose which J unit library you
want to use new J unit 3 test or new J
unit for test we are going to leave it
as default which is J unit 4 for now and
we name our test as my class test ok
or let's precisely name our test as ad
test because we are going to use this
for this function for adding two
integers ok so now what we can do here
is click finish and it's going to ask
which library you want to use and it's
going to prompt us that J unit 4 is not
on building
do you want to add it yes we want to add
it and now we have created a simple you
know test case for us J unit test case
and this test you can change the name of
this test as ad test for example because
we are going to test the add function
here and in here you can call your class
so we have created this class right J
unit test class okay and in here we have
two functions so we are going to test
first function for now right
so in this ad test we will define our
class and we will name it as J unit for
example is equal to new my J unit test
class and then we can use this to call
the add function inside of our J unit
class my J unit class right so we are
expecting int as a result result is
equal to J unit dot add okay and in here
let's pass some numbers 100 and 200 okay
now this result will be the summation of
these two because we are adding these
two numbers using this function so we
can just check for the equality using
assert equal okay and the first argument
of this assort equal function takes the
value you are expecting for example 300
because we know that the addition of 100
and 200 is 300 and then we will pass the
result of the function
which which is returned by add function
right so this is a simple test we have
written for our add function you can
define more test cases there are more
functions to test the functionality of
your functions and classes but this is
really simple stuff I want to show right
now now in order to run your test what
you need to do is you just need to go to
your add test dot Java which is our J
unit test case right click on it and
then debug as J unit test ok so right
click and debug as J unit test and what
you what are the source file you want to
add in it you can leave them as default
click OK and now it shows the result
here in green line here and it says zero
error zero failure so that means our
unit test has passed which we have
written for the add function in my J
unit class right now let's define some
unexpected result for example we are
except expecting 301 and the addition of
this is 300 so this test should fail
right so once again we are going to go
to our ad desktop and right click and
debug as J unit ok and now your test
fails because the result is 300 and we
are expecting 301 so obviously the test
will fail right now let's define a
second test for our second class or
second function in the class so just go
to your project new j unit test and then
con cat
test for example click finish' and in
here you can change the name of your
function as concat test ok and we will
delete this and for now let's copy the
same code from the earlier test and
paste it here and we are just going to
change this result here now we have
testing concatenation function which
returns string and this will be J unit
dot concat and we will pass two strings
here for example hello world okay and as
a result we are expecting hello world
this is you know case we have defined
this is the case we have defined for our
concatenate function right now let's try
and run our second test case I forgot to
add the semicolon here once again
right-click your project debug as a unit
test ok and our test passes okay
now let's create a test suit for our two
tests so we have written two tests for
our two functions and now you can define
a test suit for all your tests right so
right click on your project go to new
and in here go to other and in here you
will be able to see a category called
Java and inside this Java category there
is a category called j-unit and in here
just choose this j unit test suit click
Next
and here we are you know choosing a
source folder and the name of your suit
is all test for example and then you can
even choose your package name for
example programming knowledge and in
here you can choose your test so we are
going to add both the classes add test
and concatenate test for this suit and
click finish so it has created a test
suit for us with both the test classes
add tests and gotten catenate test class
okay now you can run this all test dot
java file right click debug as J unit
test and it runs your java suit our test
suit J unit test hood and in here you it
says both test passes and you know you
can see both are green here so in this
way you can create a simple J unit test
for your java program I hope you have
