video tutorial on visual C++ windows
form application in this video I will
show you how to link your database with
the list box so what is a list box I
will show you first just go to the tool
box and grab a list box from here this
one so a list box is a container which
can contain a list of data so it can
contain many rows of data and in this
video I will show you how to show your
database data in this list box so for
example you want to show this all data
employee ID name surname and age in your
list box how can you show this row by
row I will show you today so let's get
started so this is a list box and just
go to the form source code here and in
the video number 12 I have shown you how
to populate your combo box or how to
link your combo box with your database
and we have made in the function called
fill combo in the video number 12 so I'm
going to use this fill combo function
for populating the list also in order to
save time and if you don't know the code
just go to the video number 12
of out link combobox with the database
and just see this code there so you
don't need to do much here you just need
to select your list box and copy the
name of your list box from the property
properties and go to your fill combo
function which we have made in the video
number 12 and just go to this while loop
and replace this combo box one by this
list box so so we have not done much but
just replace this list box replace your
previous combo box variable name with
this list box and let's try to run our
program so it's running and I will enter
my username and password it's correct
okay and you can see all the data for
the name is listed here okay because we
only have taken the name field from here
and shown into our list box
that's my only name is is a is showing
you can show the other column values
also into your list box like this
employee IDs name surname and age so
let's see how we can do that also so
what you need to do is just make a
little space in between this list box
and this variable and we will declare
some more variable for employee ID so I
will name it as V e ID and then we'll
copy this and paste it here and here and
I will give them second is ours so name
so V these are only the variable name
you can name according to your
convenience
the age okay and name field we already
have this we don't need that and just
write equal to and just copy this am
reader where you move from here and
paste it here and then this arrow column
and then for employee ID because it's in
our database employee ID is a integer
data type I will show you why I'm
telling you that so in my database you
can see the data type of employee ID is
an integer and data type of age also is
a integer and the other two values are
string or character
values so in our program we just have to
convert the integer value from employee
ID to the string in order to show in our
list box so from after my reader right
get in 32 and then your column name this
one e ID so I will write my column name
here VI D and then white dot two string
and bracket and back it closed so it
will convert your integer values from
your employee ID column in the database
to a string and save it in this value
for surname because it's only a string
so I will just copy this string get
strength this is o is equal to yes and
just copy and paste your string and you
just replace it by surname which is my
third column name you can see here
and in the fourth place I will copy this
thing once again and paste it here
this is converting integer to string and
I will replace employee ID by age so
it's taking name implie ID surname and
age and in here instead of only name we
will write and just copy your employee
ID variable name from this string paste
it here and give up plus sign and double
plus and in between for example we want
to separate our value by comma so just
do that plus plus once again and comma
and plus plus once again comma here also
so I've taken three commas employee
named and surname yeah
and then our age at last so it will show
employee ID names on a managed and let's
see our code works or not
program it's it's running username and
password correct and you can see one
comma John comment below
John and 27 is H which you can verify
from here
so I think my screen is little bit
smaller but you can see here this John
employee one John Bell and it 27 and
here also 1 comma John comma ball age 27
second John Dell age 33 which is here
too
second John Daly needs so in this way
you can populate your list box and
connect it with the database I hope you
