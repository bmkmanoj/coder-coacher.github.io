html5 tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can add and use
video element in HTML so to add a video
element in HTML you need to use this
element called video and this video
takes the source of the video so just go
between these video element and add
element called source ok and then you
can provide the source of your video
here so to add a source I have this
video which I have made in the last
video I'm going to just drag and drop
into my web content folder and it will
copy this into my web content folder so
just leave this option copy files and
click OK and it's going to add this
inside my web content folder same I'm
going to do with a picture which I have
so I have a PNG picture and I'm going to
drag and drop into my web content folder
this also this picture I'm going to use
as a poster for the video in the later
section but first of all let's see how
we can add this source to our video
element so to add this video to the
source you just need to write the name
of your video which is html5 dot mp4 and
you can also add the type of video you
are adding so just add an attribute
called type and in here just write video
slash and before so it's a mp4 video ok
now you can refresh your page and now
you can see this video but it will not
start automatically because we haven't
added any flag for starting right so
let's add a flag for automatically
restarting this video so in your video
element just add an attribute called
auto play and save your code and refresh
it
and now your video will start playing
okay
now you will still not see the controls
to stop or pause this video so to pause
or to have more control for volume and
maximizing and minimizing you can add an
attribute called controls here so just
add an attribute called controls and
save your code and refresh the webpage
and now you can see these controls here
so you have this play and pause button
you have this volume button you have
this fullscreen button here right so
this control attribute as the control to
your video right now there is one more
attribute which you can add here is Lu
and what this does is it will provide
the loop to your video so for example
your video is finished here and then it
will be replayed again and again until
and unless you stops it now there is one
more attribute here which is called
muted so when you add this attribute
called muted and save your code and
refresh it then your video will be muted
when it will be loaded so you can see
it's muted when it's loaded right now
suppose you want to give the size to
your video so right now it's in its
maximum size now you want to limit the
size of your video what you can do here
is you can add an attribute called width
and you can give the width in pixels so
you can give for example 500 and same
you can do for height so just add this
height attribute and you can give the
amount of pixel you want okay save your
code and refresh it and now your video
will be resized okay
so let's say it's 600 by 300 okay so
save your code and once again refresh it
and it resizes
your video okay now for example you want
to give the banner or poster to your
video so this is your video but whenever
your web page loads you want to show
some poster on your video so how you can
add it you can add it something like
this so just add our attribute called
poster here and give the location of the
picture you want to add here so just add
this for example I have this html5 dot
PNG I can add it here so html5 dot P and
G and save your code and refresh it and
you will see the picture but because
it's an autoplay mode so let's remove
this autoplay mode and save your code
and refresh it once again
now you can see this picture and when
you start it your video will be started
ok so in this way you can use video
element in HTML I hope you have enjoyed
