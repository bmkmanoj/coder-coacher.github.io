tutorial on LabVIEW for beginners and in
this video I will show you how to get
started with LabVIEW and I will show you
how you can use LabVIEW for the first
time so when you first install LabVIEW
on your system just go to the start and
just click LabVIEW and it will open this
love you workbench for you and the very
first window you will see on LabVIEW
workbench is this window and here you
can create a new VI VI stands for
virtual instrument and you can create a
new LabVIEW project from here and you
can see what project you have recently
opened in LabVIEW and you can also see
what files of LabVIEW you have opened
recently the all LabVIEW files have the
extension dot VI
so these are the LabVIEW files and all
LabVIEW project have the extension dot
LVP roj ok so when you start your
LabVIEW and you click this blank VI it
show you two panels first is pluff front
plant panel and the other one is block
diagram panel and in this front panel
you will show the process or you will
show the graphical front end of your
application and in this block panel you
will do the programming stuff and
because love you is a graphic
programming language it so you will do
all the graphical programming here it's
not a conventional programming language
it's a high-level graphical programming
language and by using LabVIEW you can do
literally anything related to the data
acquisition or automation or
instrumentation stuff and it's a very
strong tool and nav you or National
Instruments also provides some hardware
with integrate with this LabVIEW
workbench and together they can be a
very powerful tool for your research
work related to data acquisition or
automation so you can see at this front
panel and this block diagram panel and
first thing you have to know is just in
this tool bar just go to view and just
click this control palette and this
palette you will use all the time to
have the controls for example there are
two type of main tools here first is
called these buttons or input control so
these buttons or whatever input controls
you have you call them controls and when
you go back
and whatever output controls or the
output stuff you will use are called NPA
indicators so this is a input because
you give or you press button and give
the input and for example you want to
start or switch on this led by pressing
this button so this is the indicator
which shows the output so this is a
control and this is the output and one
more thing you will see here when you go
to view and see tool palette you will be
able to see this tools here and it has
different tools to help you to connect
these controls and indicator to DIC
together and make a logical combination
of these controls and when you put these
controls and indicators here
automatically in the block diagram panel
you will be able to see these backend
side of these indicators and control and
in here you can join them or you can do
whatever is correct for your application
you can join them or you can give a
logical logical control to them for
example here also you can open this view
and this function palette so in this
function ballot you have many logical
expressions for example these input
drivers or signal or
these while loops and you will be using
this while loop extensively and this
output and other functions you have
automatic functions you have numeric
functions so you will be using these
functions in the block diagram to give
the logical conclusion to your
indicators and control so this is
important and one more thing is because
LabVIEW is a very extensive vendors
there are so many controls in LabVIEW
and you cannot remember every every
control you use so you for what you can
do is you can click this help and click
this show control help from here and now
this context help is open and when you
hover over any indicator or control from
here it will show the help from here
that what this indicator or control do
so see here when I hover over this
button it shows the small help for this
control in a same way when you go here
in the front end and when you hover over
this button it will show the same help
for you so this is also important when
you are new with this LabVIEW that it
shows you a little help which you can
read and you can use your controls so I
hope this is it for this video and this
is a
pretty good starting point for your
LabVIEW stuff so keep watching these
videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
