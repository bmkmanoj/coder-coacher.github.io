you can download and install Oracle Java
JDK on your open to operating system so
let's get started first of all open your
terminal and in here we are going to
give some commands to install Oracle
Java JDK so what are these commands
which we want to give so these are three
commands which we want to give to
install Oracle Java JDK I'm going to
paste all these commands in the
description so you can just directly
copy and paste these commands so the
first command is this one so I'm going
to copy and right-click and paste it
here and this command is sudo apt - add
- repository space PPA : grab UPD
eight-team slash java okay so it's going
to add this repository for the pet PPA
and press enter and give your computer
password here and it's going to give you
this prompt just press enter at this
time and then everything is okay now the
second command is to update all the
repositories so just copy sudo apt - get
update and paste it here once again and
once again press enter and this is going
to update all the repositories right now
the third command is actually the
command to install Oracle Java JDK okay
so once this is complete we are going to
just copy the third command which is
sudo apt - get install Oracle - Java
eight at the time of making this video
Java eight is the latest I think -
installer and it can change in future it
can be a Java 9 or Java 10 depending
upon the you know version okay so just
given the third command and paste it
here and press Enter
is going to install this java jdk on
your open operating system
so once the installation is done you can
see the success message for example
Oracle JDK 8 installed Oracle JRE 8
browser plug-in installed right now to
check whether it's really installed or
not what you can do is you can just
write Java - version here and press
Enter
it's going to give the version of Java
installed which is one point eight point
zero in my case okay now sometimes you
also need to set up environment
variables something like Java home also
so what you can do to you know enable
these environment variables so first of
all let's see where this Java is
installed in our system so go to your
folder Explorer and in here go to
computer and the computer go to user
then I think Lib and in here you will be
able to see JVM folder so search for JVM
and in here you can see this Java 8 -
Oracle ok so what we need to do next
here is I'm going to open the terminal
once again and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to first of all clear this
terminal and I'm going to give this
command so just give gedit or G add it
or you can also work with Nano to open
this file which is in etc' slash profile
ok so just open etc' profile file so
just write profile and press enter and
it's going to open this et Cie profile
file in G added which is here ok now you
can see this et Cie profile file it will
look something like this and to add the
NY
meant variable here what you need to do
is you need to go to the last line and
just below the last line what you need
to do is just write export and then in
capital letters Java underscore home and
then is equal to and then give the path
to this location which is user slash lim
/ JVM / Java 8 Oracle okay so to copy
this folder path you can just you know
press or right-click on any file here
inside this Java 8 Oracle folder and
click on properties and then you can
just copy this path from here okay and
then paste here in front of the Java
home and then save this file and then it
will be done but you can see I cannot
have the same option because I haven't
opened this file with the superuser you
know permissions so what I can do I will
just copy this line first of all or cut
it and then close this file once again
without saving so close close without
saving and I will open it with the sudo
command so just add sudo here sudo gedit
et Cie profile once again and press
ENTER and it's going to open this
profile file once again and once again
go to the last line and then paste the
same you know line which we have written
last time export in the capital Java
underscore home is equal to the folder
location of Java - 8 - Oracle folder and
now just press save and it's going to
press you save your file and then just
close your file ok so this is going to
set Java home environment variables for
your java ok so I hope you enjoyed this
