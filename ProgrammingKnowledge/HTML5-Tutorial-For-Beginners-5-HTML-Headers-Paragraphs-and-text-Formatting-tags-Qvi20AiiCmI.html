HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will learn about
paragraphs headings pre formatted text
and HTML text formatting tags in HTML so
let's get started we have already
learned how to use paragraph tag in HTML
in our previous videos like this right
and when you want to add the multiple
paragraph you just need to add them like
this and when you save your code and
refresh your page look like this now
each paragraph element is separated by
other element by the line break of two
right now for example you want to break
this paragraph in two lines what you can
do is you can add this tag called BR and
it will break your line into two so save
your code and refresh it and it breaks
this paragraph into lines but you can
see there is no line space in between
these two lines
but this paragraph and this paragraph is
separated by one line space here right
so in this way you can add multiple
paragraphs and breaks in HTML now let's
talk about heading tags in HTML so there
are basically six type of headings you
can use in HTML and which are like this
so the biggest heading you can use is h1
and the smallest heading you can use is
h6 so h1 is the biggest font size and h6
is the smallest font size and when you
go to H 2 s 3 S 4 and at 5 it will
decrease your font size when this
heading tag number increases so save
your code and refresh your web page and
you can see the heading 1 or h1 tag
creates the biggest heading and that six
tag creates the smallest heading now
let's talk about pre formatted text tag
so you can use a tag like this for pre
formatted tags this means the spaces and
your line breaks are preserved whenever
you add some text in between these pre
tags so for example you want to display
some code something like this I have
this C hello world code and I want to
preserve these spaces between the code
and the line breaks so I can do
something like this so I can save it and
I can refresh my webpage and it will
look like this it will look like a code
but if you use a paragraph tag here see
what happens it will not preserves your
line breaks or spaces and it will show
you in the straight lines so if you want
to preserve the line breaks and the
spaces you can use pre tags something
like this okay now let's talk about HTML
text formatting tags or elements so
basically there are ten text formatting
elements in HTML which are bold tag
emphasized tag italic tag small strong
sub sub for sub scripted tags and su P
for a super scripted tag I ns4 inserted
tag de l for deleted text and mark for
mark text now let's see how we can use
them and how they look like when you use
them so I will delete this and I will
add all these tags so you can use these
tags for example bold tag or emphasize
tag inside your headings or your
paragraph tags or any other tags like
lists and tables which P
we'll learn in the later videos right so
for example you want to show a paragraph
with bold text then you can use this
bold tag something like this so just add
this bold tag here and bold ending tag
here it will be bold okay
so similarly you can use eeehm tag or
emphasized tag like this to emphasize
your text for italic you can use I for
strong you can use strong itself for
small text you can use small tags
something like this for deleted text you
can use de el and deleted means it will
give you a cross or it will give you a
line on your text right you can use a NS
for inserted text you can use sub for
super scripted text marks for marked
text and su P for superscripted text now
let's see how they look like when we see
em on the web webpage so refresh the
page and this is our bold text
emphasized text italic text this is our
strong text and this is our small text
this is our deleted text which you know
gives you this line on your text this is
our inserted text which will give you
this line on the bottom of the text this
is the superscripted tag something like
little bit below the normal text this is
our marked text and it will give you
this yellow mark on your text and this
is our super scripted text which is a
little bit above from our normal text so
in this way you can use paragraphs
breaks headings and text formatting
elements in HTML I hope you enjoyed this
