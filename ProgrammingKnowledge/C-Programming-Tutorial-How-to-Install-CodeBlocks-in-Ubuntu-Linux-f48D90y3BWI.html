video I will show you how to install
code blocks for compiling C and C++
program on your fresh Ubuntu operating
system and I will also show you how to
run your first hello world c-plus plus
program so let's get started once you
have opened your open to operating
system go to a software Ubuntu Software
Center here and click it and it will
open the open two operating system and
open two software Center here and at the
top you can search for the software so
in the search tab here just write code
blocks and it will search for the code
blocks IDE
so you can just select the first option
from the software's here and just go
here and you will see the install button
here you just need to press this install
button and it will start installing you
may and
to give your root password so I give my
password of my Ubuntu operating system
and I authenticate my password and now
you can see it's start installing code
blocks on my Ubuntu operating system it
may take few seconds to install it fully
now when you see here that your code
block is installed and you can see here
remove button so if you if your code
block is installed then you will be able
to see this remove and by pressing this
remove button you can remove the code
blocks also now once you have installed
code blocks you can open code blocks in
two ways one option is go to here - home
and click it and in here type code
blocks and here you will be able to see
code blocks IDE and you can open it from
here and it starts code block okay
so first when you are starting your code
blocks it will tell you that which
compiler is detected in your open to
operating system GNU CC compile C GCC
compiler is for compiling C and C++
program only in Linux operating system
which is already there in my in my
computer so I click OK and it opens this
code blocks IDE just close them all and
the second option if you want to open
code blocks IDE then you can just open
the terminal
and when the terminal is open then you
can just type the code blocks so I will
show you how you can do it so once your
terminal is open just write code blocks
and let me close this code blocks so
that you will be able to see so I have
written code blocks here and I click
enter button and you can see by this way
also you can start your code blocks from
the terminal also and it opens the same
code blocks IDE one more thing you can
do is when you go to this dash home you
can see the icon of code blocks you can
just select this code blocks and drag
and drop into your tool strip here so
you don't have to go to the stash home
again and again and just click it from
here start it from here or you don't
need to open this for block from this
sub terminal also so these are the two
things to remember
and once you freshly install code blocks
it will also open this code blocks
website and you will be able to see all
the informations about code blocks here
now once your code blocks is open now we
create a new project so you can create a
new project from here also or you can
just go to here in the file and go to
new and click new project and here you
can see so many options to select
but for the first time we are going to
hear in the category and we can filter
the categories from here and I select
the console and now the options are
filtered I select console application
and click go and now it will start my
console application so I click Next and
this is a C++ application that's why I
click Next and here I will give the name
of my project so I will write my first
program and now I click Next and here is
option folder to create a project in so
you can give the name of the folder in
which you want to create your project so
for example I choose my document folder
you can choose any folder if you want
and click OK and I will click Next
and here it shows you which compiler you
want to use by default I have GCC
compiler for compiling C and C++
programs so I don't touch anything here
I will click finish and your project is
created here and by default it creates a
simple hello world program so what you
need to do is just go to here at the top
and just click build and click build and
your program is building and here you
can see it's saying 0 errors right so
you group your program has zero errors
and now you can run your program so you
can just go to builds once again and
you can see the option run and just
click this Run button and it opens the
console application and here you see
that your hello world program is
successfully running right now so in
this way you can install code blocks on
your open to operating system and run
your first hello world program I hope
