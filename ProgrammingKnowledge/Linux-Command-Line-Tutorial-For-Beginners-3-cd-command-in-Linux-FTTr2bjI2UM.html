Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will learn
how we can use CD command in Linux CD
command we can use to change the current
working directory in Linux so let's see
how we can use it so first of all I'm
going to press ctrl alt T to open my
terminal and then I'm going to just use
the command so first of all let's see
the syntax of for CD so you can just use
CD as it is and it can be used with the
directory name also so you can just
write there here right so first of all
whenever you give the CD command as it
is is going to land you in the current
home directory right so you see it's the
home whatever you open whenever you open
the terminal for the first time it'll
you know land you there right and then
for example you want to go to somewhere
for example we want to change directory
to the root directory as we have seen in
the first video root directory is this
forward slash and then press Enter
and now we are in the root directory and
you know you are a new root directory by
this /m and by default you have this
tilde which is a home you're right so
first of all let's see in which
directory we are so we are in root
directory so we will just give PWD and
see if we are in that directory or not
so you can see we are in root directory
right now once again if you give CD and
then this tilde symbol then this means
your home directory home directory is
nothing but your home slash username
right so once again I give this command
and
once again I give the PWD command and
you can see we are in now our home
directory
right so this tilde can be used also
with CD command right now there is a
command of something like CD dot dot and
it means we want to go to the parent
directory of the current working
directory so for example our current
working directory is home slash
programming knowledge which is my user
name so when I give a CD dot dot then we
will go one folder above or parent of
the current folder so I will just press
ENTER and now you can see we are in the
home folder so I will just once again
give PWD and now we are in the home
folder so we go one folder above write
in a same way for example I will once
again go to my home directory by CD
tilde and then for example I want to LS
first let's see LS and what are the
directories and documents in this
folders so in my home directory we have
desktop or document folder or other
folders right so to go inside those
folder or to change the directory for
example to the document folder you can
just write CD and then document ok so
just write CD Documents something like
this and you will go to the Documents
folder once again I will go to my home
folder by just give giving the CD
command and then you can also go to the
Documents folder by just giving its
absolute path so you can just give CD
home then my username which is
programming knowledge and then the
Documents folder ok so you can either
give the
saluté part which is home username
documents for example or you can give
the relative pass something like CD
document this is the relative part right
so we are already in the document so we
will go home and then we can say CD
documents and we will go to the
documents folder right so you can give
absolute path or the relative path
related path is nothing but so for
example I do LS and whatever directory
you see inside your present working
directory
you can just directly give the name of
that directory so for example CD and
then I can just give download at this
time and press ENTER and we are in the
downloads right now the next command is
going to the directory inside the
directory so for example let's go to our
home and let's clear the screen for now
and let's see what we have in our
document folder so I will just go to the
Documents folder and I will just do LS
and in here I have the two files but for
example I will create one more folder
here inside a Documents folder so I will
just go inside the Documents folder and
I will create a new folder for example I
will say it's a book folder books folder
ok and I want to go inside this folder
so how I can do this I can just do CD
which will change the directory to the
home directory and I can just give the
command CD documents and then books
something like this so you can go in the
books by giving this command and press
Enter and we are inside this box folder
and then right now it has no files but
for example I want to create a document
I will say just test dot the txt files
right so dot txt file and I will just do
LS and you see we have the txt file test
dot txt file now next command is for
example I want to navigate inside this
books folder and I will create one more
folder there is a command to create a
directory by the way but this command we
are going to see in the later videos
that's why I'm not showing you this
command right now and I'm going to use
this graphical view to create my folders
for example I will say this is my books
folder ok and if you observe I have left
a space between my and books right and I
left the space intentionally so when I
do Alice here it will show me there is a
folder called my books but if you create
a folder or directory with my book for
with a space then how you can navigate
to this directory for example I will do
my CD and then I will just you know
write my books and press ENTER and will
give me the error because CD is just
looking for the first you know argument
after the CD command and if it's a space
there are two arguments after the CD
command so how you can go inside the
folder which has space between it there
are three options you can use to
navigate such kind of folder first
option is you can just write CD and then
do my and then you give this backslash
and then you give books for example
something like this and when you press
ENTER you will go inside this my books
folder okay I will go once again one
folder above and the second option is
instead of using
this backslash you can just write double
quote and then you can just write my
books okay and press Enter
and also you are in your my books folder
right once again I will go back one
folder I had and the third option how
you can go inside this folder of
directory which has the space between it
you can just give single quote around
your directory names press enter and
also you are in the same directory okay
so what are the command we have used
today or we have learnt today so I will
just clear the terminal and I will once
again tell you what are the commands we
have learnt so CD command if you give
then you will go to your home directory
okay so I will give CD and I'm in my
home directory now in order to navigate
to a particular directory I need to give
its absolute path or relative path so
for example I want to go to route
I will just say CD /root and I'm in the
root folder once again I will go to my
home folder and for example I want to go
to CD user bin okay so I will give its
absolute path and I'm in the CD user bin
and I can just list out all the content
of this folder by Alice which we have
seen in the last video I will clear the
terminal once again the next command is
the relative path so for example I will
once again go to my home directory and I
will just say CD and I want to navigate
to documents so I can just give CD
documents or if I want to go one folder
inside this document I want to navigate
to the books folder I can just give this
type of you know command and press press
ENTER and we are in the books folder now
we have created a folder with a space
between its name
then you can use a CD and then either
you can use backward slash between the
space or you can enclose this name
between double quotes or single quotes
and you will be inside that directory
and you can work with it so I hope you
