HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will see how to use
meta tags in HTML now first of all what
is a meta data a metadata is something
which shows you the information about
your real data right so a metadata will
not be displayed on the page but will be
machine possible so for example some
search engine wants to pass your web
page they will look at your metadata and
pass your webpage and even index your
web page on their search result on the
basis of metadata there are variety of
parameters on which the search result
depends and metadata is one of them ok
now what can be a metadata a metadata
can be a description or a keyword or you
can add the author of this document or
you can add when this document was
modified or other metadata which I am
going to show you now how you add this
metadata so generally you add this
metadata using meta tag inside your head
so go inside your head and just write
meta and we have two or three attributes
for our meta tag one is name and name is
the name of the attribute we are going
to add the second one is the content and
content will be the value of the
attribute which is related to this name
okay so for example we want to add the
description we just add description
attribute name now for example I want to
make this page for HTML tutorials so
this description can be HTML tutorials
for beginners or
other description related to the HTML
tutorials right and in the same way you
can add one more meta tag and this can
be the keywords so here you can add
keywords and these keyword are preferred
to be related with your web page content
so this is for HTML tutorial for example
so I can add keyword like HTML html5
tutorials CSS or HTML X or Java Script
for example so these can be some example
keywords you can add to this page right
now the maximum length is not limited
for the description or the keyword but
the preferred length for description is
about 160 characters because after this
Google search or other search engines
cuts your description and pass only up
to 160 characters of description in the
same way for keywords you can add around
200 characters of keywords you can add
any number of keyword but you know it's
preferred to have 200 characters right
now in the same way you can add one more
meta tag which is the author of your
content for example now there is one
more kind of meta tag which is called
robot so just write robot and what is it
related to the robots meta tag provides
directive for search engine crawlers and
you can have archive no archive as a
content or follow or nofollow as a
content or image or no image index as a
content or index or no index so if you
use archive or no archive it indicates
that whether or not the page should be
archived by the search engine or not
in case of follow or nofollow this
indicates whether or not the robot
should continue to crawl over pages
reference
in the hyperlinks on the page in a
similar way image index and no image
index works and it indicates whether or
not the page should appear on the
referral for images for your search
engine for your webpage write and index
and no index indicates whether or not
page should be included in the search
engine index or not
okay so generally we use index and
follow as our robot meta tags now there
is one more meta tag which is called
HTTP equivalent and here if you write
refresh and if you set any content for
example one second
and you save your code and refresh your
webpage then it'll load after every
second okay so it will refresh after
every second you can see here it's
refreshing okay and here you can give
one second or two second or 10 seconds
or 30 seconds so whatever number you
give here it will be refreshed after
these many number of seconds okay so
these are some of the most used meta
tags which you can use in your HTML
webpage I hope you have enjoyed this
