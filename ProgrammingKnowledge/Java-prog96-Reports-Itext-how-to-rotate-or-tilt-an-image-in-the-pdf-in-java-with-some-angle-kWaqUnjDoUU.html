video I will show you how you can tilt
your rapport with certain angle into
your report so for example we have this
type of report and this the image you
are seeing in straight format this is 90
degree and suppose in some attractive
reports you want to tilt this image with
the angle of 45 or 30 or 20 or whatever
you want so with some angle you want to
treat your image into your eye text
report I will tell you how you can tilt
this image so let's get started go to
your code right think report event
action performed and you can see the
code and in the 79th video I have shown
you how to insert a report or insert
your image or picture into the eye text
report and the code for that is these
three lines comm dot I text PDF dot text
dot image image this is the variable
name is equal to comma dot text I text
dot
text dot you may not get instant and
inside this you have to provide your
image name and image format so this code
if you don't know you can see the 79th
video and in this code now we need this
chart dot PNG in tilted form so what you
have to do is press ENTER and in between
this line you must write image which is
the or this variable you have declared
in the image declaration and then dot
set rotation
degree set protection degree and in this
racket you have to provide the degree of
rotation so generally you for example if
you want to rotate your image with the
angle of 45 so you write 45.0 app so
this will rotate your image with the
angle of 45 so in order to check our
program we will run our program so we
will right click it report report is
saved your image and your image is
tilted by 45 degree so in this way you
can tilt your image I want to treat this
by 20 degree once again image looks like
rapport is saved make small so you can
see and this image is now tainted by 20
degree so in this way you can tilt your
image into your eye text report so
that's all for this video please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
