Linux come online tutorial for beginners
and in this video we will see how we can
use date command in Linux the date
command is used to print out or change
the value of system time and date
information so the date command is
really simple you can just use date it's
going to display you the current date
and time okay
and when you use - s flag with date so
you can just use date - s and with this
- s after this whatever date and time
you will set in string as a string it
will be set as a system time which is
going to be set here as your system time
and you will see that time in your
system time okay for example I want to
set the update something like this for
example this date is 20th November 2003
12 o'clock 48 minutes like this okay so
it's going to set the date to November
20 2003 12:48 p.m. right so in this way
you can set the date but right now I am
NOT going to give this command because I
don't want to change the date of my
system but this is the flag you can use
to set the date now there are some other
flags which you can use with this date
command to format the date in which way
you want to see the date for example so
I have a little list here I'm going to
show you this list and these are the
flags you can use with your date command
and then you will be able to format your
you know date for example I want to
display first of all I will write this
plus symbol and then this modulus symbol
and I can see here that small H is used
for the month
in the you know in the character format
right so what I'm going to do is first
of all I am going to just use D for date
of the month small D then modulus small
edge for the month abbreviation and then
I'm going to use modulus Y for year okay
like this and then press Enter
and it shows me the date in this format
so today at the time of making this
video it's for January 2017 I can do
more with this so for example I can just
make it a string like this and then I
can add for example this minus symbol in
between the date a month and year it's
going to format this date like this or I
can do forward slash here instead of
this so whatever way you want to show
the date it's going to show the date in
that format right and these are some of
the flags you can use with the date
command now the date command is really a
you know vas command and you can you do
lots of knots of thing with the date
come on so let's see the man page and
let's see how you know what else you can
do with the date command so I am going
to just write man date and press Enter
and you can see there are so many flags
for example this - file for file flag
and are for reference and you can see s
for setting the time as a string and you
can see all these you know small formats
you can see unlisted here so H is same
as B and you can see hours or you will
be able to see Y also
for a year so you can see here and
capital y for a year
so just go through this man page and you
know see how you can use this date
command because it's a really you know
vast command and in one video it will be
not possible to you know cover all the
flags you know with this lead come on
so I will suggest you to read this man
page whenever you want to write and the
last example I am going to give you the
date and time for example so you want to
print the date and time you can just do
something like this so in the string
format itself you can just write this so
just don't forget to add this plus
before your date format and then you can
add a string any string and these are
you know flags modulus MOH or hour or
you know capital m for minute capital s
4 seconds and then when you give this
come on you can see it prints the date
first and then the time okay so in this
way you can use a date command in Linux
