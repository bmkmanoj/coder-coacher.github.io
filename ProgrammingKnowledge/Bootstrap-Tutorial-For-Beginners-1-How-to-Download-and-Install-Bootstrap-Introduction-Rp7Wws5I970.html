show you how we can download and install
bootstrap on our Windows 8 or Windows
8.1 operating system bootstrap is one of
the most popular HTML CSS and JavaScript
framework for developing responsive
mobile friendly websites and web
applications so let's see how we can
download and install bootstrap on our
system so first of all open your
favorite browser and just search for
bootstrap and the first link which will
appear here will be from get bootstrap
comm so just click this link and in here
you just need to click this download
bootstrap and you will see here three
options one is download bootstrap other
is download source and third one is
download sass so one we are interested
in is this one and it's free open source
you know initiative so you can download
it for free so just click this button
and it's going to download a zip file
for you so click OK now go to the folder
where you have installed this zip file
and just extract this zip file wherever
you want I'm going to extract it in the
same folder and inside this folder you
will be able to find three folders one
is CSS folder other one is fonts and
third one is JavaScript so for example
we go into this CSS folder and in here
you will be able to see some of the CSS
files related to the themes and design
and this and this are important in our
case whenever we want to you know start
this bootstrap project from the starting
this CSS file is
but in this one and this one and the
basic difference between these two CSS
files is the size so basically both are
almost the same files but the size is
different one is 120 Kb and when you
open this file you will be able to see
it's like a miniature file and
compressed file and when you open this
other bootstrap dot CSS file you will be
able to see that it's like you're normal
CSS file which you can add it but for
the best practices you may want to
create your own CSS file for you know
styling your HTML code so once you have
extracted your folder what you can do is
you can go to the same folder where you
have extracted your you know this zip
file and inside the folder you can
create a HTML file for example I'm going
to create a new HTML file for example
I'm going to name it as index dot HTML
ok and I'm going to open this index dot
HTML and in here we can write some code
so for the first time what we are going
to do is we are going to go to once
again this website which is get
bootstrap calm and on the right hand
side you will be able to see these tabs
here and in here you will be able to see
basic templates you can click this link
and in here there is a basic example of
this HTML 5 which you can copy and paste
it in your index dot HTML and in here I
will make it a little bit bigger and
here you can see some tags and you will
be able to see this hello world so let's
save this file
and let's run it into the browser so you
can I'm using notepad plus plus by the
way to edit my files but you can choose
the editor you like the most so you can
either preview this HTML file by
right-clicking and you can open with
your favorite browser like this and it's
going to show this hello world but this
is not the simple HTML hello world you
can see some design incorporated already
here and this is how you can you know
run your first bootstrap HTML file and
when we go inside this HTML file you
will be able to see this line of code
and this line of code is for the
responsiveness of your browser so you
know you can use your website on mobile
and because bootstrap is a mobile
friendly you know web framework so we
will go to this web page once again and
on the right hand side you will be able
to see this examples here so you can
click any example and you can choose any
example from here so for example I'm
going to choose this example and when I
shrink this browser you will be able to
see the responsiveness of the web page
so for example on the mobile it will
look something like this and on your
regular you know windows browser it will
look like this so this is due to
bootstrap and it's more responsive right
now once again we will go to our HTML
page and here we can see this bootstrap
mndot CSS which is taken from the CSS
folder
and on the bottom you can see it uses
jQuery for its plugin so you can see
this comment here necessary for
bootstraps javascript plugins so you
need to include this jQuery file here
and the last line you can see is it's
using bootstrap mint dot GS and this
file you can find in the GS folder in
your extracted folder ok so this is how
you can download and install bootstrap
and run your first bootstrap HTML page I
