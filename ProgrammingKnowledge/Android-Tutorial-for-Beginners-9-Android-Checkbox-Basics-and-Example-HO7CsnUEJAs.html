tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how we can use check boxes with our
Android application so generally we use
check boxes whenever we want to choose a
list of items for example you are making
a little grocery shop app you can use
checkboxes to select the items right or
for example you want to give the option
to the user to select his favorite
animal source favorite dishes or
favorite you know favorite things right
so well basically whenever we want to
select multiple items we use checkboxes
now to add checkboxes as you can see I
can add checkboxes by going to my
palette and in the widget section I have
this check box widget which I can drag
and drop to my Android activity I'm also
going to take a button so that on the
basis of button click event I can decide
which check boxes are checked and on the
basis of checked option or checked
checked checked boxes I can take some
action now I will choose all these or I
will select all these checkboxes and I'm
going to change the properties of these
checkboxes in the properties I'm going
to go to layout underscore width and I'm
going to set it to fill parent so that
this width is filled in the you know in
the width right now I'm going to change
the name of these check boxes for
example we want to create a list of
animals so that user can choose his
favorite animals for example
dog and in here you will see this option
checked
so in here if you choose this option
checked you can see whenever you run the
application it will be checked by
default
otherwise when you uncheck this option
your you know whenever you start your
activity this checkbox will be unchecked
so this is the default condition you
want to check to your checkbox okay the
name to the checkbox we can give
according to the name for example
checkbox dog
now we will go to the code part of our
activity so I will go to my main
activity dot Java file and in here we
are going to declare these variables so
we are going to declare three checkbox
variable and one button variables
you
okay so now our variables are declared
now we are going to create a method dish
will be the public method and it's not
going to return anything and we are
going to name our method as for example
add listener on button okay and then
it's not going to take any argument and
we will create or prepare the body of
our function in these curly braces now
inside here we are going to cast our
checkbox as a button and we are going to
cast them by ID so for example for the
checkbox 1 we are going to cast it to
the dog checkbox
you
now once we have casted all our widgets
now we are going to add the listener so
we are going to take our button variable
and we will set the listener to it set
on click listener and in here in the
arguments just press ENTER and we are
going to create a new listener so new on
click listener on click listener and
this takes three arguments right on
click yeah right so we will create a
buffer string buffer so in here we are
going to create a string buffer result
is equal to new string buffer and then
let me reform it otherwise it will go
out of the screen so select all cut and
paste once again and now we are going to
add our toast and in this result we are
going to append the checked item first
so first of all this result take this
result variable so in here result dot
append and we can append any string to
it so in the double quotes you can just
write dog and if it's checked we will
say it's checked otherwise we will say
it's not checked so append this string
dogs dot append and in here we are going
to append if the checkbox is check
tornad right so we will take the first
checkbox which is for dog a field dot is
checked is checked okay and this will
give you the binary option true or false
or 1 or 0 if it's checked it's going to
give you true or if it's unchecked it's
going to give you false right and we are
going to just close this in a same way
for cat and cow we will do the same
and now we can display this result to
the toast so we can just write toast dot
make text make text and in here we are
going to select our activity which is
our main activity here or the class name
dot this then we will choose the text we
want to display so the text we want to
display is this result variable so just
copy and paste result dot to string okay
because it's a buffer so we need to
convert it to string dot
now once we have created this method we
just need to call it in our create on
create method which is this one right so
just kill Oh will go below this
setcontentview and just paste your
method name which is this one and now we
are going to run our application and now
our application is running so for
example uh we check checkbox one and
checkbox 2 and press the select button
the answer is dog is equal to true and
cat is equal to 2 you can see dog true
cat true and cow false so if you want to
add the line ending you can just add
this line ending here backslash N and in
here also backslash and right and once
again run the program and now once we
select all the options
it says dog true cat true and cow true
and if we unselect some option now only
down dog is true cat is false and cows
false ok so in this way you can choose
your selection on the basis of s select
method here right now let's create a
method on which we will allow the user
to take some action on this checkbox
click itself
ok so for example once selector use is
or user you selects this dog checkbox we
are going to display some message that
you select a dog without any button
click event so what we are going to do
is we are going to declare one more
method which will be public
now once again we are going to cast our
check box one variable because we want
to take action on check box one so I
will copy the code from here and then we
want to you know take this check box one
and then we will set onclicklistener s--
dot set onclicklistener and in the
argument just click enter new
onclicklistener
and in here you just need to write if
the check box is checked so we will just
check the condition F
and we will take our
from view which is V so just take it
here we and then we will enclose it in
our bracket also so just add one more
bracket here and then dot is checked and
if the checkbox is checked we are going
to perform some action so we will just
play toast
dot make text and in here the last name
once again dot this comma if it's
checked we are going to display some
message here so let's display a message
for example we will display dog is
selected okay
and then the third argument is the same
toast dot length long and then we will
just show this dot show okay and I will
add it in here and now we are going to
run it okay so that it will listen on
this dog checkbox this one
so you see whenever I check the doc
checkbox I will check it and it shows
dog is selected and when I uncheck it
once again check it dog is selected but
when I check cat checkbox it doesn't
show any message because I haven't added
any you know listener to the
these checkboxes I have added listener
to the dog checkbox only so whenever I
check it it shows dog is selected but
you can add the same kind of listener to
these checkboxes also so in this way you
can use checkboxes in your Android app I
