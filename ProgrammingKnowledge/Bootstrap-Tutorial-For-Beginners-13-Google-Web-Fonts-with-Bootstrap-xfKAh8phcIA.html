bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can add and
incorporate google web fonts on our
bootstrap web page now first of all what
is Google web font Google web font is
the family of hundreds and hundreds of
fonts which you can use freely on your
website so first of all to add Google
web font what you need to do is you need
to just search Google web fonts and most
probably the first link which will
appear here will be from google.com
slash fonts so click this link and if
you want to know more about Google web
font you can just click about here and
here you can see the description ok so I
will go back here and in here you can
find all the fonts which are available
here and you can even see here there are
right now 703 font family are available
and these are all sorted by the popular
tea okay so you can sort them by
popularity or alphabet or date added or
trending fonts okay and the most popular
font right now is open sans right so we
are going to add this open songs to our
paragraph tag for example so to add it
you can go to this small button here
which says quick use so click this and
in here you can choose the style you
want okay so by default this option is
already selected which is normal but you
can choose multiple options here but
take a look at this meter here when you
choose multiple option this meter
reading increases and it indicates the
load on your website or web page loading
time okay so as you increase the number
of options this P
loading will increase in the sense it
will take more time to load ok so just
choose whatever you want right so for
example I want just this normal fonts
and it's in the green zone so it's ok
and now just scroll down and this is the
simple link code which you can add to
your web page so I'm going to copy this
and I'm going to go to my index dot HTML
and just add this link code to your HTML
page ok so this will add this open sans
formed family to your web page now we
need to add or change our CSS file also
so I'm going to open my CSS file and in
my CSS file what I need to do is I just
need to copy the code from here for the
CSS which is integrate the font into
your CSS so just copy this code from
here and go to your CSS file and just
for example I want to add it to the
paragraph tag so I can just add it like
this and in here you can just copy and
paste this code here right and just save
it and I'm going to run my HTML page on
my browser and you can see this font
here is changed to open Suns because
this is a paragraph and it's in inside
the paragraph tag so this font will
change to open sans which we have added
so to see the difference we can go to
our page which we have earlier which was
this and this was the font family
earlier before adding Google font and
now this looks like this okay so it's
changed to open Suns now for example you
want to add some more fonts you can once
again go to your
Google font site and once again you can
search for your font family which you
want to add for example this one Ostwald
and go to here quick use and I want to
use this normal or I want to use this
bold option here right and I want to use
it for my header tag okay so I will copy
this code once again paste this link in
my HTML page and I will go to my CSS
file and for example I want to add this
for h1 tag so I will just add here h1
and just copy the font CSS code from
here so just copy this and paste it into
your CSS file here okay
and I'm going to once again run my web
page and you can see this h1 tag is
changed so here I was using h1 tag for
displaying hello world
earlier it was like this but after
incorporating this font it will look
like this now for example we want to add
this font for other header tags for
example h2 and h3 tags you can just go
to your CSS file and just add this h2
tag here
okay so you can add these font-family to
your CSS file like this okay save it and
once again run your page and then it
will change this other h2 and h3 tags
also like this it was earlier like this
and now it looks like this so in this
way you can add and incorporate Google
web font to your bootstrap web page I
