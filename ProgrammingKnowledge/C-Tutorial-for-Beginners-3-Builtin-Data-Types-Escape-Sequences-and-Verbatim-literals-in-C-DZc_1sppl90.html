teach you about built-in data type in C
sharp so built-in data type in C sharp
are the data type which are provided by
C sharp to us for example in the last
videos I have used our data type like
int X right so this int is our data type
which tells or which gives us the
information that the variable X is a
variable which is used to hold the
integer values like this in there are
more variable of more data types in C
sharp for us which we can use in
different situations now in order to see
are these built-in data type we can go
to MSDN website which is from Microsoft
and first of all if you want to search
for the this you can just search for
built-in types in c-sharp and just click
the first link here and this is the link
so built-in data types are like this
this is a list of built-in data
definitions so we'll buy it s byte
Kerr decimal double and there is a whole
list of these data type and all this
belongs to system needs namespace now
for example bool you want to declare a
bool this belongs to system dot boolean
namespace so there is a list of
namespaces also to which every data type
belongs to now in order to see the range
of these data type there is a data type
called byte whose range is 0 to 255
which is an integer so if you see here
in the first link there are there is a
list of topics here so
first topic is integral types table
integral type table is nothing but the
number data type which you can declare
in C shop so this can be s byte which is
sign byte and whose range is minus 128
to 127 by it is 0 to 255 there is a care
or short whose range is minus 32
thousand something 2 plus 32 thousand
unsigned short in which we were using
its range is minus 2 billion 2 plus 2
billion something right and if you want
to declare unsigned integer which start
from 0 then its range will be 0 to 4
billion right and if you want to chose a
bigger number you can use long and you
long so these are the integer values or
unsigned integer values right now in
order to declare decimal point or
floating point they have something like
floating point data types and the main
floating point data types are float and
double load has a range which with the
precision 7 digits and the double has
the range with a precision 15 to 16
digits so if you want to declare a
floating the data type which contains
points in between one point 0 something
this type of data type is declared using
float or double okay now there is
something called default data type so
what are the default here if I click
this default value table there is a list
of default values for every day turbine
so whenever you declare a bool for
example its default value or it will it
will be initialized as a false value
right
and bite it's default value is zero care
it's default value is slash null which
is null terminator decimal has the
default value one zero point zero so
there is a list of default value these
fault the means by default if you don't
assign any value this default is
assigned to them right now
this is all these tables here so you can
always go to this MSDN Cybex website and
see this okay there is a one important
data type called string datatype which
contains a string of unicode characters
which we are going to discuss in this
video later so let's see how we can
declare the variable or datatype once
again so for example i want to declare a
bool data type we will X then we need to
initialize it by true or false so mul
contains true or false right and when we
want to show the value of x you can just
print it by console right so you can
write console dot right and you can just
drink this okay and when you run this
program to build and run it will great
give you true because the value of x is
true and if you give it false then it
will show the value false here okay in
some languages you can also provide the
value 0 1 to bool but in c-sharp you can
only provide true or false to the
boolean variables
so I think you have a now basic idea of
declaring the variables variables with a
datatype now if you want if I have
already told you here that every data
type has some range right which is 0 to
255 or 128 to 127 for sign byte you
don't need to remember this these ranges
for example if you want to find out the
range using C shop what you can do is
for example I will declare a variable
int and I want to know the minimum
minimum range of this in what I can do
is I can just print double quote for
example and I can write minimum in range
and with this plus sign I can get the
range minimum range of integer so I will
just copy this int data type here and I
will say dot and there are some options
so many value and maximum value is some
option so I will write I will just take
this min value and then I run the
program it says the minimum range is
minus this this this this
which also matches the integer range
minus this this right so you can find
the minimum values or the maximum values
using this min and Max value for every
data type right for example if you want
to see the maximum range of ink you can
just write dot
value and here you can write max range
maximum range of int okay
or you can and you can just use it here
also
max minimum range of int and just run
your program once again and you see here
minimum range of in tails - 2 billion
and maximum range is something like this
okay so you can always find the minimum
and maximum value using this c-sharp
food also now in the last video I have
also shown you how to use this string
datatype so I have shown you you can
declare a string datatype like this
string for example you want to name your
variable as name and this string
datatype
contains this any string for any Unicode
string weight within these double quotes
so I can just assign the value to this
name variable as this is our name some
some string okay so in order to assign a
value to a string you need to into these
double quotes here right now there is
something called escape sequence so
escape sequence is a a letter or or a
symbol which we can use to escape the
character for example you want to print
double quotes inside your string and for
I will give the double quotes here and
here for example so I want to print this
this is the name with the double quotes
but when I include these double quotes
here it will show me the error the code
will show me the error because when
you stick layer or double coat it will
it will consider this as a string and
this other is extra code which this C
shop code cannot understand because I
have already told you whenever you
declare a string its value is inside
double quotes and you your double quotes
are already here right so in order to
print this double quote here and double
quote here you need to use escape
sequence and escape sequence in c-sharp
is a backslash this one and here this
one not here but here and so if you want
to print this double quote here just
before this you need to give this escape
sequence here which is a slash symbol
then we will be able to print this name
inside double goes so let's run the code
once again I will just print this and I
will remove this this is the name here
okay I will run the program now and you
see here the this is a name is inside
these double quotes now printed inside
these double quotes right and there is a
lift of these escape sequence and
c-sharp which you can use let's see what
are these this list in c-sharp so when
you search for xscape sequence in
c-sharp
MS in MF TN you can see there is a list
of escape sequence here and we were we
have just used this double quotation for
printing double quotation we have used
this escape sequence now in order to
change the line there is escape sequence
like this slash and
when you give this it will print your
values in a new line right or you if you
want to give a horizontal tab you will
just rise /t let's see an example now so
for example I want to print this name in
different lines this is a name so I want
to change the line so what can I do I
will use slash and here and I can use
slash and here and slash and here now
this is her name will be printed in new
line in four lines but let's see what is
the result here and you can see here
this is a name is printed in every new
line here right so you can see this list
and you can decide what what escape
sequence you want and you can use this
escape sequence now for example you want
to print the path of a file you can use
because a path of a file in Windows
contains this backslash itself right so
for example I have a part in somewhere
for some file and I want to print this
path so I will copy this path and I will
just paste it here and as soon as you
paste your path it will show you the
error because this slash is an escape
sequence and it will not allow you to
print this path because it's a wrong way
of printing path let me change the
variable name first and we are going to
print this path here so for the escape
sequence of slash if you want to print
slash here you see here escape sequence
of drag backslash is this double slashes
so if you want
to print this part you need to give
double slashes for every slash okay
so I have provided double slash for
every slash and when I print this path
you see here it's printing only a single
slash even though we have provided the
double slash here because double slash
is a escape sequence of slash okay now
whenever you print this type of path of
whenever you need to print this type of
path whenever some other user sees it it
will be he will be confused because it
it doesn't look good when you print this
path like this so in c-sharp there is
something called verbatim literal and by
using this verbatim literal you can
ignore your escape sequence you don't
need to write this SK sequence
whenever you use this verbatim literal
before our string it will print the
string as it is so let me just give you
the name with this literal is called
verbatim string literal right and
verbatim string literal in c-sharp is
this at the rate this symbol right so
for example I want to just print this
path without these escape sequences how
can I do it I will just add this
verbatim little before my string and now
whatever you right after this verbatim
literal it will literally print this
string it will literally take this
string and print it okay so now when you
run the program it will print your path
as it is you don't need to give any
escape sequence or anything else
for example I want to print this this is
on a path and I want printed in double
quotes I can just give these double
quotes here and it says error so you
need to use this verbatim literal only
with parts right it will not work with
any other variable or any other string
so this is wrong right we were just able
to print the path and not any other
string no this is not true in order to
print this this is a path for example in
double quotes you need to give this
whatever is the escape sequence what for
example this put you need to double
these things okay so whatever is the
escape sequence for example this double
quotes in c-sharp you need to give
double double quotes right so it will
print it like this I will just print it
and we print it this is a path so
whenever you print a path with a
verbatim literal which is this at the
rate symbol you just need to give the
path right but whenever you want to
print something which you for which you
need to use escape sequence you need to
double that thing for example you want
to print double quote just provide two
times double quote here and two times
double quote here and verbatim little
will understand this two time double
quote as a single quote here right so
just remember this thing
so what we have learned in this video we
have learned different data types in
c-sharp we have learned escapes sequence
with string datatype and we have learned
verbatim literal which is this at the
rate symbol in c-sharp so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
