bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use Wells and
alerts in bootstrap so first of all we
will do the easy thing which is adding
well to our bootstrap page and to add
well you just need to add a div tag and
then add a class called
well okay and whatever you write inside
this div element it will be surrounded
by a bordered box with the gray
background so for example I can say this
is a well okay
I save my code and refresh it and the
well looks like this so it's a bordered
box with the gray background you can say
it's more or less like Jumbotron but you
can add this anywhere in your web page
right now you can add more things I like
paragraph or h1 tag for example I will
add the h1 tag and inside h1 tag I will
add this thing okay save it and refresh
your page and will look like this okay
so this is about wells now how to add
alerts in your bootstrap web page so
once again add div element and then add
a class called alert and then you can
add some attribute to a lot for example
a lot danger okay and you can just say
this is danger
a lot okay save it and refresh your
webpage and the alert will look like
this okay
in the same way you can add success info
and other alerts so just copy this and
paste it here and instead of danger you
can add success or warning or once more
info okay and I can say there's a
success alert this is warning alert and
this is info alert save your code and
refresh your page and the alert will
look like this okay now you can add some
property to close the alert also so you
can add some kind of indicator here
cross or X symbol here to close the
alert so to add this closing symbol to
your alert what you can do is you can
add first of all let's separate this and
just above your message you can add a
link tag E and you can first of all H
ref and this will be hash in our case
and then add a class called close and
then add attribute called data
- dismiss and make it is equal to a lot
and then add one more attribute called
aria-label
which will be is equal to close ok
and then to add this X symbol at the
right hand side of the alert what you
can do is you can add and and then x and
then semicolon and this is equal to X in
HTML okay so save your code and refresh
it
and you can see here there is a little X
symbol on the right hand side and when
we click this X symbol it should close
and we clicked it and it doesn't close
so let's see what's the reason I think I
misspelled dismiss it should be data
dismissed something like this okay save
it and once again refresh the page and
now it goes right so when you click this
X symbol it should disappear now if you
still face this problem that you refresh
the page and when you click this X
symbol and your alert doesn't disappear
like this what you can do is instead of
adding your jQuery script at the last
you can add it to the top here like me
okay so by default it will be at the
bottom and if this alert doesn't go you
can just add it to the top here okay and
most probably your alert will work with
this X symbol so in the same way you can
add this close button to other alerts
something like this and save it and
refresh your page and it will be added
to your alert and you can close it like
this okay so in this way you can use
Wells and alerts in bootstrap I hope you
