video I will show you how to install
wine on your Ubuntu operating system so
wine wine is important is if you install
wine in your operating system like
Ubuntu you will be able to run Windows
application many of the windows app
application if not all in your open to
operating systems for example notepad
plus plus there is only Windows
installer available on the notepad plus
plus site and if you want to install
notepad plus plus on your open to
operating system there is no direct way
but if you have wine installed you will
be able to install notepad plus plus on
your open to operating systems so let's
see how we can install it first of all
open the terminal and type sudo apt-get
install wine this is the direct method
or direct command to install wine on
your system so I will hit enter and I
will give my password and I will say yes
and hit enter now the commander which I
have shown you is directly in the open
to repository and it may be possible
that it's the older version of wine
which is available on the repository so
take a look at which version you want to
install I think older version will also
work as fine as the newer version but I
will show you the command to install the
newer version also once this is complete
so this may take some time because it's
a big file it's trying to add you can
see here
292 MB so I will pause the video and let
it install and when something important
comes I will let you know so when when
you are about install your wine
installer the one stage will come where
this screen appears and it will tell you
if you want to agree with this agreement
or not and if you read this document and
if you agree with their conditions then
you can just scroll down and just hit
up/down key to reach this okay symbol
and when it's read press ENTER and once
again it will ask you to respond for the
acceptance of the license so press
up/down and side keys to reach yes and
press ENTER and once again it will take
a few seconds to install wine on your
Ubuntu system
so now wine is installed in your system
and you can see the process is complete
once it's installed you can go to your
dash home and search for this wine so
just go to - woman right wine and you
can see the configuration configure wine
uninstall wine or wine tricks so you can
use these application to configure or
uninstall if you want to uninstall wine
or some tricks if you want to know then
you can click this so for example I open
this configure wine this one and you can
see it's configuring and mine is being
updated please wait
so it will ask for the configuration and
you can give the configuration whatever
you want now this is a direct method by
which you can install wine on your
system there is other method if you want
the latest wine installation then you
can follow these commands which I am
going to show you right now so first of
all let's see the wine configuration
it's almost look like the windows
configurations so we'll you will not be
amazed by these configurations so you
can do this configurations according to
you and just apply changes and just
yes okay and I will just cancel it I
think I have opened three times okay so
now I will clear my screen and if you
want to install latest wine on your
system then in this terminal you have to
type this pseudo I add minus apt -
repository space PPA :
ubuntu - YN / PPA so this will add a
latest PPA for wine on ubuntu in your
system and once this is added the next
step is to give the disk command so once
you hit enter and it's installed then
the next command you need to give is
this sudo apt - cat update so it will
update your installations and the last
command just go to the wine website on
Ubuntu and see what the latest version
is available on Ubuntu for wine and
according to that you can give this
command this command so sudo apt - cat
install wine and the version which you
want to install so for example I want to
install 1.5 then I will give this come
out and once this is all done then you
will be able to see wine in your
dashboard once again so it depends upon
you which version of wine you want to
install
and then you will be able to install any
not any but many windows application on
Ubuntu so I hope you have enjoyed this
