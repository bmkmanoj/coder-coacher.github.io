video number 25 which is this video C
shop tutorial 25 I have shown you how to
open that text file in the Reg text box
or text box using C shop so lot of you
guys have been asking me it's okay that
yeah I can open some text file in this
reg text box but what if I want to make
some edits and then I want to save that
txt file so in this video I will show
you how to save this text file with the
help of your save file dialog using C
shop application so this opening of file
I have shown you in the video number 25
if you don't know in case so now I will
add a button and this button I will use
to save files okay so just I will name
my file as save file the text of the
button is save file okay and I will just
double click this button and in here I
will write the code for saving the file
but if you are watching this video
series for first time for saving file we
need to import this using namespace so
write using system dot IO if you have
seen the video number 25 you have
already added this system dot IO in your
code so no need to worry
so once again in this save file button
click function we will add the code so
in here right sorry
this code for saving the file so first
of all declare the save file dialog this
dialog will open a dialog box in which
you can write the name of your file and
you can save it so write save file
dialog and give it a variable name is
equal to new save file dialog bracket
and bracket closed and then provide a if
condition in this if condition pass this
safe I'll dial dialog argument for
variable dot show dialog and bracket and
bracket close is equal to dialog result
dot okay okay and then in that if
condition write using and in the bracket
right stream and give it a variable name
s is equal to file dot open and in the
bracket once again the file dialog
variable name dot file name so is it
will ask for the file name comma file
mode dot create new okay so write this
and in the next line once again write
using and in the bracket right
streamwriter
and give it a variable name in my case
SW is equal to new stream writer and in
the bracket just pass this stream
variable which is s in my case and in
the using brackets write this
streamwriter variable dot write and in
the bracket pass the text from the rich
text box so this is my rich text box and
we'll copy the name of my rage text box
which is which text box 1 and I will
once again go to the code and just play
paste it here okay so this code will
save whatever content or whatever write
writing or whatever paragraphs are there
in the rich text box ok so just write
this code if you want you can pause and
write and copy the code and now we will
run our program so run and I will just
open the file which is a text file and
now for example I want to add something
in this text file some some text random
text and now I want to save this file
once again so I will click my save file
button and it will open a save file
dialog and I will name my file here so
edited file dot txt txt is a text
extension and you can choose the folder
from here and just save it and it will
save your file on your desktop because I
have chosen the desktop so let's see if
it's there or not
yes my file is here
on the desktop and when I see at the
bottom you can see whatever I have
entered the deck text it is saved in the
text file okay and once again if you
want you can just open this edited text
file also this one and you will see the
same text here so in this way you can
use this save file dialog to save text
file using your C shop application I
hope you have learned something new this
time please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
