video I will show you how to send your
mail to the multiple recipients so this
is the code we have written in last few
videos and if you want to send the code
to multiple user what you need to do I
will tell you right now so in this code
you have given your email ID and your
password here and you have written your
email ID here in message dot set from
new Internet address this after that
here written message dot set recipient
and in the bracket message dot recipient
type not to comma internet address dot
parse this is this line is important for
us in this code so this is one recipient
email address if you want to increase
the number of precip and what you need
to do is just go here after one
recipient email address and give the
comma and give other
email address so
what you have to do is just you need to
add comma and keep on adding the email
addresses in this way you can send your
mail to multiple recipients one two
three and you can go on adding your
recipients email address so basically
what you need to do is just separate
your email addresses by commas and you
will be good to go so this was the small
tutorial on how to send your email to
multiple recipients I hope you have
learned something new today and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
