last video I have shown you how to
declare a method in c-sharp and how to
use this method in c-sharp
now in this video I am going to show you
how you can pass parameters in the
methods and how to return values using
methods so if you have followed last
video I have shown you how to declare
this method which was returning nothing
so we have the return type void and it
has no parameters and parameters goes
inside these two brackets okay so now
suppose a user want to enter the values
and on the basis of those two values he
want to get the addition okay so let's
make this program a little more
interactive what I am going to do is I
am going to pass two parameters in this
sum so I will pass to integer which is a
no 1 and int and O 2 so these this is
called parameter passing okay or this
these are called parameters in the
method so we have we have declared two
parameters in this method definition
okay now in addition we want that this
sum will give us the addition and it
will not print this here but it will
return something to us and which is the
addition so I will just delete this line
because we have already declared these
two parameters here and what we want to
do is we want to return this addition
okay and as soon as we return something
we need to give this return type here
okay so this is called the return type
you are returning something in our case
we are returning integer that's why I
have written here integer and these are
called parameters and we are using two
parameters right now but you can you you
can pass
multiple parameter three four or any
number of parameters in the function
okay
this is return and these are parameter
okay now for example I want that user
should enter these two number and then
addition is shown to him so what I will
do here is I will declare two integers
in number one is equal to 0 comma num 2
is equal to zero okay and I want that
user should pass them so I will just
write this these two lines and I think
you know this that this console Runner
console dot write will print this enter
a first number and then this console dot
read line takes the input and then this
this convert dot to int 32 will convert
this line to an integer and pass it to
this integer this all I have shown you
in the previous video so there's nothing
complicated here right and just asking
the user that he should enter two
numbers and now what I want to do is I
want that these two numbers are passed
to the sum function because this sum
function can take two parameters so we I
will pass these two integers number 1
comma number 2 so I have passed two
integers right and I want to show the
sum to the user so I will just copy this
line which I was earlier using inside
the function and I will paste it here
okay
so what you can do is you can either use
this function directly here and this
will show the result or you can just say
in ad is equal to this e 1 which is the
instance of + example one which is my
class here if you can see here right and
because it is returning the sum of these
two numbers we can store this sum inside
this integer right because if what it
will do it will take these two numbers
it will add these numbers and it will
return this addition to this and this
addition can be stored inside this other
integer and we can print this now have a
run the program once again and now we
can just give two numbers 234 second
number 500 and we have the sum of these
two numbers right and now this program
has become little bit interactive that
user can enter these two values and
whatever the values user has entered the
result is shown accordingly okay and
then you can use the sum method multiple
times in your in your main method
whenever you need this sum okay so this
is how you pass parameters and how to
how you can return value in C shop so
this parameter passing is called pass by
value now in the next video I will show
you how to pass by value and how to pass
by reference in c-sharp and I will also
show you if you want to output or if you
want to return more than one value
how can you return multiple values
in c-sharp in our function okay so stay
tuned then please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
