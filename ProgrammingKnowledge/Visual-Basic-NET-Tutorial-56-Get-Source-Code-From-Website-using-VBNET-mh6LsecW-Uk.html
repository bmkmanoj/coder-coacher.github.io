show you how you can get the source code
of a website using your visual basic
windows form application so for example
I want to see the source code of some
website for example google.com generally
I can see this source code by
right-clicking on the browser and just
go to view source page or view page
source and it will show me the code or
source code behind the website and most
of the browser it's the same and I'm
going to show you how to do exactly same
using your visual basic application so
let's get started what I'm going to do
is I'm going to take our text box and
rich text box and a button and I'm going
to resize this which text box so in this
rich text box I am going to show the
source code and this text box I'm going
to paste or I'm going to write my
website link and by clicking this button
I want to get the source code of the
website so let me change the text of
this button as source forget source
maybe get source okay and now what I am
going to do is I will double click this
button and I will reach to the button
click event of this button and in here I
will first of all I will declare a
string variable so I will say then not
here but above them so
as string and then I will just take this
source variable here
and I will write equal to new system dot
net dot web client and I will say dot
download
string and in the bracket one time we do
I am going to get the link of the
website so I will take this link and we
copied the URL of the website and in the
double quotes and we taste it Q double
quotes and paste the link of the website
okay so this is the code and then I have
the source in the source string variable
now what I will do is I will simply
write this so I will write rich text box
one dot text is equal to my source
variable okay so let's see if it works
or not I will run my program and I will
say get source and will get me the
source code behind google.com or
google.com dot in now if you want the
source code of different website or you
don't want to hard code or hand read
write this website what you can do is
instead of
avoiding this new one you can just say
textbox1 dot text okay so whatever we
write in the text box it will take it as
a URL and then it will take the source
of the URL which you have entered in
your text box and then it will represent
or it will show the source of that
website in the rich text box but you can
or use again enter the wrong URL also so
you in order to prevent the user to
enter a wrong URL or catch any exception
you can just write try catch exception
and you can just enclose your code
inside your try catch block and in the
message box of the catch message box dog
show and you can show any error message
so that you know that you user have
entered they are wrong URL
okay so now I will running the code once
again and in here once again I'm going
to take same URL or you can take
different URL and I will say get source
or if I enter the broken URL for example
I write www.google.com thing dot C so
it's a broken URL and I will say get
source
and it shows me this exception error
right so I know that I have entered the
wrong URL because of the try-catch block
so it's always a good practice to
enclose your code in the try-catch block
whenever you have the chance of having
any exceptions or any errors I hope you
