Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn what are closures
and how can we use closures in Scala so
first of all what is a closure or what
are closures so a closure is a function
which uses one or more variables which
are declared outside the function
so closures are essentially functions
they can be pure functions or impure
functions they can be named or unnamed
closures same as functions but the basic
difference is closure uses one or more
variables which are declared outside the
function so let me give you an example
so let's say I declare function which
takes only one argument so this is add
function which takes X as int and then
what it does is it gives us the addition
of X plus a constant number let's say it
10 okay and let's call this add into our
main function so print Ln and then I'm
going to just write ad and then I'm
going to just pass 20 as an argument and
let me run the program it will give us
30 as expected right now what closure
says closure says it is a function which
uses one or more variable which is
declared outside the function so if it's
a closure we will define for example var
number is equal to 10 and then this
number we are going to use inside the
function instead of for this 10 okay so
this is a variable let's say and the
variable name is a number and its value
is 10 and we are using this variable
which is declared outside the
function inside this add function right
so let me run the program and it still
gives us the same result so now ad is a
function whose return value depends on
the value of one or more variable in our
case number which is declared outside
the function now sometimes this number
variable is also called a free variable
because its value is not bound to the
function itself that is the function
does not know the value of this variable
number now you may ask one question if
the value of this variable number
changes will the result will also change
the answer is yes so for example I will
change the value of this variable number
inside my main function and let's say
it's hundred now and let's run the code
once again and the result is 120 so the
closure takes the last valid state of
this variable which is declared outside
the closure so when you execute a
closure it takes the most recent state
of a variable now the next question you
may ask is what if the closure changes
the value of this variable number so
let's look that case also so I'm going
I'm going to enclose this inside these
curly brackets and let's say we just
assign the sum into the number itself so
number is equal to X plus number okay
and then we are just returning number
once again so what happens now so let's
print the value of number so I'm going
to just print Ln and then I'm going to
just print number once again okay so let
me run the program and let's see what's
the result is and the result is 120 so
you can see the number value is declared
first of all 10 and then we have changed
the number value 200
and at last this closure has changed the
value of this number to 120 so that
means the changes made inside the
closure are passed back to the very a
now the next question is what is a pure
and in the impure closures let me revert
back all the changes so I'm going to
just revert back all the changes like
this
so our impure closure is whenever the
data type of this number variable is var
that means the variable value can change
from inside the closure or from outside
the closure right so this is an impure
closure on the other hand whenever the
data type of this a variable number is
well that means you cannot change the
value of this variable number that makes
this closure a pure closure that is the
result of the closure will be same
always whenever we pass same value
because the value of this variable
number is constant now so the behavior
of this closure will be same for the
same argument we are passing as a value
of X so this is how you can use closures
in Scala I hope you've enjoyed this
