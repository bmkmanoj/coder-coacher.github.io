last video I have shown you how to pass
values from one form to another so for
example I and username and password and
where username is admin and when I click
login login is correct and the law law
username is passed to the second form so
username was admin so my second form
says welcome admin which we have passed
from the first form now in this video I
will show you how to search data in the
database and show it into this data grid
view so I want to search for name for
example or surname or age in the
database and I want to filter all the
names which I enter and it should be
filter according to the name I enter in
the text box so let's see how I am going
to achieve that first of all I will take
a text box and place it here and this
text box is for searching the data so
whatever I enter in this text box that
shop data should the filter and show
into this data grid view okay but but
first of all let's edit our program in
order to achieve our search code so if
you know in the video number 13 of this
video series I have shown you how to
load data into the data grid view from
the database so the name of the video is
c-sharp T total 13 show database value
in table or data grid view so if you
don't know this code this is where I
have shown you how to link your table
with the database now so in this code I
am going to correct I am going to add it
this code are little in order to search
the data so in this code where you have
declared your data table DB data set I
will just copy this whole data table and
variable name also and I will delete
this from here data table only just
leave the variable name like that and it
will show some arrow and I will go at
the top and I will declare my data table
variable the same name at the top of my
code where my form declaration completes
so here when I declare this like this
it's a global variable so that I can use
it in other method or function also
that's why I have declared at the top of
the functions so declared like that and
my load table now looks like this
without that data table so but it's not
showing error now okay now I will once
again go to my form and this is the form
third text box for searching right so I
will double click this text box and this
leads us to the
text box text change event and in here
we are going to write the code for
searching the text okay and in here
right dot of you I will name it as DB
variable name is equal to new lot of you
that of you bracket and bracket closed
and in here I will pass my data table
variable which I have declared at the
top so I will copy this DB database data
set variable this we have declared at
the top as a global variable just a
while ago right so I will just copy this
variable once again go to the form and
once again double click this text box
and in between this dot of you bracket I
will pass that DB data set variable okay
in the next line I will write I will
just copy this TV variable here dot row
filter is equal to and just write this
line this is string dot format and in
the bracket right name this name is the
database column name so right now I want
to search names in the database and the
column name for my database table for
name is name itself and the MySQL data
are is not case-sensitive so I can write
the name like that also with capital n
or small n whatever you like you can
write because it's not case-sensitive so
write name in the double quotes name
like this a single quote percentage and
in the bracket zero percentage then
single quote and then double quote comma
your text box name in which you want to
search so this is the text box and this
is its name
right so this is that text box name text
box name dot txt so write these two
lines and in the next line write data
grid view which is the name of your data
grid view this one this is the name of
my data grid view dot data source is
equal to DB which is this dot of you
variable name so in the text box text
change event we will write these three
lines of code okay and we have declared
this data set variable as a global
variable so write this and write the
above code now we are going to run the
program to
and I will load the table this I have
shown you in the video number 13 now I
want to search according to the name
right because in the food I am searching
according to the name so I write
something here J so all the name which
are starting from J are filtered I want
to search specifically for John
so john2112 search mark M we have two
names which are mark so it has filtered
both two names right now for example I
want to search according to the surname
what I will do is in our code just
change this column name so in our
database my surname column name is this
one so I will change this in the code so
surname just you want to just change
this name according to your column name
right and once again run the program
load the table and this time I am
searching according to the name so when
I write B it gives me all the surname
which are starting from B I want to
search specifically for surname Bell so
to name sodium with Bell okay or some
other surname G these are the name which
has G in surname which has G in them and
I just want to search this
sorry and it searched for me so like
that you can search any column in the
database with the help of your c-sharp
application so I hope this video has
helped you in your programming and I
hope you will learn something from this
and that's it for this video please rate
