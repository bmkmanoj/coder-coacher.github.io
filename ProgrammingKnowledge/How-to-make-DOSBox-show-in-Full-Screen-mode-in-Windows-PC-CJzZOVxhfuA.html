shown you how to install and use DOS box
on your Windows PC but if you have
already observed that when you open
DOSBox
it doesn't open in the full-screen mode
and there is no option to use it in
full-screen mode this this maximizing
option will by default is disabled so in
this video I will show you how to use
lost box in full-screen mode
so what you need to do is you need to go
to the installation file of DOS box
generally it's by default in your seve
seed folder and then in your Program
Files x86 and dos box - 0.74 so just go
to the installation file or dos box and
you can see these files in side your dos
box fold them what file we are
interested in is this point dos box 0.74
options which is a Windows batch file
and how you can open it just double
click it and it will open this file in
the default notepad and in here you if
you see carefully the full screen mode
is by default false so what you need to
do is you need to make this option else
true so right now full screen mode full
screen is equal to true and full screen
resolution by default its original you
need to make it zero cross 0 and when
those resolution is also original you
need to make em 0 cross 0 and the output
is will be by default surface it's by
default surface and you need to make it
overly okay so you need to change these
4 option full screen is equal to true
and full resolution is equal to 0 cross
0 and Windows resolution is equal to 0
cross 0 and output is equal to overlay
ok
and once you're done with that just save
this file and now when you open this dos
box just open it and KC you can use dos
box in the full-screen mode and once you
are done with boss box you need to close
it so once you have already finished
working on boss box just right exit to
exit this application so just right exit
exi t and press enter and toss box will
be closed so in this way you can use dos
box in full-screen mode I hope you have
