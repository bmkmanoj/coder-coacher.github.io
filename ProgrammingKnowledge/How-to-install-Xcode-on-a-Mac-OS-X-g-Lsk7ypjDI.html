you how you can download and install
let's scored on your Mac machine select
that started so first thing we need to
do is you need to open your App Store so
just click this icon for the App Store
and once the App Store is opened just
search for Xcode here so I'm going to
search for Xcode and the first result
here I can see is for the Xcode tool so
I'm going to just click on the Xcode
here and here you will see more
description about the Xcode so you can
see the latest version or at the time of
making this video is eight point three
point three and some description is also
given about Xcode here and when you
scroll down we will be able to see some
screenshot about the Xcode okay so now
before installing experts you need to
have Apple ID for you to in order to you
know install Xcode so if you don't have
your Apple ID then we can create one by
going to this website I'm going to open
my browser and here you can see the
website you just need to go to is
developer.apple.com so you just need to
open developer.apple.com and on the top
you can see some tabs here we just need
to click on this tab which says account
so just click on this account tab and
you just need to click create up lady if
you don't have an ID and if you already
have ID you can sign in with your Apple
ID okay so let's see when I click the
Create Apple ID a button let's see what
happens so you can see it will give you
this kind of form and you listen to give
your first name and last name and then
the country
and the date of birth and your email ID
and password and from security questions
you listen to answer and then your ad ID
will be created and then you can sign in
with your Apple ID and once you are
logged into this developer.apple.com
that your Apple ID you will be able to
see this kind of interface here right
and in the download section just click
the downloads section here and you can
see the latest stable version right now
is a 23 point 3 which is also shown in
the App Store right there is also our
latest version for the beta version
which is version 9 but we are going to
install this repent repent 3 version
right so I just wanted to show you this
so now I'm going to just minimize my
browser and I will go to the App Store
once again and here I just need to click
this button which says get and once I
click get then I can see this option we
first install app so I'm going to just
click install app and once I click
install app it will ask me to give my
Apple ID and password so here you just
need to give your Apple ID which you
have just created and then you just need
to give you a password so I'm going to
give my password here and once you give
your Apple ID and password you will be
able to see this installation is started
right so first of all the Xcode will be
downloaded onto your Mac and then it
will be installed so then you will see
on this launchpad you will see that this
Xcode file is about 4.5 4 GB so it's a
big pile so we need some time to
download so just wait for the download
to complete and then it will start
installing and then I just
launch the launch pad you will be able
to see this downloading process here
right so right now 46 MB is downloaded
how about 4.5 4 GB so I'm going to pause
the video and once it's downloaded it's
going to start installing automatically
so you don't need to do anything so just
leave it as it is and I will see you
after some time after waiting for the
download to complete I waited around 1
or 2 hours for the download to complete
I can see that the installation process
has been automatically started and it
will take some time to finish the
installation process so I will wait for
the installation process to complete
also so now I can see that the
installation of Xcode has been completed
and when I see in the launchpad so when
I click this icon for the launchpad I
can see that Xcode icon is there so I
can open the Xcode from the launchpad I
am going to just double click on this
icon for the Xcode and then it's going
to start the Xcode and for the first
time when Xcode starts you need to agree
with the license terms and conditions so
if you want you can read all this these
terms and conditions and if you agree
with East terms and condition you just
need to click agree and then you just
need to give your max password so I'm
going to give my max password and then
it's going to start installing the
components of Xcode
so I just need to once again wait for
some time until these components has
been installed so you can see the
process is much faster than the
installation process so I just need to
wait for a few seconds and then it will
be done
so now Xcode has been started and I can
see this kind of window here and now I
can create any of the application which
code can create out of here so you can
see create a new Xcode project check out
existing projects and get started with
the playground so for example I need to
create Xcode project I can just click
here which is create a new Xcode project
and I can see this kind of interface
here and then it's going to ask me which
kind of template I want for iOS or watch
or TV OS or Mac OS or cross-platform
application whatever I want I can meet
from here right so this is how you can
download and install Xcode on your Mac
machine I hope you've enjoyed this video
