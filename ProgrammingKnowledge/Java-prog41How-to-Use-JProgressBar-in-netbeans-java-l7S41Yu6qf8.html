gonna show you how to use J progress bar
like this this is your J progress bar so
let's get started
go to your J frame which is this take
our J progress bar and you can see this
is a blank bar so you can also change
the properties here you can change the
maximum value minimum value orientation
vertical or horizontal to text you know
and in here if you go if you click
string painted will show what how much
percentage of you of progress bar is
field generally progress bar is used to
show the percentage of your any data so
it will be used to represent zero to
hundred percent but it's not really
restricted to zero two hundred percent
you can show any
when you from here minimum value or
maximum value so you can set your value
also so now I will tell you how to use
it so for example if I enter some value
in this text field for example 50 and
plus okay
so progress bar should be filled 50
percent so let's get started I will take
a new button all this
my name it does progress okay and right
click event action and action performed
so I will go to my method and here you
can write you have to write int whatever
you what you want to take so I will
define the menu name is value only
equal to end
integer dot DS arnott pacient
and here you take the name of your text
field which is this so I right click and
change variable name so this is my
variable name value in so I copy this
variable name of my text field and put
it inside pass him to bracket dot get
text okay
mmm semicolon and second line whatever
is your progress bar variable name is
variable name is J progress bar one open
from the spa so I copied it paste it
here dot set value and okay and inside
while you in bracket you have to insert
this variable in which we have defined
in the first line okay so now let's try
to run in the program
so now when we enter here some value for
example 50 and I press ok my progress
was filled by 50 percent for example
under them so it should be very but then
percent and if I exceed its maximum
limit which is hundred for example I
will fill hundred and twenty and plus
okay it will not go beyond 100 person
because I have already defined its
maximum value is 100 so if you want to
increase its maximum limit you have to
go into the property and increase in its
limit so you can do that also
so this was the tutorial on how to use a
progress bar I hope you have enjoyed
this tutorial and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
