last few videos we have been seeing how
to generate a PDF and and the data such
as images lists paragraph or tables or
graphs from your C shop application to
your PDF file using ITEX sharp and C
sharp application and then now what we
are doing is we are just pressing this
button and it generates our PDF file in
the debug folder of our project okay but
what if I want to see the PDF file
directly and I don't want to go to my
debug folder again and again and I I
should open the test dot PDF file again
and again I just want to open the file
once I created the file so when I click
this button my file should open also at
the same time by clicking this button so
how can I achieve this in this video I
will show you because it's a bit
irritating going to your debug folder
and see the PDF file so let's see how we
can achieve that goal to open the file
directly and not going to the folder so
just click this create PDF and double
click it and this is the code I have
been showing you in the last four or
five videos ok to create the PDF and to
create the content in the PDF
so in this code just go at the bottom
where your document dot close code is
there okay so up to this code our
document is created the PDF is already
created and before the closing of the
method or the function closing just
right here after this document dot close
we need to open the PDF file so we will
write the code for opening the PDF file
so just write system dot diagnostic dot
process dot start and break it and
bracket closed okay and in this start
bracket we are going to pass the path of
the text file so I will just right click
it and go to the property and I will
just copy the path of this PDF file ok
close the properties and I will in the
double quotes I will paste the path and
it will shows error because we need to
add double slashes instead of single
slashes
and okay so in the start bracket just
pass the path of your PDF and now when
you run the program so username and
password and when I click this my PDF
should open directly so I click create
PDF and you can see the PDF is opened
directly and I don't need to go to the
folder and open it so by using this code
you can open the PDF directly but one
more thing if you have your file
wherever your Exe file is there
executable file is there and you are
generating your PDF file in your debug
folder or your release folder of your
project where your application file is
there so type application and your debug
folder then you don't need to provide
this long path you just give the name of
this PDF fine so this code is now very
short so system dot diagnostic not
process dot start and in the bracket in
the double quotes just give the name of
the PDF file it will also work perfectly
fine so let's try and run the program
once again and once I click and click
this my PDF should open so I click this
and the PDF is open once again so in
this way you can launch the PDF directly
after the creation of the PDF so I hope
this will help
in your programming and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
