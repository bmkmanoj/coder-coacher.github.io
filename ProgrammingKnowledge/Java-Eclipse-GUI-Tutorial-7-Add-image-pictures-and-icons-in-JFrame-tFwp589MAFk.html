video I'm going to show you how you can
add images and icons to your component
and to the frame for example you want to
add some icon to this login button or
for example you want to add some image
to this login frame how you can do it I
will show you in this video so for
example you want to show some image in
here for the login page so what you can
do is you can use this jlabel
to have your image inside your jlabel
and I will remove the text inside this
jlabel
and what I am going to do is I am going
to resize this jlabel
like this according to the size of the
image for example I have okay
okay now what I am going to do is in
this label I want to set some image so I
want to have some image post right so
what I generally do is on I go to
internet browser and I search for the
images which are free to use images and
Icona which are free to use and there
are lots of websites which provide
images which are free to use or
open-source and for example I will give
you an example I know a site called I
can archive this as you see so many
number of images and icons and you can
have them for free right so for example
I want to have some image for login I
will make this little bit bigger so I
will write here login and you will see
some images in here so for example I
would want to have this image in my
login frame I can just choose this PNG
you can even have the size of the image
you want to have right for example you
want to have 48 by 48 this size will be
changed to 48 by 48 okay or you can say
all and this size you will get the
regular size here so I want this regular
size I will click the PNG right click it
and I will say save image as
and I will save this image wherever for
for in whatever folder I want for
example I want to say with this image
here I will save it here in my pictures
folder and for example I want to have
the icon for this login button okay
the image I have downloaded right now is
for this login frame and I want an icon
here on the login button for this login
button so what I can do I can search for
for example okay icon and you see here
okay icon and I want to resize it for
example 24 cross 24 pixel and once again
I can click this PNG and I can see this
and I save this image as this image on
my pictures folder for it for now
okay now the next thing I will do is I
will change the name because they are
quite long so for example I will change
the name of this picture as only login
and I will change this picture as
only okay icon okay now what I need to
do is for showing this picture on this
label what I need to do is I will just
double click this login dot Java so I
can see my package Explorer here and in
my project 1 what I need to do is just
right click your project what in
whatever project you are in and new and
just add a source folder ok so go to
project new and just add a source for
source folder and you need to give the
name to the source folder I name my
episodes folder as IMG for images ok
IMG finish and now I have the source
folder and now what I can do is I can go
to the pictures which I have downloaded
just select all these picture drag this
picture to this image folder ok drag
this picture to the image folder and you
will see this message click OK and now
you have these pictures inside your
source folder ok if you do not see this
these images inside your source folder
right-click and refresh so now you have
these pictures inside your image source
folder what you need to do is next for
example I go to my project wherever I
have created my project generally it's
in workspace and the name of the project
my project name is company and in here I
will go to the bin folder or you see
here we have created this image folder
and in these this image we have these
two images I will go to the binary
folder and you see here they are copied
to the binary folder also right
so they are automatically copied to the
binary folder I haven't copied them but
when I click refresh they are
automatically copied to my binary folder
or otherwise what you can do is you can
right-click and you can you can run your
project or you can just run your project
once again from here and these images
will be copied in your in your binary
folder here ok so once you have these
images in your binary folder it's easy
to use them in your jlabel so what you
need to do here is now just go to I will
just double click and make it bigger and
go to source here and search for this
label wherever you have created this
label this label is this one which has
no text here right so in here what I
need to do is I need to give the path of
the image and set the icon to this label
this is the label I want to set this
icon right so just below the Declaration
of this label you can just set this icon
to the label like this okay
so just write image IMG is equal to new
image and what what is this yeah so just
write this these two lines these two
lines we need to use and these two in
these two line what we are doing we are
just declaring this image this image is
a part of this java dot awp dot image
this one okay so if this image is
showing you any error just import
java.awt dot
are so it will add all the AWT libraries
in your system okay so go to your image
and just write image IMG is equal to new
image icon and inside this bracket as a
parameter you need to pass this this
indicate to this class which is login
dot Java dot class dot get resources and
inside this bracket we will pass the
arguments slash forward slash and the
name of the icon so the name of the I
icon or name of the image which I want
to show in this label is name of the
icon is login dot PNG okay so I will
change this name as login dot PNG login
dot PNG right and then get image okay so
this line will be like this and now once
you have this image from the source code
you just need to pass this image in your
label so just call the name of the label
in my case this is the label name which
is label itself dot set icon and inside
the bracket just write new image icon
and pass this image object here so you
need to write these two lines in order
to set your image and when you go to the
design view here you will be able to see
your image but there is a one catch
you cannot resize or your image like
this right so choose the image which can
fit your label the resizing of image it
can be done but it's a long code and I
in the beginning video I do not want to
show this code to you so it's easier to
have the images which have the same size
as your label so now you have
fixed this image in your label now you
want to have the icon on this login
button right so what you can do is you
can do the same thing just go to your
code and copy these two lines which I
have just explained you and wherever
your login button declaration is which
is let's see where is our login button
here so we have this login button
declaration just below this you can set
this image and this image was called
okay image right so I will just right
under the button okay dot PNG and I will
go to the design view and it's not
showing let's see why so why it's
showing an error because I haven't
changed this label name as button login
so name of the button just take the name
of the button and in here just paste the
name of the button right so this code
will be like this and don't forget to
change the name of the button which is
this one and I go to design view
once again I will be able to see this
image here okay so in this way you can
add images and icons to your components
in your Java GUI application I hope you
