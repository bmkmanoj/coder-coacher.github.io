on WPF application using c-sharp till
now we have made an application where we
can save update or delete data in the s
collide database using our WPF
application on c-sharp
in this video I will show you how to
connect combo box with your SQLite
database so for example I need a combo
box and I want to populate all the names
in the my database so let me show you my
database first so for example I have
this database where I have table
employee ID name surname and aid and I
want to show all the list of names in
the combo box so first of all what is a
combo box combo box is like this so you
have a drop-down menu so when you click
combo box it will show some values list
of values okay so in the same manner I
want to show all the names in the combo
box in my WPF application so how can I
do that I will show you now so first of
all I will stop debugging so I have this
form and I will go to my toolbox and I
will take a combo box from here and drag
and drop in my window if you want you
can change the name of this combo box I
leave this combo box name as default and
then what I will do is I will go to its
code section so right now I am in second
dot XAML file and I will go to second
dot XML dot
see s file which is its code file and I
will make a new function make sure that
you are making the new function below
this declaration of s collide connecting
string dot Omega so below this you can
make a function so for example I want to
make a function for filling this combo
so I will name my function as fill combo
function okay break it and break it
close this is my function and it's
returning nothing so I will give voice
as writer and in here I will write my
code so if you are following this video
in the last video I have shown you how
to delete your database using this
delete button just double click it and
copy all the code in between this
function because we are going to use the
same function of same code which we have
written in this button delete click
event or you can use any other code for
example from this update click button
event or your save click event and copy
and paste your code from there to here
so this code is like this we have
declared this database connection first
so our database name is database dot DB
and version history then we are creating
a connect connection instance so I write
SQLite connection and give it variable
name is equal to new SQLite connection
and I pass this connection string here
and then I have a try-catch block first
and then I am opening the connection
with the SQLite database and here I
declare a string in which I will pass
the query so because in the last video
we are deleting the database that is why
we have written this query for deleting
but in this video we will write a
different query that we will see later
and then we have this s collide command
create command is equal new SQLite
command and we are passing our query n
connection as argument here okay and
then we are executing query and then we
show the message that our query is
executed in the delete case it's deleted
so just copy this code from the last
video and paste it here or other by what
otherwise you can copy this code also
and now we are going to make some
changes so what changes we need we will
delete this magic message dot show
delete because we don't need it and we
will comment this command dot execute
query because we also don't need it then
we are going to change this query so
instead of deleting database let me
delete all the all the query so I in the
query I will write select star from my
table name my table name is employee
info if you can see a table name and in
this table name I have column E ID name
surname and age right so just remember
that so I have written select star from
employee ID here then I created the s
collide command and in the next line I
will make the s collide data reader so
right SQLite data reader and I give it a
variable name maybe dr is equal to new
not new but just copy this s collide
command here to here dot execute reader
bracket and break it closed so it's
reading the values from this query so it
exit this data reader will execute this
query and read the values in this data
reader now we will make a while loop for
reading all the values one by one while
and break it and break it closed and in
here in the while argument we will pass
this dr which is on data reader dot read
so till this data reader reads the value
we are executing our while loop okay and
in here i will declare a string and i
want to save the name here so i will
write name is equal to dr dot get
string racket them break it closed and
in here I will pass the column number of
the column whose data I want so I want
to show the name in my combo box right
so my combo box for or my column for
combo for the name is 0-1 so my column
number is 1 if we were we wanted to show
these surname in the database we would
have taken 2 because this is 0th column
first column second column third column
so in my gate value argument I will pass
one because this name is my first column
okay I go to my code and I pass here dr
dot get value one because I want the
value from my first goal column then I
will go to my design view I will select
my combo box I will copy the name of my
combo box which is combo box one and
once again go to my code section and
below this string name I paste my combo
box name dot items dot add bracket and
bracket closed so this code will add one
by one items to my combo box and what we
have we want to add that these this name
so just copy this string variable and
paste it here okay so it will read the
names one by one and it will set the
names to the combo box one by one
because we are executing this in the
you okay so if you want you can just
pause the video and copy this code let
me make it little bit small so all code
will come in the screen so just copy
this code and what you need to do next
is just copy the name of this function
just copy it and go to the constructor
or the initialization of this this
second window so wherever your
initialized component function is there
just search for this initialize
component and just below this initialize
component paste your fill combo function
and close it so what it will do is
whenever you run your program of
whenever this window starts it
automatically calls this function at the
start of your program so we it will call
this function and it will fill the combo
box with the name so let us see if it
works or not I run the program and first
of all I gave my username and password
it's correct and it's showing me some
syntax error let's see what syntax error
I have
so when I see my query here I would have
written select star from and I have
written form so I write from select star
from my table name now it should work
I think username and password and now my
username and password is correct second
form opens and when I click this or when
I open this combo box it should show me
my names from my name column yes it
shows all the names from my column name
so let us confirm if these name are
correct or not I go to my database here
and I have this name mark John Peter
Julie and Matthew and here just see the
names are the same mark John Peter Julie
Matthew here and here all names are same
so it has loaded the names from the
database to your combo box so I hope you
have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
