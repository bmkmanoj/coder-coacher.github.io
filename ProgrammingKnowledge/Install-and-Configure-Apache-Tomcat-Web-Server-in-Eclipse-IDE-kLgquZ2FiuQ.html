show you how you can install Apache
Tomcat server on your Windows operating
system and configure it with Eclipse IDE
so let's get started first of all you
need to have two things first is the
Eclipse IDE itself for developing Java
EE programs and second thing you need to
have is Java Runtime environment so
these two things you must have installed
if you don't have these two things you
may have to install them first and then
you can install Tomcat so for installing
Tomcat you just need to search for
Apache Tomcat and the first link up here
here is Tomcat dot Apache dot o-r-g so
just click this link and in here there
are different versions of Apache so if
you don't have this Eclipse you can
download Eclipse IDE just search for
Eclipse download and the first link will
be Eclipse dot o-r-g slash downloads and
you must have this installed in your
windows operating system which is
Eclipse IDE for Java EE environment
right with JDK ok so these are the two
prerequisites so now if you have both
the things installed you just need to
choose the version of Tomcat which you
want to install I will choose the latest
version for now and when you scroll down
you will be able to see this core in
core section the last option which is
Windows service installer we are going
to download executable file which we can
install and I'm going to save this file
it's not a big file I think so
it will be downloaded really fast it's
just nine point seven MB at the time of
making this video so once this download
is complete you can run this executable
file and then click yes and then this
neck net Apache Tomcat setup will start
click Next and if you agree with the
terms license and condition click I
agree and in here you will see some
option I will choose all the checkboxes
or I will check all the checkboxes and I
will click Next and this is important
because sometimes when you install
Tomcat and if you have already installed
some other server like GlassFish or some
other server and this may you know
occupy this port 8080 so make sure that
your port 8080
is free to use and the otherwise you can
change this port and if you are sure
that this port is free port 80 85 I will
change this HTTP connector port to port
80 85 because I know that this port is
free in my case and if you are sure that
put 80 80 is free for HTTP connector
port then you can go with this port
otherwise you can change it to some
other port something like port 80 81 or
80 82 or 80 85 of something like this
okay
so make sure that this port is free to
use okay and if necessary just change
this port click Next Next and in here it
will ask please select the path of Java
SE 7 or JRE installer so I will just
choose the JRE folder which I have
installed
so when you have installed this Java JDK
and JRE on your system you may have in
your C folder in this C folder go to
Program Files and there will be a folder
called Java and in here there will be a
folder called JRE okay so this part you
need to give to your installer here so I
will go to the same path which is my PC
and my PCC folder Program Files and Java
and JRE okay click OK and click Next
so that's why JDK and JRE is important
right so you must have Java installed on
your system so just give this path of
JRE and click Next and click install now
installation of Tomcat server will start
and it will be completed in few seconds
so now the server installation is
complete I will uncheck both the options
and click finish
now I will start my Eclipse IDE for
developing Java EE projects and this
will start Eclipse IDE and once this IDE
will open I'm going to configure this
tomcat server so now my clips IDE will
open once your IDE is open you need to
go to this Pindos tab here so in here
there will be a section called
preferences open this preferences and in
here there will be a sort section called
the server so if you have a Java EE you
have if you have downloaded this
of eclipse which I was talking about
then only you will be able to see this
server section
otherwise you may not see this section
so make sure that you have install
Eclipse IDE for Java EE okay so in the
server section go to a runtime
environments and in here we are going to
add Tomcat so just click add and in here
just click Tomcat 8 because we have
installed the latest version of Tomcat
which is Tomcat 8 right so choose Tomcat
8 click Next and in here you need to
browse for the location where Tomcat is
installed so just browse and go to your
PC once again and in Program Files and C
folder in Program Files there will be a
folder called Apache Software Foundation
and in this Apache Software Foundation
you will be able to find this Tomcat 8
ok so just select this Tomcat 8 folder
and click OK and then click finish and
click OK
so now our Tomcat is 8 is configured and
now we need to start this server right
so now what we need to do is we need to
open this server perspective in here ok
so we will go to windows and in here we
will go to this show view section and in
here if you or don't see server go to
other and in here search for server ok
and just double click this service it
will open a new prospective perspective
called server now right click here and
click new and click server and this will
open you know options to
choose the version of server we have
configured Tomcat 8 so we will choose
Tomcat 8 click Next and in here right
now we don't have anything to configure
so just click finish this will add this
tomcat server at localhost ok so just
select the server and just click this
green button here ok so select the
server and click the screen button which
start the server once you click this
button you will be able to see this kind
of messages you just need to allow them
all and in some moments this server will
start so it says that several ports port
8 0 0 5 80 85 eight eight eight zero
zero nine required by Tomcat is already
in use right so what you do in that case
if these ports are already in use I have
told you that this may be the condition
that other servers are running and they
are already being used okay so I will
just click OK for now and so to change
the port if these ports are already
configured you can change it by going to
your C directory and in C directory go
to this Program Files and in here go to
Apache Software Center where your Tomcat
8 will be installed so go inside this
Tomcat folder and there will be a file
call or folder called cons and cons
there will be a server dot XML file
which is this one just open this server
dot XML file and in here all your ports
are configured for example the server
port is 8 0 0 5 4
down you can change it for example if
this port is occupied I will change it
to 8 0 1 5 right and in the same way you
can search for the other ports for
example this port 80 85 is ok for us but
the port 8 0 0 9 now we are going to
change so we will just search for 8 0 0
9 and you can see this option connect up
port 8 0 0 9 we will change it - 8 0 1 9
and just start it once again so start it
and server is started and synchronize
now so you can open this your favorite
web browser and just type localhost
localhost colon 8080 5 in my case
because this was the port I have
configured right so open and then just
press ENTER and it will open Apache
Tomcat 8 point zero point one seven yeah
right now this same URL you can even
open on your Eclipse IDE you just need
to open the web services here and you
can open this inside your Eclipse IDE
also ok now you can open these ports
which I have told you in this server dot
XML file the same kana
your project also so there will be a
folder called server here and in here
you will be having this server dot XML
we will open this server dot XML and in
here you can just change this port ok
and
and just save this file and you can you
know rerun this server once again so
restart and now your server is started
and once again it started and
synchronized okay so you can rerun or
refresh your page and once again it will
run properly so in this way you can
configure tomcat server on your Eclipse
IDE I hope you have enjoyed this video
