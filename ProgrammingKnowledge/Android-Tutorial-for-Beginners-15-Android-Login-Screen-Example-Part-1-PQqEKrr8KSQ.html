tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video and the next
video we are going to see how to create
a simple login app using Android studio
now I decided to break this login app in
two videos because if I show it in one
video this video can be a really lengthy
and boring so let's get started in this
first video of this login app we are
going to design our login application
and we are going to set up all the
resources and in the next video we are
going to see how to write the back-end
code for this application so let's get
started I have opened my android studio
and we are going to create a new Android
studio project and in here we are going
to name our application for example
simple login app ok and now I'm going to
click Next and we are going to make this
project for phone and tablets and make
sure whatever version you choose here
minimum SDK it covers 100% of devices
here click Next and we are going to
choose the blank activity click Next
and the activity name we are going to
give is login ok so login activity ok
now I'm going to finish my so now our
project is set up and now this is the
first activity we can see here which is
login activity now I'm going to create
one more activity so that we can
redirect the user if he provides a valid
login password so that it can be a you
know users activity so that he can
access some some screen or some activity
after
organ so now now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a new activity and I
will name it as user activity so in your
app just go to this resources folder or
our ES folder and inside this you will
be able to see this folder called layout
I'm going to right click this folder and
I'm going to create a new activity here
and this activity will also be a blank
activity and this activity I will name
it as user activity okay and I will
finish this so now we have two
activities one is login which we will
use to create our login page and the
other is user activity which will open
after you know authentication of the
user okay
now what we are going to do is let's go
to this activity underscore user dot XML
and see the path or the context of this
activity you can see here so what we are
going to do is in our Manifest folder so
in the app folder there will be a folder
called manifests and inside this folder
there will be a XML file called Android
manifest file ok androidmanifest.xml
file I will click this and here you can
see your both
activity one is our main activity or the
launcher activity and the other is our
user activity so in here what we are
going to do is we are going to set up
the intent filter for the second
activity also in our first activity
which is login activity this intent
filter is already there right
but in this user activity you can see
only the name is there and the label is
there but there is no intent filter ok
so we are just going to copy this intent
filter tag
our login activity and we will go to
this user activity which we have just
created and paste this intent filter
here now there can only be one launch
activity for your app right so the
second activity will be a default
activity launcher activity means that
the first activity which will appear is
this launcher activity which is our
login activity now the user activity is
our default activity and this we are
going to open whenever we you know
authenticate the user right and the name
of this activity will be the content
name of this second activity so go to
your activity underscore user dot XML
file and in here you can copy this path
from here which will be comm dot
whatever your path you have given here
comm dot something dot something dot
user right so just copy it here go to
the Android manifest dot XML file and
paste it here in the action Android
colon name is equal to and in the quotes
you just pasted this path here now we
have successfully setup of a second
activity now we are going to design our
first login activity here so what we are
going to do is in here we will pick and
place some text views and added views so
that you know user can enter his so
login credentials
you
so now our design part is almost
complete we are going to do one more
thing which is transferring of all
string constant to the string dot XML
file so in your app folder there will be
a folder called values here in the
resources folder so go to resources or
RDS folder and there will be a folder
called values and inside this values
there will be a folder called strings
dot XML file and in here you can define
all your all your string constant and
it's a good practice to you know
transfer all your string constant here
so that you can easily find them right
so what we are going to do is once you
have done designing your app you can
just go to this content tree and in here
on every you know textview and other
button you can see all small little
warning yellow light and when you click
this you will be able to see a small
little button or bulb here and just
click this bulb and this bulb says
hard-coded string login page should use
a string resource so under studio also
gives us the option to you know define
all the string constant in our string
XML so just click this message here and
then it will open your extract resources
file and file name here is strings dot
XML and in here you can name your
resource so this text page is our text
right so you can just name it as login
underscore text so it's just a ID for
your string ok and once you are done
with that you can click okay okay so for
the first time it can show the warning
like this rendering problem could not
resolve a resource but when you do the
same for other other stuff like this one
username you no longer you know face
these problems so this is for user name
underscore text okay and I will do the
same for you know every text and added
text and button here so that all these
resources are transferred to my string
dot XML file you can see we have created
lot login underscore text and the text
on this login underscore text is login
page in the same way we have defined a
one more tag for username so I will do
the same for other other text boxes or
text views and buttons right
you
so now I have successfully defined all
my strings to the string in the string
dot XML file so now I have defined all
my string constants or all my strings as
constant and I have transferred all my
strings as constant in my strings dot
XML file you can see all my you know
strings like username password attend
login have some you know a tag here or
constant name here so that I can reuse
them in some different place using these
tags or tag IDs right now our designing
is done you can even go to the second
activity which is activity and the score
user dot XML file and go to the design
and in here I can just drag and drop our
large tracks and I can change the text
you
so now our design part is almost
complete or complete and in this video
I'm going to just show you this design
and I'm going to stop this video here
itself and in the next video
what we are going to do is we are going
to write some code so that user can
enter his username and password and we
will also provide some number of
attempts here and then once he logs in
and if the login is successful he will
be successfully redirected to the
activity dot XML file so stay tuned for
that video please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
