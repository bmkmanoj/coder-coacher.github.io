last video I have shown you how you can
create your first project using window
builder in Eclipse Java application and
I have shown you how this palette works
and what are properties and I have shown
you a simple code to show some message
when you click some button now in this
video we will make some useful
application a simple calculator to add
or subtract two values which we enter in
the textbox so let's get started I have
this blank frame here and I have taken
this absolute layout inside this frame
and then I am going to take two text
boxes here Xbox one and text box
two so once again Xbox to okay so I have
these two text boxes first name first
textbox name is textbox fielder I will
name it aspects pause field
num1 and the second text box name i will
change it as textbox field
num - okay
so in these the two text boxes we are
going to enter our two number which we
want to add or subtract okay now I will
take two or I will take a button or two
buttons one for adding so I will take
this button one for adding and one for
subtracting for example
if you have observed when you want to
drag and drop or when you want to take
the same tool two times you need to just
click on some other component and go on
the same component once again and yet
then you will be able to drag and drop
the second the same component once again
here so in this text box I will change
the or in this button I will change the
text of this button as ad and the second
text box text as
- for example okay and then what I can
do is I want to show the answer
somewhere right so I can show it this
answer in a label or a text box whatever
you want so for example I wanted to show
the answer in the text box here okay and
for I will take this label to show that
this is my answer so I will drag and
drop this label and I will just move
this and this label the text of this
label is the
answer is for example and the answer
will be shown in this text box okay and
you can change the property of this
label you can change the font size so I
will give the bigger pond size and bold
and let us see what kind of
font-family we can use so any point
family for example this time strowman or
okay I will take this
and I want to make my
want little bit bigger so now I can see
this so I have three text boxes and two
buttons one label which will show that
what will be the answer in this text box
okay I will first of all I will click
this Add button so I can double click it
or I can go to right click ever add
event handler and action perform ok so
this time I am going to double click
this button and we reach to the action
perform for this new button which is
called add ok and in here first of all I
will write a try-catch block so that
user can enter any invalid number for
example he may not enter a number he may
enter some letter or word or something
which is not valid so we need to catch
that exception so that is why we need to
use try catch block right so we will use
a try catch block here and this is how
you can write a triage block just write
try and these two curly braces and after
these two curly braces you catch your
exception if any exception occurs so you
can catch your exception in this catch
block and I'm simply showing some
message in the click catch block so if
our program throws any error while we
are adding these two numbers I will
catch the exception and I will say
please enter valid numbers okay so this
message dialog I have shown you in the
last video how to show a message using J
option pain right if you remember and in
this try catch block or in this try
block I am going to write my code but
above this try block what I am going to
do is I am going to declare two numbers
or I am going to declare two integer
numbers so what I am going to do is I
will declare two integer variables in
number one comma number two and I will
need a answer variable also to store the
answer so I will say a ns
so I have declared three variables num1
num2 and ANS so this number one we will
transfer the value from the first text
box to this number one so I will say num
1 is equal to so num 1 is equal to and
then whenever we take the value from the
text box we need to convert it this
value in to the integer right from the
text box we are going to get the value
as a text and we need to convert this
value in the integer so how can convert
this text to integer you need to pass it
so you can just write integer dot parse
int and this can take a string so what
you get from the first text box you can
transfer it inside this pass it as
argument so our first text box name is
let us see what is the name of our first
text box text field num1 right go to the
source code and inside this parse int
argument I can write text field num1 dot
get text right because we are getting
the text okay in the same way we will
transfer the value from the second text
box text box field a num2 to the num2
variable right integer the path length
and this will be text field
num2 okay now once we have our values
from the text box in these two variables
we can add these two numbers so we can
write answer is equal to num1 plus num2
right and we can show this answer to the
third text box which was this text box
this text box right so we can say the
text box field I will change the text
box field variable name as a NS text
fault peel ans so we know that it is
answer text field and then in our code
what we can write we can take the name
of this text box field a and s dot set
text set text
and we are going to set this number in
this field right so what we are going to
do is we can just transfer our answer
which is this one a and s answer
variable to the argument for set fixed
right so as an argument for set text in
here
and this will show this error because it
is not our text right it's a integer and
we need to convert this text to this
integer to text right so to convert this
integer to text what we need to do here
in the text box field answer dot set
text first we need to convert this
answer to text field so we will do it
like this this is an integer so we will
write integer dot to string just write
to string and this will take this answer
integer okay as an argument here like
this so our code for addition will look
like this this is our code first we have
taken the value from the first text box
to the number one variable same we have
done for number two variable we added
these two variable and transferred the
value to the text box as an answer same
we will do for the subtraction button
which is minus button right double click
this and in this extra actionperformed
of this button I will just copy this
code which I have written in the last
action perform of this add button and
paste it into the action perform of
minus button and the only change will be
this this will be now - right and then
it will work
the only thing you may need to consider
is this exception II it's showing
duplicate parameter e you can name it as
e 1 so that this e and this e does not
clashes ok now we are going to run our
program compile it and run it and
hopefully it will not give any error
okay so it's not giving any error and
for example I want to add 5 5 5 &amp;amp; 6 6 6
not this one but 6 6 6 right and I want
to add them the answer is 1 2 2 1 right
for example I want to subtract them the
answer is minus 1 1 1 right I can do it
some other values or I can just give
some value which is not integer for
example some word or some letter and let
us click this answer button it shows
please enter
valid number because we have added this
try-catch block and this is catching any
error if we if the user enters any
invalid number ok so this is how you can
create a simple calculator using your
window builder in Eclipse using Java I
