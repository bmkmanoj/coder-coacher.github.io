second tutorial on how to save the image
into your database and retrieved your
image into your Jeffrey so in the last
video I have shown you how to add the
image into your ma s to light manager
and we added two pictures also in our
database and now I will tell you how to
replace that picture so first of all
what you have to do is go to the palette
and take a desktop bean from here it's
not necessary to take text of pain but I
am taking it because sometimes the
pictures have different sizes and it can
make your jframe structure shape
different for different size images so I
will take one next of pain so the
picture you will add will only be
restricted to your text of pain and it
will not stretch on to your je plane and
then in text of pain I will drag unable
and place it in the text of pain and
make it a little bit bigger
and now I will go to my source code and
at the bottom of my program I will
declare variable so it's very image by
weight
image icon I will name the variable has
format for example is equal to is equal
to initial checked as null so first of
all I need to declare this variable
image icon and I will name my image icon
variable as form it okay and then first
of all for example when I press the
button my image must be shown in my next
of paint so first of all I mean make a
program for when you press that button
then image will appear here and after
that we will modify our program as per
our requirements
we name it as image and right click
action action perform in the action to
fall make a try-catch block so I've made
a try-catch block first of all and in
the catch
just try it exception e and e dot print
stake trace you have to write this and
then in here inside your climb block
height or declare your SQL query string
is equal to and inside this I'm gonna
write select a variable name for image
is image this is my variable name in
image column so I'll write it here
select image from whatever my table name
is so my people name is employee info
a copy here right from where
so for example I want to see the image
for employee ID one okay so what I'm in
right here is where my ID is equal to 1
okay
now in the second line right connections
PST is equal to gone dot statement and
in the prepared statement write SQL and
after that write s is equal to e st dot
execute query and then write if
if statement block and a condition I
will write are s dot next
and inside your f condition right by and
then square brackets and then image data
so this is the variable name image water
which has bite data type and then right
RS dot get by it
and close with with semicolon and in
here in eight bytes bracket you have to
write your column name of your image so
my image column name is image only here
you can see my column name of images is
image so I paste it here and then write
permit format which is the variable name
I have declared at the bottom earlier so
like this and then new I can make
internal rocket rows and copy your byte
data variable which is image data and
paste test inside image records okay and
then go to your tape frame copy the
variable name of your label so I will
name it as image the label name this is
not the name variable name of next open
this is the name of my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
