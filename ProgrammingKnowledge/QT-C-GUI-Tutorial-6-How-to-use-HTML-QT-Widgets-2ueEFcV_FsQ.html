video I will show you how to use HTML
with your QT widgets for example in the
second video I have shown you this code
so let me run this code first so it's
building here first it will build and
now it's running so when I click this OK
button it sets some text on my label so
what I can do is let I can right click
once again I can go to go slots clicks
lot and I reach to the code here so this
was a simple code I have shown you in
the second video instead of showing a
simple text in the label I can show HTML
text for example I want to show
something like this so I open my notepad
I have this simple HTML code which here
which is showing two line first line is
bold second line is normal so the output
of this code is like this
two with T underlined and lines with
line normal and to bold so i copy the
same code from here the whole code this
is a simple code you can use any HTML
code go to my push button click event
and instead of this text which we were
setting to the label I can just paste my
HTML code here okay like this and now
when I build my program save all and
it's building and it's built and when I
click this
okay button you see there are two lines
so it recognizes my it recognizes my
HTML code so the C++ widgets are HTML
aware that's what I wanted to show you
in this video and you can also double
click this and show the same code of
paste the same HTML code here and when
you click somewhere else you can see
that it's showing your HTML code and
it's in its interpreting your HTML and
it's showing the output in your label
the second example could be for example
you want to you show the table in your
label right so you can do that also very
simple so you just go to your HTML
editor you just delete this text and
instead of this I can write the code for
the table so you can find code for table
HTML code for table anywhere on the
Internet
I save my text I see the output and the
output is this table so I copy this code
for the table and I can go to my cute
creator go to this label double click it
and this is the source so I can instead
of this two line code I can paste my
table code here and I can click OK
and now it's showing table in my label
so the what I want to show you by this
tutorial is these widgets
our HTML aware so if you want to design
your application with good-looking
widgets then you can use HTML also so I
hope you have understood the concept of
using as HTML and keep watching this
