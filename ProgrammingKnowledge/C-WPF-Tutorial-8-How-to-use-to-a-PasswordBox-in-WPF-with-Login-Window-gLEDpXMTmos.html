shown you how to make a simple login
page with the help of your WPF
application and SQLite database so I
have this main window in which I can
enter my username and password and when
I press this login button it gives me
some message whether my password is
correct or not right so in this video I
will show you because this is a password
field and you don't want to show your
password to the other users or to the
world so you need something like these
kind of password and right now when you
type your password it's like this so in
this video I will show you how to set
this field as a password so it will only
take these kind of stars or something
whatever you set so if you have followed
my windows form application for c-sharp
tutorial it's a little bit different
from that so just see how it's done in
WPF so now I have this form here and its
name here the textbox name of this
password field is text password here so
what I am going to do is I will copy
this name as it is and I will delete
this text box from here and what I will
do is I will go to my type tool box and
in this WPF application there is a
special box for the password field so
just go scroll and find this password
box from here and I will drag and drop
into my main window here
once again and now I will give this
password box the same name as my
previous password box name is so its
name is now text password okay
so in this way it will not show the
error in this code where we have used
that password text box name so just copy
this text box name and drag and drop a
password box from your tool box which is
below this menu item so just drag and
drop here and then just run your program
so I will just run my program it's
showing me some error why let's see so
here in the error it shows that this
password box does not contain the
definition for this text so what I will
do is I will go to the login button
event and I will see four there and
right away you can see this password dot
text is showing me error because this is
a password box and this is a text box so
with text box it the dot text can work
but with password box the text extension
will not work so what you need to do is
just delete this text and write password
dot password here so text password dot
password instead of this dot text just
change it like dot password and now when
I run my program and I will just enter
my username and password and you can see
your password field is looking like this
which looks like it's taking in the real
password you can change
this character right now it's set as
this dot symbol and you can change this
character also so just go to your main
form main window dot XAML file and just
select your password password box and go
here and go to the properties and search
for the password care so this is the
password care here and right now it's
set as dot you can set it like for
example this dollar sign and when you
run it now and now when you enter your
password any password no it's not
showing why let's see because I think my
password is not set here correctly yes
you see here password care is not
changed so I need to change it I will
just give dollar sign once again and
press Enter and hopefully this time it
will work let's see and I write my
username and I write my password yes now
it's working so you can change this
character also according to your
convenience so this is also very nice
feature of this password walk box and
here you can play with more properties
you can change lot of properties from
here you can change the color text
anything so just play with it and you
will be good to go so I hope you have
