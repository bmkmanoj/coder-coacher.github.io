last video I've shown you how you can
add it or update data in your Microsoft
Access database using your Visual Studio
C shop windows form application now in
this video I am going to show you how
you can delete your data from the
database using your C shop windows form
application in the earlier two videos I
have shown you how to save that and how
to add it data so let's add a new button
here to delete the data and I will
resize it and I will change text of this
button s delete and the name of the
button as this button name as PT and
underscore delete okay and let's change
the font size also so font 460 okay
so now when we have the button what I'm
going to do is I will just select my
Save button ODS added button you can
choose either one of them and just take
the code from here from either one of
these button click event save button
click event or add button click event
because we are going to use the same
code just Freddy will change so I will
double click this delete button and once
again I will paste this code in here and
this code I think you must know by now
that what this code is doing with this
is opening the connection with the
database and then we create a command
they give the connection to the command
and then we create a query and then we
pass this query to this command and this
this line will execute your query and
any error occurs this will be catch in
this try-catch block right so if you
still do not understand how this is
happening then you need to watch my
earlier videos okay
so let's build the query to delete the
data from the database so now we have
this query to delete the database so
this query will be delete delete from
your table name so your table name my
table name is employee data so I will
write employee data and then just right
where so we want to tell the database
where we want to delete our daughter so
we use pair clause for that we're aii is
equal to then give these double quotes
and in between give these two plus sign
and then here we will give just the name
of our employee ID text box okay so this
is my employee ID and on the basis of my
employee ID I want to delete the data in
the database right so I will just copy
the name of my employee text box
employee ID text box and I will just
write dot text so this will be my query
delete from my table name which is
employ data where your column name on
the basis of which you want to delete
the data and then the value which you
want to pass to your column
on the basis of which you want to delete
the data and I will change this message
as data deleted for example okay so I
will run the program once again and I
hope no error occurs I will give
username and password it goes to the
second form and let's see what Kippy can
delete for example I want to delete the
data for employee ID 60 this data okay
so let's give here 16 and you don't even
need to give all the other fields
because we are deleting on the basis of
employee ID right so just give the
employee ID and just click delete and
you see dot are deleted and once you go
to your a Access database
you see it's deleted you can refresh it
and now you have only 15 employees you
can delete employee ID 15 also so I will
write 15 and just click delete dot are
deleted once you go to the database and
refresh your data you see your data is
deleted so in this way you can delete
your data using c-sharp windows form
application in your Microsoft Access
database I hope you have enjoyed this
