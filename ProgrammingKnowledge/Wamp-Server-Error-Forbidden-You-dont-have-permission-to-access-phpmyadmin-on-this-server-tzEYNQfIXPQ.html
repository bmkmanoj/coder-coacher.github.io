you can solve this web server error
which says forbidden you don't have
permission to access PHP myadmin
on this server I am running a web server
on a virtual machine and I want to
access this PHP myadmin from my host
machine and this gives me this error it
can give this error on the localhost
also or on the host on which your server
is installed and the solution will be
the same so how to solve this problem so
to solve this problem you need to locate
this folder called a vamp and generally
you can find this folder inside your C
disk so go to your local disk which is C
and just locate the folder called vamp
here and then search for the folder
called Elias ok so just open this Elias
folder and then open this Khan file
which is PHP my admin so just select
this file and open it and now this PHP
myadmin file is open right now in here
you will be able to find this directory
element and there is a little
information here also which will help
you to solve this problem and this
information says to give access to PHP
myadmin from outside replace the lines
require local by require all granted so
you need to replace this line here
require local by require all granted so
just replace this local by all granted
which is this line okay so just replace
this by this line and now save your a
PHP myadmin conf i'll and then restart
your web server once again so just go to
web server and then just click restart
all services ok and once this icon goes
green once again try to refresh your web
page
so my icon is green now and now I will
refresh this page once again which is
giving this error and now I can see this
PHP myadmin here okay so in this way you
can solve this error which says
forbidden you don't have permission to
access PHP myadmin
on this server so I hope you have
