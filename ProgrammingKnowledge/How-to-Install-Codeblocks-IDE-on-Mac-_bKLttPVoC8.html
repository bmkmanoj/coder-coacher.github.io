you how you can download and install
code blocks on your Manco operating
system so let's get started and let's
see how we can download and install code
blocks on our Mac operating system so
first of all before installing code
blocks you need to have Xcode installed
on your Mac operating system and how you
can install Xcode just need to go to App
Store here so just click on App Store
and then once App Store is open you just
need to search for Xcode and then press
Enter and the first option here you can
see is the Xcode now for installing
Xcode you need to have your Apple ID and
Apple account and then once you have
that Apple ID using that you will be
able to see install a button here
instead of update because I have already
installed Xcode on my system so I can
see update but if it's not installed you
will be able to see install button here
so you just need to click install and
then Xcode will be installed on our
system now if you have any problem in
installing Xcode I have already made a
video for installing Xcode so I will
just provide the link in the description
to install Xcode and then you can watch
that video and then install Xcode so
once you have Xcode on your system then
you just need to open your favorite
browser and search for code blocks and
the first website which will appear here
will be from code blocks dot o-r-g so we
are going to click on that link and then
we can directly click on downloads and
here you will be able to see different
kind of downloads right so we want the
download of the binary release so we are
going to choose the first option which
says download the binary release and
once you click that link you will be
redirected to this page now here you
just need to choose Mac OSX and here you
will be able to see this option
and you just need to click on this
option we'd say so swatch dotnet so I'm
going to just click on this option which
is going to start the download of the
zip file so just agree and proceed and
then this is going to start the download
of this zip file so this zip file is
around 20 megabytes so it will be
downloaded really fast
and once it's downloaded we are going to
open it and then we are going to just
extract the code blocks into our
Applications folder so now this zip file
is downloaded so I'm going to double
click on this zip file which is going to
open this archive utility and you will
be able to see this extracted claude
blocks on your folder explorer so you
can see this code blocks option here so
what you need to do is you just need to
open once again one more instance of
finder window and then you can just open
the applications directory here so just
click on this option
it says applications and then drag and
drop this code block icon inside your
applications ok so it's going to be
copied and pasted inside your
Applications folder and once you have
this you can directly click on this code
block option from here or you can just
go to launch pad and at the bottom you
will be able to see this eigen code
blocks you get you just need to click on
this code blocks icon and once you click
on this code blocks icon it's going to
show code blocks can be opened because
it is from unidentified developer so to
solve this problem I am going to just
click OK for now and then I'm going to
just choose my system preferences so I'm
going to open my system preferences I
will just click on Apple here Apple
and then I'm going to just click on this
option which says System Preferences and
once the System Preferences opens what I
need to do is I need to go to the
security and privacy options to just
click on this option and under security
and privacy what you need to do is you
just need to first of all authenticate
by clicking on this lock here so just
click on this lock and then just give
your max password and once you
authenticate you will be able to see
this option
it says app store and identify developer
and others say is App Store right so we
just need to click this option you can
see code blocks was blocked from opening
because it is not from identified
developer so we just need to click this
option which says open anyway and then
it's going to allow us to open road
blocks and you can see code blocks is
now opened and once again it's going to
show us this option are you sure you
want to open it we are going to just say
open and I'm going to minimize this
system preferences and for the first
time when code blocks opens is going to
find out the compilers which are
installed on your Mac operating system
so by default on my micro operating
system GNU GCC compiler is detected and
llbmc lang compiler is detected so I
will leave everything as default for now
which is GNU GCC compiler for me but
whatever is default for you you you just
need to leave it as it is and then click
OK and you can see and now this code
blocks IDE is opened on our Mac
operating system so let's create a
project so I'm going to just click on
file here and then I'm going to go to
new and then I will say a project and
from here I'm going to choose
the console application and let me see
the other options also you can see the
other options but for now I would just
want to choose the console application
and then I will say go and then I will
just click Next and then I will choose
C++ or if you want to choose the C
program if you want to make the C
program then you can choose the C
program I just want to make the C++
program so I'm going to choose C++ and
click Next and then in here you just
need to give the project title I will
just say hello world and then in which
folder you want to save this hello world
project so I'm going to just choose the
folder in which I want to save this
project so I want to save it into my
workspace folder inside My Documents
folder but you are free to choose any
location wherever you want to save the
project
right and then I'm going to click Next
and you can see compiler is GCC compiler
which is OK for us everything is okay
I'm going to click finish this is going
to create a hello world project for us
and you can see on the source folder we
have main dot CPP file and here the
sample code is provided for us so we
just need to build this program and then
run it so I'm going to choose this
option which says build or you can build
from here also at the top and then
choose the build option and this is
going to build your hello world project
and once it's compiled successful you
can see this project is compiled
successfully inside this build log and
once it's compiled successfully you can
just press this green button it's going
to run your program and I have pressed
the screen button and you can see it
prints hello world on the console so
it's opens the console for us and then
it prints hello world right and when you
press any Enter button or any button
it's going to exit
out of this code okay so you can just
close this terminal and that's how you
can compile and run your C++ program and
similarly you can run your C programs so
in this way you can download and install
code blocks on your Mac operating system
