MongoDB database tutorial for beginners
in the last video we have seen how we
can create a database and drop a
database using MongoDB and Mongo chef
tool right in this video we will see how
we can create a collection and how we
can drop a collection in MongoDB so
let's get started
we will start by creating a new database
which I am going to name it as my DB
because if you remember in the last
video I have shown you how to drop a
database and in that process we have
already dropped our database and I will
press this button and it's going to
create the database and it will switch
the current database to my DB now to
create a collection you need to use this
command we have several commands to
create a collection the first is DB dot
create collection ok so just write DB
dot create collection and if you can see
here in the intellisense this create
collection takes two argument one is the
name of the collection and other is the
options but for now we are only going to
use the name the options we are going to
see a little bit later right
so just give the name of your collection
for example my collection and then close
the bracket and execute this query that
says ok 1 so that means our collection
is created right now to see the
collection you just need to write show
collections and just execute it and you
can see right now we have one collection
named my collection in the current
database right now the second way of
creating a collection is we have seen in
the last video so we can create a
collection for example I want to create
a collection and the name of the
collection are one
to give as for example my collection or
my collection - okay so my collection -
and then dot insert and in the insert we
have seen in the last video we can give
a jason in a key value pair for example
for example once again the name and the
value of the name for example some name
max okay and execute the query and it's
executed successfully and we are going
to give the query show collections once
again and it gives my collection and my
collection - so now we have two
collections right now this query or this
command what is going to do is is going
to create the collection if the
collection is not present and if the
collection is already present then it's
going to use that collection and then
insert this document in that collection
right so if it's not present created if
it's present then insert into it right
now to drop a collection what we need to
do is we need to use once again at this
DB command and then your collection name
for example we want to drop our first
collection which is called my collection
and then you give this command dot drop
so just write dot drop and it's going to
drop this collection so let's hit this
query and then it says true which means
that our command is successful and then
once again we will just show the
collections and now we have only one
collection right and if you want to
remove this collection also you can just
give the command once again T V dot my
collection - which is the name of second
collection not drop and execute this
command and it says true once again you
give the shoe collection commands and
now we have new collections so in this
way you can create collection and drop
collection in MongoDB I hope you've
