show you how to search data in the
database or new J table and show it into
a peg fee for example in a company you
have so many employees and in your
database you have to enter so many
employees data and you want to see
employee X data for his employee ID name
and all the things which is related to
him so you cannot go into the table and
search for his name you just want to
enter something in the search text field
like in Google and just wanted to see
the information so let's get started how
to do that first take text field drag it
into your jframe make it a little bit
bigger
change its variable name as the XD next
research and now right-click the text
field go to event and even go to key and
key released okay so you will directly
go into the method and the method just
first of all make try-catch block
already make one try catch block in
order to save time and then in the
bycatch block this white string sqm we
always write miss string spelling is
like an updated string s k is equal to
so in the string Expo we have to write a
query it will light up when select star
from our database table name database
table name is my enforce just paste it
here
and after that you will write where
whatever fee on the basis of which you
want to search for example you want to
add the name into the search field and
you want to see his whole data so just
write the name and then question mark
Turner
query is done select star from employee
and for where name is equal to because
we want to search on the basis of name
now we will write PST is equal to from
not prepared statement
and in preparedstatement right one one
and here you should write because we are
searching on the base of names and just
copy in the variable name of name text
field and paste it here dot get text
okay just do it
PST PST is capital and small
oh I did a mistake this thing I have to
write in here
PSD not accept such string this one
comma text feeling don't get text to
write here and in here
PST is equal to con not prepared step in
you type just SQL we have written these
two statement and then write is not in
there is execute now this is equal to p
st dot execute query
right that and ultimate right if if
above query is true then in if block
right s dot next if our s dot next then
declare over Emma College spring
limiters 1 equal to R s dot get string
and in here what data you want to show
from your database table so whenever I
enter the name I want to see employee ID
name surname and age so just copy
employee ID first of all we want to see
employee ID so write it here
and then
want to set down value so take this take
its name and you will name text my ID
paste it here dot set next insect angle
stand in the bracket of such subtext you
need to paste this ad okay so this you
have to do it for powerful for feeds I'm
just copying and pasting four times to
save time and just copy the variable
names only when you do name is extreme
in paste it here Sony will hit me name
is text
to
so you have to change all the force
variable name of text we have to change
this also and the two-headed three and
four years and two three and four and in
here after employee-id want to see his
name because we have name in concern
name in our database and then here the
age so waited here name
Sonne
each right so I think a program is
already to search let's run the program
in here and right my example I want to
search for Paul right
something went wrong so let's see what
went wrong I think I've pasted the wrong
text field name here we have to copy the
name of our search field which is text
search and paste it here so PST is evil
conduct proper statement SQL after the
PST dots a string 1 comma whatever is
your search field name you have to paste
it here dot get text let's try to run
the program once again once again trying
to search ball and we can see the dot of
ball now such one Jean we can see in dot
of John search for bam
we can see the knot off bang so in this
way you can search your data in the
search field that was the tutorial
search I hope you have enjoyed the
tutorial and learned a lot please rate
