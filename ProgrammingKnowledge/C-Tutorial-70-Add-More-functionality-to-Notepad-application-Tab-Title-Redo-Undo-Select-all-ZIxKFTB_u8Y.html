last three videos I have been showing
you how to make a tabbed notepad with
the help of c-sharp windows form
application so till now I have added new
tab functionality so it can add a new
tab it can open any text file in your
tabs it can also save it it can cut copy
or paste and in this video I will add
some more functionalities for example
when I select this tab and when I open
the file my file is opened here but the
name of the tab doesn't changes
according to the file name so that I
will I will show you how to change this
name according to the file name same is
with this save file and I save this file
with any name some name dot txt this
this name should come on the title of
the tab this here but it doesn't come so
this also I will show you and plus I
will add some more functionalities here
in the menu strip so let's see first of
all we will add the functionality
through the Open button so that it
displays the file name on the tab title
so I will just go to this open but my
new strip button and double click it and
this code we have written in the last
videos for notepad so in video number 67
68 and 69 I have been showing you this
how
so 68 or 69 I have shown you this code
now I want to show the file title also
so what I will do is I will go inside
this if condition here and in here what
I will do is I will just copy the name
of my tab control so my trap control
name is tab control 1 once again to the
code and in this if condition for the
open button click event paste your tab
control name dot selected tab dot text
is equal to path and in the bracket we
will pass the path
so after this path we just need to write
dot get file name yes and in here we
will pass the path of the file so I will
copy the name of my opened a file dialog
variable dot file name ok so it will
give me the file name not the whole path
but the file name on the top of my tab
control title so let's see how it works
so if you add this line just run the
code and now we will add one more tab
and we will add or open a text file so I
have this text file I open it and you
will see that text file is open and the
name of the text file is also
represented here on the tab
title so this I wanted to show so now it
can show the title same I want to do it
with the same button also so what I will
do is I will copy the same code from
here I will go to the form click File
menu strip and double click the Save
button and in here I have written the
same dialogue button in the video number
67 and 68 so I will go into this using
condition here I will paste my code the
same code the tab control name dot
selected tab dot text is equal to path
dot gate file and instead of this Open
File dialog name I will just copy and
paste this save file dialog name so see
a file dialog and paste it here and now
when I run the program and I opened a
new tab and I write something inside
this some text and I want to save this
text now so I will click this file save
and I will name this file as YouTube dot
txt file ok so I will click Save and my
file is also saved and the title of the
file is also come here so I just wanted
to show this title here also so now this
title appears here so that's what I
wanted to do so this is the same
functionality as a notepad one more one
more
not one but more functionality I want to
add here in added menu strip
so first of all I will add a separator
and in here I want to add a menu item
and sorry menu item
so this menu item I want to name it as
select all all and in here I want to add
undo and in the next I want to add redo
and in the next here I want to add
separator and once again I want to add a
new item sorry
yeah and in the menu items I want to add
clear and undo clear
okay so I want to add these
functionality also him added a new
strips first of all and we will add this
select all functionality double click it
and we will reach to this select all
button click event and in the video
number 67 I have shown you how to make
this get rich text box function so go
there and copy this get rich text box so
function name and once again go to form
select item double click select all
sorry so select all double click here ok
and paste your function name you get
rich text box name dot select
all and break it and break it close and
now we will add more functionality so
for undo just paste your function name
once again dot undo and break it will
break it closed same I will do for we do
dot redo crank it and break it closed
and say my we do fuck here double
clicked here dot clear like it mean
bracket closed and the same I will do
for undo clear so double click and dot
undo so clear undo this one not here but
like Adam bracket close so now all the
functionalities will work so let's run
the program and first of all new and I
will add some text here and we'll add
some new function here first of all I
will I want to select all so I will go
to my edit I will press select all and
all this will be selected once again go
here and select all all this text will
be selected now I want to for example I
will delete this text and I want to do
undo so I will go edit and go undo so it
will come back and when I press redo it
will go back it's gone
when I click clear all the file will
clear so clear and file will clear and
when I click undo clear they should come
but this is not coming I don't know why
so I will look at it and you can also
look at it and correct it so in this way
you can add more functionalities to your
notepad I hope you have enjoyed this
