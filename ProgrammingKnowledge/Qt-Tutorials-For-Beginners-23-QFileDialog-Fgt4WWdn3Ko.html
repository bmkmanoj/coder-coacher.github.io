cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can use queue
while dialogue class in QT the queue
file dialog class provides a dialog that
allows user to select files or
directories so it will allow you to
choose a file or directory so for
example when I go to file here and when
I say open file a project and it will
give me this kind of file dialog right
and this is the function of queue file
dialog so it will open this kind of file
dialog using which you can choose your
file or directory right so let's get
started I have created this sample
project called queue file dialog demo
and first of all I will go to my main
window dot UI file and I will drag and
drop a button here that's all we need
for this tutorial and then what I'm
going to do is I will say open file for
example okay and I will just right click
on it and then go to slot and it's like
clicked and click OK now in here in
order to use queue file dialogue
obviously we need to provide the header
for the queue file dialog right so let's
include it so just write include and
then just write queue file dialog okay
so this is the one we need okay so the
easiest way to create a queue file
dialog is to use a static function
called get open file name ok so what we
are going to do is we will first of all
create a queue string variables to just
write Q string and then it will return
us the file name with the path so just
write file name for example here is
equal to Q file dialog and then we will
call a static function called get open
file name so just write open file name
and then it takes a few argument first
argument is the parent class which is
this it
self second argument is the caption or
the title which you want to show on the
open file dialog for example open file
right this is the title this will be the
title right the third argument is the
home directory for your file dialog so
whatever directory you will provide here
it will open for the first time right so
for example we can provide here C colon
slash and it will open a C directory for
the first time something like this ok
and then the last argument is the filter
but we will see it in a little while but
these are the few basic items saw which
it requires or these are the few basic
argument which it requires right and
then we can use a message box to show
the file path so just right queue
message box and then you can just take
this message box and then you can say
information this and the title I will
not give any title and the third
argument is the message so let's print
the filename which it returns okay
something like this so let's run the
program and let's see what happens when
we run it so when it runs we will be
able to see when we press the button
that it will open C folder hopefully so
I will just click this open button and
it opens the C folder which I have
provided here you see here it says ok
because I haven't selected any file but
I want to show you here that I have
provided the default home directory
which is C that's why it was showing me
the C folder when I press the button
like this right now you can browse
anywhere and choose any file for example
I am going to choose a text file and
then I will click open
and then it shows me the part of this
file which is C colon slash hacks logs
dot txt right
the second way of providing the home
directory is you can just use a q dair
class which we have seen in the previous
video so just include first of all q dir
and then you can use this q dair class
to you know call the home path so you
can just write q there and then just
call home path something like this and
then when you run the app and when you
press the button let's see what happens
so when I click this open file it's
going to open the home directory of your
computer in my case it's programming
knowledge right so you can do something
like that and it will return you the
file path right now in the previous
video I have shown you how you can use Q
file demo right and I have shown you how
you can you know create a file and write
into it and how you can read a file okay
so I will go to that example now which I
have shown you in the previous videos if
you don't know how to how I have created
that this Q file
you know demo you can see the last you
know video okay
and in here for example I will just
choose it as active project so just
right click on it and set it as active
project and when I run it I will show
you once again what I have done in the
last video so when I click read here
it's going to read the file which I have
provided by default here so in here in
the main window dot CPP file I was
providing this static path here and for
example now what I want to do is I want
to you know choose the file dynamically
so I can do it using this Q file dialog
right so in here in the read button in
the last video I will just right click
and go to slot
and goto clicked here and I am in the
you know button click event and this was
the code I have written last time right
and what it was doing is I have provided
this static path here and using this
static path it was reading this file
which was my file dot txt but now what I
want is instead of this static path I
want to provide this path dynamically
using cue file dialog right so what I
can do here is once again I can first of
all I need to include this cue file
dialog class so I will just include it
so just include cue file dialogue just
choose this option and then just create
an object here right so I will just
write Q string which will it which it
will return and then the file name so
just write file name is equal to Q file
dialogue and then call a method called a
get open file right so get open file
name right and then the first argument
is the parent second argument is the
title for example open a file and the
third argument is the home directory for
example so I will just choose for
example the C directory once again so I
will just choose C directory C colon
slash slash something like this right
and it will return the path of the file
which I will choose and instead of this
I can just path this Q string here right
so I don't have to give it statically I
can just choose it from the Open File
dialog and I can use it now when I run
the program and once it's running and
when I click this read button here it
will give me this kind of interface and
whatever file I will choose here it will
reread it so for example I will choose
this hex log dot txt file and I will
click open and it reads this
while the content of this file right now
for example I want to read the CPP file
so I will just copy the part of the file
I will just open the location and I will
just copy the parts from here and in my
app which I'm using I will just click
read button once again I will just give
the part here and I will choose this
main dot main window dot CPP file and
click open
and it reads the content of this file
also right now one last thing I want to
show here is the filter argument so when
I click this read the button you can see
there is no filter provided here for
example I want to just show the user the
text file or only the PDF files or only
the you know image files right so how we
can apply the filter let's see so I will
just go to my code here and in here in
the Declaration of Q file dialog get
open file we have three argument here
and the fourth argument is the filter it
takes right so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to define a Q string once
again so just to find a Q string and I
will name it as a filter for example
okay and here you can provide different
kind of filters to your you know Q file
dialog so for example first filter you
want to provide is all files so I will
just say all files and then you just
need to give a bracket and in the
bracket you just need to give the
wildcard extension which you want to
show so Astrix is the wild-card and then
dot the last part of the file for
example when you show this filter it
will show you each and every file
extension Asterix means the wild card
here so it can search for every file
extension right now if you want to
provide different kind of filters
some more filters for example what you
can do is you can provide two semicolons
and then you can provide the next filter
for example this time you want to
provide the text file filter so just
write text file and then in the bracket
you will give the filter so this time I
will just say Astrix dot txt or the text
file this is the filter for the text
file right now for example I want to
show the filter for some more kind of
file I can just give the two semicolons
and this time for example I want to just
filter for the XML file so I will just
say XML files and then in the bracket I
will just say Astrix dot XML right so in
the same way you can define any number
of filters you want and then just
provide this last argument here as a
fourth argument of this get open file
dialog name and when you run your
program your filter will be applied
hopefully so when I click this read
button now you have this filter all
files then text file then XML file so
all file will show you each and every
folder here but when I choose text file
then it will just show me the text file
you can see folders and only the text
file the extension will be dot txt and
no other file extensions right and when
I choose this XML file it will only show
me the XML extension so this folder
doesn't contain any XML files so that's
why there is no file shown here right so
in this way you can also provide the
filter to your files so this is how you
can use open file dialog in QT I hope
