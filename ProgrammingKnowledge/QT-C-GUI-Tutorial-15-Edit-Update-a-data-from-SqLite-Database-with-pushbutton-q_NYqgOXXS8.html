last video I have shown you how to save
your data in the SQLite database using
your C++ Beauty GUI application in this
video I will show you how to edit your
data in the database so I have this data
in the database for example and I want
to change the age of employee ID one
mark for example his age is right now 33
and for some reason I miss interpreted
his age and I want to change his age for
example 43 here so how can I add it my
data in the database using my QT
application I will show you this in this
video so what I will do is I will take a
push button here I will rename this push
button so I will name it as push button
underscore add it and I will also change
the label or text of this button which
should be update for example and let me
change the font a little so that it's
visible okay so this is our update
button and I will just right click this
button and I will click go to slot as I
will select clicked function from here
and click OK and I reach to the push
button added clicked event here and if
you have seen my last video in which I
have shown you how to save your data in
the database using your Qt GUI
application I am going to use the same
code from the last video in order to
save time so what I will do is I will go
to my
form I will select my save button I will
just right click it go to slot click OK
and I will clock copy all the code from
my Save button click event all the code
I will copy and paste it here in the
push button added click event face the
same code and in here we are going to
change two things one is the query and
one is the message so let's edit the
code so I will delete the query but
because this was for the saving data
into the database and I will write the
new query here so in this code where you
have written query dot prepare statement
inside the brackets we will write a new
query so for editing the data we will
write the query update your info so what
update your table name so what is my
table name here where is my database
here is my database okay so my database
table name is employee info so I will
copy it and I will paste it here so my
body is update my table name and then I
will write set and then in the last
video if you have seen I am taking the
values which I am entering in the text
boxes into these string variables eeew
be name surname and age which are these
string variable QT q string variables
and here I will write first of all the
column name
in which I want to edit the data so
column name is Eid names her name and
age okay so I will write the column name
first first column name is Eid is equal
to then the value I want to show or save
new value whatever I want to save the
value so I will write e ID then single
quote and inside this double quote and
inside plus plus and I will pass this
employee ID string here which I am
taking from the textbox same thing I
will do it for name surname and age also
so second is name is equal to single
quote double quotes + + + and past the
same name string here comma surname is
equal to single quotes and double quotes
plus + and the surname and last is the
age so age is equal to single code then
double quote not plus plus but double
quote plus plus and my string age
variable copy this string age variable
pass it here and our query is complete
so what I have written my query update
your table name then set turn your
column name in which you want to set the
value is equal to the value you want to
set okay PID is equal to the value you
want set the name surname and age same
thing you should do for all the four
columns and then if your call query
executes then you want to change this
message now your message should be
add it this is the title and this should
be updated or whatever you want to show
the message here in the message box so
this is mostly the code from the last
video what I have done is I have changed
the query and I have changed the message
which I want to show let's try and run
the program and see whether I should be
able to edit my code or not so save all
build the code and run the code and let
me open the database also here is my
database and it's building let's see
yeah my application is running now and
first of all login ID and username so
login and I come to the second page and
for example I want to show the data of
this employee ID 1 so I am not happy
with the age of this employee ID which
is 33 right now I want to change his age
so what I will do is employee ID 1 his
name is Mark so I will let it be and his
surname is Henry and his age instead of
33 I want to change it to 44 for example
ok now the new age is 44 and now I will
click this button update so I will click
it and you see here it's showing me
primary key must be unique and it's
unable to fetch the row so let's see
what is the error so
showing me error so let's check what I
have missed maybe in the query so I have
my query update my table name set all
the values but I think I should add here
because it doesn't know where to set
these values right so I should give more
one more condition after your query and
ends here after setting every value and
go at the last and right here where your
Eid which is employee ID which is also
your primary key just copy this employee
ID is equal to single quote double quote
and just after where just paste it here
so now it should know where to set the
values right earlier what we are doing
is we are setting the values but where
we are setting the values the program
doesn't know so I added this one more
Clause where he I D which is employee ID
which is my primary key is equal to
whatever I am entering in my line edit
and now let's run the program once again
go to database and let's check if it
will run or not give the username and
password and I just want to change them
that of employee ID one so I will write
e ID one first of all so name surname is
Henry
and the name is mark and the age instead
of 33 I am writing 43 for example and I
will click update' button and now it's
updated so there is no advert here and
when i refresh my database right now is
33 and when i refresh my database you
see here the data of mark is changed and
by mystic I think I have entered the
name Marga wrong it's Emmy ma ek
something else because here the name is
name I entered is also wrong so mark
henry updated once again and just
refresh the start of it and just see
here it's updating the database so in
this way you can update the database
using your QT c++ cui application and
SQLite database I hope you have enjoyed
