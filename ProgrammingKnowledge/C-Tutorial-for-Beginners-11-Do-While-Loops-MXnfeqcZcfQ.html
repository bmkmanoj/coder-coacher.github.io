last video I've shown you how to use
while loops in C++ now in this video I
am going to show you how to use do-while
loop in C++ so what is the basic
difference between while loop and
do-while loop the basic difference
between two while loop and while loop is
while loop if the condition is false and
if the condition is not met it will not
execute but the do-while loop it will
execute at least once even if the
condition is not true so let me show you
the demonstration this is the code I
have written in the last video this is a
simple code in which I have X is equal
to 1 number is equal to 0 and sum is
equal to 0 I have in each like 3
variables and in the while loop I am
checking whether the value of x is less
than or equal to 5 and if it's less than
or equal to 5
I ask the user to enter some number and
I make the sum of these number and once
the condition is fulfilled and the user
has entered the value 5 times in the
while loop then I print the sum so if
you don't remember you see the last
video it's very simple so let's say I
want to convert this into the do-while
loop so for example let's take an
example of while loop first so what this
is doing is when the condition is true
it's printing the message but the if
condition is not true for example X is
less than 1 which is not true X is equal
to 1 so which is not less than 1 this
will not pray execute it this code will
not be executed and the sum will remain
0 because we have initialized to sum as
0 so let's build it and run the program
and you see the sum ratio and this is
never executed right now for
example if we write the same code with
do-while loop what is the syntax of
do-while loop is just cut this while
loop from here and paste it after this
curly braces and just try to do above
this is the syntax of qi loop and do not
forget to give this semicolon here so
this is the simple syntax of do-while
loop
okay so now even if the condition is
false
our program is will be executed once
because it says do this while this
condition is met so it will be executed
once and then the program will check ok
this condition will not met so once
again it will not be you or it will not
execute the same so let's run the
program once again or execute the
program once again and run it and you
see the program is executed in put any
value which is this so it goes inside
the loop and I give any value 56 and
press ENTER and gives me the sum 56 okay
so it gives me the sum 56 right so that
means the program is executed at least
one even if the condition is not really
true so this is the basic difference
between two while loop so now the
question you may ask is where we can use
to buy loop because the condition is
false why do we want to execute this
code right so I will give you a very
good example of do-while loop I think a
year ago I have written a program using
do-while loop for the simple calculator
so in my blog which is programming
knowledge log dot blog spot.com Inc till
this video you can go there and you can
go to this C++ code example and the
first example here write a C++ program
to make a simple computer in here I have
written the code using do-while loop how
to make a simple computer using do-while
loop okay
this is a very good example you can see
why I have really used to while loop so
I will what I will do is I will just
copy this code from here and paste it I
will select it all and paste it in my
code blocks okay in here and I will just
delete the system pause because in code
blocks you don't need system pause at
the bottom just above this the return 0
I have written system pause I can I will
just comment it out and now I will build
the program a program is built and now
when I run this program you see it's a
beautiful program 2 for the calculator
it prints welcome to the calculator
program version by your name and please
enter the operation you want to execute
so it can execute addition subtraction
multiplication division and swapping ok
for example I want to execute addition
so I will give plus here and I will
enter and then program ask me to enter
the first number I will enter some
random number here and program ask me to
enter second number so I will once again
enter other number and I will press
enter and it gives me the answer so it
says the addition of two number which I
have entered this this and then the two
line while loop comes into action then
it's ask me enter Y or capital Y to
continue ok so I will enter Y and when I
press Enter it doesn't go out of the
loop but it will
asked me once again what apparation who
you want to perform so I will say
multiplication this time and some number
first number second number and doing
give the multiplication so it will
execute the program and then it will ask
whether you want to exit the program or
not this time I will enter some random
character which is not Y or capital Y
then my program is out of the root loop
so this is the very good example I have
written here if you want you can check
and you can see how I have used to by
loop in order to make this simple
calculator so I hope you have enjoyed
