last video I have shown you how to
capture screenshot with the help of your
NetBeans java application so when I
click this button it takes the
screenshot and show it into the jlabel
but if you have noticed this screenshot
is not resized according to the size of
my frame so the screenshot is bigger and
my frame or label size is smaller so it
only shows some part of the screenshot
and not the whole screen shot in this
label so in this video I will show you
how to resize your image according to
your jlabel or according to any J panel
or anything in your NetBeans palette so
basically I am going to tell you how to
resize this image so you can use it in
other applications also so let's get
started first of all go to your source
code here and we are going to make a new
function here so I am just making the
function just above this capture image
event or capture image function so this
capture image code I have shown you last
time okay so if you don't know this code
this I have shown you last time now I
want to resize the image so I will make
a new function so just go above your
this button click event function or you
can make it at the top of your code this
function so just write private
image
and so this function will rip return the
datatype image okay and I will name this
function as scaled image and break it
and break it closed and this function
will take three parameters or arguments
first is image so here we will pass this
image which we capture as a screenshot
so
image give it a name I am G for example
and then I will pass the width and
height of my image which I want so in W
comma int H for height and W for width
now in here inside the function I will
declare some variables first is buffered
image variable and this will contain the
resize image so I will name my variable
as resize image resized image is better
okay is equal to new buffered image once
again copy and paste here bracket in
bracket closed and in here we will pass
some parameters so first parameter will
be our width second argument will be the
height these W and H from here comma and
in here we will pass
so for the image
. i will select
this type int RGB okay so just declare
buffer image resize image which is my
variable name is equal to new before
damage and in here I pass my width
variable height and I write buffered
image dot type int RGB in the second
line I will write this is showing error
because I'm not returning right now
anything so I will just return this
image now the error is gone now in
between here I will write this line so
declare graphic 2d and give it a
variable name is equal to resized image
which is this variable dot create
graphics bracket and bracket closed okay
now in the next line I will write this
which is I will copy just this variable
here and paste it here dot set the
rendering hint and in the bracket I will
pass rendering hints dot T interpolation
comma rendering hint dot value enter
port interpolation bilinear okay so just
write this and if this code shows any
error this will be because you need to
import some namespaces so just
right-click and fix import if this code
shows any error just right click and
just click fix import and it will take
care of the errors okay now in the next
line right
this code so this g2 is this graphic to
D variable dot draw image and just pass
this image variable from here to here
dot 0 or comma 0 comma 0 and then pass
the width and the height variable here
comma null so write this and one more
line we need to write is we are going to
dispose this g2 so write D 2 dot dispose
okay so you need to declare or make this
function and you need to write this code
if you want you can pause the video and
copy the code and then I will just go to
my design and once again the double
click this button and in this button
click event I have made this code to
show the screenshot which I capture in
the J label which is this J label yeah
right so now in this code I will change
a little bit and I will call this resize
or scaled image function so it will
scale my image according to the label
size so this code if you don't know just
watch the last video and here we are
going to change this third line in which
I have declared the image icon icon is
equal to new image icon and I am passing
this capture variable which is buffered
image so I will just delete this and I
will call my function scale image
function which I made right now in this
bracket and bracket and bracket close
and in here I will pass three variables
first is this before image variable
itself because first it takes the image
variables
okay so first argument will be this
capture variable which is buffered image
here second argument is the width right
so just copy the name of your j label
and second argument just paste it here
dot get width so it will take the width
of the jlabel third is the height so
once again copy the and paste the jail
label variable name dot get height okay
so we passed all three argument which
this function takes and it's it is
returning the image variable in return
so just change this code like this here
and now when you run your program it
will resize your image according to the
j label and it will show in this label
the full screenshot so let's see this is
my run j frame and when I click this it
should show me the full screen shot so
let's see yes it's resized my image and
according to the J label and it showing
in the J label that resized image of the
screen shot once again a little bit
bigger J label and once again when I
click this capture image it once again
resizes the image and fix it into the J
label so if you make your J label size
bigger it will your picture
we'll also be fixed according to the
size like this okay so in this way you
can resize your images to fit into your
J level or J panel or anything or save
it resize image in some file also this
you can also do so this is very good
function to for the images because not
all the time you get the images of your
desired size so you can just resize your
images according to your desired or your
desires and just this function you can
use anywhere right if you are watching
these videos I am showing I have been
showing you this employee J frame from
the starting and here I have shown you
how to save images in the database and
many of you have been complaining that
this image in the label doesn't fit
exactly according to the size of J label
so you can apply that same function for
this J label also so I hope you have
learned something new this time please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
