show you how you can create and run a
simple JavaScript project inside your
Eclipse IDE so first of all make sure
that you have Java EE version of Eclipse
installed in your system and then open
your Eclipse IDE now inside your Eclipse
IDE to create a Java Script project you
just need to go to this file tab here
and then go to new and select project
and in here you will be able to see
different folders so you have two
options you can either choose Java
Script project or choose the web inside
your web folder you can choose a static
web project for example so for now I'm
going to choose this static web project
and I'm going to click Next and in here
you can give the name to your project
for example my GS project and then click
Next and inside your project folder
Eclipse is going to create a new folder
called web content for you so just click
finish for now and click yes and now
when you click this Java tab here you
are going to see your project for
example this is your project my GS
project and inside this this is your web
content folder so select your web
content folder here and right-click it
and in order to add a javascript file
you just need to click new and in here
in the new go to others and in others
you can find this java script file here
inside JavaScript folder ok so select
this javascript file click Next and give
to the name to your JavaScript file for
example my J s dot J s ok so don't
forget to give the extension dot just at
the last of your file name
okay and then click finish it's going to
create a JavaScript file for you and in
here what you need to do is for example
I'm going to create a JavaScript
function function add and it takes two
argument a and B and what I want to do I
just want to return the addition of
these two numbers for example return a
plus B okay so this is my JavaScript
file for example now to add a HTML file
inside my web content folder I can once
again right-click this web content
folder and go to new and go to others
and in here you will be able to find the
HTML file inside the web folder so click
the web folder and in here you will be
able to see this HTML file okay click
Next and in here you can give the name
to your file for example I give the name
to my file as first dot HTML click Next
and click finish so your HTML file is
created here and in the head for example
I want to include my JavaScript file in
the head text so I will just include it
I will add a script tag here and in here
as a source SRC is equal to I will add
the JavaScript file name which is my J's
dot GS okay and click Save here and in
order to do some action with our
function add so we have created this
function called add so for example we
want to call this function inside the
body once again I'm going to add a
script tag here and inside this script
tag between
here I can for example I can print this
by calling alert alert and inside this I
will call my function which is ad you
can see the name of my function is ad
here and I will pass two arguments for
example 100 and 200 okay and don't
forget to give this semicolon and then
save your file okay
so every time you add it your file you
need to save it and then you will be
able to run it okay so save it and now
go to your web content folder and right
click your HTML file and then you can
open it with the web browser so go to
open with and then click web browser
it's going to give an alert and it's
giving me the answer of 100 plus 200
with just 300 here okay so in this way
you can create a simple JavaScript
project inside your Eclipse IDE I hope
