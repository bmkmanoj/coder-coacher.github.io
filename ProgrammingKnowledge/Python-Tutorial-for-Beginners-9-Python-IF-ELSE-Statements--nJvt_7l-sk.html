have been showing you a basic but very
important concepts of Python now from
this video we are going to write some
code in our Python file and from this
video we are going to write some useful
code and this video I will start from
showing you how conditional statement
works and in this video I am going to
specifically take if statement in Python
so let's get started I have this test
dot python file which i made if you
don't know how to make this test of
Python file you just need to go to file
in the shell and just click new file and
then just save your file at your
specified location by some name ok and
you will be having this type of file so
my Python file name is that test dot py
now the conditional statement which I am
going to take let's see how if statement
box so for example I want to find out
the absolute value of a number how can I
find out by using us if statement so for
example I write a variable and which
takes an input so I ask the user to
enter an input and I convert it to an
integer and be saved in the variable
called n okay now I want to find out the
absolute value of that number so what I
can do is I can use if statement and how
you can declare if statement just right
if and then the condition ok so here
comes the
condition this is a pseudocode I am
writing so we are going to replace this
condition by our real condition and then
in here so always remember when you
write code in Python it's a indentation
is really necessary
so if you write any condition for
example if if you give another code for
example I want to print something what
it will do is this statement sees the
indentation and let me give you an
example first and then I will illustrate
the basic concept of indentation so I
want to find out the absolute number
right so in the condition I can write n
if n is less than 0 so this is a
condition I am checking if a user and
thus the value n which is less than 0
what I am going to do is I am going to
print print the value absolute value so
I'm going to just write the absolute
value op and then the I can just use
comma to give the value of N and once
again I can use comma to you know
separate this string and I can write is
is and let me make a little bit bigger
is and then I can just separate it by
one of the comma and I can just write
minus NFE if the value is less than 0
right so let's save this program just
ctrl s to save the program and I will
run the program run module or f5 and it
says
invalid syntax and why it says invalid
syntax here is because in here after F
condition you need to give colon here
okay so this is taken as a condition and
after : h it indicates that this
condition ends here and then the
statement starts from here once again
save it and run it and then it will run
in this shell and it's asking the user
to enter a number I will enter a
negative number minus 3 and press ENTER
and it gives me the absolute value of
minus 3 which is 3 okay now for example
I want a enter a positive number what
happens then ok so I will run it once
again and this time I enter last them
and now nothing happens because this
condition we are checking is less than
or we are checking for the number less
than 0 so this will print this and just
remember always that always provide an
indentation here ok if you don't provide
this small space or tab here and just
you know write your port here with no
space here and save your program and run
it let's see what happens so it says
expected an indented block right so
always provide an indentation and it it
so you know show you the place where the
error is coming in red you know red
highlight okay
so always provide just give a tab before
your statement after if condition okay
or after any any logic which you write
so now this is considered as a statement
okay and if you if you write this if you
state
and all like this it will consider this
line as a different code and it will not
come as a statement of if condition okay
now for example I provide the positive
number and I also want to give the
absolute value of this positive number
so what I can do is I can just give else
condition else so your statements apart
from you know with no space here but so
if your condition is if and then we have
the else condition so your condition
start from no space but the statement
inside your condition start with the
indentation or space here just give a
tab and it will give you this space okay
so once again I want to print out the
absolute value of a number now I want to
check whether number is positive so if
the number is not negative which is this
condition if number is less than zero
which means number is negative this will
be printed else if the number is
positive because this condition is not
true that means definitely the number is
positive I want to print out the
absolute value of this positive number
right so I will just print it like this
absolute value of this should be value
and is positive because the absolute
value of positive number is positive
right so now when I save the program and
run it and it says invalid syntax once
again why because I also need to give
this pole in here right now once again
save it and run your program it gives me
this question mark with the number I
give ten once again and say is absolute
value of ten is ten so this is the basic
syntax of if statement
you're you give if as a keyword for
checking the comparison or can
comparison and you compare some values
so right now we are comparing our value
which user enters from zero and if it's
less than zero we print this else
anything else will be covered by this
statement and always remember that your
if statement or else statement it will
have no space here but your actual you
know code which you write in if
statement or else statement will be will
have to have this kind of indentation
here indentation means space or tab okay
and it's not necessary that you can only
give one line of code inside your if
condition you can just give multiple
lines of code inside your condition I
will just make it little bit prettier so
it can have you know multiple line of
statement your if condition or your else
condition and this is just an example I
am giving but this will be some logical
code which you have to write here and in
a similar way you can just give this
here right here right so you can have
multiple statement in else condition now
one more thing to remember here is
whenever you want to go outside so now
what you want to do some other operation
for example I want to do I want to add
two numbers and or some I will declare a
variable called sum sum of two for
example this is my variable name and I
add 50 plus 60 okay
and I want to print it print and then I
want just print this sum of these two
numbers right so if I do it like this
for example I'll do it like this what
will happen let's see I save it and run
my program and I give a negative number
minus 9 for example I had give me these
values which is which it has interviewed
these values okay
but I wanted to print a this number also
after there are my F else condition so
how I can you know show or I how I can
tell Python that my else condition is
now closed or my this FL condition is
now over and I want to print this now so
you on next code should start from once
again with no space okay so this is this
will be considered as a different code
and it will not be included in the if
condition conditional statements right
and now when I save it I will save it
and then I give minus 8 for example yeah
I need to give minus 8 and now you see
it gives me the absolute value which
execute this code and then it executes
my another code this code which I want
to execute after my F condition okay so
just if you want to end your as
statement in you you know want to write
some other code just start from no space
so indentation is really very important
in Python if you are you know the write
or give this indentation incorrectly
your Python code will give any error or
some error
so this is the if-else condition in
Python and future I'm going to show you
some more interesting stuff in Python so
stay tuned and please rate comment
