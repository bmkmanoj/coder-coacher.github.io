last video I have shown you how to
install your report designer and how to
download your Jasper report jar files
and add those jar files into your
NetBeans Java project in this video I
will show you how to use this report
designer so let's get started
the first step as you can see here is to
connect the database with your report so
I will do this
I will click this and want to connect
pause or have the JDBC connection so
this is first one so I will click it and
I will check next
and in here you can see so many database
connection if you are using MySQL
children click this my SQL comm MySQL
JDBC driver and here you just need to
include your database name as it says so
I will replace here my database name all
will remain same JDBC MySQL localhost
and instead of this database name I will
paste my database name and if you have
some username or password for your MySQL
database then you can enter this my
username is root and password is
something so you can enter this and when
you click test it will ask for the
password once again give your password
and now it says connection test
successful so in this way you can
connect your MySQL database but in our
project we are using SQLite SQLite as we
say so we need to connect SQLite file
first
so in order to connect SQLite database
with your just per report what you need
to do is
go here extras beside help and click
option and this will open this option
window and then click class path here
what you need to do is you need to add
the jar file so click Add jar and here
you need to add your SQLite connecter
jar file which is this SQLite JDBC
version 56 or whatever is your Escalade
connection jar file this file you have
also used to connect your NetBeans with
the SQLite database so this you might
know this is SQLite JDBC version 56 or
version might might be revised so you
have to see this just click this and
click open so you have added your jar
file connection and now click OK after
that you click this create a database
connection once again click data based
JDBC connection and click Next and in
here and you click this combo box you
will not find any proper driver for your
SQLite database so what you need to do
just go to your NetBeans project and go
to the connection Java connection class
on Java connect class this is my java
connect class and in this somewhere you
have written here hodgiedot SQLite dot
J's JDBC so this you have to copy this
is the code to connect your SQLite with
the NetBeans IDE on Java so you need to
copy this or G dot SQLite dot JDBC and
paste it here after that the next step
is once again go to your NetBeans Java
and copy this second get connection path
and instead of this JDBC URL paste your
database file here
if you have your database piling on
SQLite database file into your source
folder or folder that is NetBeans folder
then you don't need to change this path
but for the safety I will click to my
database file which is not SQLite file I
will right click it go to its properties
and I will copy its path old path and I
will go to my Jasper report and after
JDBC SQLite instead of this we will
paste the whole path here this in this
way you have given the path for your
database and as you know you will
require double slashes here so add
double slashes all the way
so you have added double slashes so you
just need to do two things and the JDBC
driver you need to write hodgiedot
SQLite dot JDBC and then the JDBC URL
you ever need to write JDBC SQLite or
and after that your path and the other
thing is you need to include your JDBC
SQLite jar file as I have said after
writing this you will click test to
check the connection and I have no
password so I will click OK and you can
see connection test successful so in
this way I know that my connection is
successful and now I can proceed with my
report I will just click Save in order
to save my connections ok
I haven't provided my connection name so
I will write in the name yes SQLite
connection just here you need to provide
the name and then save and your
connections are saved and this way you
can connect your MySQL database or
SQLite database with your report
designer the next step is to create a
new report and we will join some
database values into your reports
this will be our next step so that's it
for this tutorial in the next video I
will show you how to make a new report
with the help of a report designer
