some viewers ask me how to refresh a the
J table automatically when you save
delete or update your data for example I
save the new data
and when they save it not as saved this
is pump ID 8 so that I said but my J
table is not refreshed and when I run
the program once again you can see that
I saved so today I will show you how to
refresh your J table just after saving
your data at the same time the J table
will be refreshed so how to do that I
will show you today so if you have seen
my video number 5 I have shown you how
to make how to populate your J table and
in that video I have made a method
called update table method if you don't
know how to make this method go to video
number 5 which is how to populate your J
table and see how did I may make this
method and so just go to this method
copy this method name and
go to your design right click your save
event action and action performed people
will go to the method of button action
perform top save and after this try and
catch blog
you must paste this method and do like
that so every time you save your data
your update table method will be called
and it will update the table every time
so you can do it and while you are
saving your data you can also paste this
method when you are updating or deleting
your data just you have to do is paste
this method just after your try catch
block of your action performed method so
this is a simple one-line code to
refresh your table and please see my
video number 5 in which I have shown how
to populate your J table so if you in
case you don't know what is the update
table method so please rate comment and
subscribe and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
