tutorial on c-sharp for beginners now
some of you if you are following me on
my channel you already know I have
already created a playlist on c-sharp
but that I started it with the
intermediate level so I have started it
with directly connection with the MySQL
database and how to work with mic skills
now in this series I want to teach you
the basics of c-sharp so this is the
series for the beginners level
so from this video we are going to learn
how we can download them Visual Studio C
sharp Express and how to write our first
code in C sharp so let's get started
to download Visual Studio Express
Edition it's free by the way you just
need to go to the google search and just
write Visual Studio Express and you will
be presented with the some of the
options and the first option will be
from www.paigeedraw.com and just click
this option from here and in here you
can see there are some products from
Visual Studio Express the Express
editions are free and you can use them
for the study purpose not for commercial
purpose or you can download them you can
so whenever when you are in this visual
studio website you need to go to the
downloads here and in here you have some
version for C shop ok
so what was a version we are looking for
is this Visual Studio Express right now
the latest version is 2013 and we are
building it or we want the Windows
desktop Edition and it includes c-sharp
Visual Basic and C++ support
okay so when you need to install this
you can click this install button and
you may need to register to this
Microsoft website or you may need to
have the Microsoft account in order to
install this C shop or this Windows
desktop Express Edition so once you have
done that it's fairly easy to install
this Visual Studio Express on your
system so once you have done that Visual
Studio will be installed in your system
and you just need to go to start and you
can either search Visual Studio and you
will see here C shop with us to do C
shop Express Edition will be here so
just click this and open it now this
will prevent you this kind of window and
here you can create a new project so
let's create a new project I will go to
this file or you can just click this
button to create a new project but I
will go to the file new project and in
here you have different options for
creating a teashop projects so the most
popular is this windows format
application which I have shown you in my
earlier playlist for C sharp but right
now for the beginners level we will
start from this console application to
see the basics now here you can give the
name of your project so for example I
will give on the name of one project has
my hold it and notice that I have
started the name of my project with
capital letter and then the other
letters of the word are in small letters
and when you add some new words it will
come with a capital letter and
other letters are small letters so it's
like a camel pattern here right and just
start with always start with the capital
the letter and click okay and this will
give you this program it already gives
you this B barebone project or this code
for running but we are not going to use
it and one more important thing if you
want to increase the font size of the
this code you can go to here which is by
default 100% and you can choose or you
can increase the font size by going here
or otherwise just press ctrl + scroll
your mouse and then it will increase the
size like this so I am scrolling my
mouse bike pressing control button and
now the font size is increased now we
have this project here and it has some
property files some references and the
file which contains this code is called
program dot C S which the visual studio
has created for us so for now I will
delete this because we want to create
our own class so I will delete this file
and I will say delete it permanently
okay and will be deleted so we are now
starting with the new class now for that
I can create first of all a folder in
which I want to save my class so I will
just go to my project and I will
right-click and I will say add new
folder and I will add a new folder
called examples right and in this
example folder just click this example
folder and once again right-click it and
we will add a class to this folder so we
say add class
and you will choose this class from here
and we will choose a name for our class
so let's say if our class name is
example one notice that I have once
again I have started then class name
with a cat capital letter and the second
word I have also started with a capital
letter and other are small letters so I
will add this class to my project and
now this class is added to my project I
will increase the point once again so
you can see so now we have created a
class for us and just remember that in
order to write a c-sharp code you need
to have a class we will discuss this
class in detail in the next videos but
just remember this and whenever you
create this class you will already have
or Visual Studio will already include
these files in your in your program or
in your code and these things at the top
which starting which are starting with
using this is called namespaces and what
is the namespaces namespaces is a
collection of classes and other codes
like delegates or namespaces can also
contain other namespaces and the main
namespace of c-sharp is this system
namespace so let's make it a minimal
code so that we can understand it so
this is a namespace and net what is the
namespace namespace is a collection of
classes delegates and other namespaces
and other enums or other things right
and this namespace will help us to write
our code now
this project which with or this folder
which we have created is also on
namespace and whatever class we will
write inside this will be the class
under this namespace so this system is
the namespace like this okay
now to write a code inside your
namespace or write first code what you
need to do is go inside your class and
you need to write here static void main
and just keep give this two brackets and
this curly braces right here so whenever
you write this static void main and your
function will start and close with this
so this is called a function and
function whenever you create a function
it has some return type it have some
bracket like this or this kind of square
or not the square but the bracket and
this kind of curly braces and this
brackets can take arguments but right
now we are not giving it and we can
return value in a functional or a method
which means we will see later and
whenever you write main this will be the
entry point of your c-sharp program so
this is a special function in C sharp as
you have seen in other languages also
the main is the main entry point of your
program and notice that this means start
from a capital letter now in order to
print something on the console what we
can run do is we can use a class called
console
so you can see when I hover over this
console here it says class system
console so this class console is a part
of namespace system so I will use this
and dot this right dot right and the
bracket and give this semicolon here and
inside this bracket we will give these
two double quotes and in here we can
write our message so I can write
welcome to this tutorial okay so what
will this console write will do is it
will print this message on your console
so let's try to run this program so to
in order to run your program you can
just click this button but whenever you
click this button your screen will
appear and disappear because there is no
not no food to stop this program from
exiting so let's press this button first
and you see it screen comes and goes and
there is nothing to stop this screen
because we haven't provided any key
entry or anything to stop our code
program so what you can do is either you
can run your program by pressing control
f5 so just remember run your program
with control f5 which I am doing right
now and now you can see your console and
it will wait for your key press event to
exit so you can see our message is
printed here welcome to this tutorial
okay and then it shows that press any
key to continue
otherwise if you want to press this
button what you can do is you there is a
code called console dot read key which
will wait for the key to be pressed
right and now when I run this program
you can see the message welcome to the
tutorial and when I press some key it
will be exited so this is the basic
program we have written in c-sharp in
the next videos I will be explaining you
some more stuff related to beginners
c-sharp so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
