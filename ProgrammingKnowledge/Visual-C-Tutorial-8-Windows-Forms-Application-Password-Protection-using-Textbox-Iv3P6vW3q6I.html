in our visual C++ windows form
application videos we have seen how to
make a login page how to create this
picture and how to give icon and one
thing if you have noticed when you re
logging in is this password field
it must not show these character when
you enter your password otherwise
anybody would be able to see your
password so it should show like this
these stars or something like these dot
whatever you want these dollar signs so
how to do this how to create a password
field for your login page I will show
you now so let's come to our program and
go to your password text field and just
copy its name so it's name is password
text I copy it and then I'm go to my
form 1 attached which is its source file
and I go to the top yeah
and slowly when I come down you will see
this line initialize component we need
to put our code in this lock so here if
you put your code then whenever you run
your form it will be initialized with
your form so go there and paste your
password text field the name and then
give this arrow pointer and right
password care and is equal to
right double quotes and then semicolon
and any of whatever you provide as your
password character it will rip it will
replace your texts character or letters
when you type your password for example
I am providing this dollar sign I want
to show dollar sign when user enters his
password so I type this and let's try to
run the program now and it says it has
some error I think
some spelling mistake no I don't think
so I think instead of these double
quotes I need to provide single quotes
and now let's try to run our program
once again and yes I think it once and
now I will for example I mean enter my
username and I enter my password which I
don't want to show anybody so I enter
whatever so every time I type my
password it's it shows dollar sign so in
this way you can write your password or
you can secure your password from other
people so
and the second thing you can do is limit
the characters in your password field so
for example if you want the password not
bigger than 10 character long so just
write your password text once again and
give this arrow and after that right max
length and here you can give 10 so your
password field now will take only 10
characters and not more than that so
let's try if our code is running or not
yes it once so user name and I will
provide a password so I will type 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and I cannot enter more
than 10 characters so in this way you
can use password field and limit your
password length so I hope you and you
have enjoyed this video please rate
