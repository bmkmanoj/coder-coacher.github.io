video I will show you how to play audio
file with our c-sharp application so
let's get started
first of all I have taken a text box and
I have taken a button to choose a file
and display into the text box and
whatever file I will choose in the text
box and I will take a button called I
will change it text play audio so
whatever file will be chosen in this
text box and when I play this or when I
press this button it should play my
chosen media file or chosen audio file
so first of all let's see the code for
choosing pi that might you might have
seen several number of times so just I
will just go through with fast write
Open File dialog and open file dialog
variable name is equal to new Open File
dialog and if your file dialog dot show
dialog bracket is equal to system dot
Windows dot form dot dialog result ok
then in the bracket run write this dot
your tread text box name in which you
are displaying the path dot text is
equal to open file dialog which is this
variable once again dot file so this
will copy the chosen path into this text
box okay so write this code for choosing
the path with the help of your open file
dialog now the part of playing the audio
file
so just select this button and double
click it and we will reach to the code
for this button action for performed so
first of all here we will write try and
catch block catch and here bracket okay
so for example if you choose some file
which is not an audio file then it
should give me some error message that's
why I am providing this triangle block
here so in the catch block I will write
win32 E and E X
and just write this message so masses
bomb does show e^x dot message so it
will catch any exception if you do not
choose the correct file path and now in
the try block we will write system dot
media dot sound clear sorry dot song
player and give any name to your sound
place I am giving it player name is
equal to new system dot media dot song
play and bracket and bracket closed and
then just copy this player variable dot
sound location is equal to your text box
name in which you are copying your path
so this one our text box name so I will
just copy its name text box name and
once again I will go to the code and dot
text
okay and close in the next line right
once again
player player dot load bracket bracket
close and in the last line right player
once again your variable name dot place
Inc like it and black lost
okay so I have written this much amount
of code in order to play a sound file
which is there in the text box whose
path is there in the text box so if you
want you can pause the video and copy
the code and now when I run the program
and I will choose a file with the help
of this button and now we will choose a
file from my desktop
and we'll choose this wave file dot WAV
file it's gone somewhere so I'm copying
so I have chosen a wrong text box for
displaying my path so once again I have
changed that now I will select the path
of the file and this file is a WAV file
so dot WAV fine and when I play this
when I press this play audio have you
checked your email this morning have you
checked your email this morning have you
checked your email this morning so it's
playing a WAV file for me I have tested
this program of code with dot WAV file
so it's a file which contains sound
or audio and I don't think it will play
mp3 or mp4 sound so don't expect much
from this code it will just play a
simple dot WAV what you find so in this
way you can play a what do you find with
the help of your c-sharp application I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
