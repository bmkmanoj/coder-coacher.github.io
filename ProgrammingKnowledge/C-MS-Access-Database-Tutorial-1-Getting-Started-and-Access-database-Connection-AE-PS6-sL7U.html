tutorial on connecting and using
Microsoft Access database with your
c-sharp windows form application in this
video series I am going to show you how
you can connect and use X database with
your sheet shop windows form application
in which I will show you how you can
connect your database how can you use
your database with the tools like data
grid view combo box list box or order
other tools which are available in
Windows forms and I will also show you
how to create a simple project so we
will be creating a simple project in
which you will be able to create a login
form and you can access the second form
when you successfully log in and there
in the login after the login form we are
going to see how we can manipulate our
data in the form of charts or tables or
whatever and let's start our session
from connecting this Access database to
the C shop I'm hoping or I'm expecting
that you already know basics of Access
database if you don't even know how to
create an Access database you can go to
my youtube channel which is called a
programming knowledge and in here go to
playlist and you will be able to find
the Microsoft Access database tutorial
for beginners so if you don't even know
how you can create an Access database
you can just see those videos and you
will be you know you will be able to
make an exit database and how to query
and all these things related to access
database and if you are interested in
learning c shop from the beginning so I
am also the playlist for beginners if
you want to learn from the starting so
this is for the beginners
so okay I'm once you know how to create
an Access database I've already created
Access database and this database is
called employee data and in this we have
some columns we have employee ID we have
first name last name date of birth of
employee the country of origin of the
employee the phone number of the
employee and the pay of the employee so
this is the database I'm going to use to
connect to my c-sharp project okay so I
have this employee info database and I
have this employee table here right now
once we have our we have our database
and we have some content in our table of
our database let's go to our C shop
Express Edition or you can download this
Express Edition for free from the
Microsoft website and let's go to this
visual studio for C shop and create a
new project so I will just click this
new project and we are going to create
this windows form application I can
change the name of my windows form
application as XS login app for example
and I will click OK
and this will create us pop project okay
so we have successfully created our
blank project I will just pin this tool
bar here so we will be able to see all
the tools and I will go to all the tools
here so these are the tools we can use
in this form according to our
requirement okay and this has this
designer view and it also has the code
behind which I will show you in the in a
moment so what we are going to do first
is just select this form as a whole and
double click it so I will double click
it and you will reach to the source of
this design of this form so this is the
design view or this is the code view or
source view of this form and in here you
will be able to see all the namespaces
and simple class for your project okay
I'm going to add one more namespace here
in order to connect to the Access
database and this namespace is called
using system dot data dot oledb so
Microsoft Access database is a led be a
base database so we need to use this
valley DB namespace in order to access
the classes from oledb 0 class right so
I just need to do this and then I'm
going to connect my X database with this
oledb class ok
so once again I will go to the design
view and I will take a label from here
to show the message that if our access
database is really connected to this
label or not okay and once again I will
go to my source you or you can just
select your form and double click your
form and this is called form load event
okay so we are in form load event and in
here you need to declare this oledb
connection object so just right
Welli DB connection and give object name
called connection is equal to MU value
DB connection okay and then in the next
line we will use connection string to
connect to the Access database just copy
your connection object and just write
dot connection dot connection string
connection string helps us to connect to
the database which are only DB the dot
of this right and what we need to do is
we need to just give these double quotes
and this : and in these double quotes we
need to give the connection string and
before this these double quotes you can
include this at the rate symbol so that
it can take this whole string as a
string okay now in this that these
double quotes we need to know the
connection string for Access database
right so you don't even need to remember
the connection string for exit database
you can just go to the your search
engine and just try it or you can just
open your browser and just write www dot
connection string calm okay and in here
you will be able to find all the
connections swing of Texas database and
other databases like SQL Server or
Oracle or Excel or anything so in here
just go to this axis here and in here
you will be able to find Microsoft ace
oledb twelve point zero connection
string which is standest security and
what you need to do is you can just copy
this connection string from here I will
copy this whole connection string both
the lines there are two lines right
click and copy it and just see here this
connection string is valid for excess
2013 axis 2010 and Access 2007 so Access
2007 and this connection string will
support and the earlier version you need
to search in this website for the
earlier versions okay
so just copy this connection string and
go to your see shop project and between
these double quotes you just paste this
okay so once you have pasted this you
are done okay and this connection string
has provider is equal to Microsoft at is
well DB 12.0 which enables us to connect
to access 2013 X is 2010 and exists 2007
and then it has a data source and this
data source is equal to the path of your
Microsoft Access database this is the
dummy path what you need to know is you
need to know where you have saved your
Microsoft Access database go to the
location wherever you have saved your
database and just right-click your
database and go to properties and you
will see it's a dot accdb
file go to securities and copy this
whole path here including the
Grammy's name just copy it go to your
project and just change this part which
is a dummy path with your actual part of
your database Microsoft Access database
right so I have change it change it and
then it's okay and this persists
security info is false which is a
standard security and now in the next
line what I am going to do is I will
open the connection with the database
once you are connected to the database
just we will see and open the database
so just right connection dot open okay
and whenever you open your connection to
the database you also need to close it
after you are done with all of oleo code
so it's a good practice that whenever
just remember whenever you open your
database you need to close it also so
just write connection dot close okay and
in between you can perform your logic or
whatever you want to do you want to foil
query the database or you want to update
or insert anything in the database right
but just now we want to show in the
label which we have here that we are
connected so I will just see the name of
my label it's nothing but label one I
will say the name of this label is check
connection label so we know that this is
a check connection label and I will
remove the text from this label also
okay now I will go to my code and in
this between between this connection
open and connection close I will paste
the name of my label
I will say connection dot text which
takes the text and then is equal to
connected so in the double quotes just
write a connection connection successful
okay
so once you have connected to the
database and you will be able to open
your database then it means you are
connected to the database and then you
can say or you can show the message in
the label that you are connected
otherwise it will throw an exception so
to catch an exception if any you can
write try catch block which catches your
exception so just write try and just
give this and in here you can close this
try and just write catch and then these
curly braces and whenever you catch any
exception you can show some message okay
so here I will say exceptionally catch
exception E and for example I want to
show a message some message I will say
message box thought show and I will show
the exception in this message box so I
will say error in the double quotes
error and comma I will just use this ie
here okay so now and this e will give us
a error or this squiggly line because
you already have this E
you declared here so I will just change
it as e^x so this variable name is
different and now it will not show any
error and this comma will be a plus
symbol so we will concatenate the
exception with our message okay
now once you are done with this let's
try and run the program I will run the
program and hopefully it will build
successfully and you see here I see
connection successful message here that
means I am connected to the database now
in case any exception occurs so let's
try to create an error and see if really
catches our error or not so I will just
delete some information from this
connection string for example just to
check if it throws another error or not
so I will delete provider from here and
I will run this program once again and
now you see it throws an error and our
catch block catches an exception it will
show this long message here and it says
something like some exception has
occurred and format of initialization is
not correct right so it has thrown an
exception if our connection is not okay
and once again when I give the correct
connection string and once again when I
try to run the program it connects
successfully and it shows the message
connection successful so everything is
working fine now now you are
successfully connected with your
database now in the next video I'm going
to show you how you can create a login
application or login page in which we
are going to check validate the username
and password
or the name of the employee from this
database and if the name of the employee
and we are will create one more field
here which is called password and name
and password matches then I will
redirect this form to the next form so
we will build a application or we will
build our project little by little so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
