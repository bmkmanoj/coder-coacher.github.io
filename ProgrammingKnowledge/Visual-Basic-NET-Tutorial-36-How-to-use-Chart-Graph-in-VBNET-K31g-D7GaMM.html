to show you how to use just control with
your visual basic windows form
application so let's get started I have
this blank project made and in here
we'll take a button to load a chart and
I will take our chart control obviously
to load my charts so I will search for
the chart and you will find this chart
control in this dot or tab so just drag
and drop this chart control and resize
it according to your requirements and I
will change the name or text of this
button as load chart and before writing
any code for our application I want to
show some of the properties of this
chart so on how you can customize these
charts so the first property I want to
show you is the CDs so just select your
chart and go to the property called
series here which is this so just click
this button near series collection and
in here you can customize your series so
first of all by default your series name
is a series one so I change it as
something else for example I want to
show name versus age series so I will
name my series as age and I can
customize my chart by changing the
background image if you want you can
just choose any image into your
into your background as your background
image of your series and you can also
change the border color for example red
you can also change the foreground color
for example I'm going to choose the
screen color and immediately when you
choose it you will be able to see this
effect here green color and the broader
are red right and you have the most
important property called
chart types so this defines what kind of
chart you want to make it's not
restricted to the bar chart you can make
a different type of chart using this
chart control just click this chart
control and just click this button here
and you can choose here my chart point
chart and other line chart and whatever
you want to use so for this video I'm
going to stick to the column chart which
is most basic and I will click OK and
you can also change the property of this
chart also for example you want to
change the background color of this
chart so go to the property of by color
by default it's white you can choose any
color for example this dark grey and you
can see its property is changed now some
code so double click this button and in
here right
first of all just see the name of your
chart which is chart 1 right so just
remember this and here write me dot
chart 1 which is the name of your chart
dot series and in here we will pass in
the name of the series which is age
right just right here age this is the
name of the series and then right dot
points
dot add XY and in here we will pass two
arguments one is the x-axis and other is
the y-axis first argument with it will
take is the x-axis value so first
argument is the name as x-axis I will
write the name versus his age so for
example 43 and I will press ENTER and in
this is the first bar of your bar dot
off your chart right for example I want
to show multiple bars I will just copy
and paste it for x for example and I
will change the name John and age is 50
and the age is 20 and the age is for
example 40 and now when I run the
program and when I click this button it
will load the chart which is named
versus age
so our first age was for the mark is 33
you can see yeah it's 33 for John it's
50 so John the age is 50 in this way it
will show the chart a for example you
want to show multiple bars with the same
x axis so for example I want to show the
marks age plus I want to show the score
or marks code by a mark in some
examination so how can I show multiple
bars with the same name so let's see how
can we you add it just select your chart
once again and go to the property series
once again here and in here we just need
to add one more series so I will just
click this Add button and I will change
the name of the series as
Marx this time and this time I'm going
to leave all these things all these
properties as default so basically you
know or all you need to play with these
property in order to customize your
chart right so I will click OK and I
will just click this button what once
again and I will copy this code and
paste it below and this series name is
monks right so I'll write marks here and
the age of marks for example he's 70
year old guy or maybe he is what year
old no his score yes giving the score
right so he scored nine ninety out of
hundred marks right and for the other
for the person's we just copy and paste
the data and copy and paste right and
these are the marks so second series
will be mark marks and the age or the
scores right so second person scores
73rd schools forty and fourth scores 66
for example and now we'll run the
program and when I click this load chart
button it shows me the name was a chart
plus it shows me the name versus marks
chart and it shows the name of the
series here also age and marks by trains
in this way you can make different kind
of chart with the help of this Microsoft
chart control I hope you have enjoyed
