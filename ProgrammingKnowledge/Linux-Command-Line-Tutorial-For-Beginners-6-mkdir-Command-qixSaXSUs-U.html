Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will learn
how we can use mkdir command in Linux we
can use mkdir command to create
directories in Linux so let's see how we
can do it so first of all just press
ctrl alt T to open your terminal and for
example I want to just change the
directory to my desktop folder so I will
just write desktop and press ENTER and
in the desktop I want to create a
directory called image so I can just
give mkdir command which is the command
to create any directory and then the
name of the directory for example image
okay and I will press ENTER and then
it's going to create this directory
called image now for example I want to
create a subdirectory inside this image
directory I can just write mkdir once
again and the directory name which
already exists and then I will give the
forward slash for the subdirectory for
example I want to create a subdirectory
called pics and I will press ENTER and
then when I open this image directory it
has this pics
you know directory right now for example
you want to create the subdirectory from
the command or for the directory which
don't really exist so for example I want
to give this command for example MK dir
on the desktop and then I want to create
a directory called names and then I will
give a name for example mark here okay
so this directory names doesn't exist on
my desktop you can see here right so
when I give this command it will give me
the error and the error says cannot
create directory names so
- mark no such file or directory because
this names directory doesn't exist which
is a parent directory it cannot create
this mark subdirectory inside the names
so in order to create the directory
structure you need to use this flag to
your mkdir command which is minus P okay
and this flag you can use to you know
create a directory structure okay so
this flag can be given in two ways this
is the short version of giving this flag
and if you want to know the full version
you can just give to - and then you can
just give parents command here okay so
the flag name is parents okay and if you
give this command it's going to create a
directory for you also and sub directory
for you which doesn't even exist
okay so I'm going to just give this
short flag which is a minus P or - P and
I will just press ENTER here and it's
going to create this directory and it
doesn't give me error and when I go
inside this directory there is one more
directory called mark here right so if
you want to create directory or sub
directory which doesn't really exist you
can use - p f-- language with your mkdir
command now for example you want to make
or create several direct trees inside
your parent directory so what you can do
so you can just write mkdir command just
right MK dir and then minus P and for
example I want to create some directory
with some names inside this names
directory so I will just give the name
of the names directory and then I will
just give these curly brackets and
inside the curly brackets I can provide
the list of directory which I want to
create for example I want to create a
directory called John I want to create a
directory called Tom for example and I
want to create a directory called Bob so
I want to create three directories
inside this names directory so let me
open this directory which is names and
right now it has only one directory
which we have already created so let me
press ENTER and let's see what happens
and when I press ENTER it creates some
directory with this curly brace start
and then the first name and then comma
so this way you can create but you don't
have to give the space between these
commas so just remove the space between
the commas and press ENTER once again
and this time it will create these three
directory so always remember when you
give a space it will not create the you
know correct directory structure you
want so you need to give the comma
without the space so this format of
creating the multiple directory is
correct without spaces and this will
give you errors as we have seen it has
created this directory which we did not
want it ok so in this way you can use
mkdir command in Linux I hope you've
