how to compile and integrate crypto plus
plus library into your visual C++
environment plus I will show you how to
run a sample program using this crypto
plus plus library in Visual Studio so I
have made a log entry in my blog which
is programming knowledge blog dot
blogspot
a link below this video so you can refer
to that blog so first step is to
download the crypto PP library from its
site so just click this download link
and you will reach to the download link
at the time of making this video this is
the latest version of plus plus real
libraries so I will click this and
download this this will be downloaded in
the form of a zip file which looks like
this
and you just need to extract your file
somewhere in your computer so I have
given on file name crypto PP and in this
file I have generated the file so make
this directory and extract your files in
this directory ok
and once you extracted this these files
all these files will be extracted like
this into your folder in this file just
search for this crypto test solution
and open it into your visuals studio
once you open this solution in Visual
Studio it will look like this this
solution contains four projects so what
you need to do is go to build and go to
batch build and select crypto labor when
32 debug library so just check it and
check crypto lib release library for
win32 so select this and select this and
then click build okay I have already
built this library it will take some
time so once you build these library it
will generate a folder called win32 here
and in this folder it will generate
these project files and in the output
here it will create a debug folder which
contain these three files crypt lip we
see 80 and this one and in release
folder it also create some file
including this crypt lip library now in
order to run a sample program using
these libraries i bill i will open a
visual studio once again and i will
create a new project
and that's that project I want to create
event 32 project and I will name it as
to be be okay and just select the folder
of your choice I will prefer the folder
in which I have extracted my crypto PP
libraries so I will select the same
folder as my crypto PP libraries so
select it and click OK and it will
generate a new project for you in this
new project I will create an new CPP
file so just go to source file and add
new item and then select CPP cave the
name of your CPP file and then just
click OK so I have already created our
CPP file called test the CPP and in here
I will write the code of my crypto plus
plus libraries so in my blog post I have
given the code sample code which you can
copy and paste it into your
CPP file so once you have done that you
see it's showing some errors these
errors are coming because it's not
looking at in the libraries so just
so what I will do is I will go to my
folder once again and I will copy my
crypto PPP library folder all complete
folder from here I will cut from here
and in my new project wherever I have
this solution for my new project for
Windows 32 when 32 I will paste it here
this project is open so it's not taking
it once again based and it's pasted
and now when you give some bath from
here you can select this lat
script OPP library from here and just
add this line to every file which is
related to crypto PT so this file hex
file filters file
tes file this okay
and also double quotes dummy codes
double quotes
yeah old
double quotes equals and them so now
it's locating the libraries and it's
loading locating the files okay so once
you have done with that you can build
your program and it's showing this
because first line I have deleted by
mistake so we'll copy this include once
again and paste it here and then I will
just locate that file so now when I
build my program
it's giving me some linker error
this is error because I haven't linked
any libraries to my projects so
right-click your project and go to the
properties and go to linker and click
include and in the additional
dependencies Here I am going to write
the path of my libraries so what is the
path of my library in C CPP file where
which contains this win32 this is the
crypto project file I will go to the
type and I will search for no I will go
to Windows 32 output and because I'm
making my project in debug mode if you
can see here once again in debug mode
okay
so I will go in here crypto PP windows
32 output debug and I will right click
it copy the path of this file crypto
crypt live dot Lib file and I will add
in this additional dependencies and
click OK apply and ok now once this is
done
once again try to build the program
and once again it is giving me some
errors so once again I will go to text
my project folder properties and I will
go to C C++ and I will go to sport
generation and if you are in debug mode
just select from here multi-threaded
debug instead of this DLL okay 20:20
debug and apply and click OK once again
make the solution and this time my build
is succeeded you see and now when I run
my program it gives me some output so
this output takes a plain text it can
convert the plain text into the ship or
text and this ship or text can be
converted into hex form and then from
hex form this can be converted or D
decrypted to the original script so this
program contains all original to ship a
ship or to hacks hacks to the shipper
ship or to once again to the original
text so this is a useful program and if
you are building your program in debug
mode here debug or sorry if you are
making your project in release mode from
here you need to just set the properties
once again go to C C++ code generation
and here select multi-threaded instead
of multi-threaded DLL just select this
multi-threaded empty only and apply and
once again go to linker input and in
here we give the part of your libraries
so this time last time we have gone to
the debug folder this time we will go to
the release folder of your project and
just select the library and copy the
path of the library and paste it into
additional different dependencies click
ok apply ok and now we will run or build
our program in release mode so great and
it's built and
now you can run the program and same
output you will get so in this way you
can use crypto plus plus libraries to
encrypt and decrypt data and I have just
shown you how to install your crypto
plus plus libraries and compile and run
it with visual C++ program so I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
