Visual C++ windows form application in
this video I will show you how to find
some word into the text and then
highlight it so I will show you what I
mean I have some text for example I have
some text in this text area and I want
to find some word in this text for
example I want to find 2 in this whole
text so I will just press this search
button and then my to wherever it is
present in the text it will be
highlighted with a color of my choice in
this case it's highlighted with a red
color
let's try it once again used for example
and it highlights the word used so this
thing I will show you how to do today ok
so first thing you need to do into a
form is take a rich text box from your
tool box and drag and drop here so this
is a rich text box because when you are
highlighting you need this rich text box
and I left my rich text box name default
and I will just anchor this to the frame
so from all sides when I maximize this
this will stretch with the frame I have
taken a text box or text field from here
and it's name also I have left default
which is text box and I have taken a
button to pass the text and then
highlight the design or the word we are
searching for so this is the search text
base
so for the code just double click this
search button which lead us to the event
of this button click here I have
declared integer of vary and variable
index which is initialized is equal to
zero okay and I have also declared a
string variable which stem and whatever
text which is present in the rich text
box so rich text box arrow pointer text
I will transfer into this temp string
then
first of all rich text box arrow pointer
text is equal to null and then rich text
box arrow pointer text is equal to temp
so this will clear all the previous text
in the rich text box and once again it
will put the text into this temp
variable then I have made a while loop
and in this while loop I have provided
the condition so if the index of the
text is less than the maximum index of
the whole text so in the code from index
is less than rich text box arrow
pointing to text there open the last
index of your xbox word which you want
to find so text box arrow pointer text
this text box is this one okay so this
is the rich box name and this is text
box name while this is true I will write
rich text box and a pointer find the
word so text box arrow pointer text this
is the word we need to find comma index
this is the index of the text and then
rich text box arrow pointer text length
comma rich text box finds double colon
null so this is this will search the
text in the xbox control for a string
within our range of text okay and then
when the desired word is found it will
be colored red so
which textbox1 arrow point of selection
back color is equal to color double :
red you can change this your desired
color and then I will increase the index
by one so index is equal to which text
box one arrow pointer text there open
the index of this text which is present
in the text box or text box one arrow
pointer text comma index which I have
declared here plus one okay so and the
while loop is closed here so if you want
just pause the video and copy the code
and then we will try once again to run
the program
okay so let us run the program
so I will open next and I will make it
little bit bigger and I will paste my
text here and this time I want to search
for which so which and press search and
the word which is I liked it with the
layer red color for example I want to
find half that's a search and all the
have highlighted so in this way you can
search a desired word in the text and
highlight it with visual C++ windows
form application I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
