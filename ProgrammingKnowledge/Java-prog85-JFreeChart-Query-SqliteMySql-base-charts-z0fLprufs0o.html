show you how to make a Jeffrey chart
with the help of the query which can be
SQLite or SQL database query so suppose
we want to plot a graph which is date
versus pressure graph so how can we do
with the help of query I will show you
today I will go to my J frame and I have
already created a button called query
chart and I will go to its event action
and action performed here I have written
a try-catch block so you have to do that
prior to writing the code and now my
code will start first of all you have to
light up query string sorry
query is equal to double quotes and
single code here you have to write
select so
let's go to our database I have my
database in which date and pressure is
given and it is in my user info dot of
this so I write in my code date comma
pressure from my table there so death
will be shown on the y-axis and pressure
will be shown on the x-axis if you want
to interchange then you can interchange
also then pressure will be shown on the
y-axis and date will be shown on the
x-axis so whatever you write first here
will be shown on the y-axis so keep in
mind that second thing is very important
here you have to write your JDBC
database connection so I will write the
BC kept a gurdy
doctor set
the variable not a set is equal to so
write this and then write new copy JDBC
data set and finish it
so in here you have to write your JDBC
connections so my JDBC connections are
in the Java connect fie Java connector
dot Java file there is a class called
Java connect so I will copy that
I've got my method name which is
connected DB this one I will write that
and comma when my query variable name
this is my funny gravy this one so I
have written it here
after that I will write in the next line
J be chart chart is equal to
Factory
not
I want to create the line chart so I
will select create line chart and this
will give you a long well used to be
filled here
so after create line chart the first
thing you have to do is to give the
title name so my type name is very chart
then you have to give the x-axis name
which is pressure then give your y-axis
name which is date and then here your
data set name which we have declared
here this you can copy and paste here
after this you have to give the plot
orientation so I will
set my product orientation as dot plot
orientation but vertical and after that
you must write pause true true and and
bracket so we have written this code and
in next line you have to write bar
bar renderer is equal to null and in the
same way category lot lot is equal to
null also and then I think respect wrong
so I corrected it then copy your
renderer which is bar render is equal to
you
and write this and now you will define
your frame in which you will show your
chart chart name them whatever name you
want to give new copy this and paste it
here and bracket like it flows in here
you have to give title to your frame so
I will name very chart this is the title
of my frame and what I want to show in
my claim is my chart so I will copy much
every chart variable and paste it here
then you have to show this frame so you
have to make it set visible set visible
true and then you can defined the size
and shape of your chart so set size I
want to show it
400 by 650 so I am done so this was the
code and lest let's try in one corner
one
go to my code and when I press this
query chart my chart should appear and
you can see my chart is shown here it's
not visible is totally now you can see
pressure was it's date one thing I have
stated incorrectly is here date should
be here and this here this level should
be pressure so I just have to correct
these levels but otherwise everything is
okay so let's go and correct those here
I have done mistakes so this I should be
date date this is the name for XXL and
this is pressure
this is corrected and now let's try and
run the program
click query and
I can see
I talked here
so this here my dates are shown on dates
and here the values of pressure are
shown this is my title and this is my
frame name so everything is working
correctly
one thing more if you want to see bar
chart instead of line chart you should
just go there J chart chart is equal to
charge battery and the chart Factory you
can write it dot create bar chart so if
you do that and now you can run the
program you can see your chart is shown
in the form of bars
sorry
so you can do that also so this was the
tutorial on how to make a Jeffrey chart
with the help of SQL queries so I hope
you have learned something new today and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
