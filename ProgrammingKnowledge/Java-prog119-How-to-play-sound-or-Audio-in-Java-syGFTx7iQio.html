about plain sounds so for example if you
want to play a sound when you hit some
button how can you do that I will show
you today or if some error comes when
you are running your program and you
want to play some sound so you know that
the program is showing ever I will show
you today how you can play that sound so
what I have is a sound file which is
having the extension dot wav wav file
and when I play it now you see it's red
now it's playing some sound for 2
seconds
it says you have mail so I will
incorporate this sound in my Java
program and I will try to play this
sound file with the use of Java program
so let's get started what I will do
first is I will take a button for
example
and I named it as solid
and and it gets type of also sound and I
mean why delegate the wind action will
perform and I will come to its actually
perform method now what I will do is
I'll write input
Stream
right
I'm good
stream ID name it in add semi-colons so
I have taken some imported stream
variable and after that I will make a
try-catch block
I'm not going to make such a tall copy
exception this so I made a try-catch
block here and in the try catch block
you will write in which is this variable
in is equal to new file
then put three yes
and then able to crack it and then
semicolon in here in the bracket I'm
white
once again new PI and one bracket and in
this bracket I will give double quote
and in here you have to provide the path
of the file so whatever you do is when
you go to my file I will go to its
properties security and I will copy the
whole path and then I will paste it here
the file path and you know what to do
just add double slashes
okay
in the next you will write or do
Stream
is it good or I will give some name
variable in our limiters on you s for
example is equal to new copy it and just
it's a new audio stream and break it and
break it closed and this in variable
will go in between here okay and if some
error comes here I'll tell you after
versa and we finish the code then let me
tell you so after that you write audio
player don't
lair not stop
and in between this star bracket here
what you need to do is copy this audio
as variable and paste it here okay so I
think your code is come and if you face
some problem all the program shows some
error then you need to import a file I
will show you which file you need to
import
go here and generally it requires these
two imports imports son dot audio dot
star and import Java dot IO dot star so
if your program is showing some error
then just put this two files and now I
will run my program and see that it
works
and this is my sound button when I click
it I should hear you have file e sound
so I'm clicking it you have mail
you have mail rat mail see so when I
click the button it plays some sound so
this is very useful when you are making
some program and you want to play some
sound when you run the program or some
error also this will help you and the
important thing to remember here is it
only plays the dot wav file or dot wav
file so keep in mind and everything will
be good to go I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
