tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in this video we will see how
linked lists work in Java linked lists
are similar to ArrayList in a sense that
they can contain value or list of values
but basically the DOS those two things
are totally different in terms of
performance and in terms of usage also
so let's see how we can use linked lists
in Java so first of all to declare a
linked list you need to use this keyword
called linked list and in angular
bracket you give the data type of the
list you want to make and then you give
your variable name is equal to new
instance of linked lists okay and for
the first time when you write this code
it will give our use little error
because you haven't included this linked
list class which is there in Java dot
util so you just need to hover over
linked list and then you just need to
import a linked list so just click this
it will import a linked list loss in
your program now to add the values you
can just do it something like this name
dot add and then you can add your name
so for example some name you can add and
some more name you can add like these
and to access the values in the list you
can use this for loop or advanced for
loop as we can say and we can just use
this something like this name is our
list name and then you can just print
this
X and when you run this program you will
be able to see your list something like
this now in order to add some more
values if you want to add the more value
at the top you can just use this list
dot add first and you can add value at
the top of this list something like this
okay if you want to add the value at the
bottom you can do it something like this
name dot add at the last okay so you can
add this to the last for example I want
to add Zack at the last so whenever I
run the program you see in my list at
the top the name Jack is there which we
added at the first add first using add
first method and at the last of my list
there is the name called sack which we
added using add last method in a similar
way you can really move first and last
value by using a remove method so name
dot remove last it will remove the last
value name dot remove first and it will
remove the first value okay so once
again run the program and remove Jack
and Zach from the list okay now if you
want to remove all the data you can just
write name dot clear and it will clear
all the data from the list so something
like this and nothing is printed if you
want to get the size of this list you
can just print it like this
so name dot size it will print the size
of the list on the program and our size
of the list is six because it contains
six elements okay there are some other
methods for example you want to add at
some particular position you can add it
also for example I can add name dot add
and add can be overloaded so you can
give the index of the element for
example I want to add at index one some
element for example index one element
okay and run the program and now at the
index one I have this index 1 0 1 right
so you can add on the basis of index
also in a similar way you can remove on
the basis of index so name dot remove at
index 1 it will remove Patrick because
at first or 0th index jack is there and
at first place or first index Patrick is
there so now it's removed and we have
only 5 onions okay so there are some
other methods like set and get method
which you can use to set and get the
values for example you are not happy
with the name Patrick with small P at
the starting you can change it to
Patrick to the capital P so you can just
write set at the index 1 because petrol
cat is at the index 1 0 this one
Patrick is one and we will remove this
otherwise it will remove the first index
and then we can just write here Patrick
with capital P okay and then semicolon
and run the program and it adds Patrick
with capital P so it changed this name
with this name so setting change the
name or modified your lists at the
particular index so there are some other
method and which you can search by
yourselves you just need to write the
name of the list and dot and here comes
all the method which you can use to
access the values to the list insert
values in the list sort value there is a
method called sort so you can sort it
and you can even check if the list is
empty or not and there are so many
method which you can just use and see
what suits your requirement so I hope
