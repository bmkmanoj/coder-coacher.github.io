bootstrap tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how to download
and install bootstrap on our Windows
operating system now in this video we
will talk about one of the most
important concept in bootstrap which is
grid system now in bootstrap grid system
you can think of a bootstrap web page
like a grid and this grid contains rows
and columns okay
so similarly bootstrap grid system is
made up of three things two things are
obvious one is row and second is column
and these rows and columns are contained
in a component called container okay and
in a bootstrap web page you can create
up to twelve columns and unlimited
amount of rows so this is a basic rule
in bootstrap right now what is a
container in bootstrap grid system in
bootstrap grid system we need a
container to hold rows and columns as I
have already told you and this container
is a simple div element with a class
called
container okay so it will look like this
and in bootstrap there are mainly two
types of containers in bootstrap one is
a fixed container and other is a fluid
container so as the name suggests first
container with this name called
container itself it's of fixed width
okay
and whenever you use this class called
container fluid it will take the whole
width of your device which you are using
so for example if
you are using mobile it will take the
whole width of your mobile if you are
using computer it will take the whole
width of your computer now let's see
this in practical so in the last video
we have seen how to create this hollow
world web page in bootstrap so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a div
element inside the body of our web page
so Dave and inside this step element we
will call a class called container okay
now inside this body of the div I will
just add this HTML tag with hollow world
and I'm going to save it and I'm going
to run this and when I run this you can
see this hello world text is aligned at
the center of your web page so if you
have something like a big sentence it
will be aligned at the center of your
webpage with a fixed width okay so let's
do something like this so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to just copy this and
I'm going to paste it few times and I'm
going to save it and I will refresh my
page and you can see it's nicely aligned
at the center of our webpage with a
fixed width okay now if you use this
container fluid with your dev element so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change this to container fluid okay
and I am going to save this and now once
again I'm going to refresh my page and
now it takes the whole web page width of
your browser okay so this is the basic
difference so if you want that your
content on your web page takes the whole
width of the web page
then you use this class called container
fluid or you if you want that your a
text must be aligned nicely at the
center of your webpage then you use this
class called container okay and remember
this will still be responsive so when I
you know change the width of my browser
it will be responsive so both container
and container fluid classes you can use
and it will still be responsive right
but the basic difference is this
container class has a fixed width and
container fluid class has a width which
is the width of your browser on your
device so this is how we use containers
in bootstrap in the next coming videos
we will talk about rows and columns so
stay tuned and please rate comment
