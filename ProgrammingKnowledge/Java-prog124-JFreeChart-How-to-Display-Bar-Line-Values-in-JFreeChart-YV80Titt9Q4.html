I have shown you how to show a reference
line like this black line on your J free
chart in this video I will show you how
to show these number on your charts so
you can see this bar showing for this
bar is showing three and this bar is
showing three point two five earlier
when I have shown you how to make a bar
chart or line chart I haven't shown you
how to show these value on your bars or
lines so in this video I will show you
how to show these number on your chart
okay so let's get started
so what I have right now is I have this
frame which I will use for demonstration
of this video and what I have is this
bar chart so sorry this bar chart I will
make it a little bit small so you can
see so I have here a bar chart which
shows on the reference line which I have
shown you in the last video but it does
not show the values on top of these bars
so on the first look you cannot
determine how what is the value related
to this line or all the bars so I will
show some what
when you off this bar is I will show you
with the help of the code so let's get
started and write the code I will close
everything and I will go to the jframe I
will go to the button which opens my
dear free chart in case you don't know
this code for Jeffrey chart these codes
I have shown you in the video
number 62 and above so basically in my
videos wherever you find Jeffrey chart
it's related to charts so if you don't
know these codes go to video number 62
and above I think just take a look and
go at the bottom of your code and if you
have followed my Jeffrey chart videos
you will find this kind of a code there
at the bottom of your code or JP chart
and what you need to search there is
this category plot variables so category
plot P is equal to charge cat category
plot you go there and just below that
you have to write your code for showing
the numbers so what you will do is this
category plot just
right final before this category plot
peeve variable and below that category
plot T or whatever your variable name is
right bar renderer
I like this bartender and it's variable
name so
bar renderer okay and is equal to in
brackets just copy this variable Miranda
and paste it here and just after the
bracket right lot dot okay
our variable name is P here so just copy
this category you plot variable and
write P dot get
renderer
and
close the bracket okay and in the next
line right decimal format okay
this line we are writing first of all I
will define the DEF a decimal format
variable named decimal format is equal
to new copy this and after this provide
bracket and ragged clothes and in
between this bracket you write double
quotes and in here right hash so this
hash indicates the position of decimal
so for example I want to show two
position before the decimal and two
position after the decimal so right hash
hash dot hash hash and if you want to
show only one position after the decimal
just write hash hash dot hash so it
depends upon you how much resolution of
your values you want I want ninety-nine
point nine nine so two values after
after my decimal so I write hash hash
dot hashes so this is decimal format in
the next I will copy this bar renderer
variable and paste it here dot set
item-level
so we said dot said item
once again said item level generator I
was looking for but yeah it's here said
item level generator and in the bracket
right the new
standard chart
standard category item level generator
right this and select the second one so
this will provide once again I will show
you what I have taken renderer dot set
item level no set category I have taken
this wrong to take this once again dot
set
said item level generator once again and
in standard category level generator
okay and instead of these two null
values I will provide some values here
so right double ports and these
semicolon and right to here okay and in
here in the place of second null copy
this decimal format variable and paste
it here so our code looks like this
renderer dot set item level generate a
new standard category item level
generator and in bracket write this in
the next line copy this category plot
variable name paste it here dot set
renderer
and your lender or name will
automatically come here which is bar
render on this one okay
and after that right
once again renderer which is this bar
printer dot dot
fact base positive item level position
so I will select this and instead of
this null right new item
and on
so item
liberal position and right click this
okay so I have right hundreds at base
was a positive item level position new
item level position and it will
automatically take item level position
at Center and text anchor at top left I
will leave them as default value if
required I will change them and in the
next line this is the last line so be
patient
copy this renderer variable once again
dot set item
levels visible and in between right true
and now our last line so in this last
line copy your chart variable name which
is this chart it's before Jeffrey chart
chart is equal to so you have definitely
written if you have followed my code
this variable name chart which is before
Jeffrey chart and in the last line right
chart dot get category plot dot set
render the and your renderer name so
these are the few lines you need to
write in order to show the values and
now it's time to test our code works or
not and my Jeffrey J frame is running
and I press this and you can see these
values you is shown here so this
represent ninety-eight point zero eight
hundred one hundred ninety nine point
eighteen so in this way you can show the
values on your bar I can also change the
position of these values for example
instead of Center here when Drew said
base position item lobby position in
here item Lam Belanger dot instead of
Center you right
outside 12 I will take outside 12 and
instead of top text anchor right dot 1/2
essence Center and let's see how our
program works so when I click this and
my values are shown above so you can
play with the code and see what is what
code fits you so that's all for this
video I hope you have learned something
new this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
