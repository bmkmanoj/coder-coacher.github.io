HTML tutorial for beginners using html5
in this video we will learn about the
new element which was introduced in
html5 which are section header footer
and nav so these are the four new
element along with the other elements
which are introduced in html5 and let's
see how we can use them so in the last
video we have seen how we can create
this kind of HTML layout page with
header navigation bar and the section
and the footer and for creating this
layout we have used this div element
along with some ID and the styles like
for header we have given some style for
navigation also we have given some style
here and we have segregated or divided
our code in for section of word
divisions which was header navigation
section and foot right now in html5
these four elements are introduced which
are called header nav section and footer
which we can use instead of this div
element so your code can be more clear
so for example in the last video I have
defined this develoment and I have
defined this ID header right now instead
of using this div element you can use a
header element like this and it will
still be same right and for navigation
instead of using navigation we will add
a element called nav and in here instead
of this develoment and ID call section
we can add element called a section and
end it with section and for the last we
have defined of
footer develoment so instead of using
this develoment we can use a element
called photo and and your footer in here
so instead of using these develoment
with the ids you can use these new
elements which was introduced in HTML
file which are called header nav section
and footer ok and for the styling of
these elements what you can do here is
instead of using hash header you can
directly use the name of your element
which is header and the second element
was the nav which is this element and
then third element was the section
element and the fourth element was the
footer right like this so you can use
these four element and these styles with
them which we have seen in the last
video I'm not going to change these
styles just change the element name
instead of the ID of the element right
save your code and refresh it again
and it will be same and what these
elements are doing here they are helping
us to define our style in an easy way
for header footer and nav and section
right instead of defining long div and
ID you can directly use them and then
your code readability also is better
when you use these elements okay so in
this way you can use these four elements
in html5 I hope you enjoyed this video
