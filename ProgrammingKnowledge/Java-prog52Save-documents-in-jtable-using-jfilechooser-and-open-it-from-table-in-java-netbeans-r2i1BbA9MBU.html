video number 49 I have shown you how to
use jfilechooser
like this and when you choose any file
the file path the absolute file path
will be copied into your text field
today we are going to learn how to save
this path into the table and then by
clicking your table how to open the same
path so in this way you can learn how to
manage your documents in a table so
let's get started first of all what I
have done in addition to attach button
and text field I've made one table which
in which we will save the document path
and different comments I also taken one
text field for comments so which type of
document is this we will write the
comment in this text field and the
number what is the serial number of the
document I will enter it here so I will
name my text field as view comment and
here
I will name my text field as doc
okay in addition I also drag a button to
save the document in the table so in all
I made these three text field this is
for Palazzo I will omit a spot so I have
done that already plus in my database I
have made one table called document
table and I made three columns document
ID comment and path in my database so I
have three columns in my database and my
table name or database table name is
document table so you can just do that
you know how to do that in my previous
tutorials I have already told you now we
will write a code to save your document
go to right-click your saved document
button go to event action and action
performed and here I already made my
trackage blog in order to save time and
also when I save document I have already
made this comment that document is a
document saved now I will write the code
for inserting or saving my document path
tree I string X Q and
is equal to and inside this double code
slide and sort into your table the
database table name cement-based opinion
is talking in table write it here and
then in the bracket write the three
column name document ID comment in path
so I have written document ID comment in
path and then write values and in
brackets we have two for question marks
as always we do for saving only three I
think for three columns and then you
have to write PST as always thought dot
statement SQL and then write a st not
sad string and here my first column name
post this here I'm taking the value from
first column for first column so just go
to our design tab and just copy your
variable name of the path text fields
for the copy and text engine is part so
I copy dot get text okay you have to do
that and for comment and ID also do the
same so I have already done that and
here numbering this numbering is very
important so our first column is
document ID so our document ID we are
taking in this text field get text so
this is first and then comments this is
our second and this is our third because
of the path this is for path here one
two three one two three okay then
after that wide PST dot execute and this
and after you save your table your table
must be refreshed instantaneously so I
made the code for that already you can
you know how to make it I'm just I copy
after my trycatch or refreshing the
table so now let's try to run the
program so my program is here for
example i will copy some path let's see
this my path is copied here I will give
it a name or comment P so it's a picture
so I named it this picture and here I'll
give the document number and when I save
button so when I click the Save button
document and saved here your document is
saved you can see one picture comment
and here is your path now I will show
you how to open this document by
clicking in the table so cancel it and
go to your design code so click your
table right click event an event mouse
and mouse clicked and you go to mouse
click event here and if you remember in
the twenty-third video if you don't
remember
in the 23rd video I have shown you how
to open a document if you have its spot
so if you don't know how to open the
document by clicking on button or any
where in the table just go and see that
video so I am what I am doing I am just
copying my code from my 23rd video and
I'm pasting it in my
mouse click event so like this fight
click event
mouse mouse click and I am just pasting
it here go and see the twenty-third
video if you don't know this code now
what you have to do is you have to write
end go because we are taking the row
from the table and whatever go to your
table and whatever is your table name my
table name is L give me that doc doc
table document table and copy variable
name and Rho is equal to int Rho is
equal to document table dot get selected
through this one you just
write this code doctor net spring any
variable name you for example is equal
to write in the bracket right your table
name a table M is no command table dot
gap model dot get value add here you
have to give the row numbers of my
row number is because I'm taking the
path from my card or my second column
because in the database I have my path
saved in 0 1 2 0 1 2 second column so
you write 2 here because I am taking
path from second column dot o string so
this is your value and what you have to
do after that is just copy your value
from string and whatever is your path
just instead of path which we have
rewritten in 23rd video instead of part
just copy the value string variable this
string variable I have pasted here
instead of path because from I am taking
the path from the table in the variable
value and then I am just pasting my path
here so indirectly I'm just I will open
the path so now I will try to run my
program know something either is there
so it's 3 what is
so
we try to run the program
and this is my input and when I take
this row I must open my document so I
clicked and my document is open so you
can see by just clicking in the table
you open your document like this so it's
not a big port you have to write in the
table click event this code so I hope
you have learned something new today
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
