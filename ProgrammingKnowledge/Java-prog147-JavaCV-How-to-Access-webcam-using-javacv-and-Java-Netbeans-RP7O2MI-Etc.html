last video I have shown you how to
configure and install Java C V on your
NetBeans IDE and I have also shown you
how to run a sample program with the
help of your and NetBeans IDE so when
your program runs when you click this
button it opens our image which you want
to open in a canvas frame now in this
video I will show you how to open a
webcam with the help of your java c b d
jar files ok so this video will be
dependent on the last video and you need
to configure and install java cv before
writing the code for opening the webcam
with your java c and java program so i
recommend just watch that video and then
watch this video so now let's get
started I will take a button maybe I
will resize it I will change its text as
open web cam and I will change the
variable name also
for example web cam capture and now I
will double click this button or I will
right click and go to event action and
action perform and I reach to this
button action perform so first of all
what we need to do here is we need to
open our web cam so for opening our web
cam we will write the code so for
opening the web cam just write this code
here
and it will look like this right
see we capture and give it a variable
name in my case I have given this
variable in capture is equal to OpenCV
underscore hi GUI
dot CV create camera capture and in the
bracket past the argument 0 this
argument 0 indicate that we want to open
our webcam from our computer if you have
some other extension for example you
have plug in webcam 2nd webcam or other
devices then this number can change for
example 1 or 2 and you can open those
devices also other cameras also when you
change this number so it's showing me
this red line I will see what is the
error and it's showing me that I need to
import these four files so i will
provide click and I will click fix
imports and my error is gone ok and now
in the second line what I will do is I
will set the height and width of the
camera frame so that for example you
need to have a frame of certain size and
in that you want to see show the image
which is captured by the camera so in
the next line write this so just the
right OpenCV underscore hi GUI dot CB
set capture property and in the bracket
we are going to pass for argument first
is this capture variable
which we have recently created CV
capture variable here and the second
argument give comma and second argument
will be the specification that you want
to set the height or width so in first
gate we are going to set the height so
right OpenCV underscore high GUI dot cv
underscores cap underscore drop
underscore frame the underscore height
so this shows that we are setting height
of the frame of webcam and the next
argument would be the size which you
want to set so for example I want to set
720 sighs that's why I have written 720
here and in the same way I will just
copy this line once again and I will
this I will paste it here or just below
here so and in the next line I will set
the width so everything will be same
just I will change this instead of this
height I will write CV and you can
choose the width from here right so
let's see where is the width so with its
side here it's CV underscore cap
underscore prop underscore frame
underscore width instead of this height
just replace it with width and this you
can also change so for example I want to
say in the set the width as 1 - 8 0
so in these two lines I have set the
height and width of the frame which we
are capturing from the webcam okay and
in the next line we are going to create
a IPL image format so just write this
here right IPL image grow and give it a
variable name I have given it a variable
name it called grab the image is equal
to OpenCV underscore hi GUI dot fee me
very frame and here as argument you will
pass this CV capture so whatever image
you are taking from the webcam you are
passing it as an argument for the IPL
image and now what we want to do is we
want to show this image continuously so
that it seems like webcam is showing a
video or it's showing the image
continuously right so let's write the
code for that app but first we need to
create a canvas frame so let's create a
canvas frame here so in here right this
line right canvas frame and give it a
variable name in my case I have given
the name frame is equal to new canvas
frame and as argument you will give the
title of your frame so I have given the
canvas frame title as webcam here so do
this and now we will create a while loop
so let's create a by loop really quick
here while and in while loop we will
give the condition first of all
we will take this canvas frame variable
frame and we will write frame dot is
visible so if while the frame is visible
and this grabbed image should not be a
null so I will just copy this line up to
here and I will give here as a condition
here so right frame dot visible and
grabbed image is equal to open CV
underscore hi GUI dot C we query frame
and which is having the argument capture
and I will just delete this and I will
just close it in a bigger bracket and
while this is not equal to null we are
going to show the image okay so what I
have done is I am seeing while my frame
is visible and my grabbed image is not
equal to null and in the next line I
will simply show my image so I will
write this so right frame dot show image
and in here as argument passed this
grabbed image here okay so it's done
and now we are ready to run our program
so I will right click and run the
program and when I click this it should
open our webcam so let's try and click
it I click it and it's opening my webcam
and you will be able to see my hand
gestures now and one thing you will
notice is when you try to close this
frame here it will not open because it's
running in a while loop so this problem
can be solved by running this program in
a thread so let's try and fix this
problem
you see here it's not closing from here
so I will close it from here and so in
the code here what will we do is we will
enclose this code in a thread so in this
code just go at the top and we are going
to create a thread so right thread and
you can give any name to the threads for
example webcam is equal to new thread
and the bracket close it here open it
here and close it here ok and now in the
one step below this thread what you need
to do is you need to create a run
program for this strength so right
public void run and just close it here
open and close this and in here I need
to provide the bracket and in here also
I need to program provider bracket and
here also it's showing error so I will
give semicolon here so that my thread is
created and it when I press this webcam
capture button it should start my thread
so one thing is left is I need to start
my thread so I will just copy the name
of my thread which is webcam and after
the completion of this Fred function I
will just write webcam dot start so this
button will start our thread so just
write this code and if you want you can
pause the video and copy the code and
now we are going to run the pro program
once again and hopefully it will run
perfectly now so I will right click and
run the program once again and I will
click this button let me close this last
program and now I will click this open
webcam and it will open the webcam you
can see it here webcam is open and when
you click this close button from here it
should close the zip this canvas frame
so let's see yes it's closing the canvas
frame you can open the webcam once again
and close it once again and open it once
again
so now it's running perfectly fine
so in this way you can open the webcam
with the help of open CV or Java CV and
I hope you have enjoyed this video
please keep watching these videos and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
