Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how to use
for loops in Scala so let's get started
first of all we will see the basic
syntax of for loop in Scala and then we
are going to see how to use them so the
basic syntax is you use the for keyword
and then in parentheses you declare a
variable and then you declare this kind
of arrow which is pointing to words the
variable and then you give some range so
you give here some range here and then
in the curly brackets you just execute
some statements so something like this
so this is the basic syntax now let's
see how we can actually use a for loop
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
declare war variable I I don't need to
declare it like this for loop will
automatically take this I as a variable
which is mutable variable and then we
need to provide a range so range can be
given in this form for example so I will
give the range between 1 to 5 so what
this basically means is we want to
provide the range between 1 to 5 and
let's say we want to print the value of
I so we can do it something like this
print the value of I using keyword -
okay and then let's print the value and
let's execute our code and let's see if
it runs or not so you can see it prints
the value from 1 to 5 so in here
this too is a methods when you hover
over this - you can see it's a method
and which takes one argument which is an
integer right so you can give the range
something like this so this - method you
apply on integer so you can just write
one dot and then this method take an
argument so you can give this argument
like this also and the result will be
the same so you can see the result will
be the same there is one more method
called
until you can use with for loop to
generate this kind of range so you can
use instead of two you can just write
until here and then you just write six
here instead of five because it goes
until six which is five okay and once
again I will just print the value of I
and you can see the value of I using
until let me write until here so we will
understand which value is coming from
where so you can see one two five using
the two method and one to five using the
--until method you can also write until
like this as we have done with two like
this and this will also work so let me
run the code and the result will be same
so - and until our methods which gives
us the range so let me repeat what I
said so this I is a variable then this
arrow which is pointing towards the
variable is called the generator and
this one to five is called the range
okay and then inside the for loop you
just execute some statement now you can
also give multiple ranges inside a for
loop so let me show you that also so I
will just copy this for loop and paste
it like this and I will just press
control shift F to just format my code
and you can do something like this so
one two for example
nine here and then using a semicolon you
can provide the next range so for
example I can write J and then this
arrow which points towards that J and
then I can just write one two three here
for example and then we want to print
the value of I and J so I'm going to
just give a space here and then print
the value of J here right so let me give
a space here
and let me just run the code once again
and you can see it prints the value of I
and J from here so you can see the
result here 1 1 1 2 &amp;amp; 1 3 so 1 2 3 is
the value of J and 1 1 1 is the value of
I so it's like a nested loop and after
this range is exhausted this J starts
again so jump the value of J starts from
1 2 3 again 1 2 3 again and the value of
I goes until 9:00 so it's like a nested
loop I must write multiple ranges here
ok because we are providing multiple
ranges here now you can use for loop to
iterate over lists also lists we haven't
learned yet but I just want to show this
example to useful for example I declare
a well LST for list and then let's just
create this list so is equal to list
which is a keyword and using this
keyword we can create a list so for
example 1 comma 2 comma 3 comma 4 or any
number 5 6 so these are the numbers I'm
giving here and then this creates a list
and this list I can provide instead of
this range so I can just write I using
list here so this is a list we have
created and then this for loop will
iterate over this list and print every
member of the list 1 2 3 5 4 it will
print like this okay so let's run the
code and let's see what happens so you
can see it prints the member of the list
so you can use for loop over lists also
now you can use for loop for filtering
purpose also so for example we have this
list I'm going to just copy this for
loop once again and paste it here and I
will format my code and here I can give
our if condition for filtering our
my output so I will just give the
semicolon here and then I will just
write if the value of for example I is
less than so if value of I is less than
6 then only I want to print the value of
5 ok so this is the condition I want to
you know validate and if I is less than
6 then only the value of I will be
printed so let me just write here
filters using filters and let me run the
code and let's see what happens so you
can see it prints 1 2 3 5 4 5
but whatever value in the list is
greater than 6 it will not print so for
example this value is 6 so we are just
validating less than 6 so until 5 right
so it will not print 6 or 76 or 9 or
this value 6 so it will just filter out
these values right so you can use F to
filter out the values also now in the
previous videos I have told you you can
use if conditions as statements and
expressions same you can do with the for
loops also so till now we have seen how
we can execute this for loop as a
statement let's see how we can just
execute these for loop as expressions
also so I will just copy and paste this
for loop once again so for using this
for loop as an expression what I need to
do is I need to give here a curly
bracket instead of parentheses so
instead of parentheses I will use the
curly bracket and then I will just write
yield here okay and whatever value I
want to return from here I can write
inside the if statement so for example I
want to return the square of I for
example so I will just something like
this and then I want to store the result
in some variable so I can just write
here result and then equals and then we
can print the value of result using
print line so just write print line and
then we will just print the value of
result so result equals the value of
result which is this one and let's see
what happens when we run the code so you
can see the result is a list so it's
giving us the square of the result so
earlier the filter was something like
this so the result of one squared is
equal to 1 then 2 squared 3 squared the
value of square of 5 and square of 4 and
once again the value of square of 5 okay
so it gives us the list of the results
so if you want to use for loop as an
expression you use this keyword yield
and instead of parentheses you use these
curly brackets okay if you just want to
remove these semicolon here you can do
this also using this curly bracket so
this is good thing in this curly bracket
that you can remove this semicolon which
you have to use in the case of this
parenthesis okay so in the curly bracket
you can just remove the semicolon and
the code will work just fine so let me
run the code and it runs fine okay so
this is how you can use for loop in
Scala I hope you enjoyed this video
