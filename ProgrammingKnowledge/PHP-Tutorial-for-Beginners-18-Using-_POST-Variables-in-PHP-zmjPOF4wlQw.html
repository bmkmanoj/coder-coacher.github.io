video I'm going to show you how to use
post global or super global variables in
your PHP script in the last video I've
shown you how do you get a variable
which is also a super global variable in
PHP and I have shown you how you can get
some values something like this whenever
you can make a form and when you submit
this form you will be able to see the
response and your URL also will be
modified like this the where the key
which you pass and the value key and
value and these are separated by this
end and this is prepared by PHP for you
so you don't need to do anything here
right now in this video we are going to
see the post variable basically post
behaves like get but it's a little
different and I'm going to show you what
is the difference between them but first
of all we will prepare our form so in
the last video I have made this form
like this this kind of a form in HTML
and this was the code so if you don't
know how to make this form just watch
the last video and you will be able to
good to go and this time I want to make
it something different so for example I
want to make a form to use a login this
will you know in real-life situation you
don't use this kind of login page but
for this example let's make a user login
so for example I have a student info and
I want to for example I want the user
student to enter is username so I will
write user name and his password
password and the
name variable I will change it to use a
name and this name I will change to pass
word okay and I have this luck submit
button here so now when I save this I
want to save this first of all okay so
when I save this this form will be
modified like this so I want to enter
the username and password and I want to
submit this okay so if you don't know
how to make this just copy it okay and
in the place of this form action I'm
going to change this PHP file to the
post method but let me make the new post
the post dot PHP file so I have made
this new file I will rename it as save
as post on this post dot PHP okay save
it and this post dot PHP I will just
replace here in the student dot PHP and
I will replace this by post on this post
dot PHP okay this is a student dot PHP
which I have made in the last video and
in the action of this I will pass my new
PHP file which is post okay and the
method this time will be post last time
it the method was get because I was
showing the get a demonstration get
variable demonstration this time the
method will be post okay so just copy
this kind of form or make this kind of a
form which can take the username and
password and I will save it now I come
to my PHP here and here for example I
just want to display if the username and
password is correct or not so for
example I I can say if
first of all how to declare this post
you just need to use this dollar sign
then underscore and just write post post
and the square sign and semicolon and
here comes your variable okay
so whatever you have given here username
and password which is equal to name just
pass it here so we are indirectly
passing the value of username and
password to this post dot PHP okay in a
similar way I can past the password like
this and it will give me username and
password right but let's make this
little bit interesting and I want to
check whether my username is equal to
something so I can say user if username
is equal to for example what can be the
name mark okay and let's make it small
mark and password this end and my
password is equal to for example some
name or some password PA SS okay so if
the username and password is correct
I want to display some message echo
username and password is correct for
example as I want to display else should
be else I want to display user name and
password is not correct
okay so just copy this and paste it
there and is not correct okay so
now I will just remove this and
hopefully we will not face any problem
let's include brackets here so that it
will be more visible that we have to and
conditions here I will save this and I
will check whether my username and
password is correct or not so I will go
to the browser refresh it and let's give
the name mark and password pass
and ideally we should see the message
username and password is correct let's
see yes I can see the message for
example I enter some weird username
submit username and password is not
correct right so and let's make this
password character hidden or masked by
some character so what I can do here is
I can go to student dot PHP and I can
change this type to password password
and then when i refresh this form just
go back and come here once again and
mark and when I type password hopefully
to mask my password no let's see what
can we do okay we haven't saved this so
we need to save it first and then we
load it and hopefully it will work yes
it's working
okay so pass and still we are getting
the message and it says do you want to
remember this password I don't want to
remember this but yeah so it's working
like this but the important thing to
notice here is it's not modifying your
URL and it's different from get variable
in a way that in get method you will be
able to see your URL or whatever you
have you whatever variable you have
passed from this to the
to the other PHP file right but this
will not show any URL so whenever you
want to use a some I mean secret stuff
for example password you don't want to
use get method because whenever you for
example it's a get method and you will
post something from or you just give
some values here username and password
and submit this you will be able to see
your password here okay or other users
will be able to see this password in the
URL which is unsecure so whenever you
need to make some kind of login form you
just use post method instead of this get
method because this will give you the
URL or this will pass your variables in
the URL and your URL can anybody can
read this URL the second thing is for
example if you are making some side
which care which will be able to upload
some files for example a PHP file or a
video file then whenever you post this
file this URL can become you know you
URL can become very large it can have
thousands and you know thousands and
thousands of characters which will
become very big right and this is also
undesirable so in case of big files or
whenever you want to post something very
big or whenever you want to have a form
which is submitting a big data or a
private data just use post okay
otherwise if you want to see the link
here see the values which are posted or
which are submitted then use get
variable so this is the small little
difference between post and get so post
doesn't modify your URL but it will
definitely
submit your data but in the case of get
it will modify your URL and if you have
a big data submission it will have very
big URL right and just to check whether
it's really giving me the username and
password I can just echo the username
and password here for example echo for
example post this one as a username so I
can just concatenate use the name and
this should be like this and cut
catenate and password right just
concatenate password password thing and
then our password post here and then
maybe we can add this break so that will
be printed
in the next line or the message will be
printed in the next line okay so
hopefully it will give me the username
and password mark us for example submit
it and you will be able to see this
username is equal to mark password is
equal to pass right so it transfers your
valuable to your PHP file but it doesn't
modify your URL so this is the video
