tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are math operators and how we can
do simple arithmetic using those math
operators and we will try to make a
simple kind of calculation or calculator
in our code so let's imagine or let's
declare two variables x and y and both
will be integers and one more variable
we are going to declare and this will be
our answer
so also variable and then we will assign
X is equal to some value for example 20
and Y is equal to some other value for
example 30 right and now I want to
perform some operations on x and y
depending upon what I want so for
example I want to add these two values I
can add these two values and store the
result in the third variable which is
also an integer like this so X plus y
it's the same as we do in simple
mathematics right this plus symbol adds
two values it's a really simple right so
now whenever we do X plus y and we
assign this value to the answer variable
this will contain your answer of X plus
y right so we can just write system dot
out
dot print line and then we can just
print this answer right so we can just
write answer is equal to so in double
quotes we will say answer is equal to
and then there comes a operator called
concatenation operator when you use this
plus in car in your print function then
this plus is called the concatenation
operator and this concatenation means
that you want to add this string and
this variable or value okay so this
function is intelligent enough to you
know sense that this is a string and
this is your integer but using this
concatenation operator you can you know
print them as a single line so let's try
and run this program
okay and this gives us a result answer
is equal to 50 which is true 20 plus 30
is equal to 50 now to subtract these two
values you just need to add this minus
symbol before between these X&amp;amp;Y okay and
let's try to run the program once again
and now answer is minus 10 which is true
20 minus 30 is equal to minus then okay
now in order to do multiplication we
cannot do X because X can be a variable
so to multiply to these two numbers we
use a symbol called this Astrix okay
Astrix or star or whatever you say and
this asterisk multiply the values which
are I you know we want to multiply
okay and once we run the program and it
gives the answer 600 which is true 20
into 30 is 600 now division is little
bit not tricky but interesting so when
you want to divide two values for
example I will divide these two values
you will expect some decimal values as
an answer right but let's try to you get
the answer and answer is zero in this
case because we have declared all these
values as an integer okay
so answer is also an integer a variable
and X and y are also integer values
right and whenever we divide two values
the answer will be integer and if this
answer is not integer then you know you
get zero so for example we divide 60 by
30 right or 600 by 30 let's divide 60 by
30 for now and compile the program and
we get 2 right but when we get some
numbers which are not totally divisible
what is the answer in this case in this
case also the answer is true too because
this integer value
you know our quotient for this value is
2 the answer for the division of 70 by
30 is 2 point something right but
because this answer and these two are
integer we will only get the integer
value out of this point value and we
will not get whole division value which
is 2 point something but to get this
decimal value as an answer you can
declare your variables as W so when you
do something like this see what's the
answer now the answer is
two point three three and this is the
exact answer what we were expecting
right so when you declare your variable
as W we'll get the decimal values and
when you declare your variable as int
you will just get the whole quotient
value not the remainder okay so when you
run the program you will only get the
quotient okay now there is one more
interesting operator in Java which is
called modulus operator and this gives
you the remainder of the division so
once I run this program the remainder is
10 right so when you divide 70 by 30 you
will you know get the answer for example
two point three three but when you are
divide them and the whole answer will be
two quotient will be two and the
remainder will be ten right so modulus
operators returns you the remainder of
the division okay so these are some
important math operators in Java one is
plus second is minus third is so let's
recap so first math operator is minus
second math operator is - OH or first
operator is plus and second is minus
third is multiplication fourth is
division and the fifth one is this
modulus okay so these are some of the
math operators in Java and we have also
learned that when you I use this plus in
your print line function argument this
will concatenate concatenation means
joining two values right so this will
concatenate your value
as an answer so I hope you have enjoyed
