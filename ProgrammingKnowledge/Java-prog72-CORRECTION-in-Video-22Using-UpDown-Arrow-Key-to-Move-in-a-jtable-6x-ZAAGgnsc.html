gonna talk about the J table and some
problem which is faced by some of the
viewers and J table so what is the
problem I will show you first
the problem is when you click your J
table and in the 22nd video - n - 20
second video I have shown how to change
your text field value when you press
down arrow or up arrow for example my
mouse is yeah but I'm not clicking the
table by my mouse but I will press down
arrow this I have shown in the twenty
second video and when I press down arrow
for example just see here what happens
so here it's 2 second employee ID and
but it's it's showing employee info 1 so
it's a mistake once again when I press
the down arrow it shows two but my focus
is on third employee for 3/5 so my
employee in Ho is always trailed by one
but I want 15 blind because my focus is
on fifth
so I will show you how to correct this
problem
once again I will show you what isn't
problem here is to focus on fifth and
here we can see him blind number four so
it should be employing number five
because the focus is on five so I will
show you how to correct it today now go
to your design jframe and right-click
that table and event key and keypress
event so na in the last video that is
twenty second video I have shown you
that you have to create an event which
is key press event when you click it you
can see the code of the key press event
that is up and down key when they are
pressed they will show the respective
value in J field
so in this method just copy your whole
method up to here and cut your method so
this your key press event is empty now
so once again what I am done is a right
click event key three key press event in
20 second video I have shown that you
have to write your code into three key
press event so go there and just cut
your program or copy your program
whatever you want once again go to your
table right-click it event
and go to hkey and this time you will
you must go to key release not key
pressed but he release just click key
release event and you will go to its
method and whatever code you have copied
just paste that code here so what we
have done is we have cut our code from
key press event and pasted it in key
release event just that you have to do
and then we try to run the program
once again
and now when you click or when you press
down Greinke see here what is focus and
what is the value here so I have press
for example down key now it's showing
the correct values focuses on employee
ID - and you you can see employee ID 2 3
3 4 4 5 5
so now I hope I corrected my small
mistake which I have done in 22nd video
so I apologize not apologize because the
code is the same but it's trailing by 1
value so I hope you can change your code
and now no code will work ok so this was
a tutorial and please create comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
