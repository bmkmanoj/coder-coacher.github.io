you how you can download and install
Eclipse IDE for Java development on your
Mac operating system so let's get
started
so first of all you need to have Java
JDK and Java Runtime environment
installed before installing Eclipse IDE
on your Mac now in order to check
whether the Java JDK and JRE is
installed on your system the simple
check is to go to the system preferences
there is the icon for System Preferences
you can just open the system preferences
and at the bottom you will be able to
see this Java I can here and by this job
I can you will be able to know that Java
is already installed on your system
right so in my case Joe is already
installed but if in your case it's not
installed then you need to install it
and I have already made a video on how
to install Java on your Mac operating
system so if you don't have Java just
you just need to install it first and
then come to this video and continue ok
so just check if the Java is there and
if the Java is already there then we are
good to go now the next step is to open
your favorite browser and search for
download Eclipse for Mac you just need
to search that and the first link which
will appear here is from www.elllo.org
Lash downloads ok so just click the
first link and now they keep on changing
the Eclipse website so in your case it
may be different in future so just keep
an eye on that so what I'm going to do
here is I will just scroll down a little
and I can see get Eclipse neon which is
the newest version I think and I can see
this download 64 bit button here
but for now I'm not going to press this
button I'm going to just press this link
which says download packages ok so don't
click this button which says download
64-bit but click this button which says
download packages and I'm going to just
click this link we're just going to open
this kind of interface now this website
is intelligent enough to recognize that
you have Mac OS so it will automatically
select Mac OS X for you but if it
doesn't you can just choose it from here
ok now you can just call a little bit
down and you have few options the first
option is Eclipse IDE for Java EE
developers and you can also see what are
the tools which you will get from this
you know this IDE right second is the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers and the
description of all the tools are given
here but if you download for example
this Jo IDE for Java EE you don't have
to worry about Java IDE for Java
developers because in future you can
always add this you know this support to
your Eclipse IDE right so if by mistake
you wanted to download this one and you
downloaded this one in future you can
easily extend your Eclipse IDE to
support this one also or if you want to
support C++ you can do that also in
future so I'm going to just download
this first version right and I have the
64-bit operating system so I will just
choose this and I'm going to just click
this link which say a 64-bit right and
now it's going to redirect me to the
other page now in here you have the
download button and if you can scroll
down you have other you know mirrors all
so you can see IBM and some other
mirrors for example spring by pivotal
and other mirrors right so if you are
you know comfortable with this mirror
which is near to you then just click
this otherwise you can choose other
mirror from this link right let me just
open it for just showing you that what
are the other mirror which are available
you can just choose for example spring
by pivotal just click get it and then
you can scroll down and you have the
option for for example window which we
don't want you have this Mac and then
you have this option with saves Eclipse
IDE for Java EE developers right so you
can just click this and you will be good
to go ok otherwise you can just simply
click this download button and it's
going to download that for you ok so I'm
going to just click this button which is
automatically shown to me and it says
thank you for downloading is hips
it's a tard dot GZ file so it's a zip
file and it's going to take some time to
download so for that time I'm going to
just pause the video because maybe it's
going to take unless you buy to download
this zip file ok so once this download
is complete we are going to go ahead and
see how we can install eclipse and then
vo we'll also see how we can write our
first hello world Java program with so
now the download of this tar dot GZ file
is complete in my case so I can just
open it in finder wherever I have
downloaded this file so this is a GZ
file and what I'd like to do is I like
to move this GZ file into my desired
folder so what I'm going to
I'm going to move with to the Documents
folder here and first of all I'm going
to just minimize my browser and the
finder I'm going to make a new folder
here so let me make up new folder and
I'm going to name it as Eclipse for
example okay so this is my Eclipse
folder and I will just move this GZ file
into this Eclipse folder right and I'm
going to go the inside this Eclipse
folder and then I'm going to double
click on this zip file which is going to
extract this file so just double click
on this zip file and in some seconds
this file will be extracted and then we
will be able to see this Eclipse icon on
the finder right so you can see this
Eclipse icon
you just need to drag it like this in
order to see both the zip file and the
Eclipse icon so this is your executable
icon which you can use to start eclipse
right some people like to move it to the
application and it's totally fine so you
can just select it and move it to the
applications and start it from there or
otherwise if you don't want it you can
start your eclipse from here also right
so I am going to double click on this
icon and for the first time when a clip
starts it's going to give you first of
all maybe it will give you this warning
which say the Eclipse is an application
downloaded from internet are you sure
you want to open it so we are sure that
we want to open it so just click open
and then it's going to start eclipse in
your case so you can see Eclipse is
starting and in the next step it's going
to ask you to select our directory as
our workspace both space is a directory
where all your Java project or Eclipse
related project will be saved right so
by default it's Sydney on documents
folder
and it's fine for me but if you want
this workspace to be somewhere else you
can always browse the folder wherever
you want to have your workspace and then
just choose that you know directory but
for now I'm going to leave it as default
and I'm going to click OK and now it's
going to start the Eclipse ID for me so
now the Eclipse IDE has been started you
can see it like this also you can
maximize it or minimize it and resize it
and for the first time it's going to
look like this so you can see the review
IDE configuration settings or create a
new Java EE web project or some other
sample projects you can see you can also
see the tutorial and samples but we are
interested in creating our first Java
project using Eclipse right so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to this
file option on the Eclipse so just click
this file option on Eclipse and then go
to new so just click new and you will be
able to see a different kind of project
see also jba projects and the other kind
of projects here so I'm going to just
click for now project and now you will
be able to see this option ok so once
again I'm going to show you file and
then new and I have selected the project
option from here right it's going to
give me this option and in here I'm
going to choose Java so just choose this
option with a Java and then choose the
Java project ok so just use a Java
project from here and then you just need
to click Next and in here you can
provide the name of your project so for
example we are creating the hello world
project so I'm going to name my project
as HelloWorld and then in here by
default it's going to recognize the
GRE for you so in my case it's Java SE
1.8 in your case it can be different
right so by default is going to
recognize it and if you want to choose
some specific GRE you can just choose
this option and choose your specific GRE
but for now I'm going to leave it as
default now in the next category you
have the project layout so it says use
project folder as route for source and
class files and other is create a
separate folder for source and class
files so I'm going to leave it a default
which is create separate folders for
source and class files right and the
other thing is working set right now we
are not so much interested in this but
later we will do it right and then I'm
going to click finish here and this is
going to give you this kind of warning
which says this kind of project is
associated with Java perspective right
so we have downloaded the Java EE IDE
and by default it's going to show us the
Java EE perspective but we are creating
the Java project inside this Java EE ID
so it's going to change the perspective
that means the look and feel of this IDE
to the Java perspective right so just
click YES here and we are going to
minimize this value come screen so just
minimize this welcome screen and when
you minimize this value come window then
you will be able to see your hello world
project right so just minimize your
welcome window and now you will be able
to see this hello world project now in
our holo world there is a sole source
folder and nothing inside it right so we
need to create a class which is a mean
class for our hello world project right
and you will be able to see JRE system
libraries which helps you to compile
Java project just select your source
folder and right-click on it and
generally first of all in our project we
create some packages and then we create
some classes but for simplicity for now
I am going to just directly create a
class so just go to new and then click
laugh here and then you can give the
name of your class right so for now I'm
going to just name it as test for now
and you can choose which kind of
modifiers you want to use it because we
are just testing our first Java project
so I'm going to leave everything as
default but this is important here so
this ask you to you know it's asking you
which method stub you would like to
create right so it's better to choose
the this first option which is going to
directly create a public static void
method for you and you don't need to
create the mean a method inside your
class for you right so it's going to
automatically create this method for you
right so just select this option and
then click finish and it's going to
create this test or Java file for you
and you can see it directly have the
mean method for you right so you already
may have known that Java is all about
classes so it has created a class for us
and this is the main entry point for
your project right being a method right
and for example we want to just print
hello world here so I can just write
system dot out and then dot print line
so just write print Ln for print line
and inside this bracket you just need to
give the double quotes and
the double quotes you can just write
hello world okay so what this is going
to do is it's going to print this hello
world on the console when you run it now
you would need to run your project right
so you can click right click on your
Java file so just right click on your
test dot Java file and then you will be
able to see this option we save run as
and you have two options here run on
server and one has java application so
you need to run it as java application
so i'm going to choose the second option
and then you just need to choose your
dot java file in my case it's only one
so just select it and then click OK it
is going to compile your program and you
can see on the console it has printed
hello world for us right now there is a
shortcut for you know writing this code
which is system.out.print line and which
is you just need to write capital S and
then Y F and then o face o and then just
press control-shift
to get the you know intelligence so just
press ctrl shift and then press ENTER
which is going to give you this method
right and you can just write something
again so for example hello world again
right now for the first time when you
compile your program you just have right
click then run it as you know java
application but once you have already
run it you can just press this green
button now to in order to you know
compile and run it right but before that
you just need to save it so just press
the Save button here
and then click this green button so just
press this green button and it will
compile it and you can see the output
here once again hello world and hello
world again which is printed by these
two lines so now you have successfully
installed Eclipse IDE on your Mac
operating system and you have
successfully tested your first hello
world Java project so I hope you've
