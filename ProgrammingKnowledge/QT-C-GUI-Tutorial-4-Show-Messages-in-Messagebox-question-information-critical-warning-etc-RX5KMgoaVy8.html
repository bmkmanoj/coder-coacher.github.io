last video I have shown you how to work
with signals and slot in your QT
framework so I have shown you how to set
this slider and when you set some value
on the slider it should appear on this
progress bar also in this video I will
show you how to show different messages
in different message boxes in your main
window or in him in your window with the
help of a button for example I want to
show a message when I click this button
so how can I show it on this Qt
framework I will show you today so let's
get started first I will go to my edit
or let me take a button first push
button and drag and drop into my window
and I will change text of this button so
I select this button I go to the
properties here if I want I can change
the object name also but I am not
changing it right now I keep it default
which is push button underscore 2 but I
want to change the text so here from
here I can change the text so right now
it's push-button and I want to change it
to show message and click OK and now my
caption on this button is show message
now I select this button I right-click
it and I click go to slot and it will
open this
slots are for selection so I click I
select this clicked slot or function of
button click event whatever you say and
click OK and I reach to this on push
button click function ok here I will
write my code so whatever I write here
it should be executed when I press the
push button so right now I wanted to
show the message box right so what I
need to do is I need to go at the top
and I need to include the message box
library so what I do is I write hash
include' and then this lesser than sign
cue message box okay so include this
library cue message box let me make it
bigger so you can see include cue
message box and now go to that on push
button to click event and in here I
write queue message box double colon and
I can choose what type choose what type
of message I want to show for example I
want to show some information so I can
choose information with a small I so
just remember that and I close this
bracket and in here first of all I will
give the first argument which is this
write this as a first argument comma
right T R and give bracket
and this will be our title so give this
double quotes and this is the title so I
will write the title okay and the third
argument I'm passing is the actual
message so write T R and give the
bracket and double quotes and in here
whatever I write will be displayed as a
message so for example this is a message
okay so I write Q message box underst
double colon information and then I
passed three arguments this comma TR the
title comma T are in the bracket the
message what I want to display okay
and now when I run the program from here
first I need to build it so I save all
the files and it's building from here
see and now it displays my run window so
when I click this show message it should
show me a message box showing this is a
message so I click it and it shows me
this is a message and you can see the
title is displayed here I can show
different type of messages not only this
Q box on double colon information but I
can change this Q box and I can write
the bill :
for example warning this one and once
again I run the program and no I
did not compile the program so I built
the program save all and it's building
the program and now when I press this
button it shows me the warning symbol
here okay
just notice this symbol earlier it was
the information sign and now it's the
warning symbol in a same way I can
change it for example question it will
give me a question mark symbols so I
once again run the program and bills and
it runs and when I click this show
message button it gives me this question
mark which is with two buttons if I want
to execute or not so I click yes once
again this question mark and one last
time you can also choose something like
critical all these are starting with
small letters okay so message box a
semicolon or colon colon critical and
once again I run the program
I build it and it's run and when I click
this show message it shows me the
critical message sign and my message
okay so in this video you have learned
how to play with messages different kind
of messages you can just play with the
this code and you can show different
type of messages by yourself also so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
