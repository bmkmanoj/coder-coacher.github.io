last video you learned about Oh such
data on the basis of name but I don't
you tell me yeah yeah we'll come to the
employee info but what happened if you
want to search on the basis of name as
well as if you want to search on the
basis of employee ID or solemn all
together
so what anything you can which you will
write here example but one so employee
ID once data should come here or any
employees on him also you right here
anything employer name name surname on
his own employee ID so in other word in
when you want to do advanced search to
search field how to do that I will show
you right now it's not very difficult
once again right click go to amend key
and key release which will take us into
the method we have already made in the
last tutorial
you make this try catch in between this
code we have written in the last
tutorial just copy
all the gold in it try and catch after
copying would you have to do this
just below that try catch blocks ends
just copy the same thing just below that
and you have last time you are searching
on the basis of name and this time you
want to search on the basis of for
example employee ID so we will copy the
employee ID column name and paste it
instead of name select star from
employee info Pell employee ID is equal
to question mark and last we have name
is equal to question this time employee
ID is equal to question mark and then
once again if you want to search on the
basis of surname also just copy the
whole try-catch block once again paste
it just below
the code last time here we are searching
on the basis of employee ID in now if
you want to search on the basis of net
copy surname and based at place of
employee ID so we all together we have
three try-catch block once it will
search for name if it doesn't find any
name there it will go to search employee
ID it will not find any employee ID in
the text field go to search for surname
right so in this way let's try to run
the program it wants not by clicking one
fine
suppose one to Sarge
boy I did three just type three here you
can see it's search on the basis of your
my ID also suppose you want to search on
the basis of surnames for example I want
to search some Martine so Sonya Martines
doctor comes here and also the name I
want search on the basis of name so
John's name doctor welcome one more
thing if you confuse what is surname
employ ID or name here this name this is
our column database column names reading
names also name these are these column
names we have to write these queries in
so I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial
and please rate comment and subscribe
