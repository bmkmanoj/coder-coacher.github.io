how to create a CH M file so the first
question comes into mind is what is our
CH M file so the file you are seeing on
your screen is a CH M file and it's a
collection of HTML file which are
compiled together and these CH M file
are generally used as a help for
different software or some of the books
are also published as a CH M file online
so CH M file you can use to create a
help text of your software or you can
create a book online or which you can
publish online so generally if you
search or for CH m in your search box
so I write C hm you can find at least
one or two CH M file in your system if
you have some softwares so for example I
have this user manual I open it and it's
for Oracle VirtualBox so it's a usual
user manual for this software so you can
create a user manual help provider or
books with this software or with this CH
m pile so let's get started and I will
show you how to create a CH M file and
how you can find CH M file generally if
you have a Windows and if you have this
sub Visual Studio installed in your
system you will find when you go to the
search option and here you right
help or HTML help workshop see generally
you can find this software on your
system by default and if not we can find
it on online just go to your browser and
just write HTML help workshop ok and
this HTML help workshop is a Microsoft
softwares so just go there first link
and you can just download this HTML
workshop from here just click download
and just click the first option and
click Next and you will download this
Exe file and this file you can install
very easily on your system so once if
you you have installed this HTML help
box work shop on your system then I will
open it HTML workshop and it will open
like this here so what you can do is you
can create a new project we are going to
see how we can create a simple CHM file
so I will go to help new and I will
select project and click OK and I will
click Next and here I will give the
title of my CH M file so for example I
will write my CH M file as user manual
and I will select the folder in which I
want to save this CHM files so for
example I have already folder made so I
will give the path of that folder and
press ENTER and I will click OK open but
first of all we will give the name of
this file so I'll write use a manual
once again and click open and click and
next and if you have already made your
HTML file because CHM file is a
collection of HTML file so if you have
already made HTML help files then you
can just select it and then just add it
from here so you can add your previously
made HTML file but I don't have
previously made HTML right now so I will
just leave these blank and click Next
and click finish so now I have this
project made and then I will make some
HTML files for example so I will go to
file new and now I will make a HTML file
for my table and let's see what can be
the title let's look here in our HTML
file so let's say we want to give the
name of the first HTML file as about ok
and click OK so this is the HTML file
make and here you can give the HTML code
so that you can have your HTML file for
example I will
provide a paragraph here and I will say
my first CH M file and then I will save
this file so I will go to file once
again and save file as and I will say
because it's my about file so I will
name it as about and save it in the same
folder and in the same way I can make
some new file new HTML file once again
this file I want to name it as content
for example ok and once again I can give
any HTML code here so let's see what
HTML code we can give here so we are
going to give a paragraph here and let's
say this is content files okay and you
can provide a list of content file you
just need to know little basics of HTML
this file also I will save as and this
is my
content file ok so right now I have to
file to HTML file made then what I will
do is I will go to here project and I
will click this button and here I can
give a title to my project and I can
choose the default file so default file
is the first file which it will open ok
so for now I will close this and let's
create a content of this CHM file first
so I will click on content tab and I
will say create a new content file ok
and here I will say this is my about
content files ok because the first HTML
file we made is for the about so content
we can give the topic s about it has
extension dot h SC and I will save it
and now my content is made now I will go
here insert a page I will click this
button so when I hover over here I click
this button and I will say once again
about and add a file here and I can add
any file from here so I will browse for
my about file is it here or not
ok browse about
and click OK and click ok so this is my
about content in the same way I will add
a second page which is my content page
right so I click it once again and I
will say content and I will add a new
file which is my content file desire
HTML file I have made also and click OK
and click OK so I have two files one is
about and one is content you can adjust
this file you can move up any file you
can move down or wherever you want and
you can also create an index so when you
click this index tab it will show a
dialog box and you will click OK and
index I will leave this index default
and I will save it and now my index is
also made so once you are done with your
content and index you can add some more
files and held X whatever you want once
you are done with that you go to file
and you save all the files before
compiling it and once again you go to
file and click compile from here also or
you can click this button also and now
you can browse the folder in which you
want to create this file so I will
choose the same file in which I have
created the other files so I will click
open and I will give the name of my file
so that was user manual for example
YouTube and I will open it and you can
select this save all file before
compiling so it's good that it will save
all the file before compiling and I will
click compile ok it's given me error
because I think I have selected a wrong
file
so just select this dot hhp file from
here and click open and now we compile
it and it's compiled ok and now when you
compile your file you can just go to the
folder where you have compiled a file
and you can see here a CHM file is made
for you you can see here and when you
open it it'll look like ah
CHM file and in which you have this
about page and you have this content you
have the index also so we if you have so
many HTML file and a big content then
you can search for your content also
from here so in this way you can create
a CHM file this was only the first step
and you can add your idea of creating a
CHM file and use it in your project
somewhere so I hope you have enjoyed
