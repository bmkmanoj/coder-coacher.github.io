you how you can install OpenSSH server
on your Rubin to operating system in
order to enable SSH on your Ubuntu
operating system but first of all what
is SSH
so SSH or secure shell is a protocol
which is used to securely log into the
remote operating system it is the most
common way to access the remote Linux or
UNIX like server for example ok so first
of all we will just check where the SSH
is installed on our system and then if
it's not installed then we will see how
to install it so first of all just give
this command SSH to check whether SSH
client is installed so SSH and then
press Enter and if it gives this kind of
response that means SSH client is
installed on your system now you will be
able to connect to our different remote
operating system for example some server
in some cloud by using this SSH command
so you can just write SSH and then the
username of that remote server and then
at the rate I P address of that server
and if it supports any special port then
you can write minus P and the port
number something like this write some
port number ok so this is to verify
whether ssh client is installed now
let's see how to verify if ssh server is
installed on your system which is
OpenSSH server so once again give SSH
and then localhost ok that means you are
trying to connect to your localhost why
is SH and then press Enter and if it
gives this kind of response which says
connection to host localhost port 22
connection refused
that means the OpenSSH server is not
installed on your system so you need to
install it in order to allow the other
operating system for example if you are
working on your Windows operating system
you want to access this operating system
which is your Ubuntu operating system by
our terminal using SSH then you need to
install this OpenSSH right so in order
to install it just write sudo apt - get
install open SSH - server ok and then
press Enter
and then give your open to spaz word and
then it's going to start installing this
open SS so just press Y to allow it to
install now once this installation is
complete I'm going to clear my terminal
and to check whether OpenSSH server is
running we can just give this command
sudo and then service ssh status and
then press enter and if it gives this
kind of response which says active
running that means OpenSSH server is
running on your system so press Q to
quit and then once again we are going to
give this command SSH local host and
then press Enter and you can see this
time it allows us to connect to our own
operating system wire terminal so this
time just say yes and then give your
open two password once again and you are
logged into your own operating system
which is your open to operating system
now let's say if you want to change the
default port on which as such works then
you need to just change this port into a
special file which is I'm going to show
you where it is so let me clear the
terminal once again and then just write
this command which is sudo G added which
is a editor we are going to use and then
/e TC SSH and then SSH D underscore
config and then press enter which is
going to open this kind of file so this
is the configuration file of this
as I said server so if you want to
change the pour just search for the port
which is here you can see the default
port is port 22 you can change it if you
want to change it and if you want to run
this OpenSSH so on some different port
so the default port is 22 so now in this
way you can log into this open to
operating system from a different Linux
or UNIX or even Windows operating system
using SSH client or SSH command so I
