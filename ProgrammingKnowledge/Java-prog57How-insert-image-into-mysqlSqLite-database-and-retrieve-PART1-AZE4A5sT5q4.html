promised now I will tell you how to add
images to your database and how to save
update and delete those images from the
database or in the database so I think
this will take few videos in the first
part I will show you how to create a
column for images or for saving images
in the database so I have my SQL manager
in Firefox you can do it in MySQL also
in MySQL also the procedure would be
same so I add for example I want to show
the picture of the employee in my employ
in for jframe so I will get the list in
the table and like I can be able to save
delete or update the names also and also
the picture of the employee here I'm
gonna add the panel for the picture of
the employee so let's get started and
create first of all column in your
employ info table database and I will
name the column as image and here is
very important thing to note the
variable name of
my image is blob blob full form of blob
is binary large object so it will
convert my image into binary stream and
save it into my database and I will I
will click Add column to add it into my
table employee info so it is added and
the variable type of data type of it is
blob this is very important to note to
save the images now what I will do is I
will go to my database table my browsing
search and I will add new data into my
table so for example I have my first
employee ID his name his password his
age and now I'm going to add his image
into the database so this is my image
column and I'm going to add image in the
database right now I am going to add
image from my database itself but in the
next few tutorials I will tell you how
to add the image from the jframe or e
from your java frame itself so for the
beginning I am just adding the image
from my database only so this is my
image variable name just go to here add
images or add file
attachment button so it will open your
file chooser and from here you can
select your images so I will select an
image this is not any employees picture
I don't have any small size pictures
where I have this picture so I will add
this only to German icon you can add the
passport size picture of any person also
here and just
Pressey blog as file it does nothing so
I press okay and it will convert my
image into binary stream and I press
okay then
my file is added or my image is added to
my image column there my employee ID is
first and name is Paul let's get add one
more image or
employee and then let's see what happens
so in the image I click this and I will
add some other small image for example
this image and I press ok we convert my
image into the stream or binary stream
and I press ok and it will be saved in
my image column and here the size of the
file is also shown so this is how you
can save your images into your database
and in the next tutorial I will show you
how to see these images on your jframe
