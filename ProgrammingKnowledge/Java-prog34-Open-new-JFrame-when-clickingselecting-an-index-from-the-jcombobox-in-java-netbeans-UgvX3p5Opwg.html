gonna show you how to open the new
jframe and you click your jcombobox for
example if you click Mary some new
jframe will open when you click John
some new jframe will open and when you
click paul new window or jframe will
open so how to do that
I'm going to show you today so first of
all go to your source code and in here
make one more method so I'm making the
new method
public void should be the name of this
method combo select
kamo select method and and in this
method you should write first of all int
take any variable name what you want to
do it and take it as d is equal to
whatever is the name of your variable of
combo box my combo box variable name is
combo box name can be seen here combo
box variable name and after int D equal
to write calm combo box name the
variable name dot get selected index
okay
just try that
and after that we should write some
condition for example if first before
that I want to tell you what is index
get selected in next so what is a index
index is when you select the combo box
and go to the model and D is your 0th
index Mary is your first index John is
your second index and Yulia is your
third index so index is the row number
of the selected variable and by default
the selected index is 0 always so it
will show nd because our selected index
is 0 because this is on our zeroth place
so this is called index so write F
condition
and here you should write if D is equal
to one for example select this when we
want to choose Mary and we select Mary a
new window will open
so the index of Mary is 0-1 so we are
writing when first of all we take the
index into the variable int and when D
is equal to one that is when we select
Mary we will write this code what is the
meaning of this code this is my new
jframe named for example I have made my
Jew new jframe whose name is user input
frame dot Java so this is the name user
open frame user info frame s is equal to
new user info frame semi column and
write this s this s dot setvisible
is equal to true so this is for opening
the new jframe these two lines okay once
again
else--if
if once again we will give the condition
you can give else if also you give if
this is equal to two index is equal to
two second index is let's see what is
our second index in here
our second index is John so when we
select John zero one two is John which
window will open
I want to open my login login name
take any variable L for example is equal
to login
I think I spelled my login chip this is
G and this is also J so this is name of
mine new fare which I am made here this
is JP and flip so this is the name log
in J prime L is equal to new log in
jQuery and below that right L dot set
visible and in English too so when you
so now when we run the program we should
see ya whenever we select our first
index which is Mary zero one our user
info frame below should open and
whenever we choose 0 1 2 John and our
login frame should open so let's run the
program and let's see what happens okay
I forgot one thing
we have not called our method anywhere
so this is the name of our method combo
select this is the name of our method so
go to our maintain frame and when it
should open it should open when we click
or select any item from here so right
click here go to event go to prop pop-up
menu and popup menu will become
invisible this middle one click so you
will go to the method and here you
should paste this method so whenever you
click any item in the combo box this
method is called and it will decide
which jframe we should open so now let's
try to run the program
and now let's click Mary and see Jeff
removals or not yes it opens our user
info page now when we click John it
should open a login frame so I think we
are successful in our program so that
was the tutorial on how to open new
jframe by clicking the jcombobox item I
hope you have learned something so

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
