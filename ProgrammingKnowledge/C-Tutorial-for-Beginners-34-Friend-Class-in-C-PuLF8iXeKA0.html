show you what our friend classes and how
to use friend classes in C++ so in
principle we know that we cannot use
private or protected members of class
outside the class so for example we have
a class called my class and it has a
private member variable called secret
and we all know that if we declare this
variable in this private under this
private access modifier we cannot use
this outside the class now sometimes we
need to use this private members of the
class in other classes and in this case
we use friend classes or friend keyword
so let me give you an example first so
we have this my class which has a
private member o'clock all secret right
let's declare another class which I call
my another class for example and this
class wants to access the secret
variable which is private so we all know
that we cannot choose this right so for
example there is a public public member
function and this my another class and
we can call it anything
for example void
our show secret okay so this is a
function and let's give it an argument
so I will pass my first class here as an
argument okay
because I want to use the secret in my
second class so I will call it my or MC
for my class and then I want to use this
for example I want to use so this is MC
is the object of the class as you all
know that we can create a instance of a
class but when we want to access the
secret the variable which is a private
variable in my class so when I write dot
and when I write MC dot secret and when
I try to compile this let's see what
happens and it gives us an error and
what is the error so this error is
within this context so my class secret
is private within this context which is
true and which is also we know by
definition that we cannot use private
members of a class in another class
right but for example for some reason
you want to use this private member in
your another class how can you do it you
just need to declare that the class in
which you want to use the private member
you just need to copy the name of this
class so becau because my another class
wants to use the private member in the
first class called my class right
so I need to
this my another class as a friend of
this my class so why what I can do I can
just write a keyword called friend and
then class and then the class name for
which I want to make the friend or make
this friend okay
so if you declare in your first class
that this another class my another class
is the friend of this class then this
keyword allows you to access the private
member by this class so now if if you
declare that my another class is a
friend of my class then my another class
has the access to the private members of
the class okay so I am going to build it
and hopefully it will not show any error
and it doesn't show any error okay so
for example I have the value for secret
is equal to 10 and I want to set this
value to some another value I can set it
right so I can do plus plus for example
in this function and then what I can do
I can simply call the instance of this
class here my another class right and I
can say I am a C for my another class it
is the object and then I can declare the
instance of myclass which is my first
class which is MC for example and then I
can call this function using ma see from
my another class show secret dot show
secret right and it takes an argument
which is the instance
of the class which we have this private
member in right so just copy this
instance here and then you will be able
to see the value of the secret so for
example I can see out here or STD : :
see out and I can just print the value
of this okay and STD : : and okay so now
I will compile the program and then I
will run the program it compiles fine
run it and it so shows the value of the
secret is 11 right which is true because
we set the value of secret as 10 and we
are increasing this to +1 and now the
value is 11 so the basic thing is
whenever you want to use a private or
protected members from one class to
another class you need to use friend
keyword or pen friend class keyword of
the class in which you want to use this
private members okay so for example this
is the class in which you want to use
the private member of my class then you
need to give this keyword friend class
my class so that this my class knows
that my another class is a friend of
this class so I can use these private
members from the other class okay so
this is the basic concept I hope you
