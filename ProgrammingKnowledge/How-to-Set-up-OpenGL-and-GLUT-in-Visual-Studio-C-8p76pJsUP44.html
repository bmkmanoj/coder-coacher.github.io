show you how you can configure and set
up opengl project in Visual Studio using
C++ so first of all go to the link in
the description and download a zip file
attached there ok so go to the link in
the description which I have provided
and then download the zip file the zip
file will look like this so I'm going to
open this zip file and this zip file is
going to contain some folder and some
DLL files the two folder names are free
glut and glue and the two DLL files are
free glut dot DLL and glue 32 dot DLL ok
so what you need to do is you need to
extract these files in some folder of
your choice ok so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just extract these files
in a folder ok
so these files are in my folder which is
there on the desktop and now I'm going
to close my zip file and now I'm going
to open my visual studio and in Visual
Studio what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create a new C++ project so open new
project and in C++ select C++ and we are
going to choose our empty project and we
can change the name of our project as
open GL ok and make sure it's empty
project and click OK and it's going to
create a empty project for us so
once your project is created you need to
go to your solution Explorer here and
right click on your project so right
click and we are going to create or add
a new C++ file so right click and go to
add and add a new item and we are going
to select C++ file and we are going to
name our file as main dot CPP okay and
click Add and it's going to add this
main dot CPP to our source file ok now
to setup OpenGL in our visual studio
project what I'm going to do is I'm
going to right click my project so right
click and go to the properties and in
the properties first of all we will go
to the property called C slash C++ okay
and inside this we are going to go to
the general properties and in here we
are going to this category called
additional include directories ok and
I'm going to click this small little
button and I'm going to open and here I
am going to click this button and I'm
going to choose my folder in which I
have extracted my files so I will go to
that folder open GL and first of all I'm
going to go to this free glut folder
which I have downloaded and I will
select include folder here and I will
select holder ok same I will do for the
key loot 32 folder so desktop open GL
and I'm going to go to glue and select
include and select the folder okay so
this has included these two you know
library files or folders to our
directory path okay now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go to the category
called linker and inside this I'm going
to go to the category called input okay
so go to linker and go to input and in
here go to additional dependencies and
I'm going to add some additional
dependencies and first of all the
dependency which I'm going to add is so
whenever you have downloaded you can see
in your OpenGL there is a free glut dot
DLL and glue dot DL so we are going to
add the same library file related to
these two DLL first is free glut dot Lib
and second is glue 32 dot Lib okay and
make sure that these matches this free
glut and glue 32 the spelling matches
okay
and what this is going to do is this is
going to add the libraries these
libraries in your project so that you
will be able to compile your program
okay now what I'm going to do is in the
same category linker I'm going to go to
the category called general and in this
I'm going to go to the additional
library directory section and I'm going
to add it it and now I'm going to add
the library folder from those two
folders so navigate this folder OpenGL
and go to free glut and select web and
select folder and same once again I'm
going to do for the view so OpenGL glue
lib select folder click OK
and then apply and click okay okay
and now once you do that what you need
to do is now you can go to your project
and right click it and you can open your
folder of your project by clicking open
folder in File Explorer ok so once again
right-click your project and open folder
in File Explorer and this is going to
open your project here ok and in here
you can you know
place your DLL file which you have
downloaded ok so that your executable
file recognizes this DJ DLL file and
link to this DLL file to run your
program ok so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to take all the DLL file which
are click free glut DLL and glue dot DLL
from my folder where I have extracted
them and I will copy these two DLL file
in my project folder so copy and into
the project folder just paste ok so that
any linking issue will be solved
otherwise if it this doesn't work what
you can do is the next option you can
choose which is the most general options
go to the C folder and then go to
Windows I think and in Windows you can
go to the system32 folder and in this
system32 folder you can paste copy and
paste these two dll files and then any
linking issues will be solved because
this is the global location for all the
DLL files so that it will link directly
your
we'll link directly to these dll files
okay now once this is done what remains
is the program so in this folder which I
have given you in the zip file you have
this base code file also so just open
this file copy all the code from here
this is the basic code to test whether
our project is running or not okay and
paste this code here and then we can run
our code okay so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to click this green
button to run my project or build my
project first and then run it
and is going to build my project first
and now it's going to run my project and
it says hello GL so the sample program
is doing nothing but it's creating a
window which is a blank window just to
test if this OpenGL library is set up
properly or not okay so the purpose of
this video is just to you know let you
know how you can set up OpenGL libraries
with your Visual Studio IDE I hope you
have enjoyed this video please rate
