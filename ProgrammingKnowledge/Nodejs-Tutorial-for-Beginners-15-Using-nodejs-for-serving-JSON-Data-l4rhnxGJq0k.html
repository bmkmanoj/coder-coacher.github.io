more tears to toll for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can send
a HTML page using readable streams and
writable streams in nodejs
now in this video I'm going to show you
how we can send our Chasen to the
browser using node.js right so Jason now
you know most of the you know so
application uses Jason as a data to send
it to the browser and this data can be
passed on the browser side for example
and then it can be used for you know
multiple purposes so it's also a popular
technique that Jason is sent from the
server to the browser and then with this
g3 data some useful things can be done
so let's get started and see how we can
use Jason and we can send Jason to the
browser so I'm using the code from the
previous example I have removed the
readable streams and writable streams
code from here because we are not going
to use them in this code and we are
going to directly use this response
variable to send the data using response
dot and ok so first of all we need to
change the content type right so here
previously we were sending the text for
a slash HTML but because we want to send
now the JSON data so you just need to
write application forward slash Jason
okay and then this means that we want to
send the JSON data and browser will be
able to pass this JSON data
appropriately right now in the next step
we will create our JSON objects so you
can use a JSON file for that or you can
create a JSON object using the code also
so I am going to create my JSON object
using the code but this can be done also
using the Jason file so you can create a
Jason file here and read this Jason file
and then convert it to for example
stream and then send it to the browser
right so let's create a Jason so far for
example the Jason obj purchase an object
and inside this brackets we can add some
elements to the Jason
so what elements we want for example we
want the name some name and thing can be
max and then the so name for example and
this can be something and the H for
example each can be 26 okay so this is
our JSON object and this you want to
send it to the browser so we can simply
use this response variable and then call
a method called end which we have been
using in the previous video also so just
write and and then you just pass your
jason object here bust this code will
not work because the browser or whatever
you want to send using this method
it only takes the streams or the string
as an argument and this is our object so
we want to convert this JSON object to a
stream and how we can do this we can do
this using a method called Jason dot
stringify which will convert our jason
to a string okay so this is the method
jason dot stringify which takes our
argument you can see the details here so
it takes object as an argument which can
be a chaser right so this is our code
and
what this object will be converted to a
string and then using this method it's
going to be sent to the browser so let's
run our server first of all and it has
some errors so let's see what the error
is so the error is instead of equal to
PI I need to use this :
yeah and once again run the code and
then use the browser to see the response
and you can see our response Jason is
here right I'm going to make it a little
bit bigger so this is our response Jason
now in order to inspect this you can
just right click on your browser and
then click inspect in Google Chrome I
think this is the same option inspect
element or inspect right so click this
and then go to a tab called Network okay
so go to network here and you need to
reload our page so you can click this
reader load button and you can see it
has the status 200 which we are sending
from the code this code right and then
we will see the content type also so
just click on this you know get method
and you can see here the content type is
application for slash Jason so this is
send using this code and then when you
go to the response here response tab
this tab you can see this Jason is
passed and shown in comment in way right
so in this way you can send a Jason to
the browser using no Cheers ok and this
is also a very useful technique whenever
you want to you know send some dynamic
data to the browser for example you want
to fill some table using this Jason data
then you can do this right because you
can pass this Jason data based upon the
alum
and values right so I hope you've
