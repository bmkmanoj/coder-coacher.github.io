Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will see how
we can use less command in Linux less
command we can use to you know read the
files or if you want to search something
inside the file something like patterns
or some word you can use less command
conveniently to read or search in the
file so let's see how we can use it so
first of all I'm going to open my
terminal and first of all I will
navigate to my desktop where this big
dot txt file is there so first of all I
will CD to the desktop and first of all
because this is a big file and I want to
for example see the content of this big
text file I want to use cat for you
because we have learned you can use cat
to you know print the content of the
file so I'm going to use big dot txt and
when I press ENTER you can see it's
printing the content of this text file
and because it's really big it's
printing and printing and printing and
for examples you want to read from the
starting of this file when it's done
printing and you want to go up let's see
what happens so first of all let it
complete so it's completed and when I
want to go to the top and I want to read
the content the terminal doesn't allow
me to go beyond a certain level so it's
not going to the you know starting of
the text file that's why we can use our
less command to overcome this problems
plus less has its own features right so
I will first of all clear the terminal
and now I'm going to use less or for you
know reading the file content so first
of all for using less you just need to
prepare your you know write less and the
name of the file which is big dot txt
right and press ENTER and you can see it
will show you the
a content of the file from the starting
so this is the starting of the file and
we'll show you you know some text until
this terminal allows it to show it and
if you go on to see the content of the
file more you can hit the down arrow key
so down arrow key to go one line down at
a time you can see you can read down and
if you hit up arrow then you can read up
or you can you know browse over the file
in the you know up now if you want to go
through the file page by page what you
can use is you can use a space key to
navigate here to your file page by page
so when I press a space it's going to
show me the next page next page next
page next page and it will show me again
and again next page so for the you know
going through the page down words you
can use space or key now if you want to
go upwards page by page you can use
capital B or B key okay and you can just
press B and you will go one page up at a
time and you press B okay now if you
want to go at the end of the file you
can just press capital G so press Shift
+ G so it will be capital G so press
Shift + G and you know browse to the end
of your text file right and now if you
want to go at the top at the starting of
your file you can just type one and then
G and it will go at the beginning of the
file so capital C using shift G at the
end and when you press one G then it
will go at the top right once again
capital G at the end and when I press
small G also it will browse me to the
top also so small G for going to the top
and capital G for going to the end right
now for example I want to go at the top
and now I want to search something
inside the text file from up to down so
I can use this forward slash which says
this less that we want to search from up
to down some word and the word for
example we are looking for is book
inside this text file right and when you
press ENTER it's going to you know show
you or highlight the first book key word
which you are searching for which is
this one and now to search or to go to
the next book in the text file you can
now press n to go to the next item which
is book right so you can see there are
so many book and we are searching or we
are going from top to down right so you
can see there are so many book words
inside this text file and when we are
done with you know the searching and
it's the end of the file it will say
pattern not found so now this book is
the last iteration of this word book
right after that when you press next or
n it's going to show this message which
says pattern not found now sometimes you
may want to search from down to up and
for this you can use this question mark
for searching from down to up and then
you can you know give your keyword which
you are looking for in and press enter
and the first word from the down is this
itself and then when you press n it will
go through this text file and highlight
the book from down to up right so you
can just press and
key to you know see where this book is
used this word is used right now if you
want to put less command you just need
to press Q it'll quit your less command
right so this is how you can use less
command in Linux and if you want to know
more about less you can just write men
and less and here is the description of
less command and the flags and the keys
you can use with less commands okay so I
