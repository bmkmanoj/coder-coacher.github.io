show you how you can download and
install Visual Studio Express for
developing C and C++ program on your
Windows operating system in addition I'm
also going to show you how you can make
your first HelloWorld
c-plus plus program so let's get started
first of all let me need to download and
install Visual Studio Express video
Visual Studio Express is free for us and
we can download it freely so go to your
favorite browser and search for Visual
Studio Express the first link most
probably will come here from
www.videoculinary.com
and in here when I see there are
different versions of Visual Studio
available and the one I am looking for
is Visual Studio for desktop which is
this one and at the time of making this
video Visual Studio Express 2013 is the
latest version but it can change
whenever you you know if you are seeing
this in future so don't get confused by
anything else like Visual Studio Express
2013 for Windows or Express for web we
need to download this version Express
2013 for Windows desktop and it will say
here that the programming language it
includes is C sharp Visual Basic and C++
also so just select this one and click
this download button here once you
download this button click the download
button you will be able to see Express
2013 with updates for for Windows
Desktop and you will be able to see this
kind of interface in here you can choose
your language whatever language you want
to choose to download Visual Studio and
then you need to click install now now
you may have to have your Visual Studio
or Microsoft account it may be outlook
for any Microsoft account or Microsoft
email account so you may have to log in
with your account in order to see this
link if you already have this account
you just need to sign it with your any
of your Microsoft account and otherwise
you need to sign up for the account or
create new account and then you will be
able to see this link so there are two
options here one is the Express 2013 for
Windows desktop and other is ultimate
2:01 3 what we want here is this one
which is Express for Windows desktop so
just click this link and the
installation will start automatically
and installation of Visual Studio is
fairly straightforward it may ask you to
you know restart your computer after the
installation but the yeah it's fairly
straightforward you don't even need to
click any button Visual Studio
executable file takes care of everything
so you know don't need any extra step to
install it so you just need to run this
executable file and wait for a while
it may take you know 20 minutes it took
20 minutes in my case to install visual
studio but it may take lesser or more
time depending upon the speed of your
computer once you have this on your
computer I can see this are in my
Windows 8 apps layer
and this is what I am looking for Visual
Studio Express 2013 quad desktop ok so
just click this and it will open visual
studio and for the first time whenever
you open this visual studio you will be
able to see this kind of interface in
here you have two options to create new
project one is to click this new project
button or otherwise you can click the
file menu here and then click new
project just click that and in here you
have different template versions and one
we are looking for is this one Visual
Studio C++ or Visual C++ and one once
you click this visual C C++ category
here you will be able to see some
options what we want to do is we want to
make an empty project so I will select
empty project from here and in here you
can give the name to your project for
example you can give the name my first
CPP project for example okay and this is
the default location where this project
will be you know stored okay so if you
want to change this default location you
can browse for the location wherever you
want to store your project and for now
we don't need to create the solution so
if you see any checkbox checked here
these two tools checkbox leave them as
unchecked okay so if this is like this
you just need to uncheck this for now
okay and I will click OK
and Visual Studio will create an empty
C++ project for me now once it creates
an empty project you will be able to see
three folders here one is header files
one second is source file which will
store or you can store CPP files here in
header files you can store dot H or dot
H P P or had other header files and in
resource file you can save your
resources now let's see where this is
stored in your computer so whenever you
right-click your solution you will be
able to see this option open folder in
File Explorer
ok so right-click your solution and just
click open folder in for File Explorer
and here is the location where project
your project is saved so you see there
is a project category and this is the
name of your project whatever name you
have given and they have created Visual
Studio have created some project file
for you and whenever you go inside this
project you will be able to see your
source file or other files ok so what
not next I am going to do here is in my
source folder this in source file in my
project I am going to create a new
source file so just right-click your
source file and click add and click new
item and in here you have two options or
either you can choose a dot CPP file or
dot header file but for our hello world
program we will just choose dot CPP file
and in here you can change the name of
your source file for example
program dot cpp okay and this is the
default location where this source file
will be stored okay so once you do this
you can just add this source file to
your project and now you have program
the CPP inside your source file you can
just click this program dot CPP and in
here you can start writing your first
C++ project for a program so let's try
to write a very simple hello world
program so we just need to include
include iostream and then we are going
to use or using namespace STD
not this for this and then we will make
our main function
so this is a very basic main function
I'm going to make and now in here you
can just print hello world by just
writing STD C out and then you just need
to use these angular brackets and inside
double quotes you can just print hello
world okay and to end the line we will
just add STD and line this is the very
basic simple hello world program and to
retain the screen so for example to
build this program I'm going to go to
this build option and I will just click
build solution okay or otherwise the
very good option is clicking this green
button here so just click the screen
button and it will automatically it
automatically ask you to build the
program just like yes and it will build
your program so for the first time when
you compile your program or build your
program it can take some time and you
can see it gave the screen and screen
disappears suddenly because there is
nothing in this main program which can
you know hold the screen from
disappearing so I will add one more line
which is STD CI and
dot get okay and this will this just
input function which expects some input
so for now for you know retaining the
terminal or screen on the computer you
will just add this line so that our
terminal or screen doesn't disappears
suddenly and once again we will build
the program and run it and here we can
see our hello world message showing on
the terminal so in this way you can
download and install Visual Studio for
developing C and C++ program and you can
create your first C++ HelloWorld program
on Visual Studio so I hope you have
