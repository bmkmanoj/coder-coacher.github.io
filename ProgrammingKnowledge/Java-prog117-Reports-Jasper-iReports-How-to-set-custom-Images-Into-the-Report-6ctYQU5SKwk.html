last few tutorial I have been talking
about just per report until now we have
learned how to produce this kind of a
simple report in this video I will show
you how to change the image on how to
insert your own image into the report
this image you are seeing is the default
template image provided by just per
reports so suppose I want to change this
image here what I have to do I will tell
you now first of all I want delete this
image so that I can
provide a new image
and in order to insert your custom image
into the report what you have to do is
go to your palette and grab image from
here and drag into your report once you
drag this image into the report
a dialog box automatically opens from
which you can choose your image whatever
it means you want to enter into your
report so I will choose my own image
open and this image comes here and then
I can resize all the reshape my image
according to the space available like
this here I can change the title for
example my report and here also I can
change the subtitle
by your name for example so in this way
you can customize your report and I will
just see its preview how it looks ok you
can see the image right now and the
change title so in the next video
probably I will tell you about how to
pass a query from NetBeans to your
chespin report so keep watching my
videos and please rate comment and
subscribe and buy it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
