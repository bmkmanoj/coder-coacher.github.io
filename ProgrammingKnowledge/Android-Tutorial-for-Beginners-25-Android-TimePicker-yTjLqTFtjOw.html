tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use time picker in android time
picker you can use to choose some time
whenever you are making some activity
related to time or Android app related
to time setting or time picking so let's
see how we can use time picker with an
example so what you are going to do is
or what you need to do is first of all
create a blank project for you and then
go to your palette and search for date
and time category and in here choose
time picker control and drag and drop
into your activity and time picker looks
like this and what we are going to do in
this example is we are going to show the
time chosen by the time picker in a
toast using a button ok so let's take a
button and we change the text of this
button as show time and the ID I will
leave it as default which is button
itself now our design is complete so we
can go to our main activity to Java in
our Java folder so just go to the main
activity dot Java file and in here first
of all we will declare the object of
time picker and button so
so our objects are created now and now
what we are going to do is we are going
to create a function and this function
in this function we are going to write a
code whenever the button is clicked we
want to show that time which is picked
by time picker so let's create a
function public void show time which
takes no argument and inside this
function we are going to first of all
cost of a object which we have declared
first is for date/time picker
so we have successfully casted both our
objects and now we are going to take
this object of button and we will call
set on click method on this button and
then inside the set on click method we
are going to write the code to show the
time right so take the button instance
dot set one click listener and inside
this we are going to create a new on
click listener and inside our on click
method what we are going to do is let's
take a toast to show the time so toast
dot make text and first instance let us
take the get base context second is the
actual you know text in which we want to
show the time so for example we will
take this time picker instance dot get
current hour and this will give you the
current hours so for example if the time
is 1115 then it will show you eleven
right because it's a plus we want to
also show the minute also for example so
after this we will concatenate it with
minutes so time picker dot get current
minute okay and the third argument is
the duration so toast dot let's take
length short and then we are going to
show this message so show okay now our
code is complete the only thing which
remains is the calling of a function
inside on create method so just call it
inside on create method or copy this one
inside on create method and now we can
run our program let's one do one thing
more here is we are forgot to give this
concatenation operator so just give it
and now let's run our program so now our
app is running now you can see the
date/time picker and the button here and
you can choose the time by clicking on
this green palette here so right now the
time is 11 and if you want to change the
minute you can just click this thing and
you can change minute by dragging this
arrow on the circle like this or if you
want to change the time you can change
it by clicking on time and dragging this
like this okay so for example I want to
set to 15 so I can set it like this and
I can also even set the a.m. or p.m.
options and now for example I want to
set or show the time so when I click
show time button it's going to show the
time ok
2:15 let's change the time some to some
new time and let's change it to 1055 I
chose 1055 right so in this way you can
use the date/time picker
there is one more option right now you
can see it in you know 24-hour format
you can set it to other formats or using
set so you can take this time picker and
call set is 24 hour as true and it will
be changed to I think 12
something like this okay so you can do
this also to set the time options so in
this way you can use a date/time picker
or time picker in Android I hope you
