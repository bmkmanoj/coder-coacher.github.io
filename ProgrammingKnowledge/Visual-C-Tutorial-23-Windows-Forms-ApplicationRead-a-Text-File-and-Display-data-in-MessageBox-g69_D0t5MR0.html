last video I have shown you how to open
a dialog box my button so for example I
press this button and it opens the
dialog box and when I select some file
it copy the file but in this video I
will show you how to read a text file
I'm repeating it this is a code for the
text file not a PDF file or any other
type of file it's only to read a text
file PDF file it will also read but in
some weird form so only the text file I
can guarantee you that it will read so
let's get started and I will show you
how to read it this is open Wiley
which I have shown you last time in the
last video just double click it and this
code I have shown you in the last video
okay just go to the position go to the
place where you have declared this
string cap is equal to string file name
is equal to open dialog one arrow point
initial directory plus open find out of
one arrow point a fine name just below
that and above your message box just
declare a variable string
cap symbol and you can name it as let me
define and then white is equal to pi w :
read all text in the bracket and break a
closed and in this bracket just pass
this part where you have written in
which we have copied the part of our
directory or file so just copy and paste
it here in this file all read text
bracket and just copy this once again
and paste it instead of this STR file
name which we have taken a step so what
it will do is it will copy the path of
the directory or a file and just through
this path it will read all the text from
the text file and it will place that
text into this string variable and this
string variable we can see in the
message box you can also use a text
field for that or text box for that I am
just using message box because I just
wanted to show how to do this if you
want to analyze that text string then
you can take it in the text box
okay and let's try to learn the program
if it runs or not it's running so
there's a name password okay and I press
this open opened this dialog box and in
here I have our text box a text file
with the extension txt so when I select
it it should open the text in the
message box so I double click it and you
can see it has read that text and place
it into the message box so it can read
the text from the text file and place
this pie into the message box so in this
way you can read a text file and analyze
it you know if you want and then using
use it according to your project so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
