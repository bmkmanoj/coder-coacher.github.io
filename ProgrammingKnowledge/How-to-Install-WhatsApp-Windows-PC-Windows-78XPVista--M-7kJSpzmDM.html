show you how to install whatsapp on your
Windows operating system or on your Mac
OS so for this demonstration I'm using
my Windows PC so just open your browser
and in the search just right loose takes
here and the first link you will find is
from blue sticks and blue sticks is a
software or the app using which you can
run your Android app or mobile app on
your PC so you just need to download
this installation for your windows from
here or if you are using Mac OS you need
to install your blue sticks from here so
just click it and in run the Installer
and blue sticks will be installed in
your system and if you find or if you
encounter any errors related to the
graphic drivers and all I have made the
last video on that so how to properly
install the blue state without any
graphic card problems so I will give you
the link of that video also so you can
see if you encounter some problem in
installing blue sticks so once your
installation is done you just go to the
Start menu and just start blue stakes
from here just click this start blue
sticks and it will start here it's
loading now once your glue sticks app is
loaded we need to find what's up here so
in the messaging section here you will
be able to find blues whatsapp so just
click this messaging here and you will
see top messaging app
on blue stakes and most popular I think
is what's apt so just click this
whatsapp here and here you will see some
apps tools from which you can download
this blue stakes right so one G app and
App Store
so for example I'm choosing this Google
App Store for installing whatsapp right
but my Google App Store is not showing
whatsapp messenger so I will use this
one stool for installing whatsapp
messenger so I will just click this
first icon here and it will start
downloading the Watts up messenger from
here and in some moments whatsapp will
be ready to use so the process is
complete now and once this process is
complete you will be able to see this
whatsapp and below whatsapp you will be
able to see this message installed so
you may know that whatsapp is installed
in your blue stake app right and to
accept it access your whatsapp you just
need to go to this my app section and
you see here whatsapp is a new entry in
your my apps so I will just click what's
up here and it will start the wizard to
install whatsapp on your glue sticks so
if you agree with these license and
some condition just click agree and
continue and in here you just need to
choose your country and you just need to
give the phone number you have and
that's it you will be able to install
whatsapp on your PC and you will be able
to message or you will be able to use
whatsapp using your PC I hope you have
