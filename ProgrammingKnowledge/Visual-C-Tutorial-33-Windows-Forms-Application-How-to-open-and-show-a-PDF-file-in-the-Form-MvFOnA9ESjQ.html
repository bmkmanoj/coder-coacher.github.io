video I will show you how to read and
show PDF files in your C++ windows form
application so I have this form and I
want to show a PDF file in this form so
how can I show it I will show you today
so first of all go to your tool box here
and right click here and click choose
items and in here go to calm component
this one and click Adobe PDF Reader this
one so I will check it and then I will
press ok what it will do is if you see
your tool bar once again it will create
a new tool called Adobe PDF Reader in
your toolbox so we are going to use this
adorn pre DF Reader and drag and drop
into your form okay I will just resize
it
and then I will go to the properties and
I will go to the anchor properties
because when I resize it it should stick
to the corners of the form so just
anchor from all four sides and then come
to the form once again
now take a button from here this button
we will use to select a file which is a
PDF file so this button we will use to
open the file and to the path of the
file so I will rename it as
choose Phi okay and then I will select
this button choose file and double click
it so this will lead me to the event of
this button in here
first you will write this line open file
dialog cap your file dialog variable
name give it any name as you want is
equal to GC new open file dialog now
copy this variable and paste it below
here and after that right arrow pointers
show dialog and bracket bracket close
this and this are same okay now I will
go to the form and I will select this
PDF Reader tui and I will copy the name
of this PDF reader so this copy and once
again to the button event paste it here
and then arrow pointer SRC is equal to
once again copy this very variable Open
File dialog variable and paste it here
arrow
by name okay so we just need to add
these three lines in order to open a
dialog box and we will open the dialog
box after opening the dialog box we will
pass in this PDF Reader the path of the
PDF file so let's try and run the
program if it runs or not so I will run
the program and it's funny I will make
it a little bit bigger so that we can
see and now when I click this choose
button it will open a dialog box and in
which I can load my PDF so for example I
want to load this PDF I'll select it and
you can see this PDF is loaded into my
form so this is the form and in this
form you could be able to show the PDF
file this is very helpful to show the
documents in your form or if you want to
show the help desk this may come handy
and useful so I hope you enjoyed this
