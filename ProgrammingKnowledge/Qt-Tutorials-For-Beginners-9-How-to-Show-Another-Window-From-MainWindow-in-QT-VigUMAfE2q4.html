QT tutorial for beginners in this video
I'm going to show you how you can open a
second window using your first window in
QT so let's get started what I've done
is I've created a sample project which
is a blank project and what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to go to my main
window form here right so remember right
now we only have one UI or one window
which is our main window but we want to
you know open the second window or
dialog so first of all we need to create
a second you know class in order to open
this second window so how we can create
a second window or second dialog in QT
first of all so let's see how we can do
it so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just right click on my project and in
here I'm going to just say add new and
in here I will just select QT and then I
will select this option which says QT
designer form class ok there are some
other options here like QT item model or
QT designer form which is without that
last it's only the form then we have
resource file qml file and javascript
file but for now we want to use this
option which says QT designer form with
class ok just choose this and then you
have some options or templates to choose
from so you can see first option comes
with dialog with buttons you can see ok
and cancel button comes with this
template then you have dialogue with
button on the right and then you have a
dialogue without button this is the one
we are going to choose we also have the
main window which have the status bar
and the toolbar and we have the widgets
also right so what we are going to do is
we are going to choose this option which
says dialog without
the button and then click next and this
will be the name of your dialogue so you
can change the name of this dialogue
like second dialogue or you can even
change this name totally for example my
second forum or something like this okay
so this will be your second window so
click Next and then we want to add this
window to our project which is yes so
just click finish ok so now when you go
to this edit mode and when you go to the
source file for example you have the
second dialog class created for you in
the header also you have the second
dialog dot H file so this is the class
which is created by QT for you and you
also have the second dialog dot ui file
ok so first of all what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go to my main window UI
which is this one when main window dot
UI and I'm going to add a push button
here and what I want to do is whenever I
push the button I want to open the
second dialog so I will just right here
open second dialog ok so in order to you
know make it work we will just right
click on it and we will say go to slot
and we will choose the slot clicked here
so whenever the button is clicked we
want to perform some actions so just
choose this slot clicked and click OK
here so it's going to create this
function for us which is on push button
clicked function right now in order to
you know the call this second class from
this class you need to include the
header of it right as all C++ program
too so just write include and then just
include this second dialogue dot H file
ok which is this one so this name should
be same as this header file name SEC
dialogue okay now you can use this class
in your main window class so in order to
you know create this class or in order
to create an object and open the second
window from the first you just need to
create an instance of this class so just
right second dialogue and then you can
give the name to this dialogue for
example second dialogue something like
this okay now we have the objects so we
can use this object and then we can call
a method from this object which is
called set model okay so just write set
model with the capital M and this takes
one argument which is true or false so
we want to set the model as true here
okay and then we just need to call this
object once again and we just need to
call a method called exact here okay so
what we are doing here we are creating
an object of our second dialogue class
and we are setting the model is equal to
true so this type of you know creating
the window from the first window or main
window is called model approach okay and
I will demonstrate what the model
approach is in a moment when we run the
program and at the last in the third
line we are just executing our you know
object class for second dialogues so
this is you know what it does is it's
just opening your second dialogue and
it's going to execute it okay so save
your code and run it so whenever we run
this or program what we are going to see
let's see so we will wait for the
program to compile and run and our
project is running so whenever I click
the second dialogue button it's going to
open this
in dialogue which is the second class
right now what model approach is so
whenever you open the second dialogue
you cannot access your main window the
previous window right so unless and
until you close this dialogue second
dialogue you cannot open this main
window here right so this is called the
model approach so whenever you say open
your second dialogue you cannot access
the previous one right now for example
you want to access the previous window
what you can do here so we have some
other approach which is called model
less approach and this will allow us to
use both at the same time now if you
have observed here we have created this
object on the stack right we haven't
used any pointer so as soon as this you
know object go out out of scope it will
be destroyed immediately but in order to
make it persistent or on heap what we
can do is we can first of all I'm going
to just comment this code and what I'm
going to do is this time I'm going to go
to my main window dot H and in here I'm
going to create an object of this second
class right so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just cut this include
header file for the second window or for
a second dialog from here and I will
include it in my header file for main
window dot H right and now in the
private access specifier I'm going to
just create an instance of second dialog
so you can just use second dialog point
second dialog for example okay now in
here there are better ways of creating
point nowadays in modern C++ using smart
pointers shared pointer or Auto pointer
any kind of pointer you can use here
depending upon the situation but I'm
going to follow the conventional route
here as Qt is doing by creating normal
pointers because duty is capable of
handling these kind of pointers but if
you are creating a real application I
will suggest you to use in most of the
times the smart pointers like SMAW
shared pointers or Auto pointers or
unique depending upon the situation
right so this is the some kind of a tip
of the day you can say right so I have
created an object of the second dialog
and now I can go to the main window dot
cpp and in the push button click
function I can just use this second
dialog and I can create a new instance
of this second dialog here and what we
are going to do here is it takes one
argument right and which is the parent
of this second dialog so it asked us to
provide the parent for us and by default
it's set is equal to zero you can see
here so if you don't give any argument
it's okay but we want to set the parent
for this constructor which is this class
which is our main window class right so
this indicates our main window or the
class we are present in at this time
right so as soon as your main window is
destroyed this will be also destroyed
the object of this second dialog will be
destroyed right so now in order to open
the second window just choose this
second dialog once again and then we are
using this arrow pointer to access our
show function here there is a more
function called show and now this
approach of
get in an object and opening the second
window is called Model S approach so I'm
going to save this program and I'm going
to run it once again and let's see what
happens this time so it's going to for
example let's suppress this dialogue
once again on button once again and now
you can see I can access the second
dialogue also and I can access the first
dialogue also second and first right
so using this approach I can access the
first and second window at the same time
when you create this on the heap as a
pointer right now you may be wondering
how you can you know hide the first form
and then open the second form so right
now I am opening the second form but so
maybe in some cases you want to hide
this first window and then open your
second window this is also possible
which is really simple what you need to
do is you just need to here go here and
here you just need to just call a hide
method okay which is this one okay this
hide method will hide this main window
and then open the you know second dialog
right so as the code sequence goes first
it will hide your main window and then
it's going to show it so run the program
once again and when it runs we are going
to press this button and as soon as you
press this button the first window is
hidden right you can see there is no
first window okay
so whenever you call the hide method it
hides the current window so I hope
