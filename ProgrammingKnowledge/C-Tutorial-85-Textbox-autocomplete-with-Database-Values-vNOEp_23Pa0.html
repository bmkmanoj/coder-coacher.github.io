last video I have shown you how to
implement or to complete with your text
box in your windows form application in
c-sharp so for example I have set a
custom list of countries and when I type
some words here it gives me the
suggestion for autocompletes complete
right in this video I will show you how
to connect your text box with the
database so that it will suggest you the
values from the database so if you are
following these videos on MySQL database
and c-sharp
I have made such application and in the
video number 56 which I want to show you
here video number 56 c-sharp tutorial 56
search data in the database and filter
in data grid view or table in c-sharp in
this video I have shown you how to
search data and filter it into the table
so for example R right now I am
searching according to this surname so I
type some surname for example B so it
gives me the suggestion all B bells so
we have to surname with Bell or whatever
you write here it gives me such as the
data and gives me the suggestions right
but some of you have been asking me that
how can we implement autocomplete in
this text box in this search text box so
it gives me the signature suggestions
and then it will filter the values in
this table so in this video I will show
you exactly how to do that
so let's close our program and this is
our program and this was the
implementation just double-click this
search text box which I have shown in
the video number 56 and this code this
three line code I have shown you in
video number 56 okay so for implementing
auto-complete with your text box we are
going to load that values in your text
box or custom custom those values so
what I will do is just above this text
box text change event method I will
create my own function or method so I
right here void which returns nothing
and I give my function name as auto
complete text takes no argument and just
complete
a function and in this function we are
going to implement our autocomplete
method first of all what you need to do
is just go to the form once again and
copy the name of your Xbox search text
box I should say just click it and copy
the name of this textbox so what was the
name
so my textbox name was text box one
which I'm changing for example search
text so I named this text box as search
text this text box okay and now I will
go to the program once again here I have
created my autocomplete method and in
this method I paste the name of my
textbox for search and I click dot and I
write autocomplete
source first no first of all I will set
autocomplete mode first so I select this
autocomplete mode is equal to or to
complete mode dot suggest append this
method bracket and break it closed so I
did that I think this is suggest
appended will not take this bracket so
now it's okay
so I write my textbox named autocomplete
mode is equal to R to complete mode dot
this suggest append mode once again I
copy the name of my textbox I paste it
here and I said auto complete source
this time okay just select Auto complete
source is equal to auto complete source
dot we have these all options we are
going to select custom source so just
select this custom source and complete
the bracket and in the third line just
once against select the search box paste
it here and then right dot auto complete
custom source just like this
or I think you need need even to write
this line you just write autocomplete
string connection collection and give it
a variable name call I named it as call
is equal to new autocomplete string
collection I get a break it closed
so in this autocomplete string
collection variable I will collect all
my database values okay so I have
written these three lines and in the
fourth line I establish the connection
from the database so what I will suggest
you because it will be a too long if I
explain explain you how to connect with
the database once again so I suggest you
to watch this video number 10 in which I
have shown you how to link combo box
with the database if you if you are
following these video you will not have
any problem understanding the code or
but otherwise just see this how to link
your combo box with the database i will
copy whole code from that method which I
have used in that video and I will I am
going to paste in our method
autocomplete method so I go up and I
search for fill combo method which I
have used in video number 10 and here it
is so in the video number 10 I have used
this pill combo method and I have shown
you this code so I am copying all the
code from here which is basically just a
connection with the database and
executing the query from the
dummies so copy all the code from this
string to the end of this try-catch
block and once again we go to our
autocomplete method here okay and just
below these declaration autocomplete
connection call declaration just below
this I paste my code from my video
number 10 so what this code is basically
it's creating the connection with MySQL
database so this line is for that and
then I am writing the query which is
select star from my database name dot my
table name then I write my SQL
collection variables give it a variable
name is equal to new MySQL connection
and pass this connection here and then I
create a command variable my SQL command
is equal to new MySQL command and I pass
the query and the connection variable
here this variable and the query and
then I created a try-catch block so if
any exception this try/catch block will
catch and then I open the database with
Korn database this a MySQL connection
variable and I create this MySQL data
read a variable is equal to this
database command variable dot execute
reader and while it continues reading I
am taking the values from the database
and Syd setting it into my string
variable right so now what I am going to
do is I will not change anything in the
program I will just keep it same so if
you want just pause the video and copy
it as it is if you are using MySQL
database and of course above this we
have all three lines of this code which
we have
written earlier so this query will also
remain same select star from the
database and here in the while loop I
was taking this name variable name and
setting it into the string variable so
right now because I am searching for
surname in my text box I can change it
as name first so name so right now I am
searching for name in my table right and
in here also this is table I delete this
combo box with the item dot add code
from here inside this while loop and
what I am doing I will do is I will copy
this call variable autocomplete string
collection call variable just copy it go
inside your while loop here and click
dot add and break it and break it closed
and inside these bracket I pass this
name variable okay
so pass this name variable so what it
will do is it will take all the names
from my database and set it into this
collection variable of my textbox and
now once my code is complete if you want
just pause the video and copy the code
and now once it's complete I want to
copy this method name or to complete
text method which I have created and I
want to go up where my initialized
component method is there if you
remember this method initializes first
when you run your program so go to your
public
declaration of your form and here
wherever you find this initialized
component method just below that this is
by default in every program so just
below that paste your new function name
autocomplete text and close it so it
will execute this method at the starting
of your running of your form so now when
it's complete let's try and run the
program username in database correct I
load all the values in the table and now
just see here it already has called my
autocomplete text method because I have
called it in the declaration and now I
want to type some name here from this
list so for example J
and it's not giving me any suggestions
so I must have done something wrong or I
left some code in my code so let's see
what I have done wrong so I come to my
this autocomplete text method and I have
written all the code here so I think you
remember all the code so I think I have
defined or I have collected all the
values from the database in this call
variable here in my while loop but I
have forgot to set these call values in
my textbox this search text box so at
the bottom of your method after this
try-catch completes what you need to do
is just copy the name of the textbox
once again for the search search text
box name which is search text once again
go to the code and so in your
autocomplete method at bottom of your
method just before the closing of your
method just paste your search text box
name and right dot autocomplete custom
source okay is equal to this call which
is autocomplete string collections
variable right so copy this call
variable and paste it here complete it
like this
okay so I forgot this line I collected
all the data from the database but I
haven't set this collection to my text
box now it should give me suggestions so
let's try and run the program load the
table once again I type some words from
this name so for example J it gives me
all suggestions here you are seeing I
can click this Jill and it finds me Jill
it I can click this John and it gives me
John name here okay so it's working now
and that's what I wanted so you have
successfully implemented or in your
search method for which is connected
with the database once again you want to
search for what her hustle you have to
suggestion which letter H you select one
and it search the name Husson and then
it filters the value and set it into
this table so I hope you understand the
what I wanted to show you and please
