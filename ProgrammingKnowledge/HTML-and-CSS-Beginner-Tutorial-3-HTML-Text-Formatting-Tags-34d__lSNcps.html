last video I have shown you how you can
write your first program in HTML using
this notepad plus plus editor and I have
shown you what this HTML tag is what is
this head title and the body and we have
added some paragraph and heading in our
main body now in this video I will show
you some more tags so let's get started
first thing is if this is for paragraph
this I have shown you in the last video
and if you want to insert some more data
like please subscribe and you want this
line on one line and this on next line
so how can you do that because this
paragraph
don't break these lines it shows these
lines as it is so to break these lines
we add just smaller than n greater than
sign and write BR and what this BR will
do is it will break your line so let's
see if it works or not
save your code and run it in your
favorite browser and yes it breaks the
line so first paragraph and here is the
second line of the paragraph so this is
break now sometimes in when you are
writing a big code you need to write
comments in your code so for example I
will give you an example when you write
this
and this here and here you write not and
to more and whatever you write in
between this and this code it will not
be executed it will be taken as a
comment so for example you want to
insert an important comment for example
heading is below so you need to write
like this so this code will not be
executed as a HTML code okay and now I
will show you how you can use text
formatting with these paragraphs okay so
first of all let us see this works or
not this will be acting like comment so
it will it should not execute so let's
check this first and yes it's not
executing it's showing the previous
result now I will show you some text
formatting tags which you can use with
these paragraph okay so first of all I
will make some space here and I will add
text formatting tags here so these all
tags I will explain all things one by
one so these all are text formatting tag
so what are these text formatting tag I
will show you one by one so first you
can see here we are writing a
so we write P and at the end also P so
whatever inside this P tag is a
paragraph right and now if you notice I
am writing this less than and greater
than an in between I am writing this B
letter and I am closing it also so what
this B will do is it will make your text
bold so whatever text inside this bowl
that tag will be will appear as bold
text okay
now second this one once again the
paragraph and in here I have written
this smaller than a greater than sign
and in between I have written
eeehm and I have closed it this will
emphasize your text in your paragraph so
we will see the result and then you will
be able to recognize what is emphasized
text in the third line once again the
paragraph and I have in I have enclose
this text in greater than and smaller
than and this I sign this is for italic
letters so whatever you pass in between
this italic tag all this code will
appear as a italic letters in the next
line I have written a paragraph and here
I have given the small tag so whatever
inside the small tag will appear smaller
than normal size and next is the strong
tag so whatever you write in the strong
tag will appear as strong text right
like you can say it's a bold text but
really it
appear as a mean text in the next line I
have written a paragraph and in here I
have supplied the su P tag this is for
subscript tag and whatever inside this
tag will appear as a subscript okay and
in the next line I have written a
paragraph and I am using two tags here
one is delete tag so whatever you will
provide inside the DL tag will appear as
deleted some cross line will be there on
blue and this is tag will add something
to the text so I honest we'll add a
underline in your text whatever inside
here so this all tags are called text
formatting tag tags and now let's try to
save it and let's see what is the output
of these oil tags
okay so save and run in your favorite
browser and you can see here all the
output of our tags so first was bold tag
right so this becomes bold whatever text
here is bold if you can notice this
second was we are using emphasized tag
so it becomes a emphasized type of text
formatting third was we were using
italic text so you notice that this text
text here is italic and other is normal
fourth was the small tag
so this go this line will appear smaller
than normal size right
and the other was the strong tag so
whatever you will write inside strong
tag it appears as a strong a text so it
will be really at the front the next tag
we have used was subscript tag so
subscript add your text add the power of
something like this like a subscript
right and the next tag we have used two
other tags which were delete tags so for
blue we have used delete tag so it looks
like it's deleted or cross-line is here
and other tag we have used was a NS tag
so it it's underscored and this
exclamation mark is there right do we
have this exclamation yes it we have so
this just underlined this red text okay
so this all is called text formatting
tags all these and when you write them
when you are making your website you are
going to need all these tags in your
website when you are writing something
somewhere or the other you will surely
require one of these formatting tags so
that's it for this video in the next
video I will show you some more HTML
codes so please stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
