last video I have shown you how to
create a local database using your
visual studio and I have also shown you
how to connect your local database with
your C shop windows form application
until now we have this form and we have
table and we have text field to add it
in this video I will show you how to
write a code to save add it and remove
your data from the database so you can
say that this is the same functionality
which you can do it from here but if you
go to the code here
it hasn't generated much code for
editing or or removing the database okay
so I will show you what code you need to
write in order to remove or add new
doors added the daughter so let's get
started
I will take three buttons yeah one two
and three and I will change the text of
this button first is add new second is
save for example and third is remove
okay now we will write the code for this
button a click event but if you have
noticed last time when we have dragged
and dropped this data grid view from our
datasource and we have drag and drop
this data default data here it has
generated some code here also so it has
generated employed data set one employee
info binding source employee info table
adopter in table adopter manager and
employee info binding navigate
so in your code also you will be able to
see these things according to the name
of the database and according to the
name of your table so just remember this
we are going to use this in our code now
just select your add new button and
double click it and here we will write
this dot binding not binding but
employee info binding so employ in for
binding source dot add new ok this
should be dot add new so this will add a
new data to your database and second we
will write the code for saving or adding
the saved data saving this additive data
and sorry so here we will write this dot
validate and in the next line we will
write this dot binding source which is
employing for binding source so
everywhere employ info binding source
dot and add it ok and once you have
edited your data you need to update it
into the table also right so write this
dot table up adopter manager dot update
all and in the bracket we will pass the
data set so we will run this dot
employee data set one okay so this is
for saving the edited data now the code
for removing the data just select or
remove button and double click it and he
we write this dot and point for binding
source once again dot removed current
okay to remove the current data so this
is the code for adding and editing the
save at saving the edited data and the
rebel the removing your daughter so
let's try and run the program and till
now we have two employees let's add one
more employee don't forget to select
this row last row otherwise if you
select this it will add it your data in
this row so I select this raw last and I
will add a new data okay so I will say
first of all add new and here I will say
this is employee ID 3 name is Patrick so
name is something and age is 40 and is
he married yes and I will say add new
and if you see he has added a new item
but he has added the last data which I
have selected so this time when you want
to add a new data just click here add
new and then add your new daughter some
name surname and age this time is not
married and I will say save and now this
time we have added into the new row
right
some more employee-employer some names
some surname and age and he is married
and say add new okay now for example I
want to add it the data of this employee
so I will select this one and I will say
this name should be something else there
should be some new name and some new
surname and age is also different and I
will say and this time let click he is
married and I will save the data and now
data is added here you can see him and
if you want to remove some data just
select this cell for removing the data
and say remove and your data is removed
from here okay

written the code for adding new data and
saving the edited data and removing your
daughter so I hope you have enjoyed this
