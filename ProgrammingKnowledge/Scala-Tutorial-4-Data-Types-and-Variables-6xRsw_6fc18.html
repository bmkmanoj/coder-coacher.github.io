Scala tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen how to install SBT on
our Windows operating system now in this
video we will learn how to use data
types and variables in Scala now in this
video and some of the next few videos I
will be showing you how to use Scala
terminal or Scala interpreter or Scala
repple or you can also say a scholar
read eval print loop right so you will
be familiar with some terminal commands
also and you will see how you can use
Scala interpreter and later we will
install some kind of an IDE to work with
our Scala code so let's start with how
to use Scala rapid so we already know
that we have installed SBT so just
create a directory in which you want to
you know create your project for example
now we already know that Scala is not an
interpreted language
it's a compiled language right so
whatever code even if you use repl or
Apple - you know declare your variables
they will be eventually converted to a
class file and then they will show the
result right so for that you just need
to create a folder in which you want to
create or use this Gala apples so for
example I created a folder called
variables so right now my current
working directory is this variables
folder and you can see to start with
this variables folder is empty for now
right now to start your Scala Apple what
you do is you give a command called SBT
console ok so just write SBT console and
then press Enter and now press enter
once again and now you can see the Scala
rebel has been started here you can see
the version of Scala which it's using so
we are using Scala two point twelve
point three right now so
talk about the datatypes which we can
use in Scala so these are some of the
basic data types we can use in Scala so
we can use boolean byte short care int
long float double and string as data
types there are some more data types
which are these data types which are
unit null nothing any and any ref these
are some of the advanced data type and
we will talk about them a little bit
later so we can see here boolean as you
already know that it can be a true or
false value by it is a 8-bit signed
value shot is a 16-bit signed value care
is a 16-bit unsigned unicode character
int is 32-bit signed value long is
64-bit signed value and then you have
four single precision float or double
precision float and at last we have
string which is a sequence of characters
now how we declare variables in Scala
so in Scala you can declare variables in
two ways so let's see the first way of
declaring variables so the first way of
declaring variables is using var and var
whenever you use var that means it's a
mutable value that means you can change
the value of this variable later okay so
mutable variable means you can change
the value of this variable later so you
write var this is a keyword then you
give a name to your variable for example
I use a simple name a and then you give
the datatype after this : so then you
use : and the datatype for example i use
int as datatype and then you initialize
your value with equals and then whatever
number you want to give here so you use
var a special keyword which indicates
that this is a mutable value
then a variable name then a colon then a
data type and then equals the value of
data type right now you can use the
semicolon to end your line of code or
you can leave it without a semicolon it
doesn't matter right so when I just
press ENTER and it says a colon int is
equal to 12 so this basically means that
we have declared a variable called a
whose data type is int and we have
assigned the value of 12 to this
variable a right now you can do a plus
30 for example and then press Enter and
then you will get the value for this so
12 plus 30 is 42 and you will see the
result and the result of data type you
can see here and if you are wondering
what is this this is a temporary
variable in which your result will be
stored and then at last this is the
sequence which will increase one by one
so result 0 this is a temporary data
type and it will start with our es for
example 0 and when you will evaluate
more expressions using this Scala Apple
then you will see this number will
increase by 1 every time you do this so
for example when I do a plus 40 now then
you will see our es 1 that means this
value at last is increased by 1 and this
is a temporary result variable which is
created by Scala for you so you can
declare a variable like where or mutable
variable and then you can declare a
variable as an immutable variable so for
those immutable values we use a keyword
called Val and then your variable name
for example B colon and then your data
type for example int and then you
initialize your variable for example 15
okay and then press Enter and you can
see this variable is declared is that
when you declare a very
using Val keyword then its value cannot
be changed so this means that value of
variable B is constant and it cannot be
changed or it's immutable that means it
cannot be changed so for example I use B
is equal to 20 now it will give me the
error and it says reassignment to well
on the other hand when I do a is equal
to 20 and then press Enter it's totally
fine because we have used a keyword
called var before it that means the
variable value can be changed right so
when you use vlaar the variable value
can be changed when you use Val the
variable value cannot be changed and now
let's see in the folder in which we are
working in so you can see we are working
in the variable folder and earlier it
was empty but when we you know start or
Apple in this folder there is a folder
called target created automatically in
this folder and here we are for example
intermediate files will be created for
Scala and they will be compiled and they
will show the result here on the
terminal so always keep in mind Scala is
not interpreted it's a compiled language
now let's say you declare a variable var
C colon int for example and we are not
initializing this value okay so we
haven't assigned any value to C and then
we press ENTER and it says error that
means you need to initialize these value
whenever you are using this Apple now
there is a special feature about Scala
and that is datatype recognition by its
initialization value okay so for example
I declare a variable C once again and
then I don't give any data type to it
I will just say is equal to true let me
correct this it should be
true with smaller T ok and then press
ENTER and then you will see that Scala
recognizes the datatype by the
initialization value okay so for example
you initialize the value is equal to
true that means Scala interprets that
it's a boolean data type so we can see
here boolean data type is assigned to
see here now for example I can declare
var D is equal to some number so for
example let's say I define a number
called 12.3 this is a float value and we
say enter so by default it recognizes
this decimal value as a double data type
right it doesn't recognize this by
default this decimal number as a float
value so if you want to define the
variable as a float value you can just
write F here and now it will recognize
this value as a float okay so what this
indicates that Scala interprets its
variable data type from the
initialization value whatever we assign
as an initial value to our variables so
if we assign true the data type will be
automatically inferred as boolean right
if we assign any integer then data type
will be automatically assigned as int if
we use a decimal value the default data
type is double but we can also declare a
float data type with these kind of
initial values now in Scala you can use
multiple expression using a curly
bracket so for example I declare our
immutable variable X and then I use
these curly brackets and inside those
curly bracket I can declare some
variable for example
well a colon int is equal to 200 and
then I can separate those expression by
semicolon so I can declare a second
variable for example well B is equal to
300 and semicolon and then we can
just return the result using their last
expression so for example you want a
plus B here so we can just write a plus
B and then press ENTER and you will get
500 and what this means this means that
we have declared two variables variable
a is equal to 200 variable B is equal to
300 both are integers and the last
expression returns the result okay so
this will add those two values and
assign the value to the variable X okay
so the final value of x will be 500 okay
so the last expression is the result
which will be returned and assigned to
the variable and it's not necessary that
you can declare only two variables here
you can declare any number of variables
here but the last expression will
evaluate the result and assign it to
this variable okay so for example that
if there will be ABC variable and if you
want to do the addition of all three
variables then you can do that also now
I said that you can separate these
expression by semicolons so this is one
statement this second statement this is
third statement right so you can either
use semicolon or a next line so for
example same thing I want to do so I
will do well X is equal to then curly
bracket and then press ENTER and then I
can declare a first variable for example
Val a is equal to 500 this time and then
press Enter Val B is equal to 600 this
time and then press ENTER and then we
will evaluate these two values for
example a plus B and then press ENTER
and then give the ending curly bracket
and once you press ENTER now then you
will see the result and result is 1100
that means you can use semicolon as addy
the meter or a new line as a delimiter
now the last thing I want to talk about
in this video is the lazy loading or
on-demand loading so generally you
declare a variable like this so well X
is equal to 500 and then press ENTER and
it declares our variable and it
allocates the memory for this value and
everything is good and now for example I
want to do some arithmetic operation on
this so for example I do X multiplied by
30 right and then press enter it will
give us the result okay now let's say we
declare here a list for example list
which contains millions and millions of
values right so what happens then that
means that we have to up front allocate
that much amount of memory to those
millions and millions of values and this
is unrequired or harmful sometimes
because sometimes those variables are
not used and that much amount of memory
is going into ways or is unused right so
for that we have a lazy initialization
so what we do we just write lazy here
and then well X is equal to 500 once
again and then press Enter and you can
see this time the value assigned here is
lazy
that means this value is not assigned
right now but it will be assigned
whenever this is used so if X is unused
this memory will never be assigned if
this X will be used for example we are
using it to multiply it by 2 then only
it will be used otherwise this memory
will not be used ok so this means we are
using the value on demand or this is a
lazy initialization that means whenever
the variable is used at that time it
will be initialized and not
for that okay so at this time we are
using X into 2 that means it will be
initialized and then you will see the
answer which is thousand here okay
so lazy initialization means the value
of the variable will only be initialized
when it is used so that's it for this
