a new video series on C++ for beginner
so why do we care about learning C++ C++
is the most popular language of modern
times and by using C++ you can develop
modern gains maana programs like if you
want to program a microcontroller or
microprocessor you can use C++ for
programming those microcontroller or
microprocessor because C++ is a superset
of C so it's more modular more
object-oriented and more easier to
understand and implement then C so for
example if you see digital watches or
digital thermometer or digital anything
you can use C++ to program those devices
or even modern robots also you can
program using C++ now for developing C++
we need to use something on which we can
write and compile our C++ program so
these thing or this software on which we
can write in compile our program are
called i des and water i des i des are
the full form of ide is integrated
development environment and it helped us
to write and compiler program so let's
download a free ide for compiling c++
and just open first of all your favorite
browser and in the
just write code blocks and search for
this and the first link here you will
find is www.kickstartcart.com
support this IDE right and now how do we
download and install this ID just go to
this download tab and in here there are
three options for you download the
binary release download the source code
and retrieve source code from SPN that
is subversion the link we are interested
in is this link download the binary
release just click this link and in here
there are different downloadable options
like Linux or Mac OS but the one we are
interested in is for Windows and here
also there are three options download
this code blocks and the option we are
interested in is this middle option
which is code blocks - the version the
latest version is point 12 right
now and min gw- setup so just download
this option with mingw
so just select this option and just
click this sourceforge.net and it will
download poured rocks on your computer
and once this codeblocks
ide is downloaded you just save it and
run this installer i have already
downloaded the code blocks on my system
it's not really rocket science you just
need to click some next buttons and code
blocks will be installed on your system
okay so once code blocks is installed in
on your system just go to the start
button and just open this for blocks
from this start menu and this will open
code blocks here and now for creating a
new project implode blocks you can
either click this option here or you can
go to this file menu here and go to new
and new project ok and there are
different option we can develop using
code blocks like you can program arm
devices arm devices that means micro
processors or some other kind of
programs you can make with code blocks
but the one we are interested in is this
console application ok so just click
this and click go and just click Next
and here there are two options C and C++
so obviously we will choose C++ because
this is a C++ tutorial and click Next
and in here you need to write the name
of your project ok so just give any name
to your project
for example test my frog or you can say
my first prong or program okay and in
here where it says folder to create
project in you need to choose one folder
in which you want to save your program
so for the first time when you start
this code block this option will be
empty and you need to give some path
here to a folder so that your C++
program can be saved in that specified
path so just give some path here or give
the path of the folder in which you want
to save your project okay and this will
be generated automatically and click
Next and the compiler we are using is
C++ or GNU GCC compiler there are other
compiler available also but by default
compiler is GNU GCC compiler and press
finish and you can see here our new
project is created here called my first
prog and in here there is a folder
called source and when you click this
plus button here this is small plus
button you will be able to see this main
dot CPP file and when you click this may
not see PP just double-click it and it
will open this main dot CPP in here in
your workspace
and what is this main dot CPP is this is
a file in which our program will be
started okay oh it will be writable so
by default code blocks has generated a
very simple program for us which I'm
going to explain in the next video but
what I am going to show you is how you
can compile this program so once you
have written your program in your IDE
you need to compile your program that
means you need to verify that if you
have committed any mistakes in your
program while writing your program so
compiler recognizes mistakes or suggests
suggestion if you have done any mistakes
in your program and it will make a
binary or executable file for you which
you can run so how you can compile your
program just select your project in my
case this is my first project
right-click it and just search for the
option called bill ok just click this
option build and you can see here our
program is built now and it has zero
errors zero warnings that means our
program is successfully compiled now to
run your program you can either press
this button or you can go to build and
press Run button here ok and there is a
build option here also which we have
used here earlier so just go to build
and click the Run button and you can see
this egg's this terminal has started and
it has printed hello world because it's
our first program and this is to print
hello world so you can see here hello
world and this other thing is a default
so this you don't really care about but
the message we wanted to show is hello
world so in this way you can download
and install code blocks IDE on your
Windows operating system in the next
video I will also show you how you can
download and install code blocks on your
Linux operating system like Ubuntu so if
you want to use Windows you can skip
that video and you can directly jump to
the first video where I will show you
how this program works okay
so that's it for now I hope you have
learned something new this time please

now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
