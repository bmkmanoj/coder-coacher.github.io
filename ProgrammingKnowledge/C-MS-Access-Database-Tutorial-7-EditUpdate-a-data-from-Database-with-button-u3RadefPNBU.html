shown you how to save the data in the
Access database using your she shop
windows form application now in this
video I am going to show you how you can
add it or update data in the Access
database using your see shop windows
form application if you have noticed in
the last video I was using the first
name last name and pay on labels and
text boxes and in this video I have
added one more field which is Eid and
Eid text box which is this employee ID
text box why I have added this a ID text
box here because this e ID is our
primary key in the database if you go to
the design view you see it's a primary
key and primary key is nothing but the
unique identifiable for your data so in
order to update your data you need to
have some unique ID or unique a unique
column on the basis of which you can add
it data right so our form is like that
this and let's try to add it data by
adding a button into our form and I will
change the text of this button as added
data and I will change the name of this
button also as BTN underscore added for
example okay and let's change the font
size of this button also so that you can
see this so I will go to the font bold
16 done now I will just double click
this button and in here I am going to
write the code for editing the data now
what I am going to do is if you remember
in the last video I have shown you how
to save your data right I will go to
this button click event of save data
I will copy all the code inside this
Save button click event which I have
shown you in the last video and I will
paste it in the button click event of
added data why I am doing this because
most of the code will remain same only
the query will change so I will just
delete the query whatever I have and I
will write the new query here and
everything will remain same so just
watch the last video if you haven't seen
it and you will be good to go I will
also change this message to data added
successful okay so we know that our
daughter and it is successful now in
order to update or edit data we use the
query like this so I also want to show
the query what what query builds
whenever our query we write the query so
what I'm going to do is I will declare a
string variable string query is equal to
and whatever query I am going to write I
am going to write here and I will just
pass this string variable here this will
come on dot comma come on text we will
pass the disk query which we will write
here right so what I am going to do is
if you don't remember the code I will
just explain it once again we are
opening the connection with the database
using this oledb connection object and
then we create a command called command
which is only DB object of the class
well DB and then we create a connection
we give the connection to this command
command or connection is equal to
connection and now we will write the
query and then we will pass the query to
the command and then
it will be executed by this core command
or the execute non query and if
everything goes well we will see this
message and then it will be this
connection will be closed so let's see
what is the query in order to add it the
database so to edit the database we
write the query like this update and
then the table name you have which is
employed data in my case joint employ
data and then you the keywords set to
set the values and what values I want to
set I want to set first name last name
and pay on the basis of employee ID so
what I will do I will just copy the name
of my first name column right here and
write equal to and then I will write
single code not the double coat but
single code and double quotation and
then plus plus and then in here I will
pass whatever is the text box name of
this first name text box dot txt okay
similarly I will just give space here
and we copy the name or of the column of
last name is equal to single code in
between the bill codes between this plus
plus and if you are wondering why I
always do single quote double quote plus
plus this is just a basic concept of
string concatenation this is a one
string this will be other string and
this will be other string and plus we
use it use this plus symbol to
concatenate our string I will also show
you the message or the string when it
builds in the message box so you will be
able to see
okay so this last name is equal to the
column name of on the text box name of
last name plus dot text and then the pay
so all right pay is equal to single code
in between double quote in between plus
plus okay
and in here we are going to copy or pay
text box dot txt now we have already
assigned the value but where we want to
assign the value we will write it like
this so this will be semicolon here
first and this will be where our a ID is
equal to whatever is our e ID so just
notice that I I D employee ID is a auto
number or it's a number so we will not
give a single quote we will just give
double quotes + + plus sign here and I
will explain you why I done that and I
will just use the text box name of text
box PID dot txt and let's print this
first print this query in a message box
message box bot show and I want to print
this way
so this queries like this update from
your table name set whatever your column
name is then the single quote double
quote and then the value in the text box
same is for the last name in which is
separated by comma so let's separate
this last name and pay by comma okay so
once again update table name set
first-name whatever value in the text
box
comma last name whatever value in the
text box pay whatever value in the text
box where your employee ID and we want
to added this data where we must have
the location where we want to add it or
doctor right so on this on the basis of
employee ID I want to add it my daughter
that's why I have written where employee
ID and here if you notice I haven't
given single quote here I have just
enclose it a double quote and plus
symbol but generally I have used single
quote and why I will explain you when
you will see this message query in him
so let's try and run the program and
give and give the username and password
and let's see if it's okay or not that
saying it's unhandled some oh let's see
why okay so I think my database is open
right now so I need to close it because
I already told you we can only make one
connection at a time right run the
program once again and I will give
username and password and login
successful we reach to the second form
and in here we will try to add it our
data from the database so for example I
want to add it the data in on the
employee ID 14 for example and let's see
what if the dot I'm Chloe ID 14 so I we
open my database once again and employed
our top employee ID 14 has the first
name programming and last name knowledge
and the pay is $30 for power so I will
change it as Eric instead of programming
and the last name is something like this
and the pay is this one right so we want
to change this programming knowledge by
Eric Gomes and the pay is 50 instead of
40 I will click this button added data
and we will see this message because we
were showing the query here and now I
will explain why I haven't used single
not single quotes in the case of
employee ID so our query builds like
this update employee data which is our
table name set the first name and first
name is a text field that's why it needs
to be in these single quotes right last
name is also a text field that's why we
need to give them
in the single quotes pay is a number but
we can just give them give it as a text
and axis can know that this is a number
and it can deduce that and after this
bear claws we are comparing employee ID
with whatever we write in the text box
this text box right so comparison we
cannot compare a number with a string
and if we use single quotes here then it
will be a string and your exes will
think that you are assigning employee ID
as a string which is which employee ID
is not employee ID is a number right
that's why I haven't used single quotes
here okay to compare employee ID with
this number so there will be no clashes
in between and when I click this ok you
will see added that I added successful
ok and you see here and I go here this
data has changed ok once again I want to
add it the data for example employee ID
15 let me see if I I was closing the
connection or not yeah I was closing the
connection so there will be no problem
in adding the second data so employee ID
15 right now its programming 1 1 1
something and knowledge 1 1 1 let's
change the name to something else and
something else and pay is hundred dollar
per hour and right now its programming 1
1 1 knowledge 1 1 1 and 50 we want to
change it to this value let's do this we
can see our query
I click ok dot I did successful and now
when i refresh my database you see again
the name is changed name and last name
and the pay is changed so just remember
this I will close it first so just
remember this whenever you want to use
this bear claws don't use single quotes
whenever you want to compare some number
if you were comparing some name for
example I want to want to add it my dot
on the basis of first name then I can
use single quote here because then name
will be a a text and whatever I want to
pass it as a txt also so this will
compare the string to string but
employee ID is a number that's why I am
not using double single quotes here
okay so in this way you can add it the
data in the database using c-sharp
windows form application I hope you have
