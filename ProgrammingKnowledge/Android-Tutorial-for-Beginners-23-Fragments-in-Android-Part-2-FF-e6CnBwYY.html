activity dot Java file so go to the Java
folder here and then go to main activity
dot Java and in here first of all we
need to import some library to add these
fragment fragment manager and fragment
transaction okay
so just add these three libraries or
import these three libraries which is
import Android dot a p-- dot fragment
second is import Android dot a p-- dot
fragment manager which we will use to
change fragment or remove fragment right
and import the third library called
Android dot app dot fragment transaction
okay so you just need to add these three
libraries and now we are going to add a
function okay so let's add a function
for example void void change fragment
for example okay and we will pass one
argument view view okay and then inside
this function or method we are going to
write our code let's make it public
and to resolve this just press alt enter
now inside this method what we are going
to do is first of all we will create an
instance of fragment so fragment and we
will name it as fragment itself for
example okay now we want on button click
event we want to open up fragment right
so what we are going to do is we are
going to check which button is clicked
first
so if view is equal to find view by ID
and we will search for for example ID of
button 1 first of all so r dot ID dot
button which is our first button and if
this button is selected we will write
some code otherwise if the other button
is clicked what we are going to do we
will just copy the same code but this
time we will you know check if button 2
is clicked or not
ok now inside are the these if condition
if but 1 is clicked what we are going to
do is we will assign to this instance
the object of fragment 1 ok so this is
our fragment 1 class which inherits
fragment right so we can use
polymorphism property here so you know
to this fragment instance which is our
instance of fragment we can just assign
a new fragment 1 class or object like
this ok and if the button 2 is selected
we will just call fragment 2 class which
is this one fragment too with a spelling
like this okay so it should be fragment
to okay so we have created fragment 1
and fragment 2 classes whenever we have
created this layout it's automatically
created these classes fragment 1 and
fragment 2 right now once you assigned
the instances of fragment 1 and fragment
2 to the main fragment instance now we
will add a fragment manager and then we
will do some transaction so go to your
first step condition and here we will
create an instance of fragment manager
we will name it as FM for example is
equal to and what we are going to do we
are going to call a function called get
fragment manager ok and then we will
create an instance of fragment
transaction and we will name this
fragment transaction instance as ft
which will be FM which is our fragment
manager dot begin transaction ok and
using this transaction what we want to
do is we want to replace or we want to
you know replace the fragment to the
fragment 1 if the fragment one fragment
2 is you know placed in the fragment in
our main activity then whenever one
button one will be clicked it will
replace the fragment to fragment one ok
so we will just use this F T dot replace
and this replace function takes two
arguments one is the fragment
I D so if you remember whenever you go
to this activity underscore main dot XML
file here we have given the ID to this
fragment right which was fragment place
right so we have created this fragment
and the ID for this fragment was
fragment place or you can see click this
fragment and you can see the ID fragment
place iam so we will go to the main main
activity dot Java file and in here pass
the first argument by placing the ID of
the fragment right so r dot ID dot
fragment place ok and the second
argument it takes is the fragment
instance which is this one okay now we
will do the same for the other if
condition if button two is selected what
we are going to do we are just going to
copy this and paste it here ok with no
changes so now our code is almost
complete
there is one more thing I think which is
remaining is whenever we call fragment
transaction we need to commit this
transaction so ft dot commit
okay so whenever you begin a transaction
you need to commit the transaction also
so just place this transaction code here
and one more thing which is remaining is
we need to add this method to the button
click event of button 1 and button 2 so
we have created this change fragment
method so go to your main activity or
activity underscore main dot XML and in
here just choose the button one so just
select button one and search for the
property called on click and select your
method your which you have created
change
and okay same we will do for fragment
two so select fragment two and search
for the property called on click and
select your change fragment method from
here so whenever some button is clicked
this method will be called now we are
going to run our program so now our
program is running you can see by
default this fragment one is selected
here if you remember we have given green
color to fragment one and red color to
fragment to right so by default fragment
one is selected and whenever I click
this button fragment to the fragment two
will be set in here right and I click
fragment one fragment one is set so you
can just change these fragments by
clicking these buttons right now in
these fragments you can create your you
know functionality like if you want to
add some image you want to make a
registration form or some you know some
UI which you want to add to the fragment
and on the button click this this
fragment will be you know replaced on
fly whenever you click button so in this
way fragment works in Android I hope you
