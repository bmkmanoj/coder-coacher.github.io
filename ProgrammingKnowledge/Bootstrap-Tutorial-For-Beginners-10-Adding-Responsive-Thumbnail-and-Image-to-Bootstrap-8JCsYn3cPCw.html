bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to add thumbnails
and images in your bootstrap web page so
let's get started for example I want
some thumbnail for my team here or this
team one team two and three three here
so for example I'm making some tutorial
website so I want to add some code
related thumbnail or image and then I
want to give the headings something like
Java or C++ or something else right so
how do I do it let's see so first of all
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to my project folder where all my
bootstrap file are located and then in
here I have the CSS folder fonts folder
and JavaScript folder I'm going to add
one more folder here so add a new folder
and name it as IMG for images right and
inside this IMG folder paste your images
which you want to add to your website so
for example I want to add these three
images and then I will go to my index
dot HTML and in here in the last video I
have added these three columns inside
this row right and inside the column I
have this head tag and this paragraph
right so above this h3 tag I will add
this link thumbnail so I will add my
image as thumbnail in the form of a link
so I will add first of all this link a
href and for now I will point to a hash
but you can point to
or webpage right and then add a class
called thumbnail and close your link tag
and inside this link element I'm going
to add an image element so I am G and
then my source for the image so SRC is
equal to and in the double quotes the
location of your image so it's in my
image folder IMG / the name of your
image file so for example I have CPP jpg
Java dot jpg and Python dot jpg so first
of all I'm going to add CPP dot jpg and
you can also add the description using
this alt tag so for example CPP tutorial
and close this tag here and save your
code and we will run it in the browser
and once you run it you will see your
image here right now in the same way I
can add two more images here and here so
I will just copy this code from here and
add to the other two columns so like
this and I'm also going to change this
h3 text here for example first is for
C++ second is for Java so I will change
the name of this file Java dot jpg and
this is Java tutorial and third one for
example is python dot jpg and python
tutorial right and I will change this H
had one to python and this here i will
replace it with Java for example save
your code and refresh your web page and
now you can see these images on your web
page
now when you shrink your browser let's
see what happens
so I'm shrinking and when it goes to
medium size it will adjust the size of
your image also so you see the image
size is also adjusting dynamically right
so in this way you can add thumbnails
and images to your web page I hope you
