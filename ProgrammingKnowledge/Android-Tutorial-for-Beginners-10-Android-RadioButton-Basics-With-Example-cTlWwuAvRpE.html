tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use radio buttons in our android
activity now last time we have seen how
to use checkboxes and the basic
difference between checkboxes and radio
button is that whenever you want to
allow the user to choose multiple
options out of a list of options you
generally use checkboxes but whenever
you want to allow the user to choose
only one option out of multiple options
then you can use radio buttons for
example we will take the you know
example that we have taken last time
that we want to allow the user to choose
his or her favorite animal but this time
we want the user or we want to allow the
user to choose only one option out of
multiple options and for that we are
going to use radio buttons now let's
take a look at some examples so that we
can understand this concept in more
detail so I'm going to go to my palette
and there is a container here called a
radio button container or radio group
which I'm going to drag and drop here
now radio group is a container which we
can use to group radio buttons and
whatever radio buttons we put inside
this radio group they are grouped
together and the logic behind the this
grouping is in this group out of this
group we will be only able to connect
you know select only one option out of
multiple radio buttons ok now I'm going
to go to my palette and take some radio
buttons here one two and three radio
buttons for three animals and I will
take a button and then I'm going to
change the I will put this button
outside this outside this radio group
now I am going to select my radio group
and in here in the properties for layout
width of this radio group I will change
it to wrap content and hide also wrap
content so that it takes the space which
it's you know it wants to take right not
enough not much space now I'm going to
change the name of these radio buttons
you
now we can go to our main activity dot
dot Java file to write some code for
these for these radio buttons and this
button so I will go to my main activity
dot Java file and in my main activity
class I'm going to declare these
variable which are three radio buttons
and one button and one radio group which
is this radio group we have taken okay
so I'm going to add these variables
you
so now we have
our variables here now we are going to
create our method so we will create a
method whenever we call this method in
oncreate so that it can listen to button
click event so public void and on click
listener for button okay so the button
and this is not going to take any
argument and inside this method what we
are going to do is we are going to cast
our radio group first okay so in here
radio G for radio group is equal to in
the bracket radio group and we will find
it by ID so find view by ID are not ID
dot radio group right so the name of our
radio group was I think we have one sign
you know define the ID of these radio
group so if it's not defined just select
your radio group or select here and go
to the property called ID and give an ID
to your radio group for example our G
for radio group our G for animals so
this is for this is the ID which is our
D underscore animal for the radio group
okay and I'm going to copy this and go
to here where I am casting my radio
group and I will paste this ID here okay
now I'm going to do the same for other
button
let's do one more thing before calling
this set on click listener for button
that let's declare only one variable for
radio button because we are going to
need only one radio button because we
are going to you know allow the user to
select only one radio button right so we
don't require more variables for radio
button okay and whatever radio button
use a select we are going to cost this
to this radio B now we will set on click
listener for button so button submit
which is our button dot on click
listener or set on click listener so set
on click listener and in here we will
create a new on click listener okay on
click listener and inside this on click
method what we are going to do is we
will declare a integer for deciding of
what getting the ID from the group right
so we will name it a selected ID is
equal to and then we are going to take
our radio group variable and then we
will get the ID so get check radio
button ID and then this radio or
selected ID we will pass to our radio B
which is radio button or variable right
so radio B is equal to we will cast it
to radio button radio button and then we
will find view by ID find view by ID and
this ID we will get from radio button we
can pass it here as an argument
and now whatever you know button is
selected on you know radio button is
selected we can get the text from this
button and display okay so what we can
do is we can call the toast dot make
text text and in here we can call three
arguments now you already know what are
the arguments called right this and
second is the text itself so we will
take this radio button dot get text dot
to string okay
and third is toast dot length short for
example and outside this toast we will
just show it alright so like this are
going to you know include this method in
our on create method here so I will copy
the name of the function or method and
paste it here I will change it to German
and paste it here and now we are going
to run our application so run the
application and here the application
will appear so select your device and
now it's going to appear here so now our
application is running
and whenever we select any item from
here we will only be able to select one
out of these items because remember we
have enclosed these radio buttons inside
the radio group and whenever you enclose
these radio buttons inside the radio
button you will only be able to select
one radio button at a time okay and you
can add multiple radio groups to group
your radio button so you can add one
more group for example
who's your favorite anything and you
will be able to select only one out one
item out of this radio group also okay
so always group your radio button inside
a radio group now for example I select
this and click Submit and it says dog
for example I select cat and click
Submit it's a scat and same it will say
for cow right so in this way you can use
radio buttons in your Android activity I
