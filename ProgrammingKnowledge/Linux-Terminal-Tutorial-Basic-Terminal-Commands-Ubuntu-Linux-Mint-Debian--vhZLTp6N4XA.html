teach you some of the basic terminal
command in Linux terminal I'm using
Ubuntu for this demonstration but this
will work fine on any Linux operating
system which has terminal commands so
let's get started just open your
terminal and the first command we are
going to see is PWD PWD stands for
present working directory and as the
name suggests it just gives you the
present working directory in which we
are in so by default we are in home
folder or on Ubuntu ok now for example
you want to list out all the directory
in your home folder ok so what you can
do is you can give the command LS for
list listing out whatever files or
directory are there in this open to home
folder home
Ubuntu folder ok so just give LS and
press ENTER and it gives all the folder
and document in this open to folder
right now if you want to see the hidden
files this only shows the non hidden
files by this command so if you want to
show the hidden file also what you can
do is you can give the command LS - a a
stand for all lists all and you can see
it will just print out all the files and
which are hidden or not hidden all the
files in the terminal
now our terminal looks like full right
so to clear your terminal you can just
give the command clear then it will
clear your terminal okay so what is the
command for clearing just write clear on
the terminal now once again let's list
out the all the directories and for
example so in the current folder which
we in which we are in it has text of
holder Documents folder and music public
videos okay so for example you want to
go inside your downloads folder or let's
go to the Documents folder first okay so
what you need to do is you need to give
this command CD so CD stand for current
working directory and then give the name
of the folder in which you want to go
okay so firstly you need to list out
this and this folders and if this folder
is present there then just draw and
write CD then
document and slash so whenever you write
do see here and press tab also it will
autocomplete your search so for example
you write do see and press this tab
button it will complete your search like
this and press enter and now you are in
Documents folder let's see what is there
in documents there is nothing in the
documents so let's make a directory in
your document folder so for making the
directory in the folder you need to give
this come on
MK dir for make directory and then you
need to give the name of the directory
so just I will give the name of the
directory as test and press ENTER and
now I will list out all the directories
in documents and I can see there is a
new directory created called test now
for example I want to go into this
directory once again I will write CD and
I will write test for example look here
I am giving this in capital letter which
does not matches this test folder which
is T and small est and giving all
capital and what happens it will give
you error because Linux is case
sensitive whenever you want to go into
some folder in Linux you need to give
the exact spelling of the folder not in
capital letter or not in a small letter
exact spelling so once again when I give
CD test and we are in this directory now
for example I want to go back one
document up so right now I'm in test
directory you see here so in here this
shows that in which directory you are in
this tilde sign
if you can see here this is a small sign
it indicates that we are in our home
folder and in home folder we are in
documents and in document we are in Doc
test folder now once again I want to go
to the last folder that is document
right now we are in test folder right so
for going one folder up you need to give
this command CD space then dot dot okay
so space is not like this CD dot dot
this is not the command command this CD
space dot dot and then you will go one
folder up you see earlier it were we are
we were in test folder and right now we
are in document folder now for example
let us list out once again we have test
folder inside document and we want to
delete this directory once this test
directory which we have created so for
removing this directory you need to give
this command RM dir and give the name of
the directory which is test and press
enter and this command will remove the
directory in your document folder so
this command will remove the test
directory I would say in your folder and
now when you LS or list out the content
in the document and you don't have
anything in the test now for creating
document there is a there is a command
called Nano this is the software which
is pre-installed in Ubuntu so whenever
you give this command Nano
so this nano is up edita terminal editor
and open to which is pre-installed a
number two or any Linux system I am
talking about Ubuntu right now okay so
when you give this Nano command here and
press ENTER you can make any file here
so for example I provide hello
hello world and for saving this file I
will I will just give the command
control X you see here for exiting I
need to give this command control X so
just give control and just press X and
it will say it will ask you whether you
want to save this file I will say yes so
I will write y es or Y and then it will
ask me the name of the file which I want
to give so I will I want to give my file
name as HW for hello world
ok file name is HW and I press ENTER and
we are outside our from our Nano editor
now when I when I list out all the
contents in document folder LS I can see
this file called HW inside my folder and
once again if I want to see the content
of HW once again I will go I will give
this command nano HW so just give nano
and then give the name of the file you
want to open and press ENTER and you see
we have entered hello world in this text
which we have created and control X will
exit now suppose you want to remove this
file what you need to do is you just
need to give RM and then give the name
of the file so RM and then give HW and
whenever you give this command it will
remove your file so once again I will
released out all the content in the
folder and I see here there is no folder
ok so these are some of the basic
commands in Linux and I was showing this
tutorial on Ubuntu you can use this on
Linux Mint or all Debian
Linux operating system and just practice
these commands on other Linux systems so
