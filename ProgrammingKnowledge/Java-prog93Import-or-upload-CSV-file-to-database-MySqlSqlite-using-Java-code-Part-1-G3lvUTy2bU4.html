will show you how you can upload your
CSV file to your database with the help
of a Java program so first of all
question arises is what is a CSV file a
CSV file looks like this which opens in
excel sheet and the full form of CSV
file is comma separated value files so
as the name suggests in CSV file the
values are separated by comma as you can
see in here
so these values are separated by comma
so in many application like in some data
logging sister system or some sensors
they provide their data in the form of
CSV file
so these CSV file we can directly upload
to the database and we can analyze
through our Java program so in this CSV
file I have eleven or I would say ten
values which are separated by comma 1 2
3 and like this these are 10 different
values which are separated by a comma
and this is a sensor data which collects
the data on the basis of time so this is
the real-time data of the project I'm
working on and I want to upload this
data I'm analyzing this data in Java so
first of all what I will do is I will go
to my database and I will make a table
in my database called timing data you
can name your see your database table
whatever you want and what I am done is
I have made
those 11 columns for those 11 values of
data so you just have to make a table
and you have to make the number of
column which your data
csv file contains so my data contains CL
number item ID function state full date
what is the day month here our minute
second and milli second so I made my
table in the database and now I will go
to my code and I will show you how I can
make it so first of all what I will do
is I have to provide the path of this
file to convert into my database so what
I have done is I have taken attach
button and which when I click opens the
day file chooser
so the code of this attach button you
already know I have already
have teach that thing in the last video
and this attach button write or paste
the link in this text field so this code
I will not write because you know this
code and I will go ahead after this code
so in addition I have also taken a table
in which I will show my CSV data after
loading into the database and my CSV
table name is doc table and I have taken
a upload CSV button in order to upload
the CSV file and I have made the update
table function or or method for this
table so it will be updated
automatically this I all also I have
already told you in previous videos so I
did no need to tell you now what you
have to do in up to code table is write
this code so whenever your data is
loaded it instantly shows this data so
what I have made is I made this update
table
function and I have written this code
into the upload table function this also
you know the main thing and the main
meat of this tutorial is the upload CSV
button which I have already taken and I
will go to its event action and action
perform and this is empty right now so
in this I will write the code for
uploading my CSV so I think the time for
this tutorial is over
in the next tutorial I will show you how
you can upload the CSV file with the
help of this code so please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
