last video I have shown you how to
populate your combo box with the
database value so for example I open
this combo box and all the values from
the database is shown here so these are
the names from the database which I am
showing here in this video I will show
you how to show your database values
column values in the list box instead of
this column I will show you how to load
the same values in the list box so let's
see how we can do it so first of all
this is our window I will go to my
toolbox and I will search for this list
box drag and drop into my form okay
just resize it and then I will go to my
codes section of my window and in the
last video I have shown you this fill
combo method to fill the database value
from column name so all the values from
this name column mark and these all
lists was displaying in the combo box or
was populated in the combo box right so
I don't need to do much here
I will just copy this whole function all
the function so from void to the end of
the function and I will paste just below
the same method okay so what I have done
is I copied the function as I pasted all
the function just below that same fail
combo function and I just changed the
name of this function as fill
list box okay
so I change the name of this function
and which is less fill list box and then
all the code will remain the same so you
don't need to change much in the fill
combo function so if you don't know the
fill combo function code just go to the
last video I have explained all the code
there so just go there and just see the
code and copy all the code from there
and in that video we were populating
combo box so go to this while loop
inside this while loop
I was populating my names in my combo
box but this time I want to populate my
names in my list box so what I will do
is I will go to the design view I will
select my list box and I will copy the
name of my list box from here just copy
it go to the code section and instead of
this combo box we will paste list box so
we replace this combo box by the list
box so I have done just this to populate
my list box and all the code will remain
same so alright this box what item dot
add name so it will add all the names to
your list box one more thing we need to
do is we need to call this function what
at the start of the running of the
window so just copy this function from
here go to the top where your public
method is called and where this
initialize component function is there
last time we have called film combo so
it was filling combo box and
time we are calling this fill list box
so it will fill the list box from the
database so let's see if it works or not
run the code username and password and
it's correct okay opening the second
well form in it you see here it
populates all the names from the
database to the list box so let's check
if these names are correct so you can
see here all the names from my name
column comes here now suppose you want
instead of these names you want to show
the surnames in this list box okay so
how you can do that it's very simple
just see the column number of the
surname so this is column number zero
column number one and column number two
so the surname column number is two so I
want to populate this column number two
in my list box so go to your code we
need to change just one thing here in my
list box function I will change this get
value from here so in your while loop I
have declared a string called name I
change it as surname and in here I write
dot dr dot get value from my second
column so I write two here and I just
copy the string and paste it here now it
will populate the surname column in my
list box let us try and run the program
username and password is correct and now
the surnames are populated in the list
let us check whether it is correct or
not yes all the surnames comes here in a
same way you can show these age values
or these employee ID values in your list
box you can do one more cool thing with
this list box if you want to show names
and surname together what you can do is
just right now you are showing name just
above just copy this code and paste it
above and I want the name and surname
together so I write this and the name
column was one so I change the column
number and in here you what you can do
is you can write name plus and double
quotes I am providing called : you can
provide space or something else and then
surname so it will show name and surname
of the employee together and it will
populate in your list box let us see use
an even password correct and you see
mark and his surname
let's check so yes mark and Henry John
Vaughan see here Peter Parker here
Julie Bell here so basically I wanted to
show that you can show two columns side
by side also in the list box you can
show this age also and employer ID also
in the same manner so I hope you have
learned something new this time please
