last five videos I have been showing you
how to write your basic HTML web page
code and when you run your code it looks
like this but when you see the original
pages which you see on the website it
doesn't look like this because this is
very a simple text and we want to style
our website in a certain manner and
which is certainly not this so in from
this video I am starting the other part
of this tutorial which is called CSS or
cascading style sheets so what this CSS
will do is it will provide the style to
your web page the HTML provides the
basic building block of the web page and
CSS will provide the style to your web
page so for that I will just delete my
code and I will just make my code only
the bare body code
no title known so this is the basic body
of our HTML code which I have already
told you now in here I will just add a
heading and a paragraph for example so
like this I added h1 heading I have h2
heading and I have a paragraph ok and
now I want to style my headings and
paragraph and I also want to change the
background color of the web page so how
can I do this the styling you provide in
here
so go in the head tags between the head
tags and in here you will write smaller
than and greater than sign and write
style and when you start a tag you have
to close it so close this and inside
this whatever you will write will be
your style code or CSS code so now for
example first of all I want to change
the color of my web page so what is my
web page web page code is contained in
the body right so I will copy this body
tag or body and write it here okay same
this body and write it here and I will
give a space and I will provide this
curly braces and in here I need to
provide the property and the value so I
need to change what background color
back background color so this is the
property which I need to change and
after the colon I will give the value so
I want it to be yellow and after you
write your property and value you need
to close this with this semicolon okay
so this is the property which I want to
change and this is the value which I
want to give so I will just save my code
and I will see my code works or not so I
will just run it in the Firefox and yes
it works my webpage background color is
yellow now okay so what I have done is I
wanted to change the property of the
body so I have taken the name of the
body and I have provided the property
name and the property value okay so this
I have done now next if you want to
change this h1 tag what you will do in
the same wave you whatever you have done
with the body you know you will do with
this h1 gold so right here h1 and give a
space make a curly braces and provide
the property which whatever you want to
change okay so for this I want to change
color for example blue so property and
this value save it and then run it and
my color of my h1 heading changes to
blue now in the same way I can change
the properties of this h2 tag and
paragraph tag also right so I just need
to write the name of the tag so h2 or P
like this so I will just paste this code
because you understand I think the basic
concept so just write the name of the
tag and the property which you want to
change so for h2 I once again want to
color it it with blue h1 I want to
change the color or the text size to 36
PT and for the paragraph I want to give
the margin from the
left side so this is the left side and
this small space is called the margin so
I want to give the margin to this
paragraph 250 pixels so px is pixel okay
so you can write this code like this
this you can just make your code shorter
by just providing the semicolon and
after your semicolon provide this font
size also so after semicolon you can
provide the second property and value
after this semicolon once again you can
provide the other property also so this
you can delete now now when I save the
program and now I run it my header is of
36 point my this h2 header is blue right
and for this paragraph I have provided
the margin margin is the left side so
whatever you see here is the margins of
50 pixels I have provided the margin to
this style sheet now I want to align
this text at the center this is at the
left side left aligned I want to align
this text edge Center for example I want
to align this heading at the center so I
will go to the h1 tag which is for
heading 1 and after this semicolon I
will just add this text align text -
aligned and semicolon the value which is
center-right save it and run it and now
my h1 heading is at the center ok now
for example I can have many h1 tag for
example
this one two three three headings I have
four h1 so this style will be applied
for each of this h1 or every h1 in your
code so in a way it will be easier to
style your tags because it applies to
all the tags so you just need to write
it once here and it applies to all the
tangs and similarly if you can do for
the paragraph it applies for all
paragraph or and all headings so I just
save it and once again run and you see
the same heading at the center and three
all three tags have acquired the same
style in here also the paragraph have
acquired the same style we have provided
for first paragraph so it applies this
style to each and every paragraph okay
now I will talk about the classes
because sometimes you want this heading
to be different in color this heading to
be different in color so basically you
want everything differently style so I
will provide some more modularity to my
Styles by using the classes so what are
classes so instead of using these tags
we give a name to these tags for example
I have three edges on tags so I make
instead of this h1 tag I delete it and I
will write dot and the name of the class
for example center-aligned class this is
class name which is provided by me so
this can be anything Center one two
three or it can be anything so this is
user defined class okay now when you
copy this class and when you want to
apply this class to any one of this H
one not all all h1 tags but only one of
this h1 tank just go here in which you
want to change this or you want to apply
this class and just go there and make a
space inside this h1 tag and write class
is equal to now double quotes and in
inside this double quote write the name
of your class okay so class is equal to
double quotes and inside this the name
of your class now this class whatever
this style for this class will apply to
this h1 only and not these h1 okay so
let's see save and run so you can see
for the first h1 tag it applies and for
the others they stay same right now
go back to the notepad this class you
can apply to any of the tags so this
class can be applied to this paragraph
also because it's not specified that it
can be used only for these headings so
you can just copy this class and use
this in this prior paragraph also and
same thing will happen with this so
let's see what happens yes the center
tag is applied Center style is applied
to this also the paragraph
but for example you want to define this
class only for a particular tan for
example you just want to define this
class for h1 tag so what we will do is
copy this h1 tag and just before this
dot paste it so h1
dot last name and your style will remain
the same and when I will delete this and
when I apply this class to other
paragraph also it will not be applied so
let's see for this we have tried
so we tried for this second h1 tag and
save it and run the program and it will
apply for the second so first is this
second paragraph is this and third is
this right and now let's try to assign
this same class to the paragraph and
what happens save and run the program
nothing changes here paragraph is same
why because we have defined this class
only for the h1 tag right and not this
paragraph so even if you write here the
class name it will not be applied so in
this way you can define the class for
the particular tags also so I think I
will stop this video here only and in
the next video I will show you some more
HTML and CSS code so please stay tuned
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
