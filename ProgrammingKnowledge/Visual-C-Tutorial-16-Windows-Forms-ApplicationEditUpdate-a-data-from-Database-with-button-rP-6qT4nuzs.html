last video we have seen how to use list
box and link it with the large database
and how to use list box with
coordination with the database in this
video I will show you how to edit or
update your data with the help of your
windows form application so what I am
going to do is I will take a button and
I will name it as update button and when
I press this button and whatever I have
entered the data in these text boxes my
daughter related to that field will be
edited or updated in the database so we
will see how to do that first of all
take a button from your tool bar and
place it here and I will name it as go
to the properties and I will name this
is a text
so I will write text up date and
in the name area I mean name it as
Update button okay so this button I have
created to update my daughter now what
you need to do is just go to your save
and select your Save button yes you
heard it right
select your Save button and then double
click it and you will go to the code
which we have written in the video
number nine and ten in which I have
shown you how to save your data with the
help of a Save button so I will just
copy the whole code because I just need
one or two Corrections in this court not
Corrections but I will add it this code
and then using this code only I can
update my data in the database I just
need to change this query which I will
show you right now so I will copy this
once again I will go to my form and then
select this update button and double
click it and now you reach to the update
button click event or function in here
paste your code which you have copied
from the Save button code okay and now
you already know by that this time that
this is the connection with the database
MySQL and here with MySQL command this
is the query we pass in to the database
in order to interact with our MySQL
database so we are going to change this
query a little bit instead of instant
insert into database we will here write
update and delete this in to update your
database dot your table name which is
this this is my daughter base name and
this is my table name not the base dot
table okay so update database dot table
and just delete this Optimus we will
write value also delete
so here we will write first I will see
what is my column name I call him name
is eid name surname and age these four
still I am going to add it with the edit
button so update database naughty data
then right set E ID which is my first
column name in the database said E ID is
equal to this arrow point e ID text
arrow pointer text this comes from this
this text box name whose name is I will
show you added text so added text is
this added text so we are taking the
data from this text box and just passing
in this column variable okay and after
this comma so second column name is name
is equal to this arrow pointer our
textbox name which is this name textbox
and arrow pointer text
and then
the third column is surname so surname
is equal to this sir name text-box named
arrow pointer text and our fourth column
is gauge is equal to this age text field
arrow pointer text okay and we will
delete this and write where a ID is
equal to and once again just copy this
whole key ID is equal to this arrow
point a I D text and a pointer text and
paste it here where a ID is equal to
this
so it will update your data whatever you
will enter into your text fields I will
show this query once again update
database dot your table name then set a
ID which is your first column is equal
to single quote in between double quote
in between plus and in between that
write this then your textbox name then
this text write like this and then comma
your second column name which is name is
equal to this arrow pointer named text
and arrow pointer text surname same as
surname and same to it for the age where
this where clause comes because it tells
your database where to update your data
so whatever we will enter into this
field it will update your data in that
column so for example we will write
update my data where our employee ID is
1 then your not now whatever you enter
in the text field will be an edited for
the employer ID 1 okay so this we have
done and now in this message box we will
show instead of saved message we will
write up
dated so when our data is updated it
will show us the message that our data
is updated okay now let's try and run
the program if it's really running or
not run yes
once again I'm and username and password
and my new home opens this thing I have
shown you the last video whenever you
click any field in here the value
corresponding value will appear here so
for example you want to change employee
ID 3 data which is previously saved as
first name jenk
last name cell and his age is 40 so I
want to name him him as
Patrick
that did this famous Bell and his age is
45 now okay
and I mean click this update button and
it's showing me that you have an error
in axial syntax check the manual
corresponding yours okay let's see why
so I will check we're done mistake it's
here my ver spelling is wrong
I should write whe re and now I should
try and run my program so sorry for this
spelling mistake and now I run my code
to pass for username username password
okay and once again I want to change
this employee ID 3 as a trick
Bell and his age I want to change now as
50 okay Patrick Bell 50 remember this
code we have an additive employee number
three I will click this Update button
and you can see we can see the message
our data is updated click OK and just
check whether our data is really changed
or not
here you can see the old data for the
employee ID 3 but now we have changed so
we need to refresh our database from
this button refresh and now you can see
Patrick barrel and 50 so we have just
change in our code this update query and
this message and run our code and our
data is updated so that's how you can
update your database and I hope you have
learned something new this time please
