last video I have shown you how you can
connect and use Access database with
your visual basic windows from
application project and I have also
shown you how you can find your data
base with the starter grid view and how
you can generate these text boxes and
check boxes along with these tool
widgets right now in this video I am
going to show you how you can manually
add buttons for saving the data and add
the adding the data and removing your
data from the table so let's get started
I will go to my toolbox and in here I
will choose 3 buttons 1 2 3 and I will
change their name first button select
the button and change the text of this
button as add new second button text as
the save and third button text as delete
okay so now we have three buttons and
now what we can do is we can double
click these buttons and we'll write the
code but first of all you may have
noticed when you have connected your
form with your X is not a base by
dragging and dropping this data employee
dot or whatever database you have to
your form it will generate these tools
here which are data set whatever
database you have dot data set employee
data binding source employed at a table
adopter table adopter manager and
binding navigator ok so just remember
these name we are going to use these
names here and first of all we will
use this add a new button and we will
just double check this button and in
here we will write the code so we will
write in case of the whatever your data
base name is just write the name of your
database so my database name is employee
database and just search for whatever
binding source of that database so you
will be able to find in my case employee
data binding source whatever your
database name is but
and after that binding source you need
to search or you need to just look here
whatever is the binding source before
your database name okay so not a
employee data binding source dot add new
okay once again go to the Save button
and double check it and in here you need
to write first of all we will add a
try-catch block so just write sorry okay
so we will write try and press enter
it will give us destroy catch code and
what this try-catch does is if any error
occurs while you save your data if we
catch the exception and show you some
message whatever message you want to
show otherwise it will save the data so
in case of error condition it this try
catch code helps okay
now inside this try catch code what you
can do is you can write employee data
which is my employee data this name dot
data source for the search for the
binding source dot and add it okay and
then in the next line you need to write
once again
employed data and search for the table
adopter okay so employed at a table
adopter right dot update just right
update and in the brackets you need to
write the data set whatever you have in
my case my data set name is employee
info dot o-- set just write employee
info data set dot the database name so
my database name is employ data okay
just write this and in the case of
success you can even show the message so
you can write message dot show and you
can give some message here we gave you
some message like dot saved okay so this
should be the message box okay and now
we have message now in the case of
remove data or in the case of any error
what you can do is you can show the
error so just after this catch EPS
catch code and before this end the try
block to me just copy and paste this
message don't show message and you can
say
ever occurred while saving data okay and
now it's just once again go to my window
and I will select delete button and
double click it and in here once again I
will write employ binding source employ
data binding source dot remove current
okay so just remember you need to write
this and now when I run my code
hopefully I will be able to add new data
and save it and delete it also so let's
try to add the data I will click add new
it goes to the last line and I will add
a new data for example employ 14 some
name some surname date of birth I will
select from here for example and country
and phone number and pay 30 all over
however and then I will click the Save
button and you see data saved you will
see this message and click OK and this
14th employee is added to your list now
for example you want to delete this you
just select this and say delete and it's
deleted from your daughter right so from
this button you can add new data and you
can give you data here
and whenever you click save it will save
your turn
and whenever you want to delete it will
delete your data ok so in this way you
can add buttons to add data save data
and delete your data using your which
will basic windows form application I
