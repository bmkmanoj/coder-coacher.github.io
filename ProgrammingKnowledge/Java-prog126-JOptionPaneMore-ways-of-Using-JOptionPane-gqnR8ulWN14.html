last video we have seen how to use your
J option pain and show your custom
message in different line like this in
this video also I will show you
different ways of using your J options
pain so let's get started and explore
how we can use our J option pain in
different ways so I will once again go
to my Save button action perform and
this code I have written last time I
will not believe this port so when I
will save my data it will show this
message also this save message also and
the other message also so you can see
different ways to show J option being so
let's get started here you have to write
to your that I saved
so confirm dialogue and in here right
give bracket and right
component okay
and in here after this component right
and yeah keep in mind you don't have to
give comma after this component bracket
just after this component give null and
in here say the second part you will
write your message so for now I will
just give it any text here
and then in the next field you will
write your frame name name it as a lot
this is my name of my frame and then
comma
right
J Watson pain dot default action okay
and this
code will show a different message and
for simplicity and for the sake of
identification we copy this this default
option and paste it here instead of this
unidentified name so we know that this
is default option message so this is one
kind of a message I will copy the same
code just copy it and paste it few more
times
and in the second line of code I will
delete this default option and I will
see here and I randomly choose some
method
show you different a block G option
built so okay okay cancel option
error message
Pino stops
okay and so you can just explore your J
option pain and how to use it you can
see and I will run the program and I
will show you how this works so I will
save and I will save it will show my
message which I have shown last time so
we have forgot one thing
every time it will show default option
so this once again go to my food and I
will copy this variable name and paste
it here so I can differentiate my
message previously all my messages were
default option which is only for this
now I can identify any more easy way so
let's run the program once again
some employee some name and I will
receive this is my first message which I
have shown in the previous video okay
this is the default option message so
it's default option which looks like
this okay option looks like this in
which you have the option of choosing
yes or no if it's yes it goes your code
goes further
if you know you could and this kind of
code writing I have also shown in the
video number 24 yes or no option for
deleting I have shown you the code for
deleting so please see that we do and if
you want that code just take it from
there
this is OK or cancel option ok this is
error message yes this is close option
okay and this is my normal message so in
this way you can use different type of
the option pain according to your need
you don't have to stick only one the
option vein message type so I hope you
have learned something new this time
please wait coming to subscribe and bye
