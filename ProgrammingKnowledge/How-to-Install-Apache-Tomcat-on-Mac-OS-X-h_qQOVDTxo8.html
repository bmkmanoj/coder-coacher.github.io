you how you can download and install
Tomcat on your Mac operating system so
let's get started first of all open your
favorite browser and search for Tomcat
and the first result which will appear
here will be from Tomcat dot Apache dot
o-r-g so just click that link and here
you can see the landing page for the
Tomcats so now you can see on the left
hand side there are Tomcat versions
right and we are going to download and
install the latest version which is
termed at 9 at the time of making this
video right so under downloads just
click Tomcat 9 and then just scroll down
a little and here on the binary
distributions so on the binary
distributions you will be able to see
core here and then you will be able to
see some options for example yusup file
or tar or 32-bit of Windows the file or
64 bits windows zip file or other
installations right so what we need to
download is the first option which is
the zip file ok so just click on the
first option which is the zip file
option we're just going to download this
zip file on your Mac operating system so
once the zip file is downloaded you just
need to extract it so I will let it
download for some time and I will just
create our Tomcat folder on my desktop
and let's rename it to Tomcat so just
Tomcat so this is the directory in which
you are going to extract our downloaded
zip file ok so I'm going to just double
click on the zip file which I have
downloaded and I can see here this zip
file and then I'm going to just move it
to the Tomcat folder ok so let's move it
here to the Tomcat folder and now this
Apache Tomcat 9 point zero point zero M
22 is in my Tomcat folder on my desktop
ok
so once this folder is on your Tomcat
folder what I'm going to do next is I'm
going to open the terminal so just open
the terminal and just go to that Tomcat
folder so because it's in my desktop so
I will just CD to the desktop first of
all and then Tomcat ok and you can just
- LS here and you can see this Apache
Tomcat folder is there right so I'm
going to just CD inside that folder
Apache Tomcat folder and I will do LS
once again list all the files and you
can see these are all the files which
are inside this folder Apache Tomcat
folder right now I'm going to go one
level in inside a bin directory so there
is a bin directory here you can see this
bin directory so just CD to that
directory and we are in the bin
directory of this Apache so let's do LS
once again and we have all these files
there okay so lets me open this in the
finder also so this is my tomcat folder
and when I go inside this I have this
bin folder right inside this bin folder
I have some dot as such files right so
what I need to do is I need to make
these all SH files as executable files
right so right now let's check their
permissions so let me do for example LS
- al so let me do - al and then I will
just give a wild card bitches and
extract so Astrix dot H ok so just - LS
- LS tricks dot Sh
which is going to list all the dot SH
file inside this bin folder right and
right now as far as I can see there is
no executable permissions for the files
dot SH files these executable permission
you will be able to see at this level at
the last - level
okay so there is no executable
permission so we will change this
permission by changing the permission of
these files so how to change the
permissions you just need to give chmod
here and then plus X plus X is going to
make this file executable and what are
the files we want to make the executable
we want to make all that dot SH file so
just give Astrix dot txt
whatever files which end with dot sh
this chmod command is going to work on
those files okay so let me just press
ENTER and it's done okay so they are
made executable and we can check by LS -
al come on so once again give l s- l SJ
x dot i set and now you can see there is
an x flag added to these files earlier
you can see there was no X file X means
executables right so earlier there was
no executable flag associated with these
dot SS file but after our chmod command
this dot X flag is added to these files
so that means we can execute these dot
SH files right now for our purpose there
are two files which are important one is
this startup dot SH to start the Tomcat
and other is the shutdown dot SH to shut
down the to shut down the Tomcat server
ok so first of all I'm going to just
execute the startup dot message file so
you just need to just give this come on
dot forward slash so just give dot
forward slash and then startup dot SH
and this will execute this startup shell
script ok so press Enter and you can see
the last message here term
get started now how to check whether Tom
that is properly started or not I'm
going to go to my browser once again and
in here I will just write localhost so
just write localhost and then pull in so
just give this : and then port 8080 okay
support 8080 is the default port for the
Tomcat to start on so localhost colon
8080 okay and then press ENTER and once
you press ENTER hopefully you will be
able to see this kind of interface and
that means you're at Apache server is
running fine okay now to stop your
server you just need to run the stop
script so you just need to write dot
power slash and this time you just need
to run this shut down that Sh file so
just this time run shutdown dot SH and
press Enter
and once you run this and refresh this
page now nothing is shown here right
so our Apache Tomcat server is stopped
and you will not be able to see anything
here okay so once again we can restart
this server and we can refresh this page
and you will be able to see this once
again right let me minimize the browser
once again and there is one more option
to start your Tomcat so let me just stop
it really fast so I'm going to just run
shutdown dot Sh
and is going to stop it right now in
order to start Tomcat there is one more
option so let me just do LS here to list
out all the files and this time you can
see there is a file called Catalina dot
Sh
right we can use this script also so
just write dot forward slash and then
Catalina dot Sh and then give this
argument dot okay just give start here
and then press ENTER and you can see
once again its means
started now it's important to know here
is you need to have Java JDK installed
on your system in order to install
Tomcat it's no brainer I think you
already know that you need to have Java
installed on your system before
installing the Tomcat right now the last
thing I want to do here is I want to
open the this tomcat folder and I want
to rename it to Tomcat so I'm inside my
Tomcat folder and there is my Apache
Tomcat you can see here I want to rename
it to something easy for example Tomcat
itself capital T so tom cat and
generally we place this folder inside
our library folder ok and now we are
ready to move this folder to our
libraries folder right but before that
it's really important to stop your
Tomcat server which you have already run
ok so we have given this command and
that means our Tomcat server is already
running we can just refresh our this
localhost port 8080 and you can see it's
running so let's stop this first of all
I am going to just give the same command
Catalina and then stop and this is going
to stop this and let's double check this
that this is not running so you can see
it's not running so once this is not
running then only we can move this to
the other folder which is library folder
ok
so let's open the new terminal let me
open the new terminal and then I am
going to CD to the desktop so let's meet
CD to the desktop and then this Tomcat
folder in which my real Tomcat folder is
so this folder right so I navigated to
only to the Tomcat folder which is the
on the my desktop right and now I will
sudo MV so I will give administrative
privileges and then MV is for movie
and I want to move this Tomcat folder to
the library folder so /library
okay so this command will move this
Tomcat folder to the library folder
let's press ENTER and give the max
password here and once you open this
folder you can see there is no folder
inside my Tomcat folder on the desktop
because it's moved to the directory
called library right so just Alice to
the library or just CD to the library
from this terminal so I'm going to just
give CD four slash library and then LS
and I can see this Tomcat folder is
there right so we can go to the tomcat
folder inside the Tomcat by using CD
Tomcat and we can start this Catalina
dot Sh from the bin folder so I will
just go to the Tomcat bin folder so just
CD Tomcat /bin and then press ENTER and
to LS and you can see this Catalina dot
Sh is there so once again forward slash
dot /a tina dot Sh press ENTER and I can
see that this Tomcat is not started
because I haven't given the start
command with this right so I need to
give a start command here so dot forward
slash Catalina dot Sh start right and
then it's going to be started right so
earlier I forgot to give the start
argument with this Catalina dot Sh that
that's why it's not started and now when
I give have given this command now it
started so let's recheck it and now it's
running ok so in this way you can
download and install Tomcat on your Mac
operating system I hope you enjoyed this
