show you how you can install language
packs on your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
operating system so suppose you have
your windows in your regional language
and you want to change your display
language of your windows 8 or 8.1 to
english or some of the preferred
language of yours how you can do it I am
going to show you in this video so for
example I right-click this toolbar and
my display language for this desktop is
in English and I want to change this to
some regional languages for example
German in my case I want to change this
English display language to a German
display language so how can I do it
let's see I am going to show you now so
what you need to do is you just need to
go to the right and corner here and it
will open the search box so just go to
right hand corner and just like the
search and in here just type language
but first select settings from here so
we are going to search in settings and
we are going to search in this settings
section we are going to search for
language so just type language here and
it will search for the language options
so depending upon the speed of your
computer it can take few second one two
or three seconds to show all the results
and the result we are looking for is
language so language or add a language
both are same in my case I can see add
our language if you see language also
this is also a valid option so just look
for language or add a language option
okay and just click this option
and in here you will be able to see the
language packs on your system the in my
system English is the primary language
which is a display language and I want
to add a new language to my system and I
want to make it as a primary language so
what I need to do is is I need to click
this add a language button and in here I
can see different languages so just
choose your preferred languages or if
you do not find it here just you can
search it in the search box
for example German in my case and I can
find this German here so just select
this and click open
and in here different kind of German
languages are there so just select I
will select the language which I want to
install from these languages so I can
just select any language from here
language pack and then I will click Add
so click this and click Add
so when I click Add it will be added to
my language window okay so I have
already done that so I can already see
this language back here but still you
need to install this language BAM
you just have selected right Mouse
language back but no installation is
done for activating this language pack
okay so what you need to do go to
options here and you will be able to see
this download and install language pack
from here you just need to click this
option from here and then you just need
to let the process complete okay so this
will take you know few seconds to few
minutes depending upon the speed of your
internet because it downloads and
install a language pack from Internet so
it can take some time or it will be fast
if your internet speed is faster once
this installation is complete I will
just wait for the installation to
complete so once this installation will
complete I am going to show you what to
do next so now the installation is
complete here I can just close this
window you can see installation is
complete close this window now in order
to make this language as your primary
language what you need to do is you just
select this language so select this
language and you need to click this move
up button once you click this move up
button this language German in my case
will be your primary language because
it's the first language your operating
system will look for when it starts
right so just move your preferred
language up at the very top and then
what you need to do is you need to
restart your system right so still we
can check that our system
or display languages English still even
if we have already chosen the option of
our preferred language right so what you
need to do is you need to restart your
system in order to see the changes of
your preferred language right so just go
to this option here and restart your
system so I will just click this option
and I will restart
my system you can see right now just
make sure that your preferred language
is at the top point so I am going to
restart my system
you
and once your system will be restarted
it will show your preferred language as
a display language right so Maira system
has been restarted now and I can see
here just on the front screen the
language is changed you can see fun it's
Saturday but it's showing Sontag which
is German language so I can say that
this display language has been changed
to German but let's see in here whether
this display language is changed yes
it's change here when I click the right
click my toolbar or the options are in
German or I can go to the Start menu and
check the options all options will be in
my preferred language which is German
right or I can go to once again to the
desktop and I can right-click the start
button here and all the options are in
German right now okay so in this way you
can change your preferred language or
display language on your Windows 8 or
8.1 operating system very easily and
it's for free</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
