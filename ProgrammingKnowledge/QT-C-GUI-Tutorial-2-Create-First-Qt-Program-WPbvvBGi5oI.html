on C++ GUI using cute framework in the
last video I have shown you how you can
find cute framework and how you can
install it on your PC in this video I
will show you how you can create an new
program for your GUI application and how
you can run your first program so let's
create the program first you can create
a program by going to this file and go
to new project it will open a project
wizard and what you need to do is you
can go to this application and you need
to choose this cute GUI application
there are lots of different other
project you can make you can even make
non Qt project for example clean c plus
plus projects plain c++ project using c
make build this is also a really good
program and you can all also make c++
libraries and other plugins also but
what we are interested in is this
application and this cute GUI
application so click application and
cute GUI application and go here and
click Choose and it will ask for the
name so I will name my application as
cute app and select your location where
you want to locate your project and
click Next
and now it has created the project and
this next window contains the
information of the project so when you
make a new project it will create a
class you can change the name of this
class I leave it as default so it will
create a class called main window it
creates a header and the CPP file for
the UI and it creates the form file
which is named window dot UI this is the
user interface file so it creates this
class header file CPP file and this user
interface file and just click Next and
you just click finish and once you are
done creating your project it will open
this project so it looks like this it
has created our cute app project and in
the header file it has main dot main
window dot H and the source file it has
main dot CPP and main window dot CPP and
it also contains this main window UI
which is a UI designer or user interface
designer when you double-click it you
will be able to see this user interface
designer so here on the left hand side
you can see design and add it when you
click this design you will be able to
see this design view and when you click
this edit you will be able to see this
edit view so what this UI is it's just
XML files and nothing else and let's let
me show you what this main contains so
is a C++ program obviously and it just
has this cute application and it goes to
the main and it starts this main window
which is our main window and make the
object and it just shows this main
window and if you can see this main
window dot edge it creates a namespace
called UI and this UI we are going to
use in our code when we write the code
similarly it has this main window dot
CPP where we are going to write our code
also and it has a constructor and a deed
constructor so when you start your UI it
starts this UI setup UI and when you
close your program it deletes your UI or
it calls this object or function so
let's create a simple application
first I go to this design view so I'm
click this and in here I will take a
push button and I will take a label for
example
so I search for the label here it is
display widget drag and drop into your
form so I have this push button and I
have this label I can make it bigger and
here I have the properties of this okay
so for example I choose this push button
and I want to change its caption or its
name so I can change it from here if I
want to change the object name I can
change it from here and if I want to
change its caption or the display text I
can change it from here so for example I
want to change its text I want to change
just text to okay and I click enter and
you can see here okay is this playing
instead of push button so you can first
clear with these properties and you can
change the properties from here also and
now what we can do is we want to perform
some action while we click this button
so just right click it and click go to
slot and here you can find in which slot
you want to go
it has pressed released click or and
other actions I will choose the basic
action called clicked and I will click
OK and we go to this main window dot cpp
and it has created a new function called
on button push button clicked so when we
click this push button what we want to
do is we want to set some text in our
label so what we will write is UI and
give this arrow and we want to set the
label text so I write UI arrow pointer
label once again pointer set text and
here I can write the text ok so I write
some text here
for example hi YouTube and that's it
when I click this button it should show
me hi YouTube
so for compiling or building this
program you can go to build build all or
you can just right-click your project
and say build and if you click this Run
button it will build your program first
and then run your program so I will just
click this one it will build and run my
program it opens this Save Changes I
want to save yes save all it builds my
program you can see it here and once
it's built it will open my user
interface hopefully yes it has opened
this user interface called main window
and when I click this it says the text
on my label as hi YouTube so this was
the first basic application on cute
using C++ in the further coming videos I
will show you some more functionality
using C++ on cute framework so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
