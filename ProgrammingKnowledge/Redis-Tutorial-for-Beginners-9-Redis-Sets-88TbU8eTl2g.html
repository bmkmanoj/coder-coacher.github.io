register tool for beginners and in this
video we will learn what are sets and
how to use sets in red is so first of
all what are sets so ready sets are an
unordered collection of unique strings
right so by unique I mean whatever
values set contains they are all unique
so no repetition is allowed here okay
and they are unordered you know lists so
they are not ordered and they are unique
so let's see how we can use sets in
practice so I have already started my
already server and on my CLI first of
all let me just clear all the keys which
I already have so I will just say keys
and I have only one key which I'm going
to flush all and now let's create a set
okay so to create a set you can just use
s for set and then add okay so s add and
then give any a name any name to a key
so for example my set is a key here and
then you can add members here one or
many okay so for example I want to have
a set of numbers so let me say this is
my first set so I will name it set one
my set one and let's say I add here one
two three four for example okay and I
just press ENTER which is going to
create a set and add these four numbers
now here I have provided four different
numbers right so they are all unique and
to view the members of a set you just do
F members okay so F members and the key
name my key name is my set 1 and you can
view all the members of the set right
now for example in this set
want to add one more value so I just say
s ad and then my set 1 and I want to add
3 here right and I already know that
here I already have 3 in my set and I
want to you know add one more 3 to the
set which is not allowed right so it's
going to give me 0 in return that means
this 3 is not added to the set because 3
is already there okay
we can just prove this by using s
members and then the set name so you can
see set is not changed the values in the
set remain same because they must be
unique okay
on the other hand when I do as set 1 5
which is a new member in the set I can
just verify this so you can see this
time it's added and you can verify it
with this value as you get one here that
means the number is added to the set and
if you get 0 here that means number is
not added to the set right now for
example if I want to know how many
values are there in the set so how many
members are there in the set so I can
just do s card and then the name of the
set my set 1 ok my set 1 and I can see
there are 5 members in the set
ok now let me create one more set
so I have my set 1 let me clear the
terminal first and now I will create a
set too so set add or s add my side to
here ok and let me add some more numbers
here this time I will add for example 5
8 7 6 4 and 9 in this set ok and then
press enter and I can view this set by s
numbers here and the key name have said
to and you can see these are the member
of second
inside right now if you have multiple
sets you can subtract one set from other
using s diff okay so you can use as diff
and this estes command returns and
members of the set resulting from the
difference between the first set and all
other successive sets so this is the
difference so i will just add my set one
as my first set and then i will just
give the second set as my set to ok and
then press enter and it's going to give
me the difference between these two set
let me show you the values of the set 1
also so we can verify so you can see in
the set 1 we have value 1 2 5 and then
in the set - we have values 4 5 6 7 8 9
so from s diff it is going to give you
the values which are there in the set 1
but they are not there in the set - okay
so these values these three values are
not there in the set - right but 4 &amp;amp; 5
are there in the set - so they are
discarded so f diff is going to give you
the difference that means whatever
values are there in set 1 and not there
in set 2 now if you want to know the S
diff and save it into the third set for
example then you can do that also so you
can just write F diff and then store and
then the destination so I am going to
save the difference in the new sets of
for example my set 3 right and then the
difference between these two sets so my
set 1 and my set - so these 3 values
will be saved in the new set which is my
set 3 ok press Enter
and then you can see PI s members my set
3 you can see all these values are saved
set three which is the difference
between my set one and my set to now you
can do the union also union of the Fed
so for example I want to do Union I can
just write F Union and the set name so
my set 1 and my set - okay so I wanted
to do the union of set 1 and set 2 and
then press ENTER and it's going to give
you these values so Union means whatever
values which are there in the first set
also and second set also the combination
of that unique value right so all the
unique value which are there in the
first set and second set so T's value
were in the first set and these value
which are unique in the second set so
this is the combination of s Union okay
and same you can do for storing so you
can just write X Union store here so
just write SQL store and I am going to
store it in set for for example so my
set for the union of side 1 and set to
right press ENTER and Union is saved I
can do as member by set for and you can
see now it has one two nine which is the
union of set one and set to okay so in
order to store use s Union store now if
I want to remove some members from a set
I can do F RAM for removing a value from
a set or member from a set and for
example I want to remove some number
from set for and I want to remove for
example nine okay and then press Enter
is going to remove nine from the set for
and I can do s members one that once
again and you can see nine is not there
anymore
okay you can remove multiple values for
example 8 7 6 and so on
and these will be removed so now I have
only up to five values because 876 are
removed now for example I want to remove
a random value from the set so I don't
want to remove a specific value but I
want to remove was random value so for
example I can do s pop here to remove a
random value from a set so my set for
for example and for example I want to
remove only one value from here right so
I can just press ENTER it says three so
it has removed three from this set okay
so let's do s member s 4 and you can see
3 is no more there in the set for okay
so it has picked a random value from
this set and removed it okay I can give
for example s pop my set for I have for
example I want to remove two random
values so I can just do that and now it
has removed four and one from the set
and now my set is only of two values or
two members two and five okay so as pop
is to remove the random value from the
set now let me clear this terminal and
let me just print the values of set one
and set to once again so set one has one
two five and said to have four to nine
now there is a command called as inter
and F inter command gets the element of
a set after the intersection of all the
specified set okay so it's going to give
you the intersection of all the
specified set so just two F inter for
example my set 1 and my set 2 and then
press enter and it's going to give you
the intersection intersection means
these values are there in both the sets
so these are the intersection of both
the sets so 4 &amp;amp; 5 are
they're in set 1 and set 2 so it is
going to give you those value only and
as we have seen in the case of as deaf
and as union you can do for example as
inter store so you can store the
intersection into a new set so as inter
store and for example I want to save
this in set 5 and then press ENTER and
then I can just see the content of set 5
which is 4 and 5 which is correct or the
last command I want to show here is s
Move command so f move and this command
is used to you know transfer or move
value or member from one set to the
another set right so for example I want
to move one from my set 1 to my set - ok
so I want to move this value to the set
- so what I can do so first of all the
source source is my set 1 and I want to
move it to the destination which is my
set - and I want to transfer the value 1
number 1 right so press Enter it says 1
that means the operation is successful
so let me see the s member or members of
set - and now you can see one is moved
to the set - earlier one was not there
in the set - but now we have one in the
set - and let's see the contents of set
one also so you can see one is no longer
there in set one because it's moved from
set one to set two so these are some of
the most frequently used command in
Redis sets I hope you enjoyed this video
