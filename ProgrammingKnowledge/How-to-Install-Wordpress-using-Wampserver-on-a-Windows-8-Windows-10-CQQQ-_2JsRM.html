show you how we can download and install
wordpress locally on your Windows
operating system alongside ramp server
so let's get started and first of all we
are going to download a web server on
our Windows operating system so let's
get started just open your favorite
browser and search for a vamp and the
first link which you will see here will
be from web server comm so just click
this link and it's going to open this
vamp server comm website now first of
all what is vamp server web server is a
Windows web development environment and
it allows you to create web applications
with Apache to PHP and MySQL database
okay and it's going to give you this PHP
my admin which will allow you to create
your MySQL database so now how you can
download web server so you just need to
go to download here and in here you will
see two versions of M server one is web
server 32-bit other is web server 64-bit
now to check which flavor of Windows
operating system you have you need to
just search for system here so just
search for system and then open this
system from here ok
so just open this system here and now
you will see here your system type and
my system type right now is 64-bit ok so
that's why I'm going to download the
64-bit version but if you have 32-bit
you will download this version ok so I
will just click this here and now it
says this warning ok so there are some
warning which you are going to see first
is don't use previous or web server
add-on or extension which we don't have
other is you need to have Microsoft
Visual Studio C++ extension or
redistributable so right now I don't
have this thing so I am going to
download this okay
so just click this link Microsoft comm
slash download and it's going to
redirect you to this page okay so in
here you can see this visual c++
redistributable for Visual Studio 2012
so you just need to choose your language
and download it and then I have a 64-bit
operating system so I'm going to
download this first option which is x64
and then I'm going to click Next
and then you can see it's downloaded
right so after this is downloaded you
just need to click this executable file
and click I agree and then click install
and click yes and it's going to download
and install microsoft visual c++
redistributable okay so once this is
done then once again you need to go to
this website and then once again follow
the procedure which I have shown you go
to download and once you see once again
this message you can just click download
directly and now you're going to
download this web server executable file
okay
so I will give some time to download it
and now you can see the web server
executable file is downloaded so I am
going to click this executable file here
and I'm going to minimize my browser and
just click yes first of all and now the
installation of web server will start ok
so just click Next here and then I
accept the agreement click Next and this
is the location where web server will be
installed so if you want to change it
you can change it but I am going to
leave it as default and click Next
and then you can choose if you want to
create the quick launch icon and desktop
icon so I'm going to check both not no
harm in it
so click Next and then click install
and in here you will see it's going to
give you this message please
choose your default browser and if you
are not sure just click open okay so in
here you can choose your default browser
if you have some browser preferences for
example if you have Chrome or other
browsers like Firefox or anything then
you can choose your browser from here so
for example I'm going to go to my
Program Files x86 and in here I'm going
to choose Google from here and go to
Chrome application and in here I'm going
to choose a chrome here ok and click
open and it's going to give you this
warning you just need to allow access
and then you can see this PHP mail a
parameter I am going to leave everything
as default for now and click Next and I
will click finish and please make sure
that this checkbox is checked ok and
then click finish and click yes and now
you can see here the icon which is a
vamp server icon and if you see this
green web server icon then everything is
running ok so you can open it and you
can see everything here localhost my
project PHP myadmin
your WWWE and server and MySQL here ok
now next step is to open the MySQL
database using PHP myadmin
which is already installed using ramp
server so just click this green ramp
server icon here and in here you will be
able to see PHP myadmin just click this
and it's going to open this PHP my admin
interface on your default browser which
you have selected and once this PHP
myadmin
is open we are going to create a new
database so to create a new database you
just need to click here new and it's
going to give you this kind of an
interface you just need to give the name
of the interface for example my DB or
WordPress DB or anything I'm going to
give the name for example my DB ok you
can give any name as you want right and
then in here you can see in the
drop-down menu many options but we want
to just leave it as default as
collection and then just click create
and now you can see this my DB is
created on the left hand side right and
one more thing when you go to the users
tab so just click this users tab in here
the user name is root and the default
password is none ok so there is no
default password right now right so just
keep in mind we are going to need this
username and password when we are
installing the WordPress ok so once this
is done then we have ready to download
and install WordPress on our Windows
operating system so once again open your
favorite browser and search for download
word press and press ENTER and the first
link which will appear here will be from
WordPress Watchi slash download and when
you click this link you will be able to
see this kind of interface on the right
hand side you will be able to see the
download button which you can click and
it's going to you know download this
WordPress in the form of zip file so
just save it at your desired location
once this is done you can just open this
zip file and you can see this so
WordPress
right WordPress folder and inside the
WordPress folder you will be able to see
so many files so what we want to do here
is we want to copy this wordpress folder
from here so you can just copy this
wordpress folder and once again go to
this ramp server icon which is this
green icon and in here just go to this
option which says dub dub dub directory
or WWWE
and click it it's going to open your WWE
directory here right inside your vamp
folder in your C directory okay so we
need to paste this WordPress directory
which we have copied from the zip file
to this www folder so right click and
paste it and it's going to paste this
WordPress copy here and once this
WordPress folder is copied in your www
folder inside your web server folder
then we are ready to install wordpress
locally using web server so let's see
what's inside this folder and you can
see so many files which we are going to
use later but for now what we need to do
is we need to go to our browser and then
you can just write localhost
which is going to open your local host
using ramp server and then when you give
here forward slash and then when you
give WordPress folders so just right
word press and press enter and this is
going to open your a setup
config file for the WordPress so this is
the first page which you will see when
you open this localhost form a slash
WordPress by the way you can change the
name of this WordPress directory
according to your website name for
example
your website name is easy online
converter you can just change the name
of this directory and then you can just
write localhost and the name of the
directory which you have given and this
will also give you the same result okay
just choose your language and then click
continue and in here you can see welcome
to WordPress before getting started we
need some information on database you
will need to know the following item
before proceeding right so we need to
know database name database username
password database host and then table
prefix so just click let's go here and
in here you need to give the name of
your database so our database name which
we have given is my underscore DB so
give the same name here as a database
name just write my underscore DB or
whatever name you have given and then
username is root which I have already
shown you which is this one and password
is nothing so we will leave it as blank
ok so just write root and the password
just leave it as blank ok and then the
database host is localhost so leave it
as default and table prefix leave it as
default also and then click Submit and
then you will see all right we just need
to click this button to run the install
for WordPress so just click this button
and in here on the next page you need to
give the name of your website for
example the name of the website you want
to create and the user name which can be
given by you and the password ok so the
website name I want to give is easy
online
converter and the username anything you
can give for example I will give
username as programming knowledge 101
and now give the password here for
example give the password which you can
remember and which is strong enough so
that nobody can guess it
ok so let's give any password here and
after giving the password you just need
to give your email address and after
giving the email address you just need
to click this checkbox and then press
install and then you will be able to see
this success message and this means
WordPress is successfully installed on
your Windows operating system so you can
log in so just press this login button
here and then in here once again give
your username and password which you
have chosen right so we have chosen in
my case I have chosen this is the

the username is programming knowledge
101 and the password I will give
whatever I have given and then if you
want you can check this option remember

this kind of a dashboard interface then
