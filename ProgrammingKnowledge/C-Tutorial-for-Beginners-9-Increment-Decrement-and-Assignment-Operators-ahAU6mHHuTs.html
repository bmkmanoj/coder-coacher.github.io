video I am going to explain you
something about increment operator and
assignment operator so let's get started
first of all I will explain you how
assignment operation works so let's take
an example I will declare an integer X
is equal to 25 and I'm going to print it
very simple stuff thanks okay now for
example I want to add to this value at
some more value to this value I have
shown you that you can do it like this X
is equal to X plus 5 for example and
what it will do is it will take the
value of x and add 5 to it and place it
into X once again right so let's filled
it and run it and it will show us 30 but
the more efficient way to do this is
because you are using X two times you
can just reduce this by writing it
something like this okay so X plus is
equal to 5 it will just serve the same
purpose as before it will add 5 to our
variable which is X and then save it
into the same variable once again I will
run the program and answer is same and
you can do this assignment operation
with multiplication subtraction division
or you can take a modular so I will show
you one by one
first of all - so what it will do is
he'll take X and subtract 5 from it and
we'll show the result we'll save the
result in this X and we'll show the
result here right so run the program
until it shows 20
same is with product or multiplication
you just give s6 it will multiply
applied 25 by 5 just run the program and
you see 125 and you can do it fit the
division also but remember it doesn't
show the remainder only the
multiplication value or multiple value
right so in this case it will show 5
because we don't have any remainder but
if you divide 25 by 4 it will still
let's see what it gives us 6 and it
doesn't show us the remainder in order
to show the remainder you need to give
this module sign and then it will just
show you the remainder which is 1 right
so it shows the remainder 1 now this is
about assignment operation now I have
also told you about increment operation
in the for loop tutorial so for example
you want to increment 1 or add one to
the variable X then you can do it like
this X plus plus and what you will do it
will add one to our variable X and print
it here right now let me show you a
phenomena for how you can use this in
two different ways
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to copy this and paste it here
once again and what I am going to do is
I will
increment X by off one here just delete
this and then I will show the value of X
right and both on printing let's see
what happens and you see what's
happening here is it's even though we
are increasing the value of x by one but
it's showing 25 first and then 26 so
this phenomena is happening because we
are adding this plus plus
after our X okay so what will happen is
it will your C++ port will print the
value of X first and then add one to it
and then when you print X to the second
time that will show the ID addition
values of 26 it will show here but for
example you want to add 1 or add this
one before showing the value or what you
need to do is you just need to add this
plus plus before this X now it will what
it will do is it will add 1 to X first
and then print this value and this will
be the same so let's see what happens
now just close our program and build it
run it and you can see now this is 26 26
so it takes the value of X increment it
and then prints it so this is the
difference between this prefix of plus
plus and trailing plus plus right so
just remember if you want to increment
the value first add these pluses in the
front and if you want to increment the
value after showing the value then you
just add it after plus plus same rule
will
be true for - so when you do this XX my
ex - - here and when you run the program
it will still show you the value 20-5
because the subtraction is not happened
here but it it's happened after the
execution of this so in the next line
then you can see 24 in the next line and
when you add this - - in front then your
value is subtracted first so one is
subtracted from the X and then it prints
24 and then 24 so this is all about or
the basics about assignment operator and
increment operator I hope you understood
the concept please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
