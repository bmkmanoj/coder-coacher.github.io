tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in this video we will see what
are access modifiers and how we can use
access modifiers in Java so you may have
seen the use of public whenever I define
some class or some method in a class and
this public or private or this can be
protected these are called access
modifier and what access modifier mean
is it basically allow you to you know
access this method or whatever class in
a package depending upon the keyword or
excess modifier we can access it inside
the class or inside our package or
inside whatever inside of a project so
how we can grant the axis and what
keyword means what we will see now okay
so basically we have three kinds of
access modifier one is called public
other is called protected and third one
is called private and if you do not give
any access modifier for example I
haven't given any access modifier to
this string name and integer age this
will be visible or we can use these
variable inside the package and inside
the class so because my class which is
this one and student class are in the
same package I can use these inside here
so let me delete these we do not need
them anymore
so my class and student class are in the
same package see here in lesson 1 we
have my class and student class right
so if
you provide no access modifier public
private or protected they are visible in
the class itself and the package so
packaged inside the package we have this
class also so we can define a an
instance of the class for example
student s tu is equal to new student
right new student okay
and whenever we want to access this s tu
dot and this name is available name and
a both are available in this class also
right because my class which is this
class and this class student class are
in the same package okay so basically
this is what we are doing here or we
mean here okay and name should be some
string so something like this right and
when we compile the program we will not
get any error right so whenever we give
public access modifier before any
variables for example I give public
before my name and the age variable its
visible everywhere in your class in your
package in your sub class sub classes we
will see when we see how inheritance
work in Java and basically if you define
a variable as public its visible as
everywhere right but it's a good
practice to you know not give or not
give access to your variables to you
know outside your package or even
outside your class okay so the good
practice is always declare your member
variable as private or protected
and the basic logic behind this is you
don't want that your variable should be
affected by any other user okay so you
give in direct access to your variable
using getter and setter functions okay
so whenever you add this private access
modifier before your your variable name
it's only accessible through your class
itself so outside your class outside the
student class you cannot access if this
member variable is private right so now
whenever I try to run the program I will
get an error and the error will be I
will go to the error and it says the
field student name is not visible it's
not visible because we have declared
this name as a private member of the
class and whenever we declare private
member of a class it only is very
visible inside the class and not in the
package not in the subclass not anywhere
else okay so there is other keyword
called protected which we will see when
we learn about inheritance and other
things but protected also restricts the
visibility of your variable in the class
itself package and subclass okay so
right now we are not going to discuss
more about protected because this
protected we will use whenever we are
going to learn inheritance and
polymorphism right so right now just
remember this table or memorize this
table whenever you declare your variable
as public it's visible everywhere in
your class package subclass or anywhere
else if you declare your variable as
private its own
visible in your class and nowhere else
okay and means no here and why means yes
here okay and it's a good practice to
make your variable private so that
anybody else should not have the direct
access to your variable and now so we
cannot access this name directly from
here
so how we can allow the user to you know
set the name of the student
it's easy by using setter and getter
function so go inside your class just
click anywhere inside your class and
then go to source and click generate
getter and setter ok generate getter and
setter and Java will automatically
generate getter and setter for you
whatever you check you know if you want
to get a want getter and setter for name
if you want getter and setter for age
you can check both of these so I select
all like this I can deselect all and for
now I am selecting all and click OK and
it's created four methods for me one
first one is get name which just returns
the value of name so indirectly we are
accessing the value of name but not
directly right and set name allows you
to set the name but not directly but
using the copy use right and in the same
way we have define the getter and setter
for the Aged and by the way if you are
wondering what is this keyboard mean
here so whenever you see this name and
this name is similar and whenever you
define any variable inside a function
for example this name this name will be
preferred so whenever you
want to do something like this Java may
get confused this name is this name
itself or this name which you define in
the class this keyword this keywords
tells Java that it's a member of the
class which is this one so this
indicates class itself so this means
whatever class we are in okay so student
dot name which is this variable not this
variable right so basically you need to
use or you can use this of a keyword
here whenever you have two variable with
the same name and you want to
differentiate between them this dot
whatever is the member of the class
which is this one and the variable which
does not have this is the local
variables like so this the name here is
the local variable this one and this
name which is preceded by this is the
member variable this one so this is what
this means this means that loss itself
student dot name indirectly you can say
instead of this you can just imagine it
like student dot name okay but this word
indicates the class itself and now if
you want to set the name what you can do
is instead of directly setting the name
you can just write two dot set name and
then you can set name like this okay and
whenever you want to get the name you
can just do something like this instance
of a class dot get
name okay so this will allow you the
access to this variable name but
indirectly okay so just remember this
table if you can memorize public grants
you access to everywhere private grants
you access only in the class itself and
it's always the better practice to make
your variables private unless and until
you have the strong reason to make them
you know public and used getter and
setter to access these number variables
okay and the meaning of this is the
class itself so if you add this keyword
before any variable it means the member
of the class and whenever you do not
have this here then it means it's a
local variable so you can avoid conflict
between two similar variable names okay
so I hope you have understood the basic
concept of access modifier and this
keyword and I hope you have enjoyed this
