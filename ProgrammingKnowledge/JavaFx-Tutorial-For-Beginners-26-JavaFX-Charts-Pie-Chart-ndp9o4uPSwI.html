Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use pie charts
in Java FX so let's get started
I have created the sample project which
is called pie chart and in my
application package I have this main dot
Java class in which I am calling this
main dot F XML file which I have created
here which is right now blank and I also
have this main controller dot Java class
okay
so let's add some code first and then we
are going to add our pie chart to the
effects ml file so go to your main
controller dot Java class and in here
first of all we are going to add this
pie chart variable so just right at the
rate FX ml then pie chart and then give
the name to your pie chart for example
pie chart and then what we are going to
do is we are going to create a method
which is going to be a public void
method so it's going to be void and the
name of the method I'm going to name it
as BT and 1 for example ok or BTN right
and as an argument I am going to give
the action event class variable and just
declare this event and inside this
method what we are going to do is we are
going to create an observable list ok so
just create an observable list and this
list takes this template argument so the
template out argument here will be pie
chart data ok so just write data is
going to give you this error so just
click this bulb here and you can see it
has this Java effects scene chart dot
pie chart so just add this import here
and it's going to
disappear your error and then give the
name to your observable list then
effects collection dot observable are a
list and then as in constructor argument
what you can do is you can add the spice
chart you know data so how you can add
pie chart data you can just write new
pie chart dot data and this takes two
argument first is the section of the pie
chart so for example the name of the
section right so for example we want to
make the pie chart for a popular
programming languages right so for
example first language is Java and the
value of it is 50 for example and then
we will give the comma and same we will
copy maybe 4 times more and the second
language will be c++ third language will
be pi
Thun fourth will be C sharp and fifth
will be C for example okay and I will
give some values to these languages 20
30 40 and for example this has 15 okay
and remove this comma from here so now
we have this observable list so we just
need to take our pie chart and then we
will just say set data and then set this
list variable here okay so this is our
code and now let's add it our F XML file
to perform this code so right click on
your main dot F XML file and open it in
scene builder and in here first of all I
will go to the layout and select the
anchor pin and I'm going to change the
width and height of this anchor pin to
500 by 500 and then I will go to the
chart category here and I'm going to
drag and drop this chart control here
okay and what I'm going to do next is
I'm going to take a button from controls
and drag and drop here okay and the text
of this button I'm going to change it as
load chart and the ID of this pie chart
will be the same as we have given in the
main controller okay
select your pie chart and go to code and
give the FX ID here and save your code
and then we will connect our controller
with the main dot affectional file so go
to controller and then go to application
dot main controller and then what we are
going to do is we are going to select
our button and then we will go to on
action method here and select our method
which we have created which is this one
right save the code and refresh your
project
and then run your project so right click
run as java application and now our app
is running so when I click this load
chart button it's going to load this pie
chart something like this okay and you
can see it's showing these names Python
C++ C sharp C and Java and the section
according to their values right so the
most significant value here is for Java
which is 50 so it's taking the most of
the pie chart and the least is I think
c-sharp which is taking the least
section of the pie okay now there are
some properties of pie chart which you
can change to you know change the look
and feel of the pie chart so I'm going
to close my app and I'm going to open my
main dot F XML file in scene builder and
I'm going to select my pie chart and the
go to the properties here so the first
property you can see here is the title
so you can just give any title to your
pie chart for example pie chart and
going it's going to show it here
okay now this title you can show on the
top or the bottom or left or right using
this property called a title side okay
so when you select bottom it's going to
show the title at the bottom or if you
choose a left it's going to show the
title on the left or the right right so
I'm going to choose this top now here is
the property called animated if you
check this then your pie chart will be
animated when it's created or otherwise
if you uncheck this then this animation
will no longer be visible okay now
legend what is a legend first of all so
when you run your app once again and
this is the lag legend so here you can
see this color and the name of your
language color and the name of your
language so this is your legend and you
can also change the property of the
legend first of all if you want to you
know show the legend then keep this
checkbox checked otherwise just uncheck
this and then save your code and refresh
your project and run it once again and
click your button and now you can see
there is no legend
okay so using this selection checkbox
you can choose if you want to show the
legend or not now legend can be at the
bottom or at the top or on the left or
on the right okay so for example we want
to show the legend on the left just save
your code and refresh your project and
run it
and when I click this load chart it's
going to show the legend on the left
hand side see here right and there are
some more properties here you can see
the label visible and what is label here
so when you run your app and when you
see this label for your sections for
example here it's printer C++ or Python
or C sharp these are the labels right
and you can choose if you want to show
the labels or not and there is a
property called label line length so
what is this label line length is this
line length which you know joins your
section to the label this is the line
you can see right so for example we can
set this length to 1 here and then save
your code and refresh your project and
right now you can see this label line is
little bit bigger right which is of
magnitude 20 now when I rerun my code
and load the chart you can see the label
line is now very short because it's
magnitude is 1 okay so that's the label
line so I will make it 20 once again now
there is a property called clockwise
here right so once again when I run the
project and load my chart you will see
here it animates clockwise you see right
so it animates in the clockwise
direction
now when you uncheck this option and
then save your code and refresh your
project and run it once again and load
chart now you can see it an image
through the anti-clockwise right so this
is for
at animation so you can make a check or
unchecked it's on you okay so this is
how you can use pie charts in Java FX I
