show you how you can convert MKV video
format to mp4 video format using VLC
media player so for example I have this
file video which or video file which has
the format of dot and Kb okay so I can
right click and I can see in the
properties that it's a MKV file and I
want to convert this file into mp4 video
file so how can I do this
using VLC media player what I need to do
is I will just open the VLC media player
this VLC media player you can download
it freely from Internet so once you open
this VLC media player you just need to
click this media tab here and then click
convert slash save option here ok and in
here when it opens you need to choose
your video part so my video is here I
will choose my part of my video which is
MKV video and then I will click this
convert slash Save button and then I can
choose the video format from here so
this is the source which I have chosen
and then in the profile I can choose the
video format so here there are some
options and what I'm going to choose is
video for mpeg-4 ok so choose video for
mpeg-4 and if you want to confirm this
you can click this little tool icon here
and it will be chosen here as mp4 slash
MOV make sure if this option is chosen
and in video Kodak everything is ok if
you want to change the bitrate you can
change it according to the video but
generally I leave all the things as
defaults
okay and then I need to choose the
destination path for my video so what
I'm going to do is I will save my file
in the same folder as my MKV folder and
then I need to choose my with your name
for example my m'kay
I'm ke video and then this is important
you need to give the dot mp4 extension
at the last of your video okay so give
the name and then dot and before okay so
and your name with dot and before click
Save and now start the process and then
this will start the process some kind of
process like this and wait for this
process to complete this will reach here
then the process will be complete so you
see process is going on and in few
seconds this process will be completed
so now this process is complete
you can go to the destination folder
where you have saved your mp4 file and
here you can see we have produced a new
file which is a copy of this MKV file
but now the format of this video is
taught and before I can right click on
this video and go to the properties and
it's dot and B for video right now I can
open it using VLC media player and it
will open as a normal video okay so in
this way you can convert and keep MKV
file to mp4 file using VLC media player
I hope you have enjoyed this video
