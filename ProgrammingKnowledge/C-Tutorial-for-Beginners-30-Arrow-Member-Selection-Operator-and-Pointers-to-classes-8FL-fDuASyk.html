video I'm going to teach you about arrow
member selection operator so in the last
video I have shown you how you can
create a class in other files other than
your name dot CPP so we have created a
class using this source file or dot CPP
file and header file so if you haven't
seen that video just watch it so you
know how you can create your file in the
separate file or how you can create a
class in a separate file other than your
main dot CPP so I'm going to use this
class example which I have shown in the
last video and I will demonstrate how
this arrow member selection operator
works so in this header book dot header
or book dot H file which I have made in
the last video I have defined the class
prototype and I have declared a book
class and in this we have public members
which is public public member variable
book ID and we have created getter and
setter of this book ID variables get a
method and setter method of this book ID
right so our header file contains the
prototype of a class and member
functions and our source file will
contain the source code of these
prototype which are here and how it
knows how your CPP file knows by
including this header file in your CPP
file it knows there is a class which
exists in book dot header and I have
written the source for this setter and
getter method in this dot CPP file which
is just a
setting the value and getting the value
which you know by now already I have
already explained how to define setter
and getter method in C++ in the earlier
videos so this is this class is doing it
has one member variable and one setter
function and one get a function for this
member variable right and the definition
or the source for these member functions
for setter book ID and get book ID is
here and this I have explained you in
the last video and I all I have already
are also explained you in the last video
how you can create an object of the
class for example book class and how you
can call this number method or member
functions from the class using just this
object
okay so we have called set book ID and
get book ID from the book class now you
can also say that this book class is
your user-defined data type so we have
seen we can create string for example
string some value and this we call it as
a data type and this we called it as a
value right so we can also say that this
book is odd book datatype right which we
have created so it's a user-defined data
type and this is a variable in other
words right and we can use the concept
of pointer which I have explained you in
the earlier videos and we can use the
address of this object to access our
member function from the class so how we
can do it we can define a book book so
Poynter for example so i will say first
of all this Astrix and then book point
and what this book pointer does or what
is a pointer a pointer is a variable
whose value is the address of another
variable right if you remember so I want
to give the value of this pointer as an
address of this book class so I will
write equal to and we give address by
this end sign and address of book class
so we have created a pointer of type
book okay and by using this pointer we
can access these set and get method like
we have a seen in the case of book 1
book 1 so when we created book 1 we can
use dot separator to access these member
variable but whenever you use pointer
what you need to do either you can do it
like this so you just copy this pointer
of type book and give this bracket and
paste this pointer inside this and then
write dot your whatever number variable
what you want to call so I call it call
set book ID and I set it 300 for example
ok and I want to print this so once
again I will just copy this the whole
pointer dot the get book ID or the
member variable so I either you can use
this kind of definition to call member
variables and I compile this program and
I will run this program
so let's run it it says 100 and 300 so
it's for working fine our pointer of
book type is working fine but there is a
better way of doing this which we are
doing Italy it looks a little bit weird
or ugly when we see it so what we can do
instead of doing the point in the
brackets dot the member function instead
of this I can just copy my pointer which
is book pointer and I will give arrow
like this and this arrow or this arrow
is called the arrow member selection
operator and the function of this is
same as this dot separator but whenever
you use arrow your C++ program knows
that this is a pointer so whenever you
use pointer you separate it or you can
access your member variable by using
these arrow XS or arrow member selection
operator right and I can do the same
here so I will call this select offset
book ID here and this time I will set
book ID thousand for example and I will
call this C out here and I can once
again use this arrow separator or arrow
member selection operator to call my get
function also or get book ID also and
this looks much better you need don't
need to write this or all even though
this is also valid in this case but this
looks much better and by seeing this
arrow separator you can say that this
variable or this object is our pointer
to pointer of this type or whatever type
you define
and this will work same as this code so
let's try to compile the program and run
the program and you see here we can see
thousands this time so you can define
the pointer of a class and using this
pointer of a class you can access the
member variable of a class either like
this or using this arrow member
selection operator okay so I hope you
learn this arrow member selection
operator very in a very good way and I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
