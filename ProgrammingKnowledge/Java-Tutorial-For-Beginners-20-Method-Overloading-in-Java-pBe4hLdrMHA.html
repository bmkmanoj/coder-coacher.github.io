tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in this video we will learn
about method overloading in the last
videos I have shown you how to use a
method now method overloading is same as
declaring method but the main thing is
you can define different method with the
same name so two method you can define
with the same name which can perform two
different you know different logic so
for example I want to add two values and
I want to declare some method for this
so I will declare a function call public
static and it will return integer value
and I will name it as add okay and what
it's going to do is it's going to add
two values okay and it will return these
two values and then I will pass in a
comma int B as the parameters and I will
return the sum of these two values right
a plus B and I can call it in him right
but in real-world programming the
situation may occur that you want to add
not only two integer values you may want
to add two double values or decimal
values or you may want to add two
strings because plus you can be used as
a concatenation operators also so what
you can do in Java is you can define
the method to different method with the
same name but for example different
parameters and different values okay so
you can define add something like this
or you can define add something like
this and this is called method
overloading whenever you define
different method with the same name
which performs some different logic but
they have I mean the same name they can
perform mostly a same logic but you know
data type you want to use them or
parameter you want to pass them can be
different and whenever you will call
these method for example something like
this you want to add two values you can
just call add to integer 1 comma 36 so
it will by default Java knows that
whenever you pass two integers here in a
method you are calling this method
because you are passing two integers in
a same way whenever you pass to a double
values for example 5 point something and
40 point something then your Java
program knows that you are calling this
video so Java is intelligent enough to
deduce your method by your
initialization of the method in the same
way you can pass whenever you want to
pass two names for example hello and
second parameter as
the world then also it you know it can
know that you are calling this function
because it takes string values and
whenever you run the program it will
give you different result then so in the
first case this ad is calling this
function in the second case this add
function is calling this function and in
the third case this ad is calling this
function so the method overloading or
the basic logic of method overloading is
you can define different method with the
same name to perform different
operations okay but logically they will
be doing some same kind of work so this
is Method overloading in Java I hope you
