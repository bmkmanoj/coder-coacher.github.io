a new video series on asp.net so what is
asp.net asp.net is a server-side web
application framework which was
developed by Microsoft and which allows
the programmer to make dynamic website
web services or web application and if
you want more details about what asp.net
can do you can always go to www.hsn 8
here you can find lots of information
about asp.net now for developing asp.net
you definitely want a tool on which you
can develop your SP dotnet framework or
application so we use Visual Studio for
developing our C sharp or dotnet based
application which is also from Microsoft
and Visual Studio in itself is expensive
IDE ID e stands for integrated
development environment but they also
provide the free version of Visual
Studio with the name of Visual Studio
Express so when you write in your search
engine of him on your browser we use to
the express the first link you will see
here is Visual Studio Express and when
you go inside that you will be able to
download the free edition of Visual
Studio now what version of Visual Studio
we want is this Visual Studio Express
whatever is the world latest version it
will come here and we want the Visual
Studio Express for web development so
just click it and choose your language
and just install your Visual Studio
Express
okay and it's very easy to install it
just a few clicks and you will be able
to install we shouldn't Studio Express
on your system now once you have
installed Visual Studio on your system
you can just go to your Start button and
just click it and open visual studio
okay and once it's open we can make a
new project or new website using asp.net
inside this Visual Studio IDE so what we
can do is we go to this file here and we
say new and you can choose either of
them you can choose a project or you can
choose simply a website if you want to
make our website using asp.net so I'm
going to choose this website from here
and it will open a file dialog which is
which will ask you what kind of website
do you want to develop in here you have
two options for making your asp.net
framework website either you can make it
with Visual Basic and I or you can make
it with visual C shop I'm going to use
visual C shop and the first option I
will choose here is visual dotnet
website okay and here you can also give
the name of your website from here so
for example I will write here my web
site okay and then in here you can also
choose a file or folder wherever you
want to save your project so I will
leave it as default and I will click OK
and once you click OK it will generate
all the files which are required by your
asp.net project and it will generate a
few files here you will see here in the
solution Explorer you have some files
which is for example I will open a file
from here default dot X px so this is
the code which is automatically
generated by your asp.net project and it
creates a lot of content when you create
your project
it has about page it has default page
and you have this environment and in
here you will be able to see three tabs
and right now we are in so step and when
you click here design tab you will be
able to see the front end of your
website so by default it generates a
sample a website for you which you can
then add it and make custom website
according to use yourself and it has
automatically generated this Home tab
and about tab for you which are there
also in your solution now by the way
solution and project I haven't explained
you a solution is a system in which you
can create number of projects so a
solution is basically a container for
projects in solution you can make
different project and the project is
your actual project which you have made
okay and solution have the extension
when you right-click your solution and
you go to open folders in Windows
Explorer you see your solution is here
and it has some extension so your
solution has extension for example I
will right-click and go to the property
and my solution has extension dot SL f
LM okay and when you have the solution
you can also have this project and this
project has the extension when you
right-click and go to open in solution
Explorer you have the project here also
whole project okay now I have explained
you what is this design this source and
you can also see both of them at the
same time your source code and your
design view when you click this split it
will show you the source code and
whatever is the outcome of your source
code in the form of design you will be
able to see him now I have by default
the the solution Explorer open this
property Explorer open and this toolbox
open and if you are not able to see
these perspectives in your Visual Studio
IDE you can always go to visual view and
you can open solution Explorer from here
you can open your toolbox here which is
this toolbox and your solution Explorer
is this if you can't see this X solution
Explorer you can just go here and open
here these perspectives from here okay
and you can also
you can also move this according to
yourself wherever you want to have this
on your visual studio you can just drag
and drop and just move there okay so
like this and I can move this property
like this okay now by default because we
have created our project in c-sharp you
have the file extension default dot aspx
dot CS this is the code-behind file in
which we are going to write our c-sharp
code so this is the front end which
contains HTML and CSS content and there
is one more file called dot CS file so
when I click this dot CS file it has its
own code so this code we are going to
use for writing our c-sharp code so when
we need to write our c-sharp code so for
example I have this default a SPX
code and I'm in the design mode and I
will go to the toolbox and for example I
will take a button and drag and drop
into my application now this button has
its own properties so when you select
this button you have its text you can
click this oh yeah if you can click this
button and go to the properties and here
you will be able to see all the
properties of this button you can change
the text of this button for example
click me or and you can also change the
ID of this button for example
click b14 button 1 and when you change
this here click underscore b1 and then
you when you go to your default.aspx dot
cs application here you will be able to
write the code for this button action
perform now whenever you drag and drop
this button where is the code generated
for this button itself by default it
will not generate the code for the
button in here it will just you will be
able to write the action perform methods
and events in this code in this default
code and in here you will be able to see
all the global SPX content so this is
the application content here and when
you click this default.aspx file you
will be able to see a button and we have
changed our button ID as click
underscore ID underscore b1 I'll back up
beg your pardon and this is the text we
have a change for our button so this
will come here it will generate the ID
for the button and it will generate the
text for the button as we have changed
the button properties from our property
Explorer okay so this is done and it
will by default also generate a side dot
CSS file which is a style file cascaded
style sheet the full form of CSS is
cascaded style sheet which is a styling
code for your
website and it will also generate some
of the JavaScript and jQuery stuff which
will be we will see in detail in the
later videos and it has some HTML tags
so by default it will generate a lot of
code if you have if you create your
project and now for example when we run
our program as it is we haven't changed
anything to our code apart from apart
from changing the button name and
dragging and dropping the button and I
will click OK
and it will show the solution or it will
run your solution in your default
browser so for example Google Chrome is
your default browser it will run your
application this is a project we have
created and it has home window which is
this and this is the button we have
created here click me it's not doing
anything because we haven't provided any
functionality to it and it has this
About tab and it also have by default
this login but we will provide more
functionality to our project in the
little videos so this was the project it
has generated for you and for now I will
I think this is all and in the next
video I will show you how to add some
more functionality to your site how to
make a dynamic web pages and all the
other things so I hope you have enjoyed
