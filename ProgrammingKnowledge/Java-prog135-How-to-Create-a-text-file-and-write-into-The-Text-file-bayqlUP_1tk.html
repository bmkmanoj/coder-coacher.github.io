last video I have shown you how to read
a text file and show it into the text
area in this video I will show you how
to write a text file so what I have done
is I have taken a text area J text area
from here this one and drag and drop
here and I have taken a button and I
renamed it as a write text this is from
our last video for reading text and now
this is for writing text so in this code
we are using this J text area whose
variable name is J text area 1 so note
the name or change it according to
yourself we are going to use this
variable name for J text area and then
take a button and name it according to
yourself in my case I have given a name
write text to it now right click this
button go to event action an action
perform and once again yeah so write
this code first of all make a try-catch
block so it will catch
error if your code contains any error
because you are choosing a file in this
case so right in this trike block file a
writer writer this is the variable name
is equal to new file writer and after
that give the path of your text five so
give the path and this is the name I
have given for my in text file which is
desktop text area load ok so when I
write something in the text area it will
generate our desktop text area load dot
txt file this one in my file folder
which is right now empty file folder
which is empty right now
but when I run the program and I will
click the right button it will create
and generate a next of dot text file
here so this file in desktop text area
load dot txt file so this line is done
while writer write is equal to new file
writer and the path and make sure you
put double slashes here instead of
single slash and in the second line
write buffer writer VW this is the
variable name is equal to new buffer
writer and copy this variable name and
paste it here then write the name of
your J text area
which is this so right-click copy this
name and then paste it here dot right
BW which is this variable name and then
close your BW variable so be the blue
dot close bracket and bracket closed and
when you write when you are done with
your writing what I have done is I will
clear the text from the text area so
that's why I have written this text area
dot side text null so it will clear the
text area once it has generated our file
and then write text area not request
focus bracket and break closed so this
whole is the code for writing a text
file in your desired path so here you
can give your desired path so just copy
this code and then when you run the
program
here and this is the text area so in the
text area you can write anything
programming knowledge weight coming to
subscribe give feedback
and
long so I have given three lines and
then I will press this write text and my
text area is clear for writing once
again and for verifying that it has
really generated this desktop text area
load dot txt file I will go to my folder
which is called file and yes it has
generated this file so I will open this
file and you can see whatever you have
written in your text area its generated
into our text file so in this way you
can write a text file using your java
application i hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
