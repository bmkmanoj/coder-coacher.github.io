shown you how to use interfaces and
c-sharp in this video I am going to show
you how to explicitly use or implement
interfaces in c-sharp so in the last
video I've shown you how to declare
interfaces and I have also told you that
you cannot use filled-in interfaces and
you cannot use access modifier in
interfaces when you define some member
method in interfaces and suppose we have
two interfaces for example I meter one
and I meter two and both have the same
method in themselves then how we can use
these method explicitly I am going to
show you today so first of all for
example I have this example one class in
which I have this main class I will
inherit from meter one meter one and I
meter two in this class so I inherit
from I meter one and I meter two in this
example one class and then I can define
the method inside this the right class
with an example one like this okay and I
have shown you how you can use this
print in here so you can just define an
object of example one example one e^x is
equal to is equal to new example one and
you can use this print method here write
the X dot print okay but and I can run
it first
Paul and show you the result and it will
run perfectly fine but when I want to
it's taking long time to run yeah so I
can see the message print meter 1 but
for example I want to explicitly define
the print method for meter 1 and print
method for meter - okay so how can i
define it so I either I can I have to do
like this and there will be ambiguity
because the there are two imprint method
with the same name inside the class
right so to explicitly define that this
print is a part of or this print
definition is this one and the meter to
the print definition is this one we can
use it like this
we can use we can explicitly define this
print definition like this the first of
all you need to remove these access
specifier from here from both the print
method and to explicitly declare that
this print method is a part of this I
meter 1 what you can do is just copy
this print I meter 1 and just use dot
and then define your method definition
in the same way I can just copy a meter
to dot and then I can explain explicitly
declare that this method declaration is
a part of meter 1 and this method
declaration is a part of meter 2 and how
can I use it I can use it like this so I
have to type cast first of all this
meter so I will use for example I want
to print this print meter 1 message
so I need to typecast this like this
meter in the brackets and then the outer
brackets BX dot I can use this now print
method and to this typecasting we can
specify we are using this print method
for meter one right in the same way we
can typecast this print method for a
meter to and when we run the program you
can see print meter one field print
meter to message right so you can do it
like this type bike typecasting but then
you cannot use this reference object
like this X dot print you cannot see
this right or even if you want to do it
like this print like this it will show
an error and you see it's showing this
error that does not contain definition
of print because we have explicitly
defined the methods for both of the
interfaces right for example a in some
cases you want to use this X dot some
print general method print what you can
do is you can do it like this you can
declare this reference I meter one by
one for example as an object of example
one and once again I too
and meet the - I'm eater - as an object
of example one and I can use my meter 1
I 1 here and I 2 here and then also it
will work fine then I run the program it
shows me the same result or one more
thing you can do here is you want to use
this for example I meter one print
method as normally and you want to use
this I meter - method explicitly how you
can do it you can just remove this I
meter one interface and just give the X
specifier it should be Pub lik and then
you can just use your example 1 is equal
to TX 1 and you don't need this and then
you can just say this should be e x and
you can just say just use this e^x
object dot print right and when you do
it this X will point to this definition
of meter 1 because you have defined this
normally right but for using this which
in which you have given the definition
explicitly you need to typecast this
like this ok so in this way you can
define your interface definition
explicitly and you can implement your
interfaces explicitly in c-sharp I hope
