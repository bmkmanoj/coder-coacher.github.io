video I'm going to show you how you can
show the data grid raw values to the
text boxes so for example I select some
cell or the row from here and you need
to show the values for example employee
ID in this employee ID text box the
first name in the first name text box
last name and the last name text box and
the pay in the pay text box how can you
do it I will show you in this video so
let's get started just select your data
grid view and double click it and you
will reach to the data grid view cell
content change event you can also choose
selected or selection change event which
you can find here or you can also choose
a mouse click event instead of using
this cell content click event but for
this video I'm using cell content change
event now the first step is to check
whether your cell index is greater than
0 greater than or equal to 0
so I will give this if condition and in
here
I'm going to write the index and I will
verify the index if it's greater than 0
or not to find the index you just take
you just need to take this variable
which is that a gridview cell event togs
and just paste it here which is simply e
then just try it dot row index and this
will give you the row index and we will
check if it's greater than or equal to 0
and and if it's greater than or equal to
0 we will find out the row so we will
just use this object called dot
grid-view
and let's see what is the object name ro
got a great new low so let's search for
data grid view row okay this is our data
grid Vigo is equal to so I have given
the row object is equal to this and then
this will be is equal to the name of
your data grid view which is that a grid
view one in my case right you just copy
it and paste it here and then just write
dot rows and then in the square bracket
you need to pass this index which you
get from the here from here right so
just copy this and pass this row index
here okay so what this will do is it
will pass the row index to this data
grid new row and now you just need to
pass the values to the text boxes so
just select your text boxes and copy the
name of these text boxes paste it here
dot text is equal to then just take this
row variable and then just write thought
cells which is this one and we use
square bracket to find out the index so
this you can do it in two ways you can
either provide the cell index of the row
or you can just give the column name so
you see here column name you can provide
or otherwise you can provide the index
for example I am using index for now so
it is 0th index on this zeroth row or 0
column you will be having this a I D or
employee ID so we want to transfer the
value from the employee IDs of right dot
value and then we need to convert this
value to strength in order to show it in
the text box right so just like this
okay and the same thing you need to do
it for the other text boxes first name
last name and pee text boxes and these
index will change zero one two three
okay and the first name text box name is
text F name which will come here and
last name text box name is text under
underscore ell name and the pay text
post box name is text pay and let's try
and run this program so I will run the
program use the name and password and I
will load my table and let's see if it
transfers the value or not I will select
this one and transpose right I will
select this one and transfer or I will
select this one it transfer right so you
can just transfer the value from your
table to the text boxes right so you can
do this the same thing from selection
changed event and how you can do it just
select your data grid view and go to the
event button here this one and John just
go to the event called selection changed
and double click this here and just copy
the same code and paste it here okay
and I'll just hide this port from here
so just give this so in this selection
change the event you don't need this row
count here I will just delete this from
here and this also I will change but
first we will write some code so just
write data grid view cell and give it a
variable names for example cell is equal
to null and in the next line we will
iterate this selected cell so you will
write for each and then we will give the
condition here and in here we will write
the code so here we will write for each
selected cell so you write cell for
example this is your objects whatever
you want to give you can give it here in
your data grid you send so just copy the
name of your data grid view dot selected
cells and if this cell which is this one
is equal to selected server we will
break so just try it okay and if the
cell is not null if cell is not null not
equal to null we will print these values
so here comes the curly braces and this
I will change it to the start a gridview
Rho Rho is equal to then this will be
changed to sell dot owning Rho so just
change this to sell God moaning Rho
okay now let's try to run the program
once again to to load the table and
let's see you see here it's more
flexible okay so whenever you click some
cell this is changed okay so in this way
you can transfer the data grid view
values to the text boxes I hope you have
