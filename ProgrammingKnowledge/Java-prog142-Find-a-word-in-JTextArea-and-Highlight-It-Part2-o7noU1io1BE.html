and in here we will search for something
so right pattern dot to uppercase and
second argument would be comma this
position int variable here and then
after these brackets before this last
bracket right here is greater than or
equal to zero okay so we want to
highlight the word whether it's in
uppercase or in lowercase we want to
highlight the word so it did does not
depend upon the uppercase or lowercase
that's why we are searching for the
uppercase also and it will search for
the word whether it's in uppercase or
lowercase that's why I'm declaring this
condition and then in this while loop
right thus just copy this highlighter
variable
yeah dot add highlight and in here it
automatically takes these argument first
argument is this int variable which is
correct
second argument is position plus copy
this pattern string variable position
plus pattern dot length okay
and at the last I will add semicolon so
error will go so right this and the last
line in the while loop we will write is
copy this inter variable position and
write plus is equal to and copy this
pattern once again pattern dot length ok
bracket and bracket close so I have
declared this try-catch block and I have
made this method and I have written this
code here ok so if you want you can
pause the video and write this method
and now we will go to the design section
once again and now this time we will
write the code for button action perform
so right click this button go to event
action action perform and we will reach
to the button action perform once again
and in here we will call the method we
have declared above this highlight
method so this highlight method takes a
J text component which can be J text
field or J text area and it takes a
string to search whatever what we search
so just copy this and once again in
action perform but next in perform here
paste this function and first argument
is J component so instead of this I will
copy the variable name of this J text
area so J text area 1 and I will pass it
here so this is the first argument
second argument is the word we want to
search so I will copy the
text field area name jtextfield one and
I will pass it as a second argument dot
get text so it will take the text from
the text area and highlight the word in
this text area so this is showing me
some error
let me check a why okay so what I have
done is I have declared this method
inside my highlighter class which is
wrong so I just need to just cut this
and outside my highlight class so this
highlight loss and here and after this
bracket I need to write this highlight
function same function no change just
like this and this highlight painter is
showing error because once again this
highlighter should not be in the same
class as the highlighter it should be
declared outside this class and I have
haven't considered this I haven't seen
this bracket is closing here I should
have gone outside the bracket and I
should have written this highlight
highlight point painter and this
variable now this error will go the code
will not change just this is a class
declaration at first we have declared
the class then we have written the
declaration of this highlight painter
and then we have made this highlight
method
this is all same the mistake I have done
is I have not seen this bracket and I
have written all the code inside this
class which was wrong
okay so just write write this and now
when you see this here it's not showing
any error and that's what we wanted
right now let's try and run the program
so run program I will copy some copy and
paste some text here so here I have
pasted some text which you can get from
any text file and now I want to search
the word so for example I want to search
the word da so I'll write the here and I
will press search
it should highlight this word wherever
its present in uppercase or lowercase in
red color so let's see press search
yes it highlights the word da with the
red color everywhere but if you see if I
want to search for other word for
example this end I will when I search
this it will highlight this da also and
this end also which we don't want we
want only one word at the time to be
searched not this da and the end so we
want to remove highlight from this
previous word and now we want to add
highlight to other word so for this also
we can make a method so just go at your
code and just above your highlight
method wherever you have made above this
we will may come method to remove
highlight before searching for other
words so declare here a function like
this public void remove highlight and in
the bracket right J component so this is
the J text area we are talking about so
J component we will pass here the day
text area so declare well like this
public void remove highlights J text
component text
ponent and break it and drag it close
and inside this will write the code for
removing the highlight so declare two
variables like this
first is highlighter once again
highlight is equal to tamp component
which is this variable dot get
highlighter bracket and bracket closed
second highlighter dot highlight square
bracket and give it some other variable
name highlights in my case is equal to
highlight which is this variable dot get
highlights bracket and bracket flows so
it takes this whatever highlights which
are present in this gtex component it
takes those highlight and now we will
remove those highlights so write a for
loop so just below this declaration
right here for and write in the bracket
int I is equal to zero Simon :
I is less than highlights which is this
variable dot length semicolon I plus
plus and this close for loop and in here
we will pass some condition so right
here this condition and if bracket
closed also like this
so this F can on inside this for loop
give the F condition and right if
highlights which is this variable which
is our a and in the square bracket right
this int dot get painter bracket uh
bracket close instance off and my
highlight painter which is a class we
have declared right so this one so just
copy this variable and paste it here
and inside this if condition right this
line highlight which is this highlight
dot remove highlight and side this
bracket right this highlights variable
and bracket square bracket inside this
past this I into area below and bracket
in black clothes so for removing we have
written this method so if you want you
can pause the video and copy this remove
method and what we will do is we will
just copy this method and we will go
inside this highlight method which we
have declared earlier and about the
strike block I will write this remove
highlight function bracket in bracket
closed and this function takes takes a J
component right so this is also J
component so I will copy this and pass
here okay so before searching for other
word before we will remove the highlight
first and then search for other word and
highlight it once again so once again
run the program and this time once again
I am pasting some text
here and we will search some word so for
example as last time
first of all I will search for da and
pressed the its search for Dao but once
again if I want to search other word
like and it this the highlight should go
which was not going earlier so let's see
if it goes and it highlights and once
again so press search yes
it remove the highlight from da and it
highlights and once again so in this way
you can make a simple highlight program
to search words and highlight them I
hope you have learned something new this
