video I am going to give you a basic
introduction to classes and object in
C++ so first of all what is a class a
class is a collection of related data
and function under a single name so let
me paste your dis definition and once
again go through the definition of a
class a class is a collection of related
data and function under a single name so
for example our C++ program can contain
hundreds and hundreds of functions and
thousands of variables and using class
we collect same kind of functions and
data and we use this collection in
single class so for example you have a
book class you can collect functions
related to book for example print book
open book close blow book and variables
related to book class for example you
have author of the book name of the book
and how many number of pages book
contains so this kind of data which is
same or related to one another we and
capsulate this kind of functions of it
this kind of variable in a single class
the second example can be a box class
which can contain the height width and
the length of the box and it can contain
a func contain functions like the volume
of the box or the surface area of the
box
ok so using class we collect related
data and function in C++ now let me give
you an example how you can declare a
class in C++ you can declare a class in
C++ using
the name class itself and then you give
the name to your class generally it's
good practice to start your class name
with a capital letter so for example I
want to make a class called book so I
will write this class as books and then
you give these parenthesis and this
semicolon okay so this is a basic
definition of class and inside your
class you can declare different
variables or different functions okay
now there is a word called access
specifier now for example if you want to
use variables or function which you
declare inside this class in your main
program so the functions in book class
you want to use it in your main program
you use public access specifier or
otherwise if you don't want to use your
function inside your class and you just
want to use your function inside your
class inside the class itself then you
need to use private access specifier but
this I will explain unit later right now
we are going to use a public access
specifier so you can declare this public
access specifier like this just write
the name public and then give this
column not this one this colon and
whatever you write on the this will be
considered or will be treated as public
members of this class for example I
declare a variable int and I will say
the book ID so I will declare it book ID
is equal to
- five six for example and I will
declare our function also inside this
class to print the book ID so I will say
void print book ID and I will give this
parenthesis and ins inside this I will
just print the book ID so I will say see
out the book ID is equal to and then I
really just copy this book ID paste it
here and hand line okay now I have
declared a variable inside my book class
and I have declared a function inside my
box class so you can declare variables
and functions inside the book class or
inside your any class right now for
example you want to use these members or
this function in here inside your main
function what you need to do is you need
to declare a object of this class and
why do we use object because there can
be many classes inside your program and
there can be functions which have the
same name for example the other class
can also contain print book ID the other
class can also contain ID so there can
be multiple definition of these function
and how will you know which class this
function belongs to so for this you need
to declare object so you know which
class this function belongs to okay so
an object is an
instance of the class right now to
declare the object what you need to do
is you need to use the name of the class
so I will just use the name of the class
and then you need to give the variable
name or object name to this so I will
give the object name for example book
one and semicolon so this variable or
this is called the object of the class
and we will we are going to access the
all the functions inside this book class
or variable inside this book class using
this object okay so how we can use this
function print book ID using this book
one object just write book 1 and we use
this dot separator in order to access
this function so I will use this print
book function and just semicolon and
then now I can just compile my program
and hopefully it will not give you me
any errors so my program is built now
and now I can run my program so I will
run my program and you can see the book
ID is and whatever the ID of the book
right so in this way you can declare
objects of a class and you can access
the member of the class these are called
member function and this is called the
member variable you can directly access
this variable by for example you want to
access this variable because this is a
public
public variable we have declared this in
public access number variables so we can
just write it here see out book 1 dot ID
okay and this will print you the book ID
which is 256 right so you can access
this variable also because this is a
public member of this class right and
now I will build my program and run it
and you can see it has printed 256 here
so this is the basic introduction of
classes an object in C++ in the coming
videos we will discuss more about
classes so stay tuned and please rate
