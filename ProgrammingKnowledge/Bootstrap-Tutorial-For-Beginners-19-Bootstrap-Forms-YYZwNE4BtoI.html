bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use forms in
bootstrap so forms generally we use to
give some input so let's get started and
let's see how we can create a form in
bootstrap so first of all we will create
a form element and close it and inside
this form element first of all we will
define a role for this form and role is
form itself ok and then once again we
would define div tag here and this tag
will be the class called form group form
- group okay so for every input we can
define a form group for example we want
to create a form for entering the email
and password for the user we can create
a different form group for email and
password okay
so every category in the form is a form
group for example you can say and inside
our form group you can define a label
first of all so define a label and this
label will be for emails so for email
okay and this we will reference it in
the input when we created and here we
can define the text so for example email
and colon something like this and then
we will define the input so just define
a input and for this input what we can
do is we can define first of all the
type of input we want to define and this
type will be email right and just call
it loss called
form
control okay and now we will reference
this ID for this so we will create this
ID which will be same as this okay so
this is one form group right and we can
save it and we can refresh our webpage
and it will look like this so you will
get the label and the input for entering
the email right
in the same way you can create multiple
form groups so I will copy this form
group and create one more but this time
this will be for password PWD okay and
this should be equal to this one ID and
the type is password this time so pass
word and the text will be password okay
save it and refresh it and now you can
see password right now for adding a
check box what you can do is you can add
one more div tag here and then inside
your div tag first of all call a class
called
check box so check box okay and inside
this div element we will just create a
label and this label will be for the
check box right and inside this label we
want to create a check box so what we
can do here we can create an input of
type check box so input and this input
will be of type check box so just write
type is equal to check box and then you
can give any input name or text here so
for example click me okay and then what
you can do is you can define a submit
button for submit submitting your form
so this is simple you have seen how to
create a button
earlier also so just create a button and
this will be of type submit' so just
remember that this will be not button
but submit because we are submitting the
form right and then you can call this
button design class which is BTN BTN
default for example okay and now save it
and refresh your page and now you will
see this email password checkbox and for
the button let's define some text here
so just we can add submit okay save it
and refresh it and now you have this
button so you have this checkbox email
ID password and this checkbox and button
right so this kind of forms are called
default forms or horizontal forms okay
there are two more kind of forms in
bootstrap which is inline form and
vertical form so to create the inline
form so for example we want to make it
inline form in instead of this default
form what we can do here is you can add
a class called
form inline so plus is equal to form in
line so you just need to add this class
called form inline and save it and when
you refresh this it's going to become
this inline form inline means everything
is in the same row you can see right now
there is one more kind of form and this
form is form horizontal so instead of
form in line you just need to write here
form horizontal but it will not affect
it will be just like your vertical or
default form but if you want that's that
this input should come in front of this
email and this input should come in
front of this password label then what
you can do here is
in your label inside the forum group you
can add a class and then add control
label so and then we can add a column
class call - SM - for example - so this
will be off with - okay and you already
know that we can add 12 total columns in
bootstrap web page and - is this one
then in the remaining 10 we can include
our input so just add a div tag here and
add a class to this tip tank so add this
div tag tag around your input like this
and here add a class called call SM so
call - SM and we have ten more columns
to use so you can just provide ten here
and two here so together the sum is
twelve save it and refresh your page and
now you can see this text box is in
front of your email same you can do for
passwords so just add this class to your
password label and then surround your
input by this div tag for the column
width like this okay save it and refresh
your web page and now it will look like
this and for aligning these check boxes
and this button what you can do is you
can surround your check box div elements
so in the same way you can surround our
div element for check box like this and
one more div element just below here and
in here we will offset our column by two
right so it will be aligned and how you
can do it you just need to add this
attribute to your
class which is called - SM - offset - -
and this will give an offset of - to
your checkbox and then this is of width
10 right and same we will do with button
so in here we will add a div tag for
button and surround it wide by this div
tag and which is offset it by - save it
and refresh your web page and now your
form is properly aligned so in this way
you can use forms in bootstrap I hope
