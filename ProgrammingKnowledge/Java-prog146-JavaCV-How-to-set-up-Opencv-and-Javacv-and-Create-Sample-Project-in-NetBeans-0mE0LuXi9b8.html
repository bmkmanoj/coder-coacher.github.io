video I will show you how to configure
and install Java CV on your system and I
will also show you how to create a
sample the Java CV program in your
NetBeans IDE so what is net Java CV so
Java CV is a real-time vision control or
vision image processing library which is
a wrapper of open CV open CV is
basically written in C++ and Java cv
provides a wrapper for that open CV
libraries and open CV is extensively
used in image processing and computer
vision research so let's get started and
let's see how we can install Java CV so
first of all for installing Java CV of
four running Java CV on your system you
need to install OpenCV on your system so
just go to your browser and just write
in your search tab open CV and first
link which will open here is open CV dot
o-r-g just click it and in here you will
see at the right-hand side the latest
version for the download and here you
can see for the which operating system
you can download this open CV files so
I'm downloading it for this windows so I
will just click this this link and when
I click this it will open this open CV -
two point four point seven dot exe so
it's a relatively bigger live library of
bigger folder and it will take around
10 to 15 minutes to download so I have
already downloaded it and once you have
downloaded it just go to that Exe file
and just click it and run the executable
file and here the important step is to
give the path so it's preferred to save
or extract your OpenCV library in your c
folder so just IC :
and this slash and extract this OpenCV
in your c folder and it will also take 1
or 2 minutes depending upon the speed of
your system by the time it's extracting
we cannot download our Java CV files so
once again go to your browser and in the
Search tab write Java C B here search
for it and the first link you will see
here is code.google.com slash P slash
Java CV and in here you will also see
the download link for me so just click
this download link and in here you will
be able to see some zip files so the
files we are interested in is this Java
CV minus 0.6 minus bin zip and this Java
CV minus 0.6 minus cpp jars dot zip
so this 0.6 can change according to the
newest version so just check for it
so John download these two zip files one
is this bin file and one is this
cpp jar files and once you have
downloaded these two files just open
those zip file and extract it in your C
folder also so when you go to your C
folder you will be able to see this Java
cv- bin folder which is which you have
extracted from this Java CV zip file and
you will be able to see java c v- cpp
jar folder so the first folder will
contain and this Java Java CPP and Java
CV jar files and the second folder which
is Java cv- cpp jar file will contain
all these open CV jar files ok and now
our open CV is also extracted in our C
file so you in this C folder you will be
able to see this open CV folder also and
when you click this open CV folder you
will be able to see this build and
source folder so once your open CV is
extracted here what you need to do is
you need to set your environment
variables so right go to the start
button here right click your computer go
to properties here and go to advanced
system settings and in here go to
environment variable and in here go to
this system variable here and search for
this path and in here we are going to
add the path of OpenCV dll files so
where you can find this dll file in
OpenCV just open or go to your open CV
folder in your C folder so go to
OpenCV then go to your build folder then
go to your x86 here and then go to PC 10
and then go to bin and in here
you will see all OpenCV dll files these
dll file are the c++ dll files which
java c we will require so just copy this
path of this bin folder where you have
these dll files and in your environment
variable just paste this path here I
have already done that so you will be
able to see here after this semicolon so
whenever you are going to give this path
just give a semicolon here and then
paste your path right so we you have
here see slash OpenCV slash build slash
x86 slash vc10 slash bin ok and once you
have done that click OK click OK and
once again click OK now once you have
set your environment variable
open your NetBeans IDE and create a
sample project I have already created
this sample project for this forms
application and in here in this project
what I will do is I will go to this
libraries here so when you create your
project you will be able to see this
library folder here and just right-click
it and go to the properties here and in
here we are going to add the jar files
so just click this Add jar and browse
for this in your C folder browse for
this Java cv- bin
hold up first so and in here you are
going to see this jar files so the jar
file which is of our interest is this
first second which is Java CPP and Java
CV and these files which are below are
according to the operating system so for
example I am using Windows operating
system so I will select this or this
according to the Windows operating
system 32 bit or 62 with 64 bit and if
you are not sure the best way is to add
all the jar files right except this
sample folder and click OK and click OK
and once again we are going to add some
more jar file from the other folder so
right click thus library once again go
to the properties add jar and this time
we will browse for the other Java CV
folder which is java c v- cpp jars open
it and here you need to select the jar
file for windows so you need to select
this this which have windows name here
and open CV windows jar files so just
this and this and all the other file are
for Linux and Android so we don't need
them and click OK and click OK
so once you are done with exporting your
jar file in your libraries I am going to
create a simple forms program so I will
I have created this form Java form here
and I will drag and drop a button here
and I will right click and
added the text and I will write open
image for example and I will just double
click this button and I reach to the
button click event of this button and in
here I'm going to paste a sample Java CV
program so in here I will paste this
program and when you paste or copy or
paste this program once here you will
see this errors first of all so first of
all let me go through your go through
this code first and then we will see
what to do with these errors so just
write IPL image and then give it a
variable name is equal to cv load image
and give the path of the image which you
want to load in this argument
yeah and then in the next line we are
going to create a canvas it's just like
a form in which your image will load so
right final canvas frame and give it a
name is equal to new canvas and in the
arc bracket we have will pass the
argument which will be the title of this
canvas so I have given the title demo to
this canvas frame and then what we do is
we will copy this canvas object here and
we will write canvas dot show image and
in the bracket I will pass this image
object which is my IPL image object and
in the last line what I am doing is I am
just writing a code to close this canvas
frame so I write canvas dot set default
close operation and in the bracket I am
processing the argument
X dot swing dot jframe dot exit on close
okay and once you have done with this
code and you will be able to see these
errors here the best way to remove the
errors is just right-click and fix
imports so right-click and fix import
and if you see this CV load image error
from here just go at the top and what
you are going to do is we are going to
import one more library here so here we
already have these two imports which is
import comm Google code dot Java C V dot
canvas framed this is for the canvas
frame and we also have import comm
Google code dot Java CV dot cpp dot
OpenCV code dot IPL image so this is for
the image or taking the path of the
image one more import import you need to
give here is this one so this is import
static comm Google code dot Java CV dot
cpp dot OpenCV hi GUI dot star so if you
see error on this CV load image then
just add this import here import static
comm dot Google code dot Java CV dot cpp
dot open CV underscore hai GUI dot this
s tricks or star and the other two
import you will be able to see with
right-clicking and fix imports once you
are done with that and once you have
written this code or copied this code
here
I will keep the screen here so if you
want you can copy and write the code
from here and once you are done with
that right click and run while and your
program will run and once your program
is running just click open image button
here and you will be able to see this
image from here okay let's open some
other image so I'm just giving the part
to the other image so I will go to the
image right click securities and copy
the path of the image and in my code I
will just change this path here okay
and once you are done with that right
click and run your code once again and
click this open image button and it will
open your image right so in this way you
have successfully configured Java CV and
written your first Java CV program with
your NetBeans IDE in future I will also
show some more programs using Java CV so
stay tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
