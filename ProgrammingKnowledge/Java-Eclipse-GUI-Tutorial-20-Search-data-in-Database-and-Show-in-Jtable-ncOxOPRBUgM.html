show you how you can search data in the
database and filter the values in your
che table on the basis of your search
the data for example you want to be a
search on the basis of name and you you
write or you make a text field and you
want to search whatever you write in
that text field and filter all the names
with whatever you enter in that search
text field and show it here how you can
do it I will show you in this video so
let us get started first of all what I
need to do is I need to take a text
field here and this text field
I will repass it
so whenever you see something this
internal error you just need to click
this repass button okay so I have this
text box and on the basis of text
entered in this text box I want to
search some data and filter it into my Z
table okay so what you need to do is
first of all I will change the name of
my text field as text field search and
then select your text field right click
it and go to add event handler and
search for the event called key release
so go to key and once again add event
handler key key released okay
so search for action or no search for F
event handler key and key released
actions and just click this key release
action
and we reach to the key release action
of this text field search button right
and in here you want to write the code
to to search the data in the database
right so what I am going to do here is I
will take the skeleton of the code from
somewhere till now you might know that
we always use this skeleton of the code
to query the database and execute some
values right so in here what we
generally do is we have some this try
catch block and in this try catch block
B we catch the exception if any
exception occurs while the execution of
this code this is the this is the query
we are going to write and this is the
prepared statement which we pass the
query and this option we will use it but
not like this
I will show you how to use this and then
we have the result set whenever we use
select query we need to use execute
query because select query gives us the
result on the other hand whenever you
use insert or update or delete query you
use PHP dot execute because it does not
give you any result so you do not use a
result set with insert update or delete
and you use XC q p st dot execute only
for insert update and delete right and
once you have result you can just
iterate your result in side this while
loop right so for now i am going to
delete this because i do not need this
because I want to filter the data and
show in show it into the textbox right
so first of all this is the query which
I am going to write select all or Esther
exalts star from your table name my
table name is table name is employee
info and where the clause is where and I
want to search on the basis of the name
column okay for example I want to search
on the basis of name so user or whoever
wants to search the data he will write
the name and then our data will be
searched on the basis of name ok and
then we pass this query to the prepared
statement prepared statement PST is
equal to connection or prepare statement
and pass this query and then we pass the
value to this question mark by using PST
dot set string and then just take the
name of your search text field in my
case this text field name is sir text
field search
dot
get text okay and this will give you
whatever user has entered in the in the
search text field right and then we
execute this query and I think for now
we are not going to use this while loop
let us see if we require this while loop
or not in what further when we test this
but one thing you need to have is your
table name right so whatever is the name
of your table just take the name of the
table and Mike is the table name is
table and then go to your once again SIL
such a de vente key release to the same
action perform method ok so just write
the name of your table here in this key
release in which we are writing our code
table dot
set model
and what certain what model we are going
to set here we are going to use our DB
utils loss
whenever I have shown you how to link
your database value to the J table I
have shown you how to use this TB util
class by downloading this RS to XML jar
file
this has DB util last might just write
DB and DB util which is this one dot
result set to model this one and then
pass your result set here okay so it's
just simple Co lines of code okay
this is your code which we use to search
the data on the basis of name in your
database and show it into the table
let's try and run the program
and let us search for for example mark
okay
let's search for
mark you see only mark is filtered here
and other are gone okay
for example I want to select for John
for example John so I can only see John
right or otherwise I can just click this
load table to load all the data for
example I want to search for Peter and I
have Peter right now for example I have
two names two same names okay so I add a
seventh employee ID which has the same
name as employee ID - John and John okay
and so and surname I will change it as
some surname and age will be different
and I will save this data and let us
search for John once again let us see if
it give a gives us two result or not
and you see it gives us two results here
right so in this way you can search for
the data on the basis of your selected
name okay
and just remember here if you are
searching for all the data then give
star here but if you are searching for
or you want to load only age or employee
ID name surname and age instead of this
s tricks just write E I D comma name
comma surname comma age okay now for
example what you want is you want to
search on the basis of all of your free
field so you want to search on the basis
of source surname or you want to search
on the basis of age or you want to
search on the basis of employee ID
everything on the basis of whatever you
want you want to search and filter it in
your table how you can do it there is a
simple trick I will show you which I use
generally so what I am going to do is in
addition to this search text box what I
am going to do is
for example first of all let me search
for a group box if it I can see it here
or I will take first of all a combobox
from here and drag and drop here and
this combo box I can use it for
selecting what kind of data I want to
search for okay so come I will change
the name of this combo box as combo box
select for example okay and in here I
will just select this combo box once
again and I will go to the property
called model and I will write the model
for this like this so I have want to
search on the basis of employee ID name
surname and age so I can populate this
combo box with these four values the ID
name should be named
so name
edge okay I will click okay
and then I can just add it my query a
little more so what I can do is I will
right click once again and I will go to
the same key release event from here
where I have written my code right so
here I have written my code and I can
modify this query a little bit so what I
can do is I can just go above at the top
of my try block and I can declare a
string variable string
selection for example is equal to and I
will typecast my selected object in the
combo box string and then the combo box
object so my combo box name is what is
the name of my combo box so if you see
this here that means there is some error
na or code which you are writing so I
have observed some weird phenomena in
Eclipse
whenever you I mean you have written
some code and it your source code has
some error and whenever you want to go
to design view it will not show any
component in the design view and that's
a kind of an error so just make sure
that here no error is there whenever you
try to go to designer otherwise it will
show some weird design okay so now let
us go on with the with our code so our
string selection is equal to typecast
string and we will typecast combo box
and we have the combobox selection I
think or
so let us see what is the name of our
combo box I will just comment this go to
our code
and our combobox name is combobox only
so I will just change it as
combobox election and just copy it once
again
go to my code
wherever I was writing the code and in
here I will just write combo box
selection and it shows at this red
squiggly line that means the combo box
is locally declared bike Eclipse there
sometimes Eclipse declares these
component locally and which we do not
want so I will just take this combo box
and declare this outside my constructor
here and this will be private now it
will be
the global component or variable okay so
once again I will go to my code and then
combo box election dot and then get
selected item
this should be this one
and break it closed
and once I have the selection which I
select or which I take from the combobox
election I can replace it with this name
so I can search on the basis of whatever
is selected in the combo box and instead
of this name I can just write single
quote in between double code in between
plus plus and then I pass this selection
in between these plus sign so whatever
is the selection in the combo box it
will search on the basis of that column
okay so run the program
and let us say we want to search on the
basis of Eid which is the by default
selected I can write one here and why
it's not selecting this lets search on
the basis of name for example mark
and
there is some problem in selection right
so let's see what is the problem
okay so I found out the problem the
problem is whenever I use the single
quote I should use it with the values
which are right hand side of the equal -
whenever I use it on the left hand side
of equal to which is a part of the query
it should not recognize the correct
query so I am printing the query right
now so for example I leave this double
quotes for showing you what the error is
whenever I use the single quotes outside
my outside my values and I say one you
see what the query I am getting is
select star from employee info where and
in single quotes this employee ID is
printed but it should not be in single
quote it should only this employee ID
that is why I need to use this without
single quotes here so now this query is
like this and then your code will run
fine hopefully run the code
and for example on the basis of employee
ID for example one I get the result I
want searched on the basis of name for
example
mark I guess the result I want to search
on the basis of named John
and I get to zero results right I want
to get the
get the result on the basis of surname
for example forty point
nobody is 35 okay on the basis of age
okay
45 yes there is one employee with
so 35 age or from on the basis of
surname for example
and I get the result okay so in this way
you can search on the basis of selected
field which you select in the combo box
and whatever you write here you can
filter that value inside your table
