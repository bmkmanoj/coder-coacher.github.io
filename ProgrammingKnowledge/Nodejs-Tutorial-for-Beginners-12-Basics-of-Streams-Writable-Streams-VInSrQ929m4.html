node.js tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how we can use
readable streams in node.js and we have
used this method called create restreams
to create an object of read streams and
then we have called this method on this
readable stream object which on data
event was you know reading a chunk of
data from a file which we have created
last time yeah and whenever a chunk of
file is read then it's going to be used
using this variable chunk in this
anonymous function right so if you are
not sure what I'm talking about
just see the last video to be clear now
in this video we will see how we can use
a writable streams in no chairs so for
example you have some buffer stream
coming from somewhere for example from
this file itself whatever we read from a
big file we have we have created last
time we want to write this data which we
are reading in chunks to another file in
chunks so we are not reading the whole
file and then writing to a new file we
are reading chunks and also writing
chunks so it's not going to block your
code okay so let's see how we can create
writable streams in nodejs now to create
a writable streams I'm going to use this
code which I have written in the last
video to read the file right and now we
will create a writable streams just
write var write stream is equal to FS
dot create write stream and then we can
give the name of the file in which we
want to you know send our stream to so
for example I can name my file as write
by dot txt okay
this will be the file in
which we want to write our data now to
use this right seam is really easy
whenever you read this data so here on
the data event we are we were reading
the data right so in order to write it
to a file you can just call this right
stream object and then you can call a
method called right on it so just simply
call a method called right and then it
takes a chunk as an argument so you can
just pass this argument here and this
you know chunk will be written to the
right stream object and in turn it will
be written to the right file dot txt
okay so let's run the code and let's see
how it works so I'm going to open a
terminal and run my code and it has just
printed these lines which indicates
chunk of data read you can see and then
we can see a file is created here with
the name right file it has the same
content as our file dot txt have okay so
this is essentially just writing the
chunk of data as it reads the data from
a file now in the previous videos we
have also seen how we can write the data
using the right file function right now
the difference between this right stream
dot right and the right file function is
in the right file function we were just
you know flushing all the data which we
have in the buffer and it's not you know
going to the file in which we want to
write chunk by chunk but we were writing
it in in a single shot right but using
this method you can you know write the
data to a file in chunks whenever you
have data right so this is the benefit
of this
the method or and right streams over the
right file method okay so I hope you've
enjoyed this video please welcome and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
