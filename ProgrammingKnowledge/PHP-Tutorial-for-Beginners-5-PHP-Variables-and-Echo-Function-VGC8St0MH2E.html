tutorial on PHP programming for
beginners and in this video we are going
to see how to use and declare variables
in PHP so till now in the last video
I've shown you how to write your hello
world first program and how to provide
comment to your program right and by the
way make sure that your Apache server is
running using your control panel xampp
control panel and you are able to see
this parent directory in my guess this
was YouTube which I have made in my HD
dock folder right and in the last video
I have made one PHP file to test my
hello world program okay now in this
video I am going to make a new file so I
will just click new I will save it as
variable variable dot PHP okay
and once again when i refresh my program
I will be able to see this variable dot
PHP but right now it's blank okay so
first of all I will just write my
skeleton and and like this right and
let's see how variable works in PHP okay
so in PHP variable or PHP variables must
begin with and sign okay so if you are
used to some other variable declaration
if you have known C or C++ or Java and
or any other programming language you
are used to using data type of the
variable first and then the name and
then you can assign the value to it
but in PHP all variables start with this
end symbol and
don't start with any data type PHP
interprets their value by the
initialization they get okay and so
let's see how we can declare a variable
first of all what is a variable a
variable is a container for some value
okay so value where variable is
something that stores your value okay so
in PHP we just need to define this end
and then the name of your variable so
for example I can name my variable as
value for example and I can initialize
this value by a number or a string so I
will initialize this value by a number
for example and by this initialization
your variable knows or PHP knows that
this variable which is value is of type
integer right in a same way for example
I can declare a name for example this is
the name of my variable and I can easily
initialize this by a string so I can
just try it programming programming
knowledge okay so by this initialization
PHP knows that name is a string variable
and by this initialization PHP knows
that our value is an integer
initialization or integer or value right
so unlike other languages PHP does not
provide any data type right now it only
starts with this end symbol and it is
decided by the initialization of the
variable what type it is
okay now PHP variables are case
sensitive so you can see that this
variable kept with a capital B oo is not
equal to this this one just need to
change this this should be small B okay
so let me change this so this boo which
starts with with capital B is not equal
to this which we start with with small B
and this is even not equal to this boo
so PHP variables are case sensitive okay
now global and locally scoped variable
global variable can you can use it
anywhere in the program and the local
variable we can use inside a function or
a class that we will see later okay and
some of the variable names are reserved
in PHP like post underscore post in
capital letters underscore get in
capital letters these are form variables
and in a similar ways some server
variables are reserved so you cannot
declare a variable which is same as this
server right in capital so some of the
variables are reserved in PHP right now
we move further let's see that uses of
of this variable so I have already shown
you whatever you provide the value of
variable it's called that of variable so
if you initialize a variable with a
numerical value that will be called a
numerical variable and if you initialize
your variable by a string value it will
be called string variable okay and these
variables you can perform some
multiplication or arithmetic operation
but on string values you cannot do these
values because string you cannot
multiply or divide or a dish add them
together right so let's see this this
also so for example I want to multiply
this by some value so I can write and
and then the value is equal to and so
whenever you use this value you need to
initialize this by and so you know that
this is a value right so you can do it
like this you don't need to provide any
space in between and you can multiply
this value by for example 8 like this
okay that will be completely valid but
so let's try and run the program I will
save it and I will just refresh this and
right now there is nothing printed and
no error is coming that that means our
variable is I mean not giving any error
right no result because we are not
printing anything right now that's why
we are not seeing any result but it's
not giving any error right but on the
same on the other hand for example I
want to multiply this name variable
which is a string variable by the
initialization so I can do something
like this and I want to multiply by this
name by 8 for example this will not be
valid because your variable is a string
and you cannot multiply it by some
number so whenever I try to run this it
will show me error use of undefined name
as you name in this okay so
in this way it will show or throw an
error whenever you perform some invalid
operations right so you can only do a
climatic operation on numerical values
okay so this is this one it will show an
invalid expression right now I've
already shown you in the last video what
you go does echo is a command or a
function you can use to output the
parameter pass to it okay so the typical
uses of for this is to send data to the
client browser okay so we have seen this
example but we will see this in detail
also and it's in texas like this void
echo and it takes the string argument
right and by default of the functions in
the PHP takes argument in parentheses
but because it's a inbuilt
parameter or inbuilt function in PHP you
don't need to give these parentheses in
case of this echo and let's see if what
how we can use echo in PHP so for
example if you want to echo the value of
this bar so I can just use this echo
like this echo and in the double quotes
you can just pass this name with
including this and symbol okay and and
with semicolon and save this and run it
once again and I can see the main
programming knowledge here right
in a similar way I can print for example
I want to print this value and this
value side-by-side what I can do here is
I can just
use it like this you don't even need to
use these double quotes here and you
just need to use this comma and you can
print these two values side by side by
using separated by this comma also okay
and when I run the program it will give
the result hopefully like this you see
programming knowledge and the value is
200 because we are multiplied our value
by 8 so 25 multiplied by 8 is 200 and
200 will be printed here
okay and in the case of variable if you
want to print only the variable you
don't need to use these double quotes
but if even you use this double quotes
it will not make much of a difference
okay now for example if you want to
print this value in addition with some
your-your-your values for example your
strings you can do it like this echo and
for example you want to give 25 x 8 is
equal to and you want to give this value
right whatever is the value of your
value so you can just write comma and
the value and will give you the result
okay I will just comment these out so
that only the value of diffs will be
printed so I will save it and once I run
this I see this result 25 into 8 is
equal to 200 so this is the value and
this is the string we have print it's
okay so this will be the static value
this is just a string you have we wanted
to print but this is the value actual
value you are printing here right you
can even print
the same thing without using commas so
you can just exclude comma here and you
can just include this inside your double
quotes and the result will be the same
so I will just comment this out save it
and let's refresh our program and the
result is same right so you can use this
value to print like this using comma
separator or you can use it like this
but for example if you want to echo in
something in something using single
quotes for example I will echo the same
value using single quotes single
quotation is just like this not the
double quotation I'll remove these
double quotations then what will happen
whatever you include in single quotes
let's see first of all the result I will
comment this out and save it and once
again run this you only will be able to
see this value that means whatever you
print or whatever you write in single
quote the value of that will be taken
literally literally means whatever you
will include inside your single quote it
will it will be printed as it is it will
not render this variable as the value
200 it will be printed like this but on
the other hand when you use double
quotes your value will be rendered from
here whatever is the value finalized
value of it and it printed so always use
single quote when you want to print
something literally as it is and you can
use double quotes whenever you want to
print the value of the variable or
something like this
so in this way you can use variables and
echo function in your PHP programming I
