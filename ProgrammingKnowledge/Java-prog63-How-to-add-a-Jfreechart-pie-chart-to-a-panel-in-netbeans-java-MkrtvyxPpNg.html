last video I have shown you how to
download the or J free charge library
and how to connect it with your NetBeans
software now today I will start my chart
tutorials JV chart tutorials from the
pie chart so today I will show you how
to make a pie chart from your gibberish
art library so suppose you want to make
a chart in which you have a student and
who scored some marks and you want to
show different marks as a pie chart
components so whenever you click your
button for example you can be able to
see the chart of this tool so I will
name my button as I pie chart and
whenever you click pie chart you will be
able to see your pie chart in which the
student subjects course you will be able
to see so just double click it and go to
the action perform or putting a very
light click go to event action and
action performed and you will directly
go to the action perform of your button
so go there and write our code we have
to write what we have to define data set
on a pie chart usually which will hold
our data so we will write default pie
dr. sect we will name it as I not side
for example is equal to new this one
copy and paste again you notice it and
like this okay and if some error comes
right click and click fix import error
will go because it requires all
libraries to be imported so its input
and after that right
or copy of Pi or descent and paste it
here not set value and in here we'll
write the name whatever name you want to
give so I will give the name welcome to
subject 1 and in the second part you
have to write its value so I will give
its value so what kind of data it is so
in our case we are going to insert
integers in the form of Knox fire right
integer in the bracket right for example
I want to give subject 1 10 score so I
have written that and for example I have
four subjects so I will copy this and
paste it three more times
I have no subject and I will change the
name to
three and four and also change the mouse
code by twenty thirty forty so you have
to write this after that right Jay P
chart whatever you can give name of your
charts will give it claim chart and then
write chart
John Factory
okay Jeffrey chart chart is equal to
chart factory dot will see different
kind of chart here we want create pie
chart so we will click this create pie
chart and it will show different number
of values in here so take the chart
chart is equal to chart what we dot
create pie chart and in the first
bracket I will write the name of my pie
chart so I will write for example pie
chart pie chart and in the second place
I will copy my my child a status at an
institute Yeah right
why not a set and then in here instead
of Route pain check enable I'll write
true true
- three times - and then semicolon
closed and I think I have two important
or every so I will flick fixing boats
and my lamprey is important then after
that you have to write by
not pee
or for example I want to see the pie
chart in the 3d form so i will write 3d
p is equal to in the bracket right bye
not
three the rock to the point chart which
is this chart dot not get plot and then
some recall this is also showing n maybe
this will go after your fix your import
and then write P dot
be in is capital P dot saved foreground
so you can set your foreground I will
set my program foreground as default
whatever comes as default on the top and
I will write chart bring a name is name
my frame s frame is equal to
chart fill and in take a close and I
want to give the name of my frame which
is pie chart for example you can give
any name and fix import once again and
after your name right here comma chart
so this chart we copied here okay after
that we must write frame dot set visible
here true which will show your frame and
you can also define your frame size
frame not set
iNDOT set
sighs you can give the dimension for
example I want to get 450 comma 500 so
it gets show 450 by 500 pie-chart to me
so this is the code for the pie chart
and now let's try to run the program
this is our pie chart button and when I
press this as pie chart should appear +8
and nothing is happening let's see what
is the mistake so let's see the mistake
I have done whatever so I think I have
done the mistake here I am creating the
pie chart and I am declaring it here I
want to see the 3d pension so for
example I want to see the simple pie
junk then I have to delete this thing 3d
delete hit from here and from here also
and I have to hide these P dot set
foreground alpha and I will right click
and fix import once again so this import
will be fixed so what I have done here
is I deleted 3d from here and 3d from
here and I hide this code and now I will
run my program let's see it runs a lot
and when I run it it will show all my
parts of pie chart
okay and in the next tutorial I will
show you how to make a 3d pie chart and
how to show those value we have set we
cannot see the values here only the
subject so I will show you how to do
that please recommend in subscribing by
