gonna show you how to change the look
and feel of your jframe when it's in the
run condition this runs a plane you can
see the look of this is called Nimbus
the NetBeans provide default look for
this jframe and it is called Windham DOS
and when you go to your jframe and
right-click it and go to preview and
here you can see different look and feel
of the same jframe you can change for
example if i click see de mo TI f so
your jfif frame will look like this but
when it's in the run condition or when
you go to preview design and click metal
it will look like this this is different
from Nimbus look once again when you go
to preview and click window also in the
look of your run J frame is changed so
today I am going to show you how to
change this look of your run j frame in
your code so just go to your source code
and you have to go to the bottom of your
code where these J component are defined
and above this there is a default method
which is public static void static void
main in bracket string
AGS it is just above this component
declaration which is a default when you
create a jframe this is default method
created by NetBeans go here and you can
see here look and feel
starting board and here you can see a
little plus symbol of all positive sign
symbol just click it so this code will
open of local field and here you can see
the code for look and feel so by default
or look and field you just provide my
name NetBeans is Nimbus you can change
the look and feel just by changing this
name you can change the look and feel of
your run jframe for example i write it
here Magdala you just have to write this
here instead of nimble Nimbus and just
when we run the program you can see our
run jframe look and feel change to metal
look once again if I want to change this
look into some other you can feel for
example Windows
windows when I run the program it
changes into Windows look and feel
so whatever looks you can see in here in
preview design metal Nimbus CD mo TI F
or Windows classic you can see change
these five looks of your NetBeans change
a window from here so once again I want
to change windows classic look so I will
go to my code and I will just add
classic and then I run my program and
you can see it
the our run jframe locally change to the
look window classic so this is a
tutorial how to change the locality of
your run jframe I hope you enjoyed and
learn something new in the coming video
I will also show apart from these five
looks how to change the look and feel of
your run jframe apart from these five
looks so for that you have to add some
libraries so I will show that in
upcoming videos so I hope you have
enjoyed and please rate comment and
subscribe and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
