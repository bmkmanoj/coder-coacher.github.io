Java fix tutorial for beginners in the
last two videos I have been showing you
how to use line chart in Java FX now in
this video I'm going to show you how you
can handle some event when you click on
these points on your line charts for
example you want to show the value of x
axis and y axis when you click on these
points how you can do it let's see so
I'm going to use the same example which
I have been using in the last two videos
and this was the code so right now our
line chart has only one line which is
using this series okay and I'm using
this series to the line chart using line
chart dot get data dot add all series
okay now after this code inside my
button click method what I'm going to do
is first of all I am going to create a
for loop inside the for loop I'm going
to use final X chart here and then dot
data is going to use these two template
arguments same as your series and name
it as data for example okay and then you
can take your series and then extract
the data from it so just use get data
and this is going to give you the series
data okay now just use this data and
then call our method called get node on
it and then add a event handler to it
okay so event handler it takes two
argument first is event type
so our event type is for example mouse
click event okay so just use mouse event
dot and then choose this mouseclicked
you can choose other you know events
something like mouse enter the mouse
exited or mouse moved but for now I'm
going to use mouse clicked ok and then
as the event handler
you can just write new event handler so
just call this class from here we went
endless search for it down and then add
it and then you have the event here so
this event type is Mouse event right so
just add this mouse event here and then
it's going to give you this error which
will say add unimplemented methods you
just add unimplemented method which is
going to add this handle method to your
code and then you can you know show the
values of the points on a label so let's
create a label first so i will go up
here and i will add a label variable so
FX ml label LBL for example and to this
label we are going to add some text okay
so first add the import for the label
and then use this label here dot set
text and then you can use your data
variable and then call a method called
get x value okay and this is going to
give you your x axis value which is a
string okay so it's perfectly fine here
okay so I will add some you know text
before it for example so here I will
just write X then colon in the double
quotes so just enclose everything in the
double quotes and then the plus symbol
and then once again
this double quotes after this plus and
then I'm going to change the line using
backslash n and then I'm going to just
write Y colon and then the y-axis value
okay but our y-axis value is a number
okay so we need to convert this to a
number so what we can do is we can just
write string dot value off and then here
you can just call data and then call
your get Y value okay just call get Y
value and that's it so now one thing
which remains is we need to add this
label ID to our F XML file so open your
f XML file which is this main dot F XML
file and we are going to add a label
here so just choose a label from the
controls search for this label and you
can resize it and you can even change
the font size but I'm not going to do
this I'm just going to change the FX ID
of it which is label okay
let's even change the font size of this
label okay so no text on the label just
change the font size to for example 24
and let's change the color of it to red
also okay
so now just save everything and then
refresh your project right click and
refresh and then run your project and we
will just click this load chart button
which will load this chart and whenever
I click on some point it is going to
print the value so our x-axis a
the Gen which we have clicked and the
y-axis is 200 you can see so when you
click some other point it will show the
value of these points access a x-axis
and y-axis here okay now for example you
want to give the tool tip same tool tip
when you hover over these points right
so what you can do you can add a tool
tip to your line chart let's see how we
can add a tool tip so go to your code
once again and inside this handle method
this time what we are going to do is
just below the label code we are going
to use a tool tip so just add this tool
tip valuable here and then dot install
so just add this install and it's going
to take to a method one is your node so
node you can get it from this data
variable so data dot get node and the
second is the tool tip okay so just
right here new tool tip and then inside
this constructor you can place the same
line of text which you have given to
your label ok so just copy this text and
paste it here ok and save your code and
run it once again and load your chart
and when I click this point here it's
going to show this value here and when I
hover over this point
it's going to show this tooltip you can
see here in black right so when I hover
over the second point it's going to give
me the second tooltip ok and here just
click it and then it's going to give me
the tooltip right so because I have
added this tooltip inside the mouse
click event so I need to click the mouse
first on the point and then it's going
to give the tooltip if you want to you
know change it you can change it to
Mouse entered or mouse word or any other
event okay so in this way you can add
event to your line chart I hope you
