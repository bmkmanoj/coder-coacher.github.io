video I will show you how to download
and install MongoDB on to your Ubuntu
12.10 operating system so first open
your terminal and in here type W cat
HTTP slash fast d l dot MongoDB dot
o-r-g / linux
MongoDB - Linux - X it is 786 so this is
basically the link to download you can
also download this by directly going to
the website and downloading this version
MongoDB
- Linux - x86 64 ok so like that and
press enter and it will start
downloading MongoDB zip file for you
when your download is complete the next
step is to extract that file so to
extract that file right thar expose at F
and the version which you have
downloaded which is this Mongo Linux -
this one so write this da X the Deaf and
MongoDB zip or tar folder name and press
Enter
it will extract your Phi I'm extracting
the MongoDB file in my home folder so
it's easier to find out so this has
already extracted my file Mongo DB zip
file to my home folder now the next step
is to go in that folder so what I will
do is I will write CD and I want to go
in this folder go in Linux x86 so we
copy it and I see that
CD and that folder MongoDB folder so and
press ENTER and you will go to a MongoDB
folder okay
so before that I think forgot to say one
thing once again I will go back nice
what you see and in my whole folder what
I will do I will make a directory called
pseudo
make slash okay press ENTER loss for
your password and it's already there and
the next step in my data directory which
I have created in this step in the last
step I will make one more folder called
dir so what I will do / / DB okay and
press enter so till now what I have done
is I have downloaded MongoDB s zip file
for Linux from MongoDB site to command
line I have extracted that file into my
home folder I have may made one
directory called data and in data
directly I have made one more directory
called DB now
go to that data folder because it's in
my root folder we'll have to give the
permissions so I will write sudo CH 777
/dr
slash stuff just write that come one and
press Enter okay now the next step is to
go to my Mongo folder which I have
extracted in my home directory which is
this one which I have downloaded in the
first two steps so I will go to the code
directory and then you know I will write
dot slash D to start MongoDB so and I
will press Enter
okay it's not present there so I will go
to pen folder of that MongoDB so type CD
the pen and then press Enter so I have
gone to MongoDB folder and then in
MongoDB folder are going to bin folder
and then I will execute dot slash more
would be command and I will press ENTER
and now what it says cannot execute
binary file why I will describe for
Mammootty except this dot slash
so only MongoDB and I will try to run
this command and yeah so it says that I
have to install this command install
mangodi server in order to start the
Mongo server so it says Mongo is
currently not installed so install
installation installation step is given
here sudo apt-get install Mongo DB so I
will copy it
and I will paste it here and I will
press ENTER which will install MongoDB
server into my system and then I will
press Yes to go further
and it was to install MongoDB so into my
system
so what it do is when you start on
Google to the MongoDB server will start
automatically and you don't need to
start it from separate command so it's
the advantage of this MongoDB server
installation
so my MongoDB server is installed and
now I will start my database so what I
will do is I will open a new terminal
which I have already opened and once
again I will go to
my
Luongo DB folder
which is this
I will copy it to save the time so I
will write CD MongoDB - Linux
- x86 64 version 2.0 point 1 slash bin
so I want to go into MongoDB holder and
then in that body before I go to bin
directory and I will press Enter
and it says
there is no such directory so I think
we did some mistakes and just copy CD
command once again which I
executed earlier pasted here once again
yes it's goes to more DB and then I will
go to been polled CD bin and it goes to
pin and in here you need to execute a
command called go earlier we have
executed Mungo D to start the server and
this time we will execute a command only
Mongo to start the database and press
Enter
ok it cannot execute so I will try to
write once again yes so you can see if
you see this MongoDB shell version and
connected to test it means it has
started your database and you now you
can write your database entries here for
example
tutorial so it has switched to tutorial
okay for example DB tutorial the point
Center and there is nothing in my
tutorial so I can insert new values in
my
database so this was the procedure to
install MongoDB into your Ubuntu 12.10
operating system in future I will also
show how to run Mongo C++ drivers using
Ubuntu operating system in Eclipse so
how you can access Mongo database using
C++ program I will show you in the
future videos so that's it for now
