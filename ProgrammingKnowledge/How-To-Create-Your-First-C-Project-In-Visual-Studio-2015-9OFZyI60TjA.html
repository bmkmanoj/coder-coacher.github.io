show you how you can create your first
C++ project in Visual Studio 2015 so
first of all open up your Visual Studio
and then go to file and then go to new
and then click project and this is going
to create give you this kind of project
wizard right now in here you will be
able to see different kind of templates
on the left hand side and in the
templates you will also find Visual C++
right so just select visual C++ and then
we are going to create the console
application console application means
whenever you are going to compile and
run your a C++ program it's going to
show the result in the console or
command line terminal okay so select
win32 console application and in here
you can give the name to your
application for example CPP project and
the next is the location wherever you
want to save the location if you are not
sure then leave this field as default
and then click OK this is going to
create a new empty C++ project but first
of all it's going to ask you something
so this kind of you know window is going
to pop up whenever you want to create a
C++ project which says welcome to the
win32 application wizard so here you
just need to click Next and here as we
can see that it's going to be a console
application the additional option you
may want to check here is the empty
project so you don't want any of the alt
headers or MFC headers you want to start
from the beginning right so we want a
empty project that's why we need to
select here empty project ok
and then click finish once you click
finish is going to create the project
for you which is going to be empty but
we don't need to worry about it we will
create a new CPP file by ourself so let
the project be created and in here you
can see on the right hand side on the
solution Explorer your project is
created and then there are some folders
here like a header file folder or the
resource file folder or source files
folder so what you need to do is you
need to go to source file so just select
source files and then right click on
source files and then select add and
then select new item or you what you can
do is you can just select your project
itself and then right click on it and
then go to add and then select new item
ok it's going to open the same you know
window and here we need to create the
CPP file and we are going to name our
file as main dot CPP now it's a good
practice whenever you want to create a
small application name your you know CPP
file as a main dot CPP so you know that
this is the main entry point of your C++
program ok so just get the name main dot
CPP and then add this file which is
going to create a file and you can see
here it's automatically going under
source file so this CPP extension means
it's our source file if the file
extension is dot H it's going to go in
the header files right now let's write
some code here let me make the font a
little bit bigger and then first of all
we are going to include iostream right
so just write include
and then include iostream this option
and then we are going to create our bean
function so just write int mean and give
these brackets and in the curly brackets
first of all we are going to return
something so we'll just write return 1
and then above this we will print
something for example hello world so
just write STD colon colon and sea out
and then your message for example hello
world and then we are going to end our
line so just write STD E and DL which
stands for end line okay and then just
save your code and to run your code you
just need to you know press this green
button which is going to compile your
project first of all whenever you are
you know press this green button it's
going to save your program so it's going
to say do you want to save your program
you can just say yes and you can just
build the program so what this is going
to do is it's going to build the program
building means compiling okay so
compiling the program and once it's
compiled it's going to launch your
solution in the terminal so you can see
the terminal is open and then it's gone
as soon as you see hello world right now
in order to you know see this terminal
window constantly you can just right
here for example STD and then call C
input dot gap okay so what this is going
to do is it's going to wait for the
input from the user and which in turn is
going to you know allow you to see the
terminal and
going not to disappear right and once
again just press this button which is
going to compile or build your you know
application once again and it's going to
launch it right
and you can see hello world is printed
and as soon as you give any input or
press any key it's going to disappear
the terminal right so in this way you
can create your first C++ project in
Visual Studio 2015 I hope you enjoyed
