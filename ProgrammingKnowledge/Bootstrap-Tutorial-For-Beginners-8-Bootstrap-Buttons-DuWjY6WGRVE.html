bootstrap tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how to use
Jumbotron in bootstrap now in this video
we will see how to use and create
different kind of buttons in bootstrap
so let's get started I will go to my
index dot HTML code and in the last
video I have written this div in which I
have imported this class called
container right and inside this
container I have created this Jumbotron
Atlas and some content inside the
Jumbotron ok so what I'm going to do is
inside my container which I've created
in the last video and below my Jumbotron
I will create some div element which
will contain some buttons so let's
create a dev element first div and it's
going to import a class called page
header ok page header now inside my div
element I will just include h1 tag and I
will just include the button text and
now just below my page header tag or div
tag I will create a for example
paragraph tag here and inside my
paragraph tag I will create some buttons
so to create buttons we need to include
this button element and then we need to
specify the type of button we want to
create so type is equal to button right
and then we will create a class or we
will import a class which is called BTN
and then BT and - default okay and now I
will close my button tag and in here you
can also give some text so
once you do this I'm going to save my
index dot HTML file and I'm going to run
it in Firefox for example and you can
see the default button looks like this
okay so to add button we need to add
this element called button and type is
equal to button and then comes the class
button and right now we have created
default button but there are different
kind of buttons you can create in
bootstrap for example primary button
success info or warning or danger or
link button so we are going to see how
we can create all and we are also going
to see how we can create a different
size of buttons so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to paste the same line I
think seven times so one two three four
five six and seven
right and the second button type is
instead of default you can use primary
so primary and I will write here also
primary third button type is success
okay so I will just write success here
fourth button type is info so info and
here also in for fifth button type is
warning warning and here also warning
and sixth button type is danger danger
and the last button type is link so link
now I'm going to save my page once again
and I'm going to refresh my web page and
let's see what happens so now you can
see different kind of button and
different colors so default button is
our default without any color and
primary button is this dark blue color
here and success button looks like this
it this is info button next to this
warning danger and this is our link okay
now this is the standard size of button
in bootstrap now if you want to have a
different size of button for example
little bit larger than this button or
little bit smaller than this button then
what we need to do what I'm going to do
is I'm going to copy all these button
including my paragraph tag here and just
paste it below once again okay
and to this button element and to this
class we just need to add one more
attribute which we call it as bt n minus
L G okay and LG is for large button okay
so I will do the same for every button
here
BTN LG bt n LG and for all buttons okay
and I will save my code and refresh my
page and you can see some large buttons
are displayed now so these are the
default size buttons and these are the
large size buttons now if you want a
small size button what we can do here is
I'm going to just copy this paragraph
tag including the button once again and
paste it here and this time instead of
BTN LG I want to include BTN SM and SM
stand for small so I will
to include small SM for every button
SM SM Anson okay and when i refresh my
page I can see small buttons here right
so default large and small now if you
want extra small buttons you have one
more class for extra small so I will
copy these once again and paste it below
and instead of SM I will just say XS
okay so it's extra small so I will just
include XS everywhere and here and I
will save it and refresh my page and I
can see extra small buttons like this
okay so these are the four standard
sized buttons in bootstrap you can use
default size large small and extra small
okay now if you want to add some buttons
to your Jumbotron you can do it easily
you just need to have one type of button
for example I will copy these two type
of button and inside my Jumbotron div in
here just below my paragraph tag I can
add these two button elements one is
primary and one is success for example
save it and refresh it and you can see
inside the Jumbotron I have these two
buttons primary and success you can edit
your own text here any text you can
write for example I will say for primary
I will say click me and for success I
will say thank you for example okay save
it
refresh it once again and text is change
click me and thank you so in this way
you can add buttons to your bootstrap
page I hope you have enjoyed this video
