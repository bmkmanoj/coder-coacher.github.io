show you how you can install Windows 8
or Windows 8.1 operating system on
VirtualBox I am using Ubuntu operating
system as my host for VirtualBox but the
procedure will be same if you are using
Windows or Mac OS as a host for
VirtualBox so one important thing you
need to have for installing Windows 8.1
is obviously the windows 8.1 iso file or
installation file and this you can
download for free if you want to
evaluate Windows 8.1 Windows 8 you can
download it for free from windows side I
will give you a link for the video in
which I have shown you how you can
download windows 8.1 or Windows it 8 for
evaluation for 90 days for free so just
click that link and you can download the
windows 8.1 for free for 90 days you can
use it for 90 days and then you will you
need to buy it or register that windows
to Microsoft so let us see how we can
install that iso file which you have
downloaded in VirtualBox so what I am
going to is I am going to click this new
and in here I will choose the name for
my windows so I will name my windows as
windows 8.1 and in here you can you can
see it has automatically recognized that
I want the version windows 8.1 and it is
the type Microsoft Windows if you do not
see windows 8.1 64-bit here you can just
click this combo box and you can choose
for Windows 8.1 or whatever version of
Windows you have and you can you also
need to choose the bit of version or bit
of the version you have download in I
have downloaded 64-bit version of
Windows 8.1 so I will select 64-bit and
click Next and in here it will show the
memory size you need to give to install
Windows 8 I will leave it as default and
I will go further next and this will be
the same create virtual hard drive yes I
want to create it so I will click create
and I want to use VDI which is
VirtualBox disk image click Next and I
want to allocate dynamically allocated
hard drive physical hard drive click
Next and in here you can allocate hard
drive or hard drive size which you want
to allocate to your operating system by
default it is 25 gb so I will leave it
as default but you can increase it on
the basis of the I mean hard drive which
is available on your system and I will
say create once I say create it will
create a virtual machine for me but I
haven't given any ISO file or
installation file to this virtual
machine which I have created right now
right so once you have created your
virtual machine you need to select this
and go to the settings
and in here go to systems and go to
processor and you can choose the
processors for your operating system so
by default it is one but you can
increase it to two or depending upon the
processor in your computer you can
increase it also so I would like to have
two processors for this and I will click
OK and now I will just select my virtual
machine I can either right click and
click start or I can select this Windows
virtual machine and click this start
button
and once it starts it asks for the ISO
file which it needs so for the
installation of Windows 8.1 so just
click this small button here and choose
the path of the ISO file you have
downloaded for Windows 8.1 so click that
file click open and click start button
generally the installation of Windows
8.1 or Windows 8 takes about 30 minutes
on VirtualBox it depends upon the you
know how fast your computer works also
but generally it takes about half and
also you need to mean give half an hour
to install this eight one one one year
system so you can see the installation
has started now
adil take some time to start
and now the windows setup so in here you
can select the language you want to
install select the time and you can even
select the key board for your
installation right so in here if you
want to change the keyboard layout or
you want to change the language you can
do it here okay so just say click these
combo boxes and choose your language and
choose your timezone and choose the
keyboard layout for example I have the
German keyboard layout so I can choose
it from here this one and I can click
Next but if you have a u.s. keyboard
layout just leave it as default okay and
click Next and just click install now
now the setup is starting
and it says
you need to accept this license license
in order to install windows 8.1
enterprise I will accept the license
terms and click Next and in here you
have two options upgrade windows and
keep I'll setting an application or
custom install ok so by default it's
this one but you can choose this one
also I will just select this this for
this option here so if you are running
this virtual machine on Windows just
click this option or I am going to
choose this custom install windows so
install windows only advanced custom
option just like this and in here you
can you know give the partition to your
Windows operating system or do the sums
advanced of what I will leave it as
default because it's my virtual machine
so I will click Next
and it says copying windows file getting
file ready for installation
so it will finish these steps one by one
I will pause the video for the finishing
of these stamps and I will I mean
restart the video once any important
step comes while the installing okay
so after installing those features it
this VirtualBox prompt me to or Windows
installation told me to restart the
system so don't press any key even if it
says you need to press some key so don't
press any key in order to I mean restart
or reboot otherwise it will start your
installation once again so even if it
asks that you need to press any key do
not press any key while installing this
operating system Windows operating
system let it do its work and you will
be good to go
ok
so now the process is in the way I will
pause the video and wait for the next
step and right now it's getting ready
for installation you can see here
sixty-eight percent eighty seven and one
hundred percent
getting ready
so it takes time to you know complete
the installation so if you are doing
some work just do your stop and come
back and see if it's still working or
not okay so I will just pause the video
and I will inform you if any important
step occurs so right now it's rebooting
as I have told you do not press any key
while your installation is going on
right so it's doing its stop here
and once that installation is complete
then it will ask for the PC name you
need to give so in here you need to give
the PC name whatever PC name you want to
give to your Windows operating system I
will give the PC name for example
programming knowledge and I will press
Enter
it says it is too long so let's say I
will give the name user for example and
press Enter
and these are the settings from the
Microsoft
so we will go further
there's a privacy statement here and
some information about this okay
once you have read all these condition
and privacy statement you can just
scroll this down a little so scroll down
and just click use Express setting you
can customize your system also but for
now I am using use Express setting here

set your account so you can give your
account or you can just click Next if
you do not want to do this so give your
account here so I will give my account
and give the password for the account
and I will click Next here so once you
have given your Microsoft account here
it will ask you to give your email or
email ID once again so I will give it
once again and click Next here or
otherwise if you don't have your
Microsoft account or if you don't want
to log in or log in with your Microsoft
account what you can do is you can go
back here and in here just once again
click use Express settings and in here
you can just click create new account
instead of giving your Microsoft
accounts or or instead of signing in
with your Microsoft account if you do
not want to do this you can just create
a new account just click the Create new
account and in here you need to give
your account details right I will go
back
and once again I will choose create new
account and in here and we give the
first name for example whatever is your
name so for example programming
knowledge and your address I was trying
to skip this for now but let us see what
happens I am NOT giving my email address
for now and create a password so I will
give a password which is which will be
at least 8 characters so I will give my
password
and reenter the password
and country I will choose it as United
States you can choose wherever you live
or you if you want to change to your
country you can change it I will leave
it as default and click Next and this
information is required so you need to
give this outlook information so I want
to give my email ID for example

outlook calm so this is the email which
I'm providing night now I want to create
this email account for me I will click
Next and you can give the date of birth
and gender country code phone number
there are so many things here so you
need to give all of these so once you
have created your account if you do not
have your account then it will confirm
your account verification and then go
for them
and once I have done that it is saying
this this service isn't available now so
it is not my fault what I can do is I
can create a local account for now so I
will say create a local account and once
again I will give my username so I will
give my username
I will give a simple username for
example user and the password
we enter the password
and
password hint I will say my name for
example and I will finish and it says
choose the different username it isn't
the same as space PC name so I will
change it as
programming knowledge and click finish
and now it says hi
we are setting things for you
and it's starting
so I will wait for this and in the next
step I will restart the video once again
and now it is saying let's start and the
installation is complete you can see
here the start menu and once again you
can go to the desktop from here so now
the installation is complete
one more thing what you can do is you
can just go to the machine or yeah so in
here you can see whatever hardware
device of webcam or you can see whatever
hardware devices are connected right now

setting for that or even if you want to
go in whole screen mode you can just go

saying some information I will say
switch and it goes to full screen mode
now okay and right now I am the full
screen mode
