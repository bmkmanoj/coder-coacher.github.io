program which I am made in Java NetBeans
IDE or my software engineering project
this is the initial window which shows
login screen so you can see when I
entered the login ID and password
and I should select the level and select
an admin level and press login button it
shows username is correct and when I
press ok it goes or opens another window

average values here so we can see a time
when you average value now you go to the
marks table here it shows the data
you've chosen between all two three and
between this date and this date and
pressure one so it will show the data

but will do so this window
and you can log out so this is my first

have enjoyed I will post the new videos
which illustrate how I made this project
step-by-step so should be able to learn
it
