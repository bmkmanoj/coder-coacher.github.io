last video I have shown you how to take
the sum of your all the lows of one
column in this video I will show you how
to count all the rows in your database
or in your table so for example I have
15 rows which I can see from here but in
some cases you don't have these IDs in
sequence and you have hundreds or
thousands of values and if you need to
count all the rows of your database
table how you can do this I will show
you today for this I will use this text
field to show the result and this button
when I press the result should be shown
here in my text field so in case you
haven't taken them just take them and
then I will go to my button action
perform method and this is the code from
last video I will just make a small
correction in this and you could be able
to see the number of rows so go to your
SQL query which you have written in the
last video and instead of sum you will
write
count and I can hear also where you have
called all you have taken your some of
your ages in terms of some you will
write count so this will count all of
your age rows and this will place it
into this variable and this variable
will be shown in our text field like
this so this is the small change you
need to do in the last code instead of
some just replace it bias count and now
when you run the program and you
couldn't be able to see this program and
now when I press this button you can see
number of rows this you can verify it
from here we have 15 zeros and in here
gives the result so I hope you've
learned something new and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
