you how you can download and install SBT
or Scala build tool on your Windows
operating system
installing SBT is a two-step process
first of all you need to install java on
your system and then we will be able to
install SBT on our system and if you
have installed SBT on your system you
will be able to create and maintain
Scala project on your Windows 10
operating system you don't need to
install Scala separately if you already
have SBT so let's get started so first
of all you just need to open your
favorite browser and search for Java JDK
and then the first link which will
appear here will be from Oracle comm so
just click that link and once you are in
the Oracle website you will be able to
see this kind of webpage and here you
can see it says Java SE development kit
8 downloads now you just need to scroll
down and first of all you just need to
accept license agreement so you just
need to check this radio button so just
select this radio button first of all
and once you accept license agreement we
will be able to download the executable
file for Windows for JDK right so in our
case we will be downloading the
executable for Windows x64 which is a
64-bit operating system so this is the
last option so I'm going to select this
last option which is for Windows x64 and
it's an executable file so I'm going to
just click on this Exe file which is
going to start the download right so I
have already downloaded this executable
file so I'm going to just cancel this
download for now and I will directly go
to the location where I have downloaded
this and let me niece the browser also
and it's an executable file so you just
need to double click on it and first of
all you will be able
to see this kind of user account control
warning you just need to click yes here
and I'm going to minimize this window
and now you will be able to see this
kind of installation wizard you don't
need to do much here you just need to
click Next and leave everything as
default and note this location this is
important so this will be installed in
your C folder and inside your C folder
it will be installed in the Program
Files and then there will be a Java
folder created and then Java JDK folder
will be created so this will be the
default location leave it as default I'm
going to just click Next and now the
installation of Java will start by the
way let me show you how you can check
whether Java is already installed on
your system or not so for that you can
right click on this window icon here so
right click and then open the command
prompt and once the command prompt is
open you can just type Java C here and
then press ENTER and if it says Java C
is not very recognized as an internal or
external command that means Java is most
probably not installed on your system
right so for now I'm going to close this
terminal and we will check it again once
this installation is finished and now
you will be able to see this kind of
window which says destination folder as
we have already discussed earlier if you
don't have any good reason to change the
location of the JRE just leave it as
default and then click Next and wait for
the installation to complete and now I
can see this message which says Java SE
development kit 8 update successfully
installed that means Java is already
installed on my system and now I just
need to you know set the environment
variables for Java and JRE and also the
Java home and then I will install the
SBT so I'm going to click this close
button and now I will right click on
this windows button once again and this
time I will
just select control panel and let's see
where Java is installed so just open the
folder Explorer also and then click on
my PC or this PC and then go to the C
directory here and inside the C
directory we will just browse to the
Program Files and here you will be able
to see Java folder and here you will be
able to see these two folders one is for
JDK and honor is for JRE
ok so I'm going to just minimize this
for now and in your control panel
you just need to select the system and
security so just select this option with
say system and security and then select
this option with say system and once
system opens on the left-hand side you
will be able to see advanced system
settings so just click this option which
says advanced system settings and then
once this advanced system settings opens
here you just need to go to this option
which says environment variables and
under environment variables we are going
to go to the system variables first of
all and then we will select the path
variable so just search for path
variable you can see on the left hand
side path is written and then either
double click on it or you can just click
Add it also okay so I'm going to click
add it on the path variable now we will
just open the folder where Java is
installed so go to the JDK folder first
of all inside your Java folder and then
go to the bin folder and then just copy
this part the whole path and then just
create new so in your environment
variable just press new and then paste
this part and then press Enter and same
we will do for the GRE folder so go back
to the Java folder once again and then
this time go to the JRE folder and then
bin folder and then copy this path up to
bin and then create new and then paste
the
part of the GRE okay so we have pasted
the part of JDK bin folder and GRE bin
folder now click OK which is going to
set the environment variable and now we
are going to set the Java home
environment variable so for the Java
home environment variable we will set it
in the user variable at the top okay
so under this section just click new and
then just write capital Java underscore
home
so everything in capital and Java and
home are separated by this underscore
and now open the folder once again Java
and this time you just need to select
the JDK folder and then up to JDK folder
path you just need to copy this so you
don't need to go to the bin folder at
this time for the JDK you just go to the
JDK folder copy this path from the top
and then paste it there in your variable
value for the Java home so variable name
Java home variable value is the folder
path up to Java JDK and then click OK
and then click OK and then click OK and
you can close this window now once again
we are going to go to the windows button
here and right click on it and once
again we are going to open the command
prompt here so just click command prompt
which is going to open the command
prompt and in here you just need to
write Java C once again so Java C
together and then press enter and now
you can see there is a big list of
commands which are printed here and it
says usage Java C options and source
files so Java C command is used to
compile the Java source files so it's
showing us the correct usage of Java C
so that means Java is already installed
on our system and now we just need
to install the SBT so let's go to the
browser once again and this time search
for Scala download and the first link
which will appear here will be this
website called Scala - Lang dot o-r-g
forward slash download so just click
this link and we are in the download
section of the Scala Lang dot o RG
website so just scroll a little down and
in here you will be able to see these
options these two option to install
Scala right so you can see the first
step is to install Java JDK which we
have already done right and then the
next step is to install Scala there are
two ways of installing Scala on the
official website of Scala one is to
download IntelliJ if you are a fan of I
DES and other is to download SBT if you
are comfortable with command-line tools
right so we are going to choose this
option which is the second option so
just click download SBT and this will
redirect us to the SBT website so Scala
- SBT dot o-r-g /downloads right and
then there is a Windows MSI file to
download here so you can see windows and
under that there is a red button here it
says SBT 1.0.1
dot MSI we will download this file which
is a MSI file which is a installable
file and once this download is complete
we are going to install it so now the
MSI file is downloaded so I am going to
double click on this MSI file and I'm
going to minimize the browser and first
of all I will be able to see this kind
of setup window so I will click Next
here and I will just accept the terms
and conditions and click Next now I will
see this window and here I can see the
path where SBT will be installed so this
is the default location so I don't
the good reason to change it so I will
leave it as default and I'm going to
click Next
once again and then I'm going to click
install and now SBT is installed on my
system so I'm going to just click finish
here and now I will browse to a folder
where SBT is installed so I will go to
the C directory and in the C directory
go to Program Files x86 and here you
will be able to see this SBT folder and
inside the SBT folder there are three
folders we want to go inside the bin
folder and then we want to just copy
this path and set as an environment
variable okay so just go inside the SPD
folder and in the SBT just open the bin
folder okay and once again I'm going to
right-click on the window option here
and then click the control panel and
once the control panel is open I'm going
to go to the system and just click
system here and then click advanced
system settings once again and then once
again go to the environment variables
and once again just double click on this
path variable and just paste this path
if it's already not there okay so by
default this installer is supposed to
you know set your environment variable
so I can see directly this environment
variable already set here but if it
doesn't set this environment variable
you just need to create new one and
paste the bin folder path for SBT
so in my case it's already there so I'm
going to just click OK okay and I'm
going to just close everything ok so let
me close everything and now I'm ready to
create my first scholar project using
SBT so for that I'm going to once again
open the command prompt and now in the
command prompt I'm going to just create
a folder in which I want to you know
create this
SBT project so in here I'm going to
create a folder you can create a folder
using mkdir command so I'm just going to
write NK dir for example SBT or Scala
samples for example so I'm going to just
write Scala samples and then press ENTER
and once I do this I can see the same
folder in my folder Explorer also so
here in my C directory so I'm going to
go to my C directory and inside my C
directory I'll go to the users and
whatever your username is and I can see
this Scala sample directory is created
so you can either just copy this path
and CD to this part so I can just do
this also CD and that path where this
directory is created or you can CD
directly to this scala samples right now
once you reach to the scala samples
directory you just need to create a
project folder here so I'm going to just
write s bt p roj for SBT project and
before this i'm going to just write
mkdir and then space okay
which is going to create a directory
called SBT projects for me okay and then
i'm going to do CD SBT projects so as PT
p roj okay so once you are in SBT
project trajectory you will be able to
verify it from here also so you can see
under SBT samples I have SBT projects
directory and here I will create my
first scala project using SBT now even
though my project directory is empty I
can give this s BD command so I'm going
to just give SPD command and then press
Enter and for the first time it's going
to take some time to download the
necessary files and directories you can
see it's downloading necessary files and
directories related to our Scala project
SBT also compiles your current project
if it's already there but
in our case there is no project so it's
just going to download the necessary
files related to SBT installation so now
the downloading of the necessary files
for SBT is finished and now our
installation for the SBT is also
finished and now you will be able to see
this kind of command prompt and this
means that we are ready to work with
Scala and SBT on our Windows operating
system so for now I'm going to just exit
this command prompt and in the next
video I'm going to show you how you can
use SBT in more detail just give exit
and then press ENTER and you will come
out of this SBT command wrong so this is
how you can install SPT and Scala on
your Windows 10 operating system I hope
