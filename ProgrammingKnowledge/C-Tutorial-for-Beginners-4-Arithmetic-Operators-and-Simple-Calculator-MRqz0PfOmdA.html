teach you about basic arithmetic
operatives in c-sharp so they are
commonly five or thematic operator we
use in c-sharp
which are plus minus multiplication for
multiplication we use Astrix or the star
symbol division for division we use this
slash symbol and for showing the
remainder we use this modulus symbol so
for example I will take an example of a
simple calculator for which we are going
to take two values and we want the
addition subtraction multiplication and
division of those two numbers and we
want to show this the result on the
screen so how can we do it so what I'm
going to do is I will declare two number
so these are the number in num1 and num2
which holds the two numbers which user
will give okay now I will declare three
more integers which will hold the result
of addition subtraction and
multiplication and this data type is int
I will declare one more variable called
division which will hold the result of
division of those two numbers and this
third type I have taken float because
when you divide two numbers the result
can be a float value right so I have
taken this a float now what I have done
is I am asking the user to input the
first number so I will write console dot
right enter first number and in my first
number variable which is num1 i am
reading the value which is entered by
the user so I will say num 1 is equal to
got to in 32 because we are reading the
line and this is a string
whenever user enters something it's a
string and we need to convert it to the
integer that is why we are using convert
to int so this is this line of code will
take a string from the user because we
are reading the read line and it will
convert it to the integer and then
assign it to this dumb one similarly I
am doing the same for the second number
I am asking the user to enter the second
number and whatever you was a enter I
will put it into the second number so
this code I will provide the link below
you will be able to find this code so
don't worry you will you can directly
copy this code and test it on your
visual studio C shop project so after
entering the two numbers what I am going
to do is I will take a add a variable
which I have declared here and in this
add variable I am saving the addition of
two numbers how you do the addition why
by using this plus for a thematic
operator write in a similar way I'm
saving the subtraction of this two
number by using this - automatic
operator so number book number one -
number two now in for multiplication I
am using this asterisk symbol to
multiply these two numbers and for
division I'm using slash symbol to
divide these two numbers but notice when
I will divide the number by a second
number it will not give you the
remainder or it will not give you the
decimal points because there is a
special quality in this slash symbol
it only gives you the whole values which
you which is a multiple it will not give
you the remainder or it will not give
you the decimal value so I will also
show you how you can show the result in
decimal but first let's see the result
of this so this is the interesting part
of this code and we will be watching
this in detail now what I am going to do
is next is I am just printing the result
addition so I will show the add
subtraction I will show it in sub sub
multiplication I will I'm printing
multiplication and the division I am
printing division ok so this is the code
I have now let's try and run this code
so the program ask us to enter the first
number for example I will enter 23 as a
first number and now user ask or program
ask us to enter the second number I
enter 4 as a second number and when I
press enter you will get the result so
the result is addition is 27 yes
23 plus 4 is 27 the subtraction is 90 so
23 minus 4 is 19 a multiplication is 92
23 x 4 is 93 this is correct but see
here the division is 5 it's giving us 5
so it's giving the multiple of 23 so 4
times 5 is 20 and the remainder is 3
here which cannot be divided further
right so it's only showing whatever it
can multiply and in the remainder it's
not showing so that's why it's showing
the rim this value now to show the
remainder what you can do is I can add
one more line here
remainder and I can add one more
variable here in the int variable I will
write REM and now for this I will write
here after this division I will use
remainder is equal to num 1 mod num2
okay so now i will just copy this and
paste it here and now when i run the
program i will give the same two numbers
23 and 4 and you can see here when you
divide 23 by 4 you get will get the
remainder here so by using this modulus
symbol you can show the remainder and
the full multiplet multiple of 4 you can
give by this slash symbol now for
example you may need the float value or
the exact value you want to show when
you want to divide two numbers so what
you can do is you can add this float
here and what this bracket float means
is it's called a caste operator
typecasting operator and what it will do
is whatever is the result of the
division of this number that will
convert that into the float and then it
will assign it to your divide variable
and this divide variable is a float
right we have declared it as a float so
now what will this code will do is it
will divide these two numbers and the
result is a float right so the it will
convert this division to upload by this
typecast operator
what is a typecast operator in the
brackets you would just give the
datatype you are expecting so this is
the typecast operator we are expecting
float here and now when we run the
program and we will give the same
numbers once again 23 before and now you
can see the exact division 5.75 when you
multiply or when you divide 23 by 4 the
exact value or exact division is 5.75 by
typecast operator you can show the exact
value or but when you remove this type
of operator it will give you only the
multiple and not not the remainder right
so this is a little trick to convert
your division to a decimal point of
floating point so these are the basic
operator we use in C shop not the basic
operator but it's called arithmetic
operation to be specific so these are
the basic arithmetic operators in C shop
