JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see how to use for
loop in Java Script in the last video we
have seen how to use while loop and
do-while loop in JavaScript so for loop
is also a kind of loop which you can use
to execute your piece of code again and
again right so let's see what is the
basic syntax of for loop and then we
will see why for loop is convenient and
how it's used okay so in here you just
need to use a for keyword and inside
these round brackets comes three
statements which I'm going to tell you
in a moment and then in the curly braces
comes your code okay now in here comes
three statements which are separated by
these semicolons right the first
statement which comes here is the
initialization of a variable so if you
remember in the last video when we have
seen this while loop we have initialized
the value of a is equal to zero here
right at the top and for loop allows you
to initialize your variables inside this
bracket okay so for example you want to
initialize a instead of here you want to
initialize it here then you can do it
with the help of for loop right then
second statement comes here is the
condition which is same as this
condition which you have given in the
while loop so second statement is the
condition which you want to satisfy okay
and third statement is the increment or
decrement with whatever you want so for
example in the while loop we have to do
this increment inside the while loop
but in the for-loop it allows you to
increment this value of a for example in
these bracket itself okay so the for
loop allows you to initialize your
variable compare your variable and
increment your variable in a single line
right so this is really convenient when
you want to iterate over some array for
example right and let's say we want to
just print the same result here okay and
I will just comment this code for the
while loop and save my code and refresh
my webpage and it prints 0 to 10 right
so in a lesser number of lines we have
performed the same functionality as we
have done in the while loop okay so this
you can do here as a third statement
this comparison you can do here as a
second statement and this initialization
you can do here as a first statement
okay now it's not necessary that you
need to initialize something here you
can initialize the value of a here and
it's totally fine and you can leave this
first statement as blank also and when
you refresh your page the result will be
same okay or you can initialize the
value of result so for example you want
to initialize the value of result
instead of a you can just do something
like this here so you initialize the
value of result here and then you just
refresh your webpage and the result will
be same also okay so you can initialize
the value of a here and for example you
want to initialize the value of result
also you can do with a comma separator
okay so you initialized a comma
initialize the second value and then
after the semicolon comes your condition
so if you want to initialize multiple
values
you can do it separated by comma okay so
the save your code and refresh it and
result is same now for example I have an
array called names here and I want to
print the value of all the array one by
one what I can do here is I can leave
this a as it is and result also as a
test so initialization is fine here but
as a condition where we can give here a
is less than the length of names so
names dot length okay and this will give
you the slant of this array right and
then you can increment the value by one
and in here if you want to print the
names what we can do here is we can use
the index property of array using this a
so just write a and in the square
bracket you just pass a okay because a
is initially 0 and it will increment one
by one in the for loop so it will
iterate over each index one by one and
it will print the names right so save
your code and refresh our page and you
can see all the names are printed one by
one here now there is one more alternate
way of using for loop and that's called
for in loop and the syntax of that loop
is you just use keyword for and then you
use your variable for example you have
declared a variable var X for example
right and then you just transfer here X
and then in and then you can iterate
over some object now object in
JavaScript looks something like this so
it will look something like a jason
which has associative property so for
example i declare an object called
student and it has some properties like
name surname and
age and we can give the value of name
something like this surname something
like this and it's something like this
in the curly braces okay so this is
called an object in JavaScript so you
can iterate over this student object
something like this so you just write X
in student and what it will do is it
will iterate over every element in this
object for a first name and then second
surname and third age and then it will
transfer the value in here as X okay and
then you can do the same so I will just
pass this result here and I'm going to
comment this for loop for now and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
take the student and pass it here and
don't forget to give the value of X here
inside the square brackets and save your
code and refresh your webpage and now it
gives the name surname and age as the
value right so in here what you are
doing you are iterating over the object
and this will give you the value of each
object so first it will give you the
value of name then it will give you the
value of surname and then it will give
you the value of the age okay so in this
way you can use for loop in JavaScript I
