Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use FL statements in Scala
now if else can be used as statements
and expressions in Scala lets see the
first way of using a Fell's as statement
and then we will see how we can use F
else as expressions so first of all what
is if condition or if statement so if
that meant allows us to evaluate a
boolean expression and based upon the
result of this expression whether it's
true or false
we execute some statements so let me
show you an example so let's say I
declare a well X is equal to 20 here and
then I want to evaluate if X is 20 or
not right so I just use if and as you
have seen in Java or any other normal
language you use if keyboard and then
you just use your variable and evaluate
it so for example I evaluate this
condition which is X is equal to 20 or
not so for equality we use double equals
so for equality we use double equals and
then for assignment we use single equals
so if you do single equal here that
means the assignment of 20 to X which is
not a boolean condition right so you can
just use double equals 2 to check
equality right so you can just write
this kind of if statement and when this
statement is true which is true in our
case we can for example execute some
statement for example print line right
and then let's say we can just print
here in double quotes that X is equal to
20 if X is not equal to 20 we can use
else condition else is just like if the
condition F is not true then else
statement will be executed right so I'm
going to just copy this and paste it
here and in this case I'm going to just
write X is not equal to
20 let's run our code and let's see the
result so in this case X is equal to 20
which is true condition in our case now
let's say we want to assign the result
into some variables so I'm going to
declare a variable var and then ress is
the variable name and I'm going to just
assign empty string to this response
variable now when X is equal to 20 I
will just assign for example this string
to response variable X is equal to 20
and if X is not equal to 20 I can just
write response is equal to X not equal
to 28 and I'm going to remove these
print lines instead of these print lines
I will just use one print line here and
here I will just print the value of
response variable okay so let's run the
code and let's see what happens and it
prints X is equal to 20 so normally you
have seen in the other languages also if
you want to assign some value using if
statement you can do it like this for
example
but Scala allows us to store this value
directly using if expressions so let's
see what are if expressions so what I
can do here is I can just do Val
variable and I will just write R es2 for
response 2 and I can just evaluate the
same if using an expression so how we
can do it we can just write X is equal
to 20 and we can just write for example
X is equal to 20 and then we can write
else here and then we can write X is not
equal to 20 so X is not equal to 20 and
this is valid in Scala so what is
happening here so we are evaluating the
condition here and if the condition is
true it's going to return this value
which we have written after if condition
right so this will be returned so the
value
of result to will be X is equal to 20
otherwise if the statement is not true
then the value of result 2 will be X is
not equal to 20 so let's check for non
equality let's say like this okay once
again I'm going to just print line the
result 2 so I'm going to just write our
es 2 for example and then run the code
and you can see this time first of all
it prints X is you'll do 20 which is due
to this line of code and in the next
line it prints X is not equal to 20
which is using this if expression now if
you want to format your code in eclipse
you can just press control shift F and
your code will be formatted so what are
the advantage of this if expression you
are directly assigning the result into
this variable which is constant right in
the case of statement you need to
declare a variable which is not a
constant value and then you are
reassigning the values in this response
variable which is sometimes not useful
now if you want to directly print this
response you can do something like this
also so you can just write print line
and then using the if expression you can
just write this code also so I'm going
to just remove this line and you can
lightly print the result of if using
this print line because it's an
expression so it will return the result
right and the result is passed to the
print line argument and then it will
print the result so let's run the code
once again and result will be same so
you can directly print line the result
of if-else statement and the result will
be printed now as in other languages you
can use for example greater than
expressions also for example access
greater than or equal to 20 we can check
or X is less than or equal to 20 we can
evaluate this condition also
and you can nest these a false condition
so you can use if condition inside RF
condition or if condition or if-else
condition inside as conditions also
easily as you may have seen in the other
languages you can also use and and or
operators in Scala for example I will
declare one more variable Y here is
equal to 30 and I can just evaluate it
like this so X if X is equal to 20 and
so and can be written in this way double
and symbols and then Y is equal to 30
then we can print some values so for
example here I can just write and y
equal to 30 right and save the code and
run the code and it will evaluate and it
will print the result
so you can use and operator like this
and then our operators also write so and
will evaluate the both conditions so
when both conditions are true in the if
statement so X is equal to and Y is
equal to 30 is true in this expression
then only this will be printed if one of
the condition is false then the else
statement will be executed but when you
are using or with these double pipes
then if will evaluate for only one
condition to be true if one condition
from these two condition is true then
this if statement can be executed
otherwise the else statement will be
executed for example I will just say Y
is greater than 30 which is not true in
our case but one condition is true and
I'm going to run the code and you can
see still it goes into the if condition
right and if the both conditions will be
false for example I will check X is less
than 20 and Y is greater than 30 which
is false in both the condition then only
the else will be executed which is X is
not equal to 20 for example or you can
print
anything here so this is how you can use
if-else statements and expressions in
