video I will show you how to use
date/time picker with your visual C++
windows form application so the
date/time picker
usually look like this so you should be
able to pick the date and the time you
can also choose specific date or
specific year also and also you can also
choose the time but I am using right now
the custom date time so I am just
showing the date in a certain format
also so if you are following these
videos you have seen how I'm inserting
or saving my data into my my SQL
database so this is the new addition to
it so for example till now I have been
adding employee ID name last name age
and his gender to the database and this
time I want to add the date of birth of
the employee also so I will show you two
things in this video first of all how to
use this date/time picker and how to
save your date of birth of employee into
the database so now let's see how we can
do this
so if you go into the toolbar a
date/time picker by default he looks
like this it's a big vomit so it shows
the current day of week then the date
month and the year so you can save this
like that also and if you are using this
date time pickup for other applications
you can give this format also but there
are some properties you can change in
your date time picker so for example
when you select the state time picker
and go to the properties of this you can
see you can set the default value from
here you can set the maximum date and
minimum date from here also and the most
important thing is you can give a custom
format to your date it's for example I
want to show a date in the format DD -
so first to D D stands for date small D
then - then capital double M stand for
month and these four
years so now when you enter this custom
format and
go below and just go to the format and
you have to check or select custom
format then only your format in your
date time picker will change and you can
see it comes in the form of the month
and Dia now the problem with MySQL is it
saves the date in a certain format which
is here than month and then the date so
we need to change our form it in that
form so we'll change the format once
again yeah
then month and then the day so my if you
are using MySQL specifically you need to
choose this format your month and date
this is what I have done in this date
time picker okay so I'm going to delete
this because I don't need it and now it
looks like this now what you need to do
in order to save this date time picker
into the database so first of all what I
have done is I have made a date of birth
column which is a new column into the
database for saving the date okay and
you see it's saving the date in this
format because I have tried earlier to
save some data so if you don't have this
column then just make the date of birth
or whatever they do you want to insert
into the database and just want to show
you one more thing that the data type of
this little path is indeed I have
selected now
go to save button and code for the save
button I have shown you in the video
number nine I think so if you don't know
this save button event code then you can
just go to that video and see it so I
will just just double click it and this
is the code we have written in video
number nine so till now I have been
inserting so this is the query insert
into the database dot e dot a-- which is
the table name this is the database name
and then in the bracket the name of the
columns till now I have been adding
employee ID name surname age gender and
this is the new addition I have done the
DOB column or the date of birth column
so just add a comma and the date of
birth in the Queenie and then values we
have inserted all the values of employee
ID and name so name and age and in the
last field gave a comma and just write
this line which is
single : inside double : and then plus
and inside that plus plus sign right
this arrow point a date time picker 1
which is the name of this date time
picker which is this here this is the
time picker the name of my date time
pick up and then arrow point text so add
this into your query after this comma so
we have added this column and we have
added the column value and rest of the
code will remain the same
now let's try and run the program so
right now I have if you see I have 13
and 3 till now I'm refreshing with data
so I don't have much 13 entries so I
will add the 14th and 3 into the dot of
this
so
employ nd 14 name
so whatever you want age and now you can
select the date so you can select the
month well and you can select the year
also
so 1971 now the month me and so sixth me
1971 and he is a male when I press the
Save button my data is saved 14 masking
21 and 6th May 1971 is my doctor and
data is saved now when I go to my
database and check it first of all I
need to refresh my database from here
and you can see the 14th employees I
ended and the date of birth is also
added and MySQL has taken the date
according to its format yeah month and
then B and it also passed the - here
while we are using slashes here so you
can also use - in between also so MySQL
is intelligent enough to recognize that
but you need to give the date in this
format only so in this way you can use
date/time picker with your visual C++
windows form application I hope you have
