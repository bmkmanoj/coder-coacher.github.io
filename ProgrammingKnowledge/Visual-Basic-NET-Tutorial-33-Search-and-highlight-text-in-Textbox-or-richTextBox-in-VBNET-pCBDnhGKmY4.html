shown you how to open a text file inside
your rich text box now in this video I
will show you how to search a particular
word inside your rich text box and
highlight it for example with a
background color so let's get started
for this I'm going to take a button and
I'm going to take a text box okay and
rich text box I have all I already have
from the last video okay so if you want
to open the text file inside the rich
text box just watch the last video
because I'm going to just open the text
file inside this rich text box and
search for the word inside this rich
text box so this button text I will
change it as such and I will just change
the font size of this button and text
box so I will make it 18 okay
so whatever word I will enter in this
text box and when I press this search
button it should highlight all the word
which I enter in the search box so now I
will just double click this search
button and in here I will write the code
so first of all I will declare a integer
variable so I will write them index as
integer is equal to 0 and now we'll make
a while loop wine and inside this while
loop I will give a condition
so I will write while index is less than
rich text box 1 dot text dot last index
off and then in the bracket I will pass
the text of the rich text box okay a bag
out pardon here the text in the text box
which we are searching for so this text
box text will come so just write here
textbox1 dot txt okay and I think I'm
messing with the code of why because I'm
teaching so many languages at the same
time so I get confused sometimes so now
this is our while loop okay and inside
this while loop I will write rich text
box one dot find okay and this will take
four arguments 1st argument would be so
just hover over this find and let's see
it shows any suggestion or not know
right now it's not showing any
suggestions
so this fine takes four arguments 1st
argument will be the pose would be are
searching for so the word we are
searching for is in our text box 1 so
right text books 1 dot
texts and the second thing second
argument I would say it takes is the
index so just right index this index
which we have declared as a variable
integer third argument would be the
length of the rich text box right rich
text box one dot length mm text length
and the fourth argument would be rich
text box find dot none okay so this is
these are the four argument just write
reg text box dot fine and inside the
bracket past four argument first
argument would be the text we are
searching for so we are passing the text
in the text box second is the index
third in the length of the text in the
rich text box and fourth is the rich
text box points dot none now once we
have searched our words or letters now
we are going to highlight them so just
rights rich text box 1 dot selected text
not selected times first selection back
color is equal to the color of your
choice so for example color dot red and
searching for
let's see if you want okay so this is
red color and now I will write in the
third line of code as index which is my
variable is equal to which text box one
dot text dot index off and in the
bracket I will pass to argument first is
the textbox name textbox one dot text
and the second argument is the index
okay
and I will add plus 1 this plus one I am
doing because in a while loop it will
search for the word one by one right
that's why I'm using this plus one here
okay so just write this and this is the
code for searching the word and
highlighting the word inside the rich
text box now we are going to check it so
if you want you can just pause the video
and copy the code and let's try to run
the will program so first of all I will
open our text file with this button
which I have shown you in the last video
so text file is open and for example
let's see what would we need to search
for example we need to search this word
th e da so I will write the inside this
text box and when I click the search
button
it highlights all the port which are th
e even it also search the word
containing this 3 letters th e right or
for example
let's see what word we want to search
mean for example we want such mean
so I will write mean and click search
and search for this mean also and you
will notice that it will not unhighlight
this previous search so this we can do
it like this so the to solve that
problem just write here dem temp as
string equal to which textbox dot txt
and what we are going to do is we will
empty our rich text box so we will write
this and we will just pass the empty
string inside our rich text box and once
again what we will do is we will just
pass this temporary string which
contains the rich text box text so just
write this and then write temp ok now it
will just search for the word we are
searching for and it will unhighlight
the previous search once again I will
run the program I will open the text
file and I will search for the word door
once again and I will click search and
it searches for the word bomb and once
again I want to search once again our
new word mean for example and this time
it unhighlight the previous search and
search for the new
word which we are searching for so in
this way you can search and highlight
the text inside your H text box I hope
you have enjoyed this video please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
