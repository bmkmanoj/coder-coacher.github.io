last video I am showing you how to
attach your image by clicking this
button and how to convert that image
into the binary stream and you have to
make sure that the file you're attaching
should be a PNG file because never beans
support PNG file mostly so this is one
maybe the restriction or that means I
don't know there is a solution for it or
not
if you know some solution then tell me I
will also like to know that last video I
haven't shown you how to make convert
your image into binary stream and now I
will show you how to save when you click
this Save button your data here will be
saved and whatever you will select the
match here it's also saved so let's get
started
go to your save button right click it by
the way this code I've made earlier and
this save good save code I have shown
you in the video number 14 so if you
don't know how to save data just go and
watch my video number 14 and I will
continue the code after that for my save
buttons I will right click it go to
event action and action performed and
this code I have written in my video
number 14 okay
now I will go to my database and let's
see what is my image column name so my
image call name as I've declared earlier
is image so I want to add an image in my
image column for my response respective
employee ID for example so previously I
was able to add or save new employee ID
his name surname and age and now I would
like to add an image to this data so I
will right after this insert into
employee info this is the table name and
this is the column employee ID name
surname and image and after that you
should write column name image and add
one more question marks so to look for
the image also so we will add this five
information of the employee and in here
we have written up to four column names
we are able to take the values from
these respective tests text field like
one this this and this and one combo box
also from here we have written this code
earlier and after that you have to run
it after these four lines we have to
insert an image now which is our fifth
where you belong fifth column here one
two three four five
okay so I will write it here PST dot set
set this is byte so I have to write dot
this one because we have already
converted our a medium to buy it so to
write this PST dot set byte fifth
columns of a writes five one two three
four and fifth I mean here you have to
write your person image variable name we
have declared at the bottom in the last
video here was an image so we are
through this button attach image we are
converting our image into bytes and
saving it in this variable person image
and when you go in the Save button
actionperformed
it will insert this variable which is in
here
and save your data into your database so
it's showing some error let's see what
is there
so it seemed prepared statement method
cannot be for performed here let's see
by okay so I've done some spelling
mistakes as I always do here after PST
dot set this is non-white this is a
stream of biases these are set whites so
right PST dot set V Y te s don't forget
s it's the stream of white so in your
error will go now so what we have done
basically we added one more column in
here and one more question mark after
values and we are at the fifth place or
in the fifth column via inserting our
person image variable which contains our
image binary stream so you just have to
write one line and add this column and
one question mark in order to save the
image and let's try to run our program
now let's see can be able to attach a
new image in our database and can be
able to see or not so I have till now 11
employee we add 12 12 name is
whatever his age is 24 for example and I
want to save its image also so I will
click this attach button and I will
search for my image and for example I
wanted to say yes image like this this
one and when I press Save button my
employee data and his image should be
saved in my database this is employee
number 20 so I will click my Save button
you can see it's saved our image and
employ dot I saved and when you click OK
you can see the 12th employee and this
is the binary form of your image so you
can see in your table also and when you
click this row employee number 12 you
can see in the image we can add the
image of the person I don't have it
right now so I image some icon here you
can add any image one thing to note here
is you cannot add a big image of a big
image file so it has some size
restrictions also so your image should
be not more than I think hope is the
limit I have to check so this was the
tutorial on how to save your image by
using your safe but we I hope you have
learned something new and
we'll implement in your project so
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
