Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use ListView in
Java effects so let's get started what
I'm going to do is I'm going to work on
the last project which I have made for
combo box and it has this main dot Java
class and main controller and main dot
effects ml which I have created in the
last video ok so first of all what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open my main
dot F XML file in the scene builder and
in here what I'm going to do is from the
controls category I'm going to drag and
drop a ListView in here ok and this is
how your ListView looks like right now
next thing what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to give it the ID to this
ListView so I'm going to select this and
let's say is it's my list view ok and
just press ENTER and save everything and
just take the same ID and go to your
Eclipse IDE and go to the controller dot
java
and this is our ListView name so what we
are going to do is we are going to
create one more object for the ListView
so just write list view and give this
name to the list view ok and fix the
imports for the list view from JavaFX
right now a list views and combo box
works in a similar way because ListView
also takes this observable list as a
list ok so just take your list view and
go to your initialize method which we
have created in the last video and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
take this list view and then I'm going
to just call our set items method on it
so set items and then just provide this
observable list which we have created in
the last video to
the argument of set item right now save
your code and just run your app once
again and now you can see here these
names are populated in the list box okay
now for example you want to add some
names dynamically as we have seen in the
case of combo box what we can do we can
go to this button action function which
we had created in the last video right
and instead of using this combo box I
will just replace it with the list box
so our code is list box dot Kate get
items dot add all and I have added some
more names to the list and I will save
my code and run it once again and right
now we have four names but when I press
this button the names are added to the
list right so it's almost working as the
combo box now for example right now you
can only choose one item at a time so
you cannot select multiple items using
this list box but for example you want
that you want to choose multiple item in
the list box how we can do this so go to
your initialize method once again and
take this list view object and then just
call get selection mode and then just
call our method call set selection mode
and as an argument
it takes selection mode as the argument
so just try selection mode dot multiple
okay and when you do this you will be
able to select multiple items so save
your code and run it once again and I
will click this button to populate more
names and now I can choose multiple
items in the list okay now when we
choose these multiple items they are not
doing anything so for example I want to
retrieve whatever I have selected in the
list box so let's see how we can
retrieve all those
which I have selected in the list box so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to my button action method and in here I
will just comment this code to add items
and what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to declare our observable list
because this list view returns this
observable list right so just declare an
observable list of type string and let's
say its name is names because we are
retrieving names from here okay and then
we can say names is equal to take the
lips few from here then get the
selection mode and then get the
selection selected items from here ok
and it's going to return these all the
items which we have selected in this
variable so it's a list right so we need
to you know iterate over these names to
get all these selected names right so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take a for loop and I'm going to declare
a string name in all the name so I will
iterate through the list and then here I
can print all the names one by one so
just write this out so in here as an
argument just pass this name which we
are retrieving from the names list ok
and save your code and run it once again
now for example I will choose one name
from here and click the button it prints
one name now let's select two names and
just click this button and it prints two
other names right and for example I
choose all the names is going to print
all the names from here ok so you can
access all the selected item from my
list in observable list and you can
iterate over this list using a four
Loup and then you can access all these
items here okay now let's see how we can
populate our list box using F XML file
so in the last video also we have seen
how we can populate a combo bus from the
effects ml file instead of you know
populating it through this initialize
method so I will just comment this code
which was populating the list using this
observable list and I'm going to go to
my main dot F XML file here is my list
view and I will just change the ListView
something like this so in between these
elements I can just add these items
now you can populate a list view in the
same way as you have done in the combo
box so it takes this item element and
inside the item element it takes the
effects collection element and inside
the effects collection element you can
populate your ListView using this string
element using FX value right so I'm
going to just copy this code from here
and paste it here okay and save your
code and run it once again and now you
can see all these item item 1 item 2
item G and item 4 are populated using
the F XML file so in this way you can
use a ListView in Java FX I hope you
