tutorial on MySQL for beginners and in
this video I am going to show you how
you can install and configure MySQL on
your Windows operating system I am using
Windows 8.1 as my operating system but
this procedure you can use it for
windows 7 or windows 8 also so let's get
started
first of all we are going to download
and install MySQL on our computer so go
to your browser and search for MySQL
dot-com
and you will see this website called
MySQL www is ql comm so just open this
website or what you can do is you can
just only search for MySQL and this will
present you this MySQL website okay and
once you are in MySQL dot-com website so
go to MySQL comm in here you will see
some of the links related to MySQL and
you will see MySQL the world world's
most popular open-source database so in
here you need to click this link
downloads link here ok so click this
download link and in here you will see
different flavors of MySQL database
MySQL community server mysql cluster
fabric utilities workbench and there are
so many tools for MySQL but what we are
going to do is we are going to install
MySQL community server as a whole so we
will install MySQL server and we will
also install MySQL workbench to work
with MySQL so what I will do is I will
go to this link which is MySQL community
server
and scroll down a little and you will
see this section here which say is MySQL
community server whatever is the latest
version at the time of making this video
the latest version is five point six
point one nine and I want to install
this MySQL community server as a whole
for Windows so it is already selected
here or otherwise if you are installing
a MySQL server for other operating
system you can choose your operating
system from here and select your
operating system and then download this
MSI file okay so just click this
download here windows 64-bit mysql
installer okay so I will click this
download and will lead me to this next
link and in here it will ask me if I
want to if I want to download this for
this version or this version ok
so I will choose this first version to
download windows x86 32-bit MSI and I
will download it but first you just need
to see this line here which is in the
node it's saying MySQL installer is
32-bit right MySQL installer is 32 bit
but the install is for both 64-bit
binaries and 32-bit binaries so if you
are seeing this is 32-bit do not worry
it will be it can be installed on 64-bit
because MySQL installer is 32-bit
installer ok so just select this first
link download and in here it will see
say to login or signup so if you want to
create a account in MySQL then you can
create an account or if you already have
account in my sq
then you can create or you can login
with your account or the third option is
if you do not want to login or signup
you can just click this link no thanks
just start download okay so I am going
to click this link no thanks just start
download and my download will start and
it's a fairly small executable file to
download so it will be downloaded in
really a few seconds and once it's
downloaded just click this executable
file and the installation will start and
you see here installation is starting
and click yes
and click here's once again
and saying please wait while the MySQL
server processes the current operation
so it will take about 10 to 15 minutes
to install the MySQL so be patient and
just go step by step and now you can see
this window here which says install
MySQL product about MySQL and resources
so I am going to click this option
install MySQL product and now my
installation will start but before
starting the installation you need to
accept the license terms so just click
this I accept the license terms and on
the left hand side you will see this
column and you see some categories here
so it will go one category after another
and when you go or when you reach to
this category called complete your
installation will be complete so keep an
eye here and for now I will accept the
terms and condition and I will click
Next and it's saying find the latest
product so I will just click execute and
it will find the internet connection and
fetch the product from the internet so I
will just click execute from here and
you see connect to the Internet is
successful and I am ready to go further
so I will click Next and in here you can
choose the type of setup you want I want
this MySQL for development use so I will
just keep this radio button checked as
developer default ok and I will click
Next and it's in in here it's showing
some of the requirements so for example
you already have some Visual Studio
installed in your system so it's saying
that this dotnet framework requires
of the mysqld dll and if you want to add
this DLL which supports MySQL framework
or for dotnet then you can see here all
the requirement will be will be listed
here and it is always a good habit to
install your language first for example
if you want to develop c-sharp and MySQL
MySQL application then install Visual
Studio first and then install MySQL
otherwise you will not be able to see
these requirement and whenever you
install MySQL it will not show you these
option and it will not configure the the
support for the.net framework so it is
always a good idea to install your
language first for example c shop or a
visual basic in the form of Visual
Studio and then install MySQL so it has
listed the requirement I will click
execute and it has
installed one more requirement from here
and I will say I have read and accept
the license terms and condition and I
will say install
it's installing the support for Visual
Studio you see here and click finish and
now I can see all the green checks here
that means all the support is available
I can click the next button now and now
these are the processes which will take
place when you click this execute button
so first this will be downloaded and one
by one all the all the tools for MySQL
will be downloaded and installed so just
execute or click this execute button and
one by one these download will start and
all the download will take place and
when all the download will be completed
we will reach to the configuration so I
will pause the video here because it's
downloading all the tools and there is
not much happening here so once this all
the downloading of the tool is completed
I will unpause the video and I will go
further ok
so now all the downloads and install are
complete so I will click Next and it's
saying configuration overview so it's
showing in initial configuration for a
MySQL server we will click Next and in
here you will see the typical
configuration for MySQL server so I want
to use this server configuration type as
a development machine but you have the
option for server machine or dedicated
machine but I want to use the server as
a development machine so I will just
leave it as default and this is the
default port on which the server will
run 3 3 0 6 so I will not change this
port number and I will leave it as
default because we are just learning
this MySQL so we do not need to change
this if you don't have any real purpose
for changing ok and I will click Next
and this is the most important step of
MySQL installation you need to give a
password for opening your database or to
communicate with your database so in
here you need to give your password so
for example I will give some password
which I will remember later so you need
to remember this password so just give a
password which you can remember and then
repeat that that password
at saying password week but yeah for
demo it's okay but give a strong
password for this and I will click Next
and I will leave this as default the
windows service details the service name
which is MySQL 56 in my case I will
leave it as default and I will click
Next configuring the product
and you see new service added to the
mentioned list here and click Next
so configuration of all the product will
happen first and then the installation
will be completed and click Next
and start MySQL workbench so MySQL
workbench is a kleine tool with the help
of which you can communicate with the
database and it is a GUI tool so you can
see what is the structure of database
and you can create database using MySQL
workbench so I will leave this checkbox
as checked so that it will directly
launch workbench after the setup so I
will click finish and it will launch
MySQL workbench now for me
so I will wait for the Icicle workbench
and you see here the MySQL workbench is
now launched
and here you can give the password or
search for the databases you see MySQL
doc library utilities and all the things
but what in what we are interested in is
the communication with the database
right so just once again I will do this
ok I will click here for the root
username because I have given or default
username is root just click this I will
ask for the password which you have set
so just repeat the same password
and click okay
and now you are connected with the
database and you will see this overview
here okay and in here you see the server
status lined and several number of
things but the things we are interested
in is this one information schema these
are the some of the default schema or
the databases which is given by MySQL
for for as an example databases what you
can do is you can go to database and
connect to database and click OK
and give your password
and once again you will see here so this
overview you can see in two ways either
by going to the database and connect to
the database or otherwise just click
that root which I have shown you now it
has some screen as see this schema from
here
which is world schema
and it has some tables
so it has these tables called city and
country and country language
so what I can do is in this world
database I can go to the tables here and
click the table I want to see so I will
for example I want to see the data in
the city database this is by the wave
example database we are going to create
our own database in further further
video so don't worry about it but this
is some of the sample databases which
are provided by the MySQL for us ok so I
will right click the table I want to see
so right click and just click this first
option selects rows limit thousand
and you will see the data in those
tables in that table so the name of the
table is city and this is the data in
the table and this is called the query
and this will produce the same result as
this one if you execute this query so we
are going to learn this query and in the
further videos also so do not worry
about this query but yeah
for seeing the data in the database you
just need to click right click it and
just see select rows limit thousand so
this is how you can install and
configure MySQL in your Windows
operating system in the further videos I
will show you how you can create
databases how you can query databases
and some more features in MySQL database
so stay tuned and please rate comment
