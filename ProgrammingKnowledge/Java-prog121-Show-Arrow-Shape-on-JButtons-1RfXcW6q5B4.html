in this video I will show you how to
provide these kind of arrow shape to
your J buttons
so this buttons these buttons can be
very useful whenever you want to
transfer from something from left to
right or up to down and you want to show
this arrow as indicator for that so I
will show you today how to provide these
kind of arrow shape to your buttons our
normal but me looks like this but these
buttons given a shape by using some code
so let's get started maybe close this
window so what I have here is I have
four button which I have taken from my
palette here and I have taken four
buttons so that I can show
every direction for example every button
will show every direction so north west
east and south is forward buttons will
show these four directions you can also
provide northeast direction or whatever
direction you want to provide but for
the starting I will only show you how to
provide these four directions so what I
will do here I mean they meet this title
because I just want to show my all the
title and the second thing is make these
button a little bit bigger in size
you see these buttons little bit smaller
if these buttons in which you are
showing your arrows are of this this
size then maybe your arrow will look
very small and you will not be able to
recognize it make these button little
bit bigger so we can see those arrows
signs second thing I will do is I will
provide the variable name so that I have
some logic so first button I will show
North arrow direction so I will name it
as not button second is south
third is west and what is East
so these variable names I have provided
to these buttons and next what you need
to do is go to your source code in here
and here in your main frame method where
you're in it components are there
initializing component method is there
you need to write your code here so
whenever I run my program this code is
initialized automatically or this code
is initialized at the starting of the
frame so it will give our buttons the
same shape as written here so this is my
method name you can see here user frame
is the same name as this so if you don't
know what method is this just find
whatever your file name is same method
you find and in that method you have to
write your code and in here what you
will write is first of all copy your
variable name from first name is not and
I will paste it here dot
and I'd component first close this in
this ad bracket I will write new basic
arrow button
and then the first one int direction and
instead of this width bracket you will
write once again basic button dot
my first button Direction was no so I
will search for not not click it so this
is my North Direction button in the same
way I will copy this code four times we
just change the direction and in here
also instead of not
what is not east
so these four line of code we provided
and this line will be initiated or will
be called and I will give name will one
so let's check program is working or not
so you can see this program is working
and these buttons are showing north
south west and east you can also provide
some other shapes to these buttons for
example I want to change this north
direction instead of north direction I
want to show what I want to show let's
see this works or not
my program once again and nothing
happens so you just need to try
different option so just go there and
dot and try for the different option
whatever is working for you working in
this code what options are available for
the button shape so this is also not
working so in this way you can provide
different kind of shapes I think this
must work more theast no it's also not
working maybe the size of this should be
increased
so I think you understand the basic
concept so I don't need to extend this
video further just try different options
here and see whatever what shapes your
button can get so this was the tutorial
on how to provide the arrow shapes to
your buttons and other shapes also you
just need to try different things
options here so please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
