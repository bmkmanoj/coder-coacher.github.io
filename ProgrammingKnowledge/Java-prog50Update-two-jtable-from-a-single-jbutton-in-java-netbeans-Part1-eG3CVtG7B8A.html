guys asked me how to edit data in
different tables using one update button
so for example I have one table in my
table to tempt pain and other tables is
in my decision-making typed pain and
these are the text field from which I
will enter the values here and from this
I will enter the value here if for
example you have the same column name of
two different tables for example student
mark student name first who scored the
marks and student name second who scored
the mouse here so you can enter the the
value from the same text field you don't
need to write or insert your different
text field for this and for this you can
just take out this and you can add it
your poor table from the same text field
but in my case my column names are
different so I'm taking these inside the
tempt B so I've already taken my update
button so I will right click it action
action performed and in here I have
already made the update method for my
one table which is this employee info
and now
and this thing update table I have shown
in 17th videos if you have some doubt
you can post that first and now I will
update or write the code for update for
this table from a single button so I
will go here and I will write as quick
statement if if statement covers your
try-catch block of your update so after
you catch the screw the if statement in
here then go to your T frame and just
click anywhere in the temp beam above
and right-click and copy the name of
your damned paint my time to paint name
is a temp in one so copy here dot get
selected index is equal to so you need
to know what is the index of this
because this we have already made the
code for added so this is my zero one
two third index index start from zero so
this is the wrote index this is 1 this
is 2 and this is third so I will write
here in this number 3
and so if this code means that if you
click or open the third index the update
code of this table will takes place when
you click the Update button now we want
the update method of just able also from
the same button so after if condition
right here else if
commissioned me and because I am getting
lesser time so I will copy the same code
as above and I will try to change the
values in this same code so this code I
have copied from above this is the
update code for employee info and I will
now make it for the user info table so
here once again take the name of my J
times pain
copy it and paste it in the F condition
is the dot kept connected index equal to
so my this is making time pain index is
0 1 2 so this is my second index in
which my user info table is present so I
will write it here second and yeah we
try to change the values because in here
we have the different text feel ania we
have different so I will copy the name
of my pump ID and
instead here for example I want to
change the way you pump ID pressure and
temperature so I will copy this Expedia
and paste at the second position
compiling expression and I want to
change the temperature for example and
you can also change the date and flow
volume flow and this way but in order to
save time I am just taking the values
from these three text field and just
adding only the data which you write in
these three text field you can make it
for all text field so I mean I write
written these three things and now my
string update employee info so instead
of employee info my table name is for
employing flow we have already made our
code in video number 17 and now for
using four so my tip my name is user
info just paste update the table name
and here I want to omit the name of the
columns subject user info set
the instead of employee ID my column
name is bound ID pressure and
temperature so I went and combined D
value to s for pressure when you three
temperature and the other values we
don't need them so we will just delete
these values
so write these three thing update you
can put table pump ID pressure and
temperature and these value 1 we are
taking from pump text field value 2 we
are taking from pressure value 3 we are
taking form the temperature so we
haven't copied the text field or
temperature so that i will copy the text
before temperature and I will just paste
it here so it will take the value home
temperature text field so I think my
code is complete and I mean we are
trying to run the program
so suppose I wanted to add it in the
window first of all in this table
employee folk table so I want to add it
for example employee ID six
