last video I have shown you how to
export your database table as a CSV file
or excel file in this video I will show
you how to import a CSV file or excel
file to a database so right now I have
this SQLite manager open which I have
shown you in the second video how to
download and install and for example I
create a new database so I create a new
database and I will give the database
name as for example EMP DB dot d beef ok
and I click OK and I will save it as a
location here I will say ok so right now
I have created this database right and
now I want to import our data which is
there in my excel file so for example I
have this data which is there in the
excel file and I have here employee ID
name surname age username password and P
and I have some data for these columns
and I want to import this table or this
table data as a database table here so
what I will do is I will go to this tab
data base and I will go to import here
and it will open an import wizard from
here and because this is a excel file
and not a comma separated file so let's
see how we can improve for this excel
file to our database
so just select the stab CSB CSV and just
select the first row contains the name
of the column so you can see a first row
contains the name of the columns that's
why I will select here and I will give
the name of the table here so I will
give employee info table this is a type
name of your table right and just select
this and because this is a excel file so
I will select this tab because they are
separated by tab and this I will leave
as default double quote if necessary
okay and I will click OK and it's
showing some error okay so it's showing
error because I haven't selected my
excel file this excel file I need to
give the path also so at the top here
you need to give the path of your excel
file also so just go at the right and
select the file from here and from here
you can give the path of your excel file
so just click show all and see the
extension which pile is our excel file
so I will see it from here this file is
my excel file so I will select this
excel file and I will open this and now
I will click OK and now it's showing me
the message that a new table called
employee info will be created do you
want to modify this table click OK and
you can see here all the table columns
comes come here and you can define the
dark data type of these columns so for
example first column is an integer
second name is a rare care so name is a
where care age is indeed
user name is where car this is also
where care and pay is float and you can
also define which is your primary key so
for example we take employee ID as a
primary key just select it and click OK
and it will show this dialog just click
OK and now you can see here you have a
new table called employee info and which
is having some data ok so let's see and
you can go to this execute SQL query tab
and you can just verify that if all the
data is there or not so just write the
query select star from the data table
name so table name is employee info so I
will right select star from employee
info and I will run the SQL query here
and you will be able to see all the data
is there in your table so in this way
you can import a data from excel file
you can do the same for the CSV file
also just select this comma separated
file and it's the same procedure for the
CSV file so I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
