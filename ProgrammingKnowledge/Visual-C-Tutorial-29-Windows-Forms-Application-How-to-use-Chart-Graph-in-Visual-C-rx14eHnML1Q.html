video I will show you how to use charts
or graphs with your C++ windows form
application so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to my tool box and I will go
to data section and I will pick up a
chart from there this one and I will
drag and drop into my form so this looks
like this and I will reshape it
according to my requirement and the
second thing we do is we take a button
to load a chart okay and I will name
this button as load chart
okay on my chart name is this chart one
and suppose I want to show some bar
chart on my this chart panel how can I
do it so for example I want to show a
name versus age bar chart so I will just
click this load chart but double click
this and I will go to the event of this
button to load the chart and in here I
will write the line this this arrow
pointer this line this arrow point of
chart one which is the name of my chart
arrow point of series and this is the
name of the series in my case this is
age so I will change it here age and I
will just copy this age from here and I
will go up where my chart declarations
are there and you see the series name is
series one by default and I will replace
it by age so here you want to replace
you have to replace your name of the
series and at the bottom where you are
writing your code here and in this
bracket you need to pass to my parameter
for X and y-axis so for example I will
pass a name and the age of some person
so for example Max and his age is 25 I
will copy this line once again and paste
it down and I will change the name Col
is ages 45 and one more time I'll copy
and paste his name is Mark this age is
40 for example okay so now I want to
show the age versus name graph of this
person this is the x-axis of your graph
and this is the y-axis and so when you
press the button it will load this data
into your chart and show the chart
according to this data so let's see if
this works or not and run the program
user name password and if my press this
load button my data should appear here
so let's try it yes my data is appeared
here
so this shows the bar chart of name
versus age and you see your age now if
you want to show line chart instead of
this bar chart then what you need to do
there are some settings in the
properties you know you can do so go to
the series here this one in the property
and click this button and it will open
the series collect collection editor I
only have one series called age and for
that series I can change the chart type
from here okay so I'm changing the chart
type instead of
columns I want line charge so like this
we just change it and press ok and you
see it's bars are converted to line
chart and now when you run your program
and again go to that forum and when you
load here program instead of bars you
can see the line chart of your data so
in the same way you can choose the type
from here and just display into your
chart so it depends upon you it has some
other settings like name of your series
and some other settings by which you can
make your chart really good so it has
what style do you need for your chart we
change these styles and I will see how
it looks so if I want to add some image
also I can select but I don't have any
image right now but you can select and
it will be shown into the background of
your chart so this is also a very good
feature which you can use watercolor you
can choose whatever color you want for
your border and the color of your series
also you can choose for example I am one
too
green color and I press okay okay and
once again I want to choose column
instead above this line chart and press
ok so you see your chart properties are
changed and you can play with the
properties and see what properties you
want with your chart ok and one more
thing if you want to show one other data
so you want to show name versus age and
name versus some score data you can also
do show two bars parallel to each other
showing two data for the same person so
how can we do that we will see also here
so once again go at the top
no actually you don't need to go and top
just go to your form and select your
chart and go to the properties and once
again we will go to the series
collection here okay and I will press it
and if I want to show to series age and
score for example so I will click this
Add button
and I can change the name of this series
from here so from here I will change the
name of the series as score okay so the
name is changed and what else I need to
change is the color which I want to use
for the edge
for the score I will use some other
color for example this C on color and
for the age I will use this line color
okay so I have two data one age and one
score versus name so you see you can see
already this shows two bars and in the
code how can you represent this data
just click your load chart button double
click and don't go to the code these
three lines we have added earlier just
give the space between them and just
copy this line once again and paste it
here and instead of age series we need
now need to show the score so I write
the name of this core series which is
score and this is the name versus the
score so for example I want to give him
the score 500 once again copy and paste
what car
I want to give the score 450 and four
marks mark I want to give the score what
550 for example and I will change the
name of the series this one is the
series data and this one is the series
data
okay and I will separate the code to
better understand it so it will load the
age that I am it will load the score dot
in the same chart chart one so if you
want to copy the score just pause the
video and copy the code and now we will
try to run the program
and you can see agents code to series
are there when I press load chart it
will show my score and the age of the
particular name so in this way you can
play with your chart and show what data
you want to show I think you have
