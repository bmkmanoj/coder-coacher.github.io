tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how we can make a very basic app to add
two numbers so what we are going to do
is we are going to take two inputs two
numbers from user and by clicking sum
button we are going to add these two
number so that you will be able to learn
how these button action perform of
button click event works and how these
textboxes work so let's get started I
have deleted my older large text widget
from here and now my activity is blank
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to the text field here
and in here I am going to take this
number field so I'm going to take one
number field and I'm going to take
another number field so I'm going to add
two numbers right now I can double click
this text box and I can add the text to
this text field but right now text field
is not required because we are not going
to display any text on these text boxes
but you can see the ID is important ID
is the unique ID which differentiates
one tool from other another for example
this added text ID is the ID of this
number text and added text ID to is the
ID of this second added text right now
to show this number text or added text a
little bit more or why we are using this
added text we can provide the hint to
this text box
so you just select this added text and
go to the property called hint so there
is a property called hint and here we
can provide the hint to the user that
what he is expected to enter here for
example I will say
so now these are the hint you can
provide so it will you know appear on
your text boxes but it will not appear
as a text but it will appear as a hint
for example you want to you know provide
the hint that this can be the text box
for email or some name or any other hint
you want to provide to any text box you
can provide this hint by going to the
property called hint here okay and
whatever text you right here it will be
provided as a hint now to add these new
numbers how we want to display the
message you can display message by these
plain text views or any other text views
from here so we are going to take this
text view which is a plain text view and
we are going to make it a little bit
larger and you can you know adjust the
length of the text view by adjusting
these this thing okay so for now let's
take a large text views
we are going to add one more button to
our activity so that whenever this
button is clicked we should be able to
see the results so in the visit you just
drag and drop a button
now what we need to do is now our design
is complete we have two text boxes we
have a result
text box or text edit or text view and
we have a button and once you have these
in your activity you will be able to see
them here so you have added text one
added text two and text view which is
this one and the button which is this
one right now everything is done then we
are going to go to our Java folder and
in our Java folder we are going to go
inside the main activity so go inside
your main activity or just open this
main activity dot Java okay and last
time we have added some methods here to
log some messages so I'm going to delete
all these things because we are not
going to use them anymore and then I
will go and delete up to this destroy
and then I will delete all the logging
messages which we have printed last time
and now everything is clear okay so this
is just basic main activity Java okay so
now in here what you need to do is we
are going to make a public function to
provide the button click event to the
button so what we are going to do is we
will just write public void public void
and then we will write on button click
OK and then make a bracket here I will
change my text format and I will write
here view view v
okay and then I will write something
inside here okay and for the first time
whenever you you know write this view
here you will be able to see this red
symbol here okay so what you need to do
is you just need to click alt enter and
all your imports will be fixed so just
click alt and press enter and it will
give you some option click the first
option and then your error will be fixed
so it has added this import Android dot
view dot view in your main glass or
mainactivity.java
okay so whenever you see some error just
press alt' + enter' and it will give you
some options okay now inside your
function or method you just need to
write added text edit text because we
are using this and then we will name our
text as for example e 1 is equal to once
again added text and we are going to
find our added text by its ID so I am
going to enclose my this added text this
which is a default keyword for added
text and then I will just write find and
you can see it's autocomplete so Android
studio will give you the hints what can
be the you know method you can call with
this find keyword okay
so just press ENTER and just write find
view by ID and inside this we are going
to find view by ID by writing or r dot
ID dot added text
and this added text if you remember is
the ID of the added text number one so
when you go here
and when you click this the ID of this
is added text you can see here or in the
IDs here in the properties you can see
the ID of this text is added text so
this is the idea of this one right
similarly the idea of this added text to
is added text to itself you can see here
or you can see it here so this ID is
this ID we are writing here okay so in a
same way I will copy this and I will do
the same for added text too
view here the result will be shown in
the text view right so we will create
the instance of this text view also
you
what we can do now is we will declare an
integer variable for example num1 and we
will assign whatever user will enter in
this first text box and we will convert
this text to the number and then we are
going to use this number to add the
values
you
so this will give us the sum of these
two numbers and then we can display the
sum to our text view okay so we will
take t1 on which we want to set our text
and then dot set text and then we set
the text so this is the integer and then
we need to convert this integer to text
so we will write integer with capital I
integer dot to string and then some okay
so this is going to give this in integer
and then from integer to string integer
dot to string we are converting our
integer to some okay so now we have this
method now how can we tell this button
that we want to call this method when we
press this button okay so what we can do
is just select the button so I'm going
to select the button and in here in the
properties I will find the property
called on click okay so just find the
property call on click and once you are
on click property here you can just
click this combo box and you will be
able to see this on button click method
automatically appearing here okay so
this method which we have created when
you go into the design view you will be
able to see this on button click method
here you can just select it and now
whenever we run the program we will be
able to see our result in our emulator
you
and now it's running here okay so our
application is running
let's check this so for number one I
will enter for example 501 and number
two I will enter six or not 501 but it
was five thousand one and in here I will
enter six thousand two for example or
sixty thousand - okay
let's enter six thousand two and then
when I click some see the result here so
click sum and the sum will appear in
here as a result you can add some other
numbers for example some different
number and click OK some and the sum
appears here in a similar way you can
use this activity to calculate the
subtraction division or multiplication
of these two numbers so you can add some
more method and some more buttons and
you can whatever you enter here you can
click the subtraction button or addition
button or multiplication button or
division button it will give you the
same result right so this application
you can simply extend it to do
arithmetic operations different
arithmetic operations with the two
numbers so I hope you have enjoyed this
