video I will show you how to use J list
with your java application with NetBeans
so go to the palette and take a list
from here and drag and drop into your
form and it will look like this with
some some default items so now let's see
how to add items or elements in this
list so what I have done is I have taken
a button drag a button and drop it into
my form and I named it ad list and when
I click this button it will add some
lists into this list box ok so I will go
to its event action action perform and I
will write this so write default model
give the name for default list model
this is default list model this variable
name is equal to new default list
Madhi and then just copy this default
list list model variable name and paste
it here dot add element so this add
element will add element in your list
for example first element I want to add
his name second is surname and third for
example
add element and third element I want to
add age okay so whatever is in the
bracket will be your list element and
then just call this model with and with
the help of set model so this is the
Declaration of model and this is setting
these element into the model so this is
your list name so my list name is my
right-click J list one I will copy it go
to my code once again paste it here dot
set model and this is your default list
model variable and when I run the
program
yeah it was my list so are we make it a
little bit small so that when I press
this button my all three name age and
surname string should appear in the list
so let's see yes
there appears now the main question is
how to link this list box with your
database so I want to show all the names
of employees just as I have shown or
linked my combo box with the employees
this I have shown you in the sixth video
I think so code for loading or
connecting database with the combo box I
have shown you in the sixth video in the
same way I want to add a link a list
from your database and I want to show
the names of employee in this list or
whatever you would like so how to do
that I will show you now so once again
come to your
free him and go to source once again and
at the top we will make a method called
fill list box okay this is a same method
I have shown you in the sixth video
where I have linked my combo box with
the database so just copy that code and
just change the method name and make a
new method and paste the same code which
I have shown you in the sixth video how
to link a combo box with the database
and just do the addition here so I want
to do or I have to do default list model
I have to make a default list model and
then this I think I have shown you in
the sixth video so you have already
copied that I want to show the name of
the employee in the list so the name of
the employee and we call in the list
here this is the variable name for the
list model the fault list model so m dot
add element and this is this name so
this value for name column I am taking
taking into the string and this string I
am adding into the list and then because
it's a while loop it will take all the
names from the database and then add
in this element and then just call this
or set this model by calling J table or
J list one your list variable dot set
model and this is your default list
model variable so thus just three
changes you have to do add this default
latest model and in here instead of
combo box add item just comment this and
then just add M not add element and then
this string whichever column you are
taking into the string and add that
element and then just set it into the
list these three lines you have to add
in the code for video number six
otherwise you just pause this video and
just copy it really fast so it's not
very big code so you can copy it and
then what you need to do is just copy
this method name and paste it into your
main class name so this is the class
where my initial or init component
method is there so if you want to find
this main class it has the same name as
your form and it has in it component
method by default so just copy this
method and paste it here like this and
done now when I run the program
it's showing all the names into my list
box from the database this I can see
from here this table has the names and
the same names here also are present ok
so in this way you can list
link the database with the list now the
question comes what when you select some
element from here and you want to set it
into your text field so here so how to
do that
now I will show you so just right click
your list box go to element
mouse mouse clicked and this is the code
for that so if you don't know that code
just go to this combo box right click it
this is the code which I have shown you
in the tenth video how to select your
values from the combo box and show it
into the text boxes so just copy that
code from there for the combo box all
the code I am taking from the 10th video
so if you don't know this code this I
have shown you in the 10th video ok
and I will just copy this and now I will
you right-click it once again element
mouse mouse clicked event and I will
paste it here and I just need to do one
change here instead of taking the combo
box selected item value I have commented
it I have added string temp is equal to
string in the brackets this is your list
box where you will name dot get selected
values so this will select your values
from the list box and place it into the
string variable and then your non normal
query will execute and then it will add
the selected column values into the text
fields so if you want to copy this just
pause the video and copy the code it's
just not a big port so you can copy this
also
so I think now you can copy it okay so
now when you run the program
I'll make a little bit smaller and now
when I select any employee name it will
show the corresponding values into the
text fields right so like this
exchanging the values
so in this way you can use the list box
into your java swing application I hope
