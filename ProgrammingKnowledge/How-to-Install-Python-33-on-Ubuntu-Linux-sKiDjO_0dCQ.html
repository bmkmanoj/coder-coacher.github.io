how to install Python on your Ubuntu
operating system so I want to install
latest version of Python on my urban to
operating system so I open my browser
and I type in here www.hyken.com
it opens the website and here I will go
to the download section so I will click
download and here all the versions of
downloads are available so when you
first come to this page here at the time
of making this video the version 3.3 is
the latest version but there is a small
note here that if you don't know which
version to use try path python 3.3 and
some of third party software is not yet
compatible with python 3 so if you want
to use some third-party software with
python then they prefer to use 2.7
version but right now i want to install
latest version of python so I will
install python 3.3 so in here I will
search for the tarball for Linux and I
will choose this zip file to install on
my system and I will save it it's
downloading it may take some seconds to
download
now once your Python tar file is
downloaded I will double click it and
open this file in the archive manager
you can do it with this terminal also
everything but right now I'm showing it
the very easiest way to do that so this
is my Python file I will extract it to
my desired location for example to my
home path or wherever you would like to
extract this Python zip file so I will
go to my whole file and I will extract
it here let me make it a little bit
smaller so I will go to my home and
extract and it's extracting so once your
path Python zip file is extracted it
look like this for version 3.3.4 the
configuration files here so let me close
this extraction file and now I will open
the terminal and I will search for my
Python file so here I have all the
things and then I can see my Python in
here so i will write CD
peyten and yeah I have all the
configuration files which is there in
the Python so I will just write dot
slash configure and press enter it will
configure Python on my system if you are
installing Python on a freshly installed
Ubuntu operating system and you haven't
there till now install any of the build
essential library then go ahead go and
install those build essential and
escalate library first otherwise it will
not support SQLite library or it may
create some problem to compile these
Python configuration file so the
prerequisite for installing Python is I
will show you while it's configuring so
I will open the new tab and it's right
now installing and I will I have opened
the new tab and the prerequisite of
Python file is this you need to install
build essential first before configuring
this Python file so provide sudo apt the
- get install build essential so I have
already done that so I don't need to
repeat this step once again but if you
haven't done this then you need to do
this and the second thing is
in order to python to have support for
Eska light you need to install these
SQLite dev library so write sudo apt -
get install Lib sqlite3 - Dave this also
I have already done but if you have
freshly installed Ubuntu then just
install this also so just give the
command and press ENTER and it will
install this SQLite when you are open to
also the third prerequisite is you
should also have installed this lib peas
add - - dev library so go ahead and type
on your terminal sudo apt - cat install
lip DZ - - dev library and press ENTER
in order to install this library and it
will ask for a password
and it will install in your system this
library so if you haven't done that you
you can see here zero upgraded one newly
installed now library here so these are
the some of the basic prerequisite of
configuring or making installing Python
on your system so if you haven't done
that just do this and then in the other
tab my configuration is already done so
I will make my files or configuration so
I will right make this is I'm doing in
this Python library or Python folder so
my configuration is done so earlier I
have provided this command dot slash
come configure and now I am providing
this mix command so press Enter
I will make all the Python libraries
this may can take few minutes depending
upon the speed of your operating system
so now our make is done then we will
provide the make install command so
write sudo make alt install so write
this command sudo make alt install and
press ENTER give your password of your
open to operating system and it will
start making and installing the Python
on your system so our install is
complete now and the Python is installed
in the life in the folder I will show
you where python is installed in my open
to operating system so what I have done
is if I if you don't find Python by
default so for example I go to my home
in the terminal and I print Python iya
and here it will show it's showing me
the version 2.7 point 3 which I have
earlier installed and I don't want to
use this older version right now
so what I can do is I will write quit
here and I will go to my open to folder
search or search and by default I think
it will install this Python 3.3 version
here in the user local bin folder ok so
we you will be able to find this Python
3.3 in the user local bed
holder so if you want to install if you
want to use latest version of Python
then don't write Python alone just write
Pythian 3.3 it's not three point three
but three point three okay
because latest version which is
installed in our system is Python three
point three you can see here so when you
write this and press ENTER then you will
be able to see by python version 3.3 is
working now on your system right let's
check whether it's working or not so i
will write print and alright hello world
and press enter it's giving me some
syntax error
witzy okay so i should provide these
bracket like this press enter and now it
prints hello world in my Python
so in this way you can configure and
install latest version of python library
right now till at the time of making
this video it's three point three it's
the same procedure for all other latest
version so i hope you have enjoyed this
video please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
