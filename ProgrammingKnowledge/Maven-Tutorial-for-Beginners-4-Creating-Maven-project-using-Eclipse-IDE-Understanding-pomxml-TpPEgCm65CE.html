maven tutorial for beginners in the last
three videos we have seen how we can
download and install maven on our
Windows operating system and how we can
create our first maven project using
command line or command prompt now most
of the times Java developers uses some
kind of ID to create maven project there
are few maven IDE s propellers nowadays
which are eclipse netbeans or IntelliJ
now I'm going to use Eclipse IDE which
already comes with integrated maven you
know environment so we don't need to
install any extra plugin for you know
creating our maven project and it's also
one of the most popular ide for java
developers now if you don't know how to
install eclipse i'm going to paste a
link for the video in which i have shown
how we can download install eclipse for
developing java so if you don't know
just click that link and you will be
good to go now let's create our first
maven project using Eclipse IDE
and then we are going to see the details
of pom.xml so just to open your Eclipse
IDE and then go to files here for the
first time whenever you you know see
this Eclipse IDE it's going to show you
this kind of a welcome message and you
can click this left top button here to
you know see the Eclipse environment and
you can close it something like this now
in order to create a maven project you
can go to files here or file here and
then go to new project don't choose Java
project but just choose project and in
here just search for maven or you can
scroll down
and you will be able to see this
category called maven and this maven
category we have this maven project ok
so just select maven project and click
Next and for now we are going to create
the simple project and we are going to
skip archetype that's the same thing we
have done a last time we have created
the simple java project without any web
application right so just select this
checkbox and leave this checkbox as it
is okay so these checkbox must be
checked and the third should not be
checked okay and then click Next and in
here once again it's going to ask us for
the group ID artifact ID version
packaging as we have already seen in the
last video what is group ID and what is
artifact ID right so I'm going to just
give the group ID comm dot code bind and
the artifact ID for example a one demo
ok the version is good for us which is
zero point zero point one snapshot
because we are developing this project
right now and it's in development phase
and packaging is jar and leave
everything else d fault and just click
finish here now eclipse is going to
create this maven project for us in few
seconds you can see this maven demo
project is created and inside this maven
demo project we have some you know
packages here so there are 4 packages
you can see here the first two are for
your project files for example this
source / main / Java is for your source
file and then you have the source / main
/ say sources and this will contain the
resources for your
Java project right resources like maybe
some pictures or some other kind of
resources some XML files or you know it
can be anything now the other two are
for the test
you know whenever we create some maven
project it's also creating the test you
know environment for us right
so the third is source slash test slash
Java and it's going to contain your test
source files right and the fourth is
source slash test slash resources and
it's going to contain the resources for
your test okay and the folder structure
is something like this so if you see
inside our source folder we have our
main directory and our test directory
and we also have this pom dot XML file
now let's open this pom dot XML file so
just click on it or double click it and
it's going to open this pom dot XML and
it's going to show you this kind of
overview for pom dot XML now to see this
form dot XML in the XML format you can
go here and select this last option
which says bomb dot X center and we will
see this bomb dot XML in the normal you
know XML format and inside this you can
see these four elements here first is
the group ID which we have given second
is the artefact ID which we have given
already and third is the version which
we have given so this pom dot XML
contains the information of the project
which we are working on and it uses this
group ID artifact ID and version for
that okay now let's create a class
sample class to you know understand how
this maven
works better so I will just select my
source slash or main slash Java package
here and I will right-click on it and
then I will just go to new and I'm going
to create a new class here and in here
I'm going to give the package name same
as I have already given so comma dot
code bind and the name of the class for
example I'm going to name it as app ok
and everything else I am going to leave
it as default and I'm going to just
click finish and it's going to create
this app dot Java class in my comm dot
code bind package here ok now to just
take the look at this project we are
going to just create a very simple
method inside this class so just write
the public and for example it's going to
return string and we can name our method
as sample for example and just give
these round bracket which takes no
arguments and we are going to return
some dummy values so just write return
and let's say we are returning sample
for example this sample string ok so
it's not really complicated you know
method we are creating here we just want
to understand how maven works that's why
we have just created this you know
placeholder kind of method here okay now
for creating the test case for this what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go to
source slash test slash Java this is the
third package here right and I'm going
to right click here and go to new and
this time I'm going to go to the others
category here so go to other and in the
other I will be able to find this
category called j-unit ok so this is the
j-unit category
and we will just create a J unit test
case for our project so just select this
J unit test case and click Next and just
leave this as a default and in here we
will give the package name same as we
have given earlier so just calm dot code
bind and then the name of our test will
be for example app test okay and then
click finish here and it's going to ask
you this you know information it says J
unit 4 is not on the build path do you
want to add it so for now we don't want
to add anything and why I am going to
explain you in some moment right so just
say not now and then click OK and now
you can see our app test the java class
is created with this sample test and if
you can see here it's showing us a bunch
of errors so why we are seeing these
errors here because we don't have J unit
jar file in our dependency parts or
build parts you can see so in normal
cases whenever we are not using maven as
our build management system in normal
cases what on developer will do is it's
he is going to download this jar file
and add it to the build path for the J
unit right and then these errors can be
gone right but maven allows us to add
the dependency of in our pom dot XML
file so that this dependency will be
automatically downloaded and added to
your project and let's see how we can do
this so you can see these are some
errors so to remove these errors what we
can do is we can just
go to our pom dot XML file here and in
here just below this version element we
are going to add our element called
dependency
okay so just write dependencies and then
inside this dependencies element we need
to add the dependencies for the J unit
because our project requires this J unit
jar file to compile our test now maven
has this online repository from where it
can download all the dependencies which
we can mention here but what are the
things we have to mention here so for
simplicity just go to your browser and
search for maven j-unit dependency okay
so just search for maven j-unit
dependency and click search and the
first result you will see here will be
from maven our MV and repository dot-com
slash artifact /j unit /j unit so just
click this link here and in here you can
see all the you know maven you know
files or jar files depending on the
version of this and the top one is the
latest version of this J unit release
right so just click this top version
which says release and in here we can
see the dependency for this J unit so
this is the simple way of searching the
dependency for any you know jar file or
any fear framework
ok so simply just search for the maven
and then the kind of you know dependency
you are looking for for example J unit
and then search for maven g-unit
dependency and you can search for its
dependencies something like this so just
copy this dependency from here and go to
your pom
xml file and paste it here okay and what
this dependency contain it's also
containing the group ID so this j-unit
you know framework whenever it's created
g-unit people has given it some you know
group ID artifact ID and the version we
are using okay and as soon as you will
hit save here just observe what is going
on in here it's going to add all the jar
files which is j-unit jar file version
14.12 for you automatically okay so i'm
going to just click Save and whenever I
click Save you can see it has downloaded
this maven dependency for us and inside
this maven dependency we have the j-unit
4.12
jar file inside this maven dependency
and this happened due to the addition of
these dependencies which we have added
for g-unit and now when we go to our app
test a java class you will see all the
errors will go related to you know J
unit jar files right so once again we
can do this so I'm going to remove these
dependencies and when I click Save here
see what happens here so I'm going to
click Save and now all the maven
dependencies are removed from our
project and once again when we go to our
app test dot Java class it's going to
once again give us these errors okay so
once again add these dependencies here
and click Save and it's going to
download all the dependencies and added
in the project ok so this is how you can
create your first maven project inside
your Eclipse IDE and this is how these
dependencies
work in maven so that's it for this
video we are going to see some more
features in the later video so stay
