last three videos I have shown you with
your QT C++ cui application how you can
connect this lift box and the table view
and a combo box with the SQLite database
so for example I click this load data
button and my data is loaded which is
there in the database in the list box
and in the table also and in this combo
box
also today I am going to show you how to
transfer or how to show the
corresponding data values in these text
boxes when you select some data or
corresponding data here I want to show
the corresponding data of this name to
the line added or the these text boxes
so let see how my database looks like
and I am showing the list of name in my
combo box right now so you can see this
list of names and the same list you can
see it here also so I want if I select
some name from here for example PETA the
corresponding values for example his
employee ID his surname his name which
is Peter and his age should come or
should be loaded in these line edits or
the text boxes so how can I do this I
will show you today and let's get
started so first of all what I need to
do is I will select my combo box right
click it and I will go to slot and I
will select this current index changed
and with is having the argument to
string there is one more current index
in function here but with int but we
want this Q string argument function so
select it and click it and we reach to
this combo box current index change
event here let me make some space and
first of all what we need to do is we
need to transfer our selected item in
the combo box to our Q string so I will
declare Q's string Q string and for
example I name my Q Stringer's name is
equal to UI and then I will take the
name of my combo box this is the name of
my combo box and then I will select the
current text in the TEC combo box okay
so whatever text is there in the combo
box I will transfer this text in the Q
text or q string which is having the
name name now after that what I will do
is I will take this name and perform
some query and extract the data from the
database corresponding to this value and
show it in the line edits for that I
will I am going to take the same code
which we have been using quite
frequently so for example I have shown
you how to save data update or delete
data go one of that function of button
click event right click go to slot and
click and here I have written the code
for executing the queries so the
structure will be same thats why i am
copying
all the all the code from here and I
will pass or I will paste it in this
combo box current and exchange event so
after this line of code I will paste all
the code here and we don't need this
thing so we will just delete it and I
will explain all the things so don't
worry
so just formatted the code and now so
they are we here ok so now what we will
do is after we have taken the name from
the combo box we will declare our login
object to call these connection open and
connection close function and if this
connection is not open then I will show
the the message failed to open the
connection and then I will open the
connection once again with the database
con which is this object dot con open
function and then I will declare a cue
string query object and I will prepare
up query so I will write to query dot
preparer and here I will prepare a query
so this thing or this query we need to
change so I will delete all the query
and we will prepare a new query and here
I don't need this message so when we
prepare a query and then we execute the
query we show that whatever where e we
want to execute so this is the basic
structure so if you don't want to follow
along just copy and paste this code if
you are following these videos okay and
here first of all let me write a query
so I will write
select star from my database table name
which is employee info and I have pasted
it here so let's do it once again and I
will paste it here and then I will write
where where we are loading the name in
my in the combo box so i will write name
the column name of name column is equal
to single quote and double quotation and
plus plus and in here I will pass the
string I am getting from the combo box
so so the query is simple select star
from your table name where whatever
column name
you are showing in the combo box then
the name of that is equal to the value
you are taking in this cue string okay
and once this is done then you execute
the query and all the data you will get
for the corresponding name right then in
this if condition you execute the query
and then you write while query which is
my query object dot next so while we are
getting the data then we show the data
in that line I did so here what we will
do is just go to the UI pick or select
your your line edit and just take the
name or copy the name of this line edit
for example employee ID text I deeds is
the name of this line edit and once
again I will go to the function the same
function and here in the in this while
loop I will paste it here and here
before this I will write UI because this
is the part of or UI this is the name of
our UI or align a bit and then we say
set text and what value we will set here
we will set query query dot value and
value will be 0 because we are taking
the employee ID which is column number 0
so we will give the index to these
column so this is first column is the
0th index name is 1 surname is 2 age is
3 so 0 1 2 3 that's why I am writing
here 0 okay and then because we are
transferring it into the line edit we
need to convert this to string so to
string and the same thing we I will do
for the rest of my text boxes also so 3
more times and I will change the name of
my text boxes second text box name was
txt name and the third text box name was
txt surname and the food text box name
was
pxp age okay and here we will change the
index so employee ID was at first
columns of 0 name name was our second
column search index 1 surname was the
third column so index 2 and age was the
fourth columns index 3 so you do that
and after this while loop don't forget
to close the connection with the
database and if this query is not
executed we will show the error message
okay so I will just select all these
code and if you want you can pause the
video and copy the code this is all the
code you need to transfer the data into
the line edits corresponding to the
selected value in the combo box I will
build and run my program once again and
hopefully there will be no errors ok I
will give my username and password which
this is the project we are working on
and now we will load our data in this
combo box and in this sum list box and
this table and when I select some name
here his corresponding data should
appear here so you can see already the
mark is our employee ID 1 lakish open my
database so mark is our employee ID 1
his surname is Henry and mark name is
already there and his age is 43 let's
try and select some other name for
example John and you can see the data
corresponding to John is there in the
line I did some other name Peter you see
here the values changes
okay so like that you can transfer or
you can show the corresponding value
which you select in the combo box to the
line I did I hope you have enjoyed this
video and keep watching these videos
maybe in the next video I will show you
how to show the data in this line I did
when you select some cell in the table
so stay tuned and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
