last few videos I have been showing you
how to create a login page using your
visual basic windows form application
and MySQL database so till now I have
shown you how to check connection with
the database and it shows the message
successful connection if our Visual
Basic project is connected to the
database and validate user name and
password with the database as username
and password and when I click login
button and if the username and password
matches the username and password in the
database it opens the second form now in
this video I am going to show you how to
save your data in the database using
these text boxes and this button so
suppose you want to add some data in the
database using your Visual Basic windows
form application in this video I will
show you exactly that so let's get
started so in the last video itself I
have shown you how to create the second
form right and I have also shown you how
to create this sign out button so that
when you click the Sign Out button it
goes to the first form now in this video
just you need to add these things so
what you need to do is add some labels
and suppose I have this table in the
database right I have the database and I
have the table in the database called II
data and I have this column e ID name
surname and H another username password
gender date of birth and other things
suppose I want to enter some new data
for a ID name surname and age so till
now I have 14 entries in the database
till
9:14 I want to add employee ID 15 using
my visual basic windows form application
so what I you need to do first is take
some labels to write your column name
data so I'm adding a ID name surname and
age which is there which are already
there in the database these are the
columns EW I name surname and age and
add some text boxes so that we can enter
the values which we want to save in the
database and I have already changed the
name of these text boxes according to
their use so the first X boxes is text
box underscore e ID for employee ID
second text box is for text box name
third text box name is textbox under for
s name which is surname and fourth text
box name is text box underscore age
which is for age and just take a button
this button when we click this button it
should save the data in the database
right so that is for saving the database
now just double click this button and in
here we are going to write the code to
save the data in the database but first
as we have imported this MySQL data dot
MySQL client we need to once again
import this to our second form so just
add this line or add this import to the
second form import MySQL the data dog
MySQL client and we need to declare
these two
variables so I will just copy it and
explain them at the top of your class so
after the Declaration of public class
form 2 you can declare these variables Y
first variable is them MySQL con as my
skill connection which is the connection
to the database which will accomplish
the connection to the database and this
is dim command as my skill command which
will help you to execute a query to the
database ok so just add these two lines
as you have done in the form 1 if you
don't know how I have added these things
and how I've used these things you can
watch my last videos and you will be
able to understand what I have done here
now once again in this button click
event I want to write the code so what I
am going to do is I'm going to copy the
code which I have written in the login
button action perform this is the code I
have shown you when I have shown you how
to create a login page right so I'm
going to copy all the data and because
most of the things would be repeated in
saving the daughter like the connection
and the command so I will copy this and
I will show you step by step what to
change in this code right so first of
all I will make it little simple I am
going to delete all this commands and
I will delete this end while loop and
now I will go to through the code and I
will show you how to write the code
so in this button click event just
create a new instance of your MySQL
connection so this is the variable which
we have declared MySQL connection and in
here you are creating the new instance
of MySQL connection so just write your
MySQL connection which is this variable
is equal to new MySQL connection right
and then just copy this bicycle corn
here dot connection string is equal to
the connection to the server which is
your MySQL server this line I have
already described you number of times in
the last video this line is used to
create the connection with your Maskell
so now declare a variable called dim
reader as my SQL data reader this will
read the data from the database so
declare this here and in the try-catch
block so just write a try and a catch
block so just write this Calton here
which what basically do is if any
exception occurs while executing your
query it catches the exception and shows
the message and once the query is
executed it disposes the connection so
that you are ready to use it for the
another connection so just write this
code and this try to catch the exception
so if you can copy in so you can pause
the video and copy this code and this
try block from here
now and the tribe love what we are going
what we are doing is we are opening the
connection with the database so I'm just
hoping this my school corn dot open this
opens the connection to the database and
then I declare a string variables which
will hold my query so I declare them
query as string and I will copy this
query here is equal to I will write a
new query in order to insert the data
into the database so I will delete my
old and I will write a new query here
and and say insert into dot abased dot e
dot Da so this database is the name of
my database which is this database and
edata
is my table names database dot e dot
right insert into database dot e data
and then I will provide the column names
in which I want to add my daughter first
column name is Eid second column name is
name third column name is surname and
fourth column name is age right so if
you see my column names PID name surname
and age and if you are wondering why I
have written all these things in small
letters when you are passing SQL query
it doesn't matter if you write them in
capital letters or small letters it is
not case-sensitive so your query to the
Maya spell database is not
case-sensitive so you can write this e
ID as capital also and small loss okay
so my query till now is insert into
database dot e dot and in the bracket I
have
enter the name of the column e ID name
surname and age then I will write values
and in the bracket I will pass the
values which I will enter in the text
box so first value will be the name of
the Eid textbox so first of all just
give single quote and in between just
give double quote and in between just
give this and sign and in between you
need to give the name of your text box
so just write text box underscore PID
which is the name of my text box right
so text box understood PID okay
in a fake in the same way I will enter
name surname and eh also so we give
former and I will copy and paste sorry I
will copy and paste this value once
again
here and comma copy and paste once again
and comma V and paste once again and I
need to just change the value of these
text boxes so this is text box name and
I forgot to give dot txt here so just
write textbooks name then by dot txt for
T take the text from the ducklings and
here also in the text box for Eid you
need to give the name of the text box
dot text right in the third field is my
textbox named for the surname dot text
and in the fourth field textbox name is
Paige still textbox named JH dot
text okay so now my query is complete so
I will go through the query once again
just right insert into data dot key data
which is the table name and then in the
bracket just write the name of the
column in which you want to enter the
data or save the letters of Eid name
surname and age which are the name of my
column in my II data table then write
values so I had some spelling mistakes I
have corrected values and in the bracket
just write the name of your text box not
text in this format white comma the name
of the second text box name which is
text box name dot txt comma the third
text box name which is textbook for name
dot txt comma the name of your fourth
text box name which is text box each dot
txt right so this is if ready then just
write command is equal to MU my SQL
command which is this command where you
which we have declared above right dem
command as my skin c'mon so just write
command is equal to new my screen come
on and in the bracket we passed two
arguments first is the query which we
have written here this one copy and
paste it here and second is the
connection with the database you just
copy this connection from here and paste
it here then we declare a reader just
copy this reader variable from here is
equal to come on dot execute
right and discount you don't need so I
deleted and now you can show the message
that your data data is saved into the
database so I will say message box dot
show and I will say data saved okay so
if your data is saved then this message
will be shown and if some exception
occurs in saving the database it will
catch the exception here and if you show
the error message from here okay so this
is the code to save the data in the
database so if you want you can pause
the video and just copy this code from
okay now I'm going to run my program
blow to my first form which is login
form I provide my username and password
which is correct and opens the second
form now I will open my database which
is here until now I have employee ID 14
so I have 14 employee IDs already there
now I want to enter the fifteenth
employee ID so I will add employ ID 15
name some name and surname and E and
when I click this Save button
we see the message data saved that means
your data is saved into the not of a
success fee not to check this data what
you need to do is booboo your table and
you need to refresh your table so just
take this refresh button and now you can
see whatever you do data you have
entered here 15 mark
and the surname Hines and 8:34 is
entered into the daughters now for
example I am going to enter or ads or
save up some more dot up employee ID
sixteen you name is some name and
surname is some surname and age is for
example 45 and I say save and database
that I said if you see this message
status eight and once again i refresh my
database and you can see here employed
in sixteen and name is Julie and surname
is Peters and age is 45 so in this way
you can save the data into the database
using your visual basic windows form
application and MySQL database I hope
