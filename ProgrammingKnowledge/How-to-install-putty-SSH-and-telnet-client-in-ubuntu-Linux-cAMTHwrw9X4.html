how to install putty or putty on your
Ubuntu operating system so what øt does

you want to access your system remotely
so for example you have this Ubuntu
operating system and you also have one
more open to operating system or you
have a Windows operating system which is
connected to this Ubuntu operating
system via network and if the other PC
has a SSH server then by using this
putty client you can access that Windows
PC or open to PC remotely if you can
ping it you would be able to access it
via / declined so let's see how we can
install it just open your terminal and
just give this command so write sudo apt

press ENTER and give your password and
press enter and it will install the
putty on your system it will ask for the

you will be able to see this client so
if you have the ssh server running on
the other machine then you will be able
