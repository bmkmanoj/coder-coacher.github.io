video I will show you how to use a
progress bar using your visual basic
windows form application so let's get
started first of all I will go to the
toolbox and I will drag and drop a
progress bar from here into my form and
I will resize it a little and then I
will take a three buttons one two and
three and I will take two labels one and
two labels and I will take two text
boxes so one text box and second text
box and first text label a name I will
change it as increment and second text
box name I will change it as interval
okay
now what I will do is I will change the
text of this button first button it text
is start second button text is stopped
and the third button text is clear and
once again I will go to my toolbox and I
will drag and drop our timer from here
pick a timer and drop it into my form
and you will see this timer will go down
and not directly into the fall now I
will write the code for this start
button so just select this timer one and
just see the name of this timer is time
of 1 so I will select the start button
double click it and here I will write
time of 1 which is the name of my timer
dot start
okay and then once again I will go to
the forum and I will select the stop
button and double click it and I will
write timer one dot stop and once again
I will go to the forum and I will select
this Clear button and here I will write
timer 1 dot stop and I will write prog
progress bar one dot value is equal to
zero so it will clear the progress bar
now I will click this time a 1 from here
and double click it and we go to the
timer tick event in here I will write
progress bar dot increment so increment
we will increment our progress bar
whatever value we will give here so just
copy the name of this textbox and just
paste it inside this bracket dot txt
okay and then in the next line I will
write timer 1 dot interval and is equal
to whatever I will write in the text box
for interval which is this text box so
this is text box 2
and I will say textbox to dot txt so now
I think our code is ready let's try and
run the code so for example I write it
that my timer should increment or my
progress bar should increment by the
factor of ten and it should increment
every one second okay so now I start my
progress bar and you see here it's
increasing very fast let's give the
interval of one and an increment of one
also first of all here it clear the
progress bar and start it once again you
see it's increase increment every one
increment let's give the interval ten
and clear the progress bar and just
start it you see and thousand clear the
progress bar and start progress once
again and now it increases every second
so this interval is taking the time in
milliseconds right so thousand
millisecond is equal to one second
that's why it's incrementing the time
every second now and this is the
increment by the factor of 100 so for
example you write 50 here then once
again when you clear it will go once
again 50 and then 100 okay so in this
way you can create a progress bar with
the help of timers and buttons I hope
