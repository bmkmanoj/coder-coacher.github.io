you how you can download and install
Redis on your Mac operating system so
let's get started and let's see how we
can install Redis on our Mac so first of
all open up your favorite browser and
search for Redis and the first link
which will appear here will be from
Redis dot you so we will just click this
link which is ready Scott IO and here we
can see the homepage of Redis what we
want to do here is we want to go to that
downloads section so we will just click
this option will download and then when
we scroll down a little we can see this
downloads button but don't click this
download button yet we will see how to
install the Redis on our Mac by
scrolling down a little so when we
scroll down a little here you can see
the installation steps for Redis so
first we need to download this tar file
and then we need to unzip or unter this
tar file and then we need to make the
Redis binaries right now let's see what
is the latest version at the time of
making this video for the red is so we
can see in the Downloads button that
four point zero point zero is the latest
stable version at the time of making
this video right so we will install the
four point zero point zero version of
Redis now sometimes this W ket command
may not work on your Mac operating
system so we will use the curl command
to download this star file okay so
instead of W gate we will use the curl
command and then we will follow the same
procedure as described here with some
additional commands okay so what we will
do first is on my desktop for example or
at your chosen location just
create a folder so I'm going to create a
folder and I'm going to name it as Redis
okay so inside this Redis directory I'm
going to just download this tar file and
unter it and then make the binary is out
of it okay
so then once I have this folder I will
just see the info get the info and then
just see what is the path of this Redis
directory and I'm going to copy it and
then I'm going to open our terminal so
just open a terminal and then just CD to
this Redis directory so because it's on
my desktop I can just use this old
location so user and then whatever is
your user name and then forward slash
desktop and then forward slash where
this I just need to write for slash
Redis and then I'm inside this red is
folder right now we will do the LS and
there is nothing inside this Redis
folder and let's just open this folder
so we will see what's happening inside
this folder okay so let me just resize
it so we will see all the things which
are happening here and now we will just
give a curl command so just right turn
and then - OH
and then the location of this tar file
so just copy this URL from here which is
there on the downloads page without W
get okay so just copy this URL and then
paste it here on the terminal and then
press Enter which is going to download
this tar file and once it's downloaded
we will just unter it so you can see the
star file is downloaded right and - on
target or extract it we will use this
command so right click copy and then
just paste it here it is going to
extract this tar file and we can see
this folder is extracted and inside this
folder we have some files right so the
next step is to CD to this directly
which is read is minus four point zero
point zero and then make it right so you
can see the step CD to this four point
zero point zero directory and give them
make come on so we will do the same CD
to the where is four point zero point
zero directory and then give a make
command which is going to make the
binaries for the Redis over and let read
it's client and other Redis stuff right
so now the make is finished and at last
I can see this message let's say it's a
good idea to one make test so let's run
make test I'm going to just give this
come on
we just make test and then press ENTER
so now the make test command is also
finished and I can see this message
which says all tests passed without
error right so I know that everything is
ok and now I can start the Redis server
and then where is client ok so let's see
what are the command food for those so
where the server can be spotted from the
source directory and we just need to run
this command which is ready server and
same we need to do for Redis client so
from the source directory we can just
run this ready CLI right so let's do
this so I'm going to open a new terminal
so let me open a new terminal so now I
have two terminals right so on the first
terminal I will just do first of all LS
here or let me clear the terminal first
of all so clear and then I will do LS
here and I can see there is a source
directory here so I will just get this
command
SRC and then red is - so right so red is
- so and press enter which is going to
start the ready server and it has
started listening on this port which is
the default code for Redis which is six
three seven nine and this is the PID of
this ready server right now once again I
will navigate to this directory where I
have installed Redis so it's in my
desktop and then I'll go to the Revit
directory then the red is for point zero
point zero and then I will just keep
this command which is SRC forward slash
where this CLI so let me do LS so I know
that I'm in the same directory and then
I will just write SRC and then read this
CLI and I'm connected to the Redis
server I can see this kind of prompt
here that means I'm connected to my
already server right so first to test
whether everything is working fine or
not you just need to write in here and
then press ENTER and if in return you
get pong then you know that everything
is working fine
you can also set something so for
example set name is equal to max' and
then press Enter and then you can get
the name
so get name and then you can get the
name okay and then you can give the save
command to save everything for example
right so everything is working fine but
for example when I open a new terminal
and I want to run rather CLI for example
from here how can I do it so I just want
to write where this - CLI and I want to
run it so let me just correct the
spelling here so
the CLI and I want to run it and it says
command not found because right now
the rabbit CLI command can be only run
from this directory right so you need to
CD to this directory and then run there
that is come on
so how to solve this problem so this
problem can be solved by running the
make install command inside your
registry so I'm going to just stop the
server for now and now I will once again
do for example PWDs so you know that in
which directory I am in so I'm in my
Redis for point zero point zero
directory right let me clear the
terminal so you will be able to see
better so PWD present working directory
and you can see I'm in my desktop
directory and then there is a Redis
directory here which is this one and
then we are in the red is for point zero
point zero directory right so we have
run here the make and make test command
and you just need to write make install
command here with the sudo privileges so
you just need to write sudo make install
here and then press ENTER and you just
need to give your max password here and
then press ENTER and then it will start
make install command and then you can
see everything is installed and now you
can run ready server and let is see a
live from anywhere right so let me just
close this terminal and close this
terminal also let me just terminate
everything and I will open a new
terminal so that we can check whether
it's running from any other place other
than this Redis folder or not so I will
start two terminals and the first timer
I will write where this
so uh and it starts from my home
directory
and now I will give the Redis CLI
command so just give ready CLI and then
I'm connected to this server right so
everything is working fine and now you
can start already server and you can use
where this CLI command from anywhere
from your directory structure right so
in this way you can download and install
where it's on your Mac operating system
