last video I have shown you how to add
rows to your data grid view and how to
use your data grid view in this video
I'm going to show you how to remove the
selected row from your data grid view so
let's get started I will take a button
from here and I will change its text as
remove a row and I will change the font
size also to bold m-16 so we can see
this button text okay now I will just
double click this button and in here I
will write data grid v1 okay so first of
all instead of this thought a grid view
one I forgot to give the if condition so
I will write if my data grid view 1 dot
so I will just cut it from here and
instead of this if my data grid view 1
dot selected Rose dot count is greater
than 0 then and I will also provide an
else condition okay so if my selected
the row count is greater than 0 then I
will remove the rows otherwise there is
no rows to remove or there is no rows to
select so I will just show the message
messagebox dot show that no rose to
select okay now in this if condition
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
declare a for loop for I as integer is
equal to once again your data grid view
dot selected rows count minus 1 to 0 and
we will step minus one at a time so
right step minus one okay and in this
for loop what we are going to do is we
are going to remove the rows so I will
once again just copy this data grid view
name dot rows dot remove at and in the
bracket what we will give we will give
the index of the selected rows so just
copy this data grid view one once again
dot selected rows and we will give the
index which is I dot index okay so this
is the code and if you want you can just
copy the code from here to him
okay now let's check whether it's really
working or not so I will add some random
names first some name some surname and
once again okay now I selected this row
from here and I want to remove this row
so I will click remove row and my row is
removed okay
and for example I select this row and
boom moved right so you can also remove
multiple rows I selected all the rows
and I say remove row and all the rows
are removed or you can just remove the
rows one by one okay so in this way you
can remove the rows from data grid view
using your visual basic windows form
application I hope you have enjoyed this
