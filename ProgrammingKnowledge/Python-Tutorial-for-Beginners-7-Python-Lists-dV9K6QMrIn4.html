tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I'm going to
show you what are lists and how to use
lists in Python so as the name suggests
list is a collection of values and how
you can declare list in Python you just
need to give the name of the list for
example I want to have the list of names
so I can give the variable name for list
as names is equal to and then the square
bracket and this square bracket will
contain the collection of values and
it's totally valid that this collection
can you know initialize as zeros value
that 0 values so the list can have 0
values also and it can have maximum
values for example tens or hundreds of
values so for example I initialize this
list like this and this list is
initialized as a blank list ok and when
I call this names list once again it's a
empty list because I haven't provided
any value to the list ok so it's totally
valid that you initialize your list
empty now to initialize lists with some
values what you can do is you can just
write name of the list once again and
then you can give the values inside your
list like this so for example I want to
have the collection of names comma some
other name comma some other name
and this can go on and on and on right
so it depends upon you what a number of
values you want to have in the list and
when I press enter your name variable
which is a list is initialized with
these values now when you call this
names variable once again it has these
three values now there is a term called
index in Python for lists which
indicates the position of the values in
your list so the position of this first
name in the list in as any other good
language starts from 0 it doesn't start
from 1 but it starts from 0 and this is
called the index of your list so the
index of this list or the index of this
name mark is 0 index of this name John
is 1 and index of this name Julie is 2
and on the basis of index you can even
call these values so for example I want
to print out this first value called
mark I can just try the name of my list
names and then just give the index so
the index 0 is 1 mark right and when I
press ENTER it returns me the value mark
in the same way when I call index is
equal to 2 names - can you give me Julie
because it starts from 0 1 2 right now
there is a very interesting thing in
Python is that you can even have index
backwards also right so the forward
index starts from 0 1 2 and the backward
index starts from - 1 - 2 - 3 and if
this has more values - 4 - 5 and so
right because why this starts from minus
1 and this forward index starts from my
zero because you cannot have minus zero
from backwards right so this index will
be minus one this index will be minus
two this in legs will be minus three and
you can even call these values on the
basis of backward index also for example
I want to print this name Julie on the
basis of backward index I can just do it
like this I can just give the backward
index which is minus one which starts
from minus 1 right backward index start
from minus 1 and this prints Julie once
again so always remember if you want to
start from or you want to have the
forward index just start from 0 1 2 and
if you want to you know have the values
from the backward index you can you
start from minus 1 minus 2 minus 3 and
so on
okay for example you want to call name
mark you just need to give names and the
backward index minus 3 that will give
mark right now in order to add values
more values to your list what you can do
is you can just call the variable or
your list name and then you just write
dot and just write append and in this
bracket you just pass the value which
you want to add to your list so I want
to add one more value to my name list
and I press ENTER now this name which is
a name of the list dot append which is a
function built-in function in python has
appended or added one more values to my
name
names list and now when I print my names
list it has four values and it has added
this extra name to my list okay now for
example you want to add lists into a
list so for example I have some other
list called age for example ages for age
and I have some edges here 23 comma 12
comma 32 comma for example 11 okay so I
have a list of names and I have the list
of age right and I assign this list and
now I want to add the age to my a names
list how can I add I can just write
names which is the name of my name list
night dot extend and in the bracket you
pass your second list so you can just
pass this like this and press ENTER and
it's totally valid and now when you call
this name list you have extra list of
age here so there is an interesting fact
about Python list is it can contain
different data types so it's not
necessary that you your list
only if you initialize list by string
values it only has to contain you know
string values you and your list can
contain string values also or the
integer values or float values or any
other data type values and it's totally
fine in Python okay so you can define
depth you know different data type in
list
also okay so just remember this now you
must have or you could have done the
same thing for example you want to add
or first of all I will show you how you
can remove items from a list okay so to
remove our item from a list what you
need to do is for example my list name
is names I want to remove some items so
I will just write names dot remove and
in the bracket I will just give the item
value for example I want to remove this
name Patrick from the list okay I will
just say name which is the name of my
list dot remove and then the value which
you want to remove and press Enter
and once again I will call names and now
the value Patrick is gone from the list
right so in this way you can remove
lists from your you know not remove list
but remove values from oil from your
list in Python now for example you want
to print a list you can just call print
method so it's you know you can call
your list using this print method also
so you can just write names and press
ENTER and we'll give print the list of
name like this only okay now in order to
print multiple lists for example I have
the list called names and I have
initialized this list called ages also
right so I can just separate my list by
comma and I will just add one more list
and it will print two lists from me
first list is four names till here and
ii list of ages still here right so you
can either you use single list or
multiple lists or print them like this
okay now in order to get you know I have
shown you how you can get the maximum
value minimum value or the length of the
strings in the last video right on the
list also you can call length matter
Ally N and you can find the length of
the list like you just call le n
built-in function and just pass the list
name as an argument right I will give
the length of the string which is seven
right one two three four five six seven
right so if the list contains seven
values it will return seven this is the
length of the list okay now you can even
print for example max if it applies to
your list you can even call this method
I will give an error because my list is
a mixed list right but the same method
Max and I applied to the list called age
it will give me the answer 42 right
because my list of age only contains the
integer values and the maximum values of
this is 32 okay so you can also apply
built-in function on lists also so I
think in this way you can use list in
Python I hope your enjoyed this video
