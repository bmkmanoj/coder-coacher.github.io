video I have shown you how to connect
your Visual Basic project with the MySQL
database so basically I have shown you
how to check connection with the
database and how to write the code to
check connection with MySQL database and
when I click this check connection
button it shows me the message box which
says if the connection is successful or
not
right now my connection is successful
with the database now in this video I
will show you how to create a login page
a simple login page with your MySQL
database and Visual Basic project
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to enter a user name here and a
password here and when I click this
login button it should check into the
database for the username and password
so this is my MySQL workbench and in
here I have a database called database
and in here I have a table in the
database called II data and there are
two columns in this table for username
and password so basically what I am
going to do in this video is I'm going
to check user name and password from the
database and validate those username and
password whatever I enter here and then
if the username and password is present
in the database I am going to say that
login is successful otherwise if the
username and password is not present in
my database then my validation is not
successful so I will show some message
that login is not successful so let's
get started and let me show you how you
can achieve this
so basically what I have done is I have
taken two labels for username and
password so take two labels from your
tool box these kind of labels and drag
and drop into your form and take two
text boxes from the tool box and drag
and drop into your form plus I have
taken a button in here to validate my
username and password and that's all you
need to do so just take these all items
and just change the text of this label
as user name and password and I have
changed the name of these text boxes as
text box underscore user name for this
text box and text box underscore pass
for this protects box so this text box
is for user name and this text box is
for the password now what I'm going to
do is I am going to select this login
button and double click it and in here I
am going to write the code to validate
my database for the login data so if you
remember in the last video we have
written the code to connect to your
database right so in here we have
declared a object of MySQL connection
class
so this MySQL Korn object I am going to
use in this video also so basically what
I am going to do here is in the last
video I have shown you how to write the
code to check connection so I will just
double click this button and in here I
am copying all the code from here in
between the private sub button click
event to the end sub and I am going to
copy all the code so that I don't need
to repeat all the things once again
and I'm going to just edit this code a
little in order to check the username
and password in the database okay so
basically you have this my SQL con which
is this object from MySQL connection
database and so I have created a new
instance of this my skill corn and in
the last video itself I have shown you
how to provide the connection string
with checks whether of which connects to
the my ex will database with these
credentials of the server which is
localhost in my case username or user ID
password and the dotted base name okay
so if you don't understand these things
just was the last video I've already
explained how this works now I have also
in the last video I have created this
try-catch code or type try catch block
for caching any exceptions for MySQL so
I'm going to take or I'm going to use
this block once again and instead of
just I will delete this message for
successful connection and in here I'm
going to write the code to check the
connection with the database or check
the username and password in the II data
table so let's write the code so first
of all we need to write a command which
execute the query the dot of query the
database right so on the top where we
have declared them my skill con as a
MySQL connection just below this I will
write dim once again and I'll name this
as command as
my SQL command okay so this class gives
the ability to query the database so
this now I am going to copy this command
object from here and in my try-catch
block after my connection is open with
the database I will just copy this here
and I will say is equal to new my SQL
command okay this will create a new
instance of the command you can also
what you can do is you can just declare
this on in on top of your try block also
right but it's better to use it after
you open the connection with the
database which is this my SQL cannot
open now this commands takes two
argument one is the query string and
second is this MySQL connection object
so in here we are going to write a query
or what we can do instead is we can say
or just we can say that my dim query as
string so we declare a string variable
here and now what we are going to do is
in this query string we will assign a
query so in this double quote just write
a query
select star from your database dot table
so in my database I have the database
called database and the table name is II
data so that's what I am writing here
select star from the database dot the
table name where then I will check for
the username and password so i will
write username and passwords my username
column a column name is user underscore
name and password column name is
password right so I will write where
user underscore name is equal to and
then I will give here
first of all double quote than a single
quotations then I will say gave this to
n percent signs okay
now this will go other way around here I
will give
first of all single quotes so this was
earlier then I will give single quotes
and in between double quotes and then I
will say this I will give this M %</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
