tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to add analog and digital clock
widget to your Android activity and we
are also going to make a small little
app of these analog and digital clock
widget so that on the basis of button
click we can decide which clock we want
to display so just go to your widgets or
palette and in here you will see the
category called
date and time and in here you will see
analog and digital clock there is one
more type of clock which is called text
clock it works almost similar to the
digital clocks so if you know how to use
digital clock you will be able to you
know work with this text clock also so
in this video I will just take analog
and digital clock but you can also use
text clock in a similar way so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to drag and
drop this analog clock widget first and
digital clock widget okay and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
button and on this button click event
what I am going to do is I am going to
show or I am going to display or the
widget on alternate button click so I
can name my button as swap clock for
example okay now all three widgets are
here so I can go to my Java file which
is mainactivity.java and in here
I am going to add these three variables
for the button clock of
which is analog clock and digital clock
you
so now all these variables are created
now we just need to write a method on
this button click which can swap these
clocks so we are going to write the
method public void on button click
listener for example no argument we are
going to pass and in here we will cast
these three variables once again so
you
so now we have casted our three
variables and now we will add the
listener to our button variables so I
will just take this button submit
variable and we will add set
onclicklistener to this button and
inside the set on click listener we will
set a new on click listener okay and
inside this on click method what we are
going to do is we are going to check
this digital clock so if this digital
dot get visibility and if it's this
digital plus dot gone then we will make
it visible so in our if condition we
will make our digital clock visible so
digital dot set visibility and we will
make it visible so digital clock dot
visible okay at the same time we will
you know set the visibility of analog
lock clock to gone okay so analog clock
or analog dot set visibility and analog
clock dot gone else we will do the
opposite
okay so else and in here we will do just
the opposite of the this action which is
we are going to disable digital clock
and make visible the analog clock okay
now we just need to call this method
inside our on create
method and now we are going to run our
program so now our app is running you
can see for the first time both clocks
are visible and they dynamically runs so
if here the time changes this clock time
also changes okay now let's check the
functionality of this button so when I
click swap clock this a digital clock is
not active but analog clock is active
right now once again I will click swap
clock and now my digital clock is active
and analog clock disappears right so on
this button click one clock appears and
other clock disappears right so in this
way you can use this analog clock and
digital clock in your Android activity I
