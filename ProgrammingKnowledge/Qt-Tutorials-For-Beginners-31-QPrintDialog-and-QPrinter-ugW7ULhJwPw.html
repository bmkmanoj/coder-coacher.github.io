to roll for beginners and in this video
we will learn how we can use cue printer
class and cue print dialog class in QT
now the cue print dialog class provides
a dialog for specifying the printer
configuration and cue printer class will
help you to print he or whatever
document kind of a painting so what we
are going to do is we are going to use
the cute notepad demo which I have been
using in the last couple of videos and I
will go to my main window dot UI file
and in here in the file menu I will
provide a separator first and then I
will just provide a printer submenu so I
will just say print ok and press ENTER
and then this print action is added here
and I will right click on this action
print action and then go to slot and
then I will choose triggered and click
OK and in this action print triggered
function first of all I want to declare
the object of cue printer and then I
will use cue print dialog to show the
dialog box but to use a printer class
you just need to add this print support
to your project so go to your project
file which is your dot P ro file right
so go to this project file here and in
here after core and GUI you just need to
add one more library which is print
support so just write print support here
ok and this will allow you to use print
queue printer class and queue print
dialog class now you can go to your main
window dot CPP file and add the header
first so just include the
some cue printer header and q print
dialog header so just write include qu
printer and then we will include Q print
dialog class so just write include Q
print dialog okay
so just add these to drink Q printer and
Q print dialog and don't forget to add
this print support and save this project
file before adding these two files right
now we will go to this trigger the
function and then first of all we will
declare object of Q printer so just
write Q printer and we will name it as
printer itself and then in the next line
what we are going to do is we will use
this printer and then we can set the
printer name first of all so you can
just write set printer name and if you
know the name of your printer you can
just set it here so I will just write
some random text here but if you know
the name of your printer you may give it
here so just I will just write desired
printer name right something like this
but you may want to add the name of your
printer now in the next line what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add to print
dialog so that we will be able to see
this queue print dialog and choose the
options so just write Q print dialog and
I will name it as dialog itself so
dialogue and then I will just pass this
printer object here as a reference so
just write and and then pause this
printer here and then second argument it
takes is the parent so just write this
here okay now in the next line we will
check if whatever printer we have chosen
is
or not so we will just write if dialogue
dot exact is equal to Q dialogue then we
will just call this rejected thing so
just write rejected and if it's rejected
we will just return okay
so simply return we don't need to go
forward if this is rejected okay
otherwise we can just use the text or
which is in text add it so just call
text add it and then print it so just
call a function called print and then
pass this printer as our reference so
just write printer here okay so this
will be the code for showing the print
dialog and then you may move forward
with your printing options right so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to run my
application and let's see what happens
and by the way I will just copy this
code and I will paste it into this text
add it here and I will try to print this
code okay so I will just paste this code
which I have copied and then I will go
to file and then I will choose this
print option which will give me this
kind of print interface right now in
here you may be able to see different
option it depends upon your computer
configuration you may be able to see
some different you know printing option
for now I will just use a microsoft XPS
document right but in your case you may
also see some PDF file printer or
something like this okay so I'm going to
choose Microsoft XPS document writer and
for example I want to save my document
in the project file so I will just copy
the path from here and then I will open
this and
I will just click print and then here I
will just give the project folder
address and in here for example I want
to you know save my document so I will
just say print doc for example and let's
see if it's saved or not so I will just
give littles so we can see it at the
same time right so let's see we if we
can see it so just justice and I will
just click Save and you can see it's
saved here which is this one right so I
will open this document and you will be
able to see this kind of document here
okay so in this way you can use a queue
printer class and queue print dialog
class in QT to print your document so I
hope you enjoyed this video please rate
