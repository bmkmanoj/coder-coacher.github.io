show you how you can download Microsoft
Windows 8.1 operating system in your
computer so if you even want to download
Microsoft Windows 8 or Microsoft Windows
7 operating system the procedure will be
same so on whatever operating system you
are just open the browser of your choice
and search for Windows 8.1 evaluation if
you want to search for Windows 8 just
write Windows 8 evaluation ok and search
for it and the first link you will find
here is TechNet dot microsoft.com
slash evil center so just click this
link here
and in here what you need to do is you
need to sign in to download this 90-day
trial for Windows 8.1 Enterprise Edition
ok so just click this sign-in button
here and log in with your Microsoft
account or whatever account you are
registered in Microsoft Windows or you
can even make a new account for you for
free and it's really easy to make a new
account on this Microsoft website once
you have your account just login with
your account I will log in with my a
email and my password so so once you are
logged in with your credential in this
Microsoft website or you can you have
already made your account and sign in
with that account then this but you will
be able to see this button and in here
it says register to continue so I will
click this register to continue button
and in here you need to just fill this
form in order to download the Windows
8.1 or even you can download windows 8
Enterprise Edition or Windows 7
Enterprise Edition and there is one more
download you can do so for now I am
downloading Windows 8.1 but it will be
same for Windows 8 or Windows 7 so just
fill this form why are you I mean why do
you want to download this or operating
system you are running currently just
give this and the version of software
you would like to download 64-bit and to
subscribe communication below your
preferred delivery format so I will
leave it as default maybe I will click
this subscribe
and I will say continue and here it will
ask for the language in which you want
to download I will say English and
continue
and then you will see the link and when
I click this link my download of this
ISO file for Microsoft Windows 8.1 is
started here in here you can see here so
it's a fairly big file you can see 3.7
GB so it will take some time to download
for whatever speed your internet is I
mean it depends upon the speed of your
internet how much time it will take but
once it is downloaded you will be able
to install it in York system or you will
be able to even install it on your
virtual machine and evaluate this for 90
days you can use it for 90 days and
after that either you want you need to
register it or you need to buy this
Windows 8.1 so it is free for 90 days
and in 90 days you can do a lot and you
can you know learn a lot if you have
some small tasks which can last for I
mean which can be done in 90 days you
can do it like this so I hope you have
