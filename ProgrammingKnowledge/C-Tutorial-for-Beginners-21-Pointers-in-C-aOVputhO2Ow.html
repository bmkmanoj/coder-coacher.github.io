show you what is a pointer and how we
can use pointer in C++ so first of all
let's see what is a pointer a pointer is
a variable whose value is the address of
another variable so let me just paste
the definition and then we will look
what is a pointer I will explain you so
once again what is a pointer a pointer
is a variable whose value is the address
of another variable right now for
example you I think you might know that
whenever you declare a variable its
value is stored in the memory somewhere
right so whenever you declare war is
equal to zero for example how you can
show the address of the variable where
this variable is stored so you can show
it by just writing this and sign before
your variable and then you will be able
to see the address of the variable so
once again let's build our program and
when I run this program you see this
hexadecimal number this indicates the
memory address where there this variable
is stored okay so this indicates the
memory address of this variable now the
pointer when it comes to pointer pointer
indicates or pointer is a variable so
you declare a variable whose value is
the memory address of the other variable
right so this is the memory address so
basically when you declare a pointer it
will its value will be the memory
address of other variable and why we do
it because whenever you assign some
value to a variable it's 4 and once
again you assign it to some other
variable its value is not fixed for
example whenever right now I have
variable here bar is equal to 0 and you
can assign bar is equal to 20 also right
but whenever you assign this to this
here the address will remain the same
but the value will change right so the
pointer enables us to point the memory
address and whatever the value of value
stored in that memory address will be
indicated or when will we point it by
the pointer right so let me give you an
example how you can define a pointer you
can define a pointer with this asterisk
or star sign and then you can give the
name of the variable so for example I
want to declare a integer pointer so I
will write int then this test takes and
then I will give the name for example
int P for indicating int pointer okay
now when I assign some value to this
pointer so we always assign a value to
the pointer which is the address of
other variables so what we can do is we
can write in P is equal to the address
of this variable and how we achieve
or how we have xx
the address of this variable by using
and sign before your variable just copy
it and paste it here so our pointer
definition is true now right pointer is
a variable whose value is the address so
this shows the address of another
variable right now when when you print
this into P pointer what will it show it
will show the address of the variable
right this variable so first of all
let's print it like this and copy this
and paste it here and when I just
compile this program and run it you can
see here the first address and second
address are same right so what we have
done is we have assigned the address of
this variable to this pointer and that's
what the pointer does it stores the
address of another variable right now if
you want to access the value of the
variable for example you want to access
the value of this variable using this
pointer so the value value of this
variable is 20 let's make it 100 for
example by and for example you want to
access this value using this pointer how
you can do it you can just try it
the same definition of pointer Astrix
this asterisk and then int P once again
right and then when you compile your
program this Asterix and this int P
pointer will show the value of this
variable of value which is stored at
this address right so let's see it's 100
right now okay so this is showing the
value of this address now let's try to
change the value of this variable var
let's give it a value for example bar is
equal to 20
once again bar is equal to 20 and once
again try to print the value of this
pointer and the address of this pointer
once again I just copied and pasted the
same line from above right and when I
compile this program and run this
program you will see him the address
always remains the same that means the
pointer is accessing the value from this
address but the value stored in this
address is changed when we assign some
value to variable so that means address
of a variable always remains same but
you can change the value stored on this
particular address so I think this is
the basic of pointer in C++ they are
much and more about pointers and we need
to read it in details but this is the
basics of pointer I am and I hope you've
understood the concept behind pointer
and I hope you have enjoyed this video
