show you how you can download and
install latest version of Python on your
Windows 10 operating system so first of
all you just need to open your favorite
browser and search for python and the
first link which will appear here will
be from python dot o-- r-- g-- you just
need to click this link and in here you
can find more information about python
right and you can see here python 3.5
point 0 is the latest version at the
time of making this video and Python 2.7
point 10 is the legacy version ok so I'm
going to go up here and I can see this
download button and I can choose the
windows option from here ok so just
choose this windows option and now you
can see various options for the
installers and you know web based
installer or
executable installer or embeddable
installer so what we want is we want to
have this executable installer which is
64-bit so just click this link which
says windows x86 - 64 executable
installer ok so just click it and the
save the executable file and once your
executable file is downloaded you just
need to click on your executable file
and I will minimize the browser and now
our installation setup is started so you
just need to click install now but
before that you just need to check this
option which says add python 3.5 to path
ok so just check this option and then
click install now
ok and it's going to give you this
option to provide user account control
you just say yes and now the
installation will
so now python has been installed on my
system and I can see this message setup
was successful so I know that Python is
successfully installed on my Windows 10
operating system so I will click close
and then I will go to this Start button
and then go to all apps here and in here
search for Python so under P category
you can find this Python 3.5 3.5 is the
latest version so just click this option
and now you can see four options here
first is idle which is you can say the
GUI version of Python IDE and second is
the Python command line option so first
of all we are going to open this Python
3.5 command line option ok so just click
this option and it's going to open this
Python shell so to you know execute some
code you just need to write for example
you want to print something you can just
call a function called print and then
you use these bracket after version 3 I
think you need to use these brackets in
order to print something okay and inside
the double quotes you can just write for
example hello world okay and then click
enter and it's going to print hello
world here okay so you know that the
shell is working now let's see how the
idle works in Python which is Python IDE
so just go to all apps once again and
then go to Python once again and in here
this time you just click idle ok so just
click this option and it's going to open
this kind of interface it works almost
the same as the shell
it's more convenient to use okay so in
here also for example we want to print
something we can just write print and
then in the brackets you can just write
your message for example hello world
okay and press ENTER and you can see our
output is printed as an output okay one
thing is to note here is Python doesn't
take semicolon so you don't need to give
any semicolons here so in this way you
can download and install Python on your
Windows 10 operating system I hope you
