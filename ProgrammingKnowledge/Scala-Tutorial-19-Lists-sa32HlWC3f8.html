Scala tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen how to use arrays in
Scala now in this video we will see how
to use lists in Scala
now Scala lists are quite similar to
Scala arrays in a sense that they are
the collection of similar data type
elements right and as lists can have
only one data type elements right but
there are two fundamental differences
between arrays and lists one is arrays
are mutable and lists are immutable
immutable means you cannot change the
element value of list once it's assign
and second is lists represent the linked
lists
whereas arrays are flat so let's see how
we can use lists so as in the case of
arrays you can just write bar or well
and then the variable name for example
my list and then the data type so it's
off datatype lists in our case right and
then the element data type in the list
so we want the list of for example ins
so we can just write int or if we want a
list of string you can write string or
any other data type which Scala supports
right and then you write equals list and
then you initialize your list with the
elements of for example in our case
because it's a list of integers we can
just write 1 comma 2 and we can just
create the list of integer similarly if
we want to make the list of let's say
string so let's say we want to make the
list of name names right so in this case
we can just
you the leader type string here and
instead of using the integers or numbers
you will just use the names for example
so for example now if you want to print
your list you can just simply use print
line and then print your list like this
so I'm going to just print out both the
list so print line my list and paper
print line names and I'm going to run my
code and you can see it prints the first
list which is my list variable and the
second list which is the list of names
now as I said lists are immutable so for
example in case of arrays this operation
will be perfectly fine so when I write
my list and then in parentheses I use
the index of the list so lists are also
0 indexed so for example I can just
write my list and in the parenthesis the
index of whatever element I want to
change and then let's say I will just
assign a different value to it at index
0 and you can see it shows us error
which says value update is not a member
of list end so we cannot change the
value of the list so this is the basic
difference between arrays and the list
now you may ask if I'm not allowed to
change the value of lists how they are
useful so for example I want to append
in the beginning or the end of the list
how can I do it right so let's see how
we can do it so let's say I want to just
add some number at the beginning of this
list so this is the list and I want to
just add 0 let's say in the beginning of
the list so how I can do it
so there are two fundamental building
blocks of a list one is a nil which we
will see in a moment and another is a
cons so we will see the use of cost
right now
so what I am
to do is I'm going to append a zero and
then I'm going to just write double
colon and in Scala it's called a cons
okay so this cons is used to prepend
zero in the list my list right so I'm
going to just save this and then run
this program and then it prints zero you
see so zero is prepended and then you're
less content but keep in mind so let's
say I print the value of list once again
and run the code and you can see the
content of my list is not changed so
what it's going to do is if you want to
assign the value of the console of my
list and zero to another list variable
it's possible but the changing of the
you know list is not possible so we are
not changing the value of my list
first we are just prepending zero to the
existing list which will not change my
list itself now the second thing I said
about list is nil so nil is also of type
list so I'm going to just print for
example nil first of all so you can see
it's an empty list so what you can do is
it's you can create a list using this
nil value so for example I can just
write 1 cons any other number cons any
other number cons and this is going to
create a list of 3 numbers which is 1 5
and 9 so whenever you cons anything to
the nil is going to create a list now
let's see some of the method associated
with the list so if I want to find out
for example first value of the list I
can just write head here which will give
me the first value of the list and if I
want to
get the last value of the list I can
just write tail here right so if you are
familiar with linked lists you use head
and tail in case of linked list and
that's why these notations are useful
now if you want to check whether your
list is empty or not you can just use a
method called is empty and this is going
to give you a boolean value if the list
is empty it's going to give us true and
if list is not empty it's going to give
us false right so let's run the code
once again and you can see the results
here so for the my list the head or the
first value is 1 so it's printing 1 now
the second result is interesting so tail
is whatever you get
after removing the first value so the
tail in the case of names is Tom and
John tail in the case of my list will be
2 5 8 9 6 4 okay
so had is the first value and tail is
whatever rest remaining so that's why
you're getting Tom and John here ok and
then we have checked if the name list is
empty or not and it returns us false
right so let's print the tail of the my
list also so we can see and verify the
result so you can see it start with 2 5
8 9 6 4 let's see some other methods
related to the list so for example if I
use reverse method so if I use the
reverse method on the list it's going to
give us the reverse list so it will
start from 4 which is the last element
of the list and it will go up to 1 which
is the first element of the list now if
you want to create a uniform list that
means a list which contains only same
type of elements so
so you can use the fill method for that
so let me show you how you can do it so
I can just write list dot fill and then
I will first write how many number of
element I want in my list so let's say I
want five element and then what is the
element I want in the list so let's say
I want to in my list so list of tools
okay and when I run the program it's
going to give us the list of tools which
we have five elements similarly you can
use other method with lists also so in
eclipse you can just write lists and
then dot and then you will see more
method or two associated with lists so
just go through them and see the
description of you know every method and
whatever method you want to you know
implement you can use it so for example
let's say I want to use the method
called Max here which is going to give
us the maximum of the whole list so you
can see it gives us nine which is the
maximum in the list of integer now let's
see how we can iterate over the list for
example so to iterate over the list you
can just use the name of your list for
example my list and then you can use a
method called for each on your list and
what it will do is it will go or iterate
over every element of the list and
perform the operation which we will
write inside these parentheses so for
example I want to print every element of
the list so inside this parenthesis I
can just write print Ln which is going
to print out all the element of the
lists you can see it has printed out all
the element
of the list so because it's a print line
so so it will print on different lines
in a similar way for example if you want
to just find out the sum of the list so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
define a VAR or variable and then I'm
going to just say sum and it's going to
be of data type int right and the
initial value of the sum variable is
zero okay and then I can just write my
list dot for each sum plus equals and
then this underscore and this means what
we want to do is we want to add each
element of the list so this for each
will iterate over every element of the
list which is indicated by this
underscore and what it's going to do is
it's going to just add this value to the
some variables so it will iterate over
this list one by one and then it will
add to this some variable right so when
we just print the value of sum so let's
say we will just write print Ln and then
we will just write sum here it's going
to give us the sum of the list which is
35 in this case now the next way of
iterating over the list is using the for
loop so you can just write for here and
then you can iterate over the list so
for example I want to iterate over the
list of names so I will just write a
name here which is the iterated element
and then we will just write this arrow
here and then we will just pass the list
name so our list name is names right so
this is this list okay and what we want
to do after iterating over every element
of the list we just want to print out
every element so we will just write
print L n and then we can just write
named him as we have seen previously so
what this for loop does it'll iterate
over each element of this list name and
every time it rates over the element it
will just you know assign the value of
this element to this name variable and
this name variable we are printing right
so this is the list and every iteration
it will be assigned to this name
variable and we are printing this name
here so we are going to just run our
code and you can see it prints out all
the names one by one now you can get the
value of an element based on the index
also so for example I want to print out
the value of element at index zero in
the name list I can do this which is
going to give me the 0th index element
of this list but it's not very efficient
to use this kind of notation but it's
possible so I have just shown you so
this is how you can use lists in Scala I
