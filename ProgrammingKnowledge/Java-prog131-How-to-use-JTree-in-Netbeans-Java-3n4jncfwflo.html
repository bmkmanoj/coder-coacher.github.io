in this video I will show you how to use
J tree with your NetBeans Java code so
let's get started
first of all go to your palette and
select this tree from the palette and
drag and drop into your frame and
whatever size you want just resize your
J tree and by default it looks like this
now I will show you how to use this J
tree to show your folder for example I
want to show some folder and its
structure into my J tree and then I want
to open this file from my j-train any
file I should be able to open from the J
tree so how do I do with that I will
show you right now so once you drag and
drop your J tree just right-click it
before right-clicking it I have to tell
you one thing for showing your folder
into the J tree you need to make a class
into the project so just go to a project
and right click and make a new class
Java class and I will name it as file
system model
okay so just rename this file as file
system model and keep in mind the
spelling because I am going to show you
how to write the code for that also and
just click finish
so it made a blank new file system model
file into your project which is this and
in here you need to enter a code which
is quite long so what I have done is I
have posted that key code into my blog
which is file system model dot Java file
to be used with J tree it's having the
name this and if you don't find this I
will just provide the link below my
video so you could be able to just click
it and come here if you come to my blog
also you can find it under this J tree
label this whole code so what I will do
is I copy all this code from here
talk to Morton just copy and just
instead of this code I will just paste
my code like this
okay and you don't have to do anything
because I have already named my pilot's
filesystem model so I don't have to
change this also so once you made this
java class we will use this Java class
to show the folder of our choice into
the j tree so just once again go to your
frame in which you have taken your J
tree right click it and go down and just
like customized code okay in this one
customized code and you will come to the
customized code section here in here you
can provide you need to provide here
after this J tree is equal to new Java
x-wing J tree you have to write here one
small little code so just write here J 3
1 which is your J tree name variable
name bought
so I pasted this code here j-31 which is
your J tree variable name dot site model
and in the bracket right new file system
model which is this class we have just
made this is that class so cold called
this class here in the bracket new Phi
and in here we will give the path of the
folder we want to show so I will go to
that folder which I want to show you can
choose any folder of your choice just to
copy the path like this and just go to
your Java code once again and paste it
here and just remember to replace these
slashes by double slash okay
so you can once again see the code what
I have written j3 dot site model in the
bracket new file system model which is
made here and in the bracket new file
and in the codes you have to write the
path of your file and just close it and
then press ok and now when you go to the
source of this file
if you find some error here or anywhere
you just need to fix the import so if
you have some error or the red line here
just click it and wherever it goes if it
shows some error then right-click it and
just click fix import this is when you
face some error okay but in my case I
don't I think it's not showing any error
so let's check how our code is working
right now I right-click and run it and
you can see the folder which I have
given is shown here
once again I want to make it a little
bigger so I can see all the part of my
files and then I run my code once again
and you can see I have provided this
part and all the fines which are present
in that folder comes into my J tree and
in the structure which in which they are
present in the folder so let's see and
compare these files are really their
amount so you can see my folder name is
this use a desktop German and here also
been the same file in here I have then
is put security tips PPT and all other
files which resembles from this folder
so in this way you can show the J tree
and you can show some folder structure
into the J tree in the next video I will
show you how to open these file whatever
file you select from the J tree and when
you click this select this file and I
will provide a button here and when you
click the Open File button the file will
be automatically open for you so this I
will show you in the next video so stay
tuned
please wait comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
