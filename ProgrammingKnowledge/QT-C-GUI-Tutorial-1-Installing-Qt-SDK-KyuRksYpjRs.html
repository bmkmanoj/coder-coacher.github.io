tutorial on C++ GUI using cute framework
so what cute framework or QT framework
is a fear framework with the help of
which you can make a good-looking GUI or
graphical user interface which is made
of based on C++ you can use QT for
creating other applications based on C++
but in this video series we will
concentrate more on GUI using c + + + QT
so let's see how you can find Qt and you
can how you can install QT or cute on
your Windows PC so just go to your
google browser and just type in QT and
press search and the first link you will
find is QT - project dot o-r-g just
click it and in here you need to go to
the download section here and at the
time of making this video Qt 5.1 version
is the latest and when you scroll down
you can see the installers so what we
want is this QT online installer for
Windows if you are using other operating
systems like Linux or Mac you can choose
according to that but we are developing
or I am showing this these videos on
Windows so I will just click this link
and after clicking this link 13 MB file
will be downloaded and when you start
installing because
it's a very big file and it will require
the internet connection to download all
the files and install it in your
computer this is just a installation
wizard and once you in start
installation it will take around 20 to
30 minutes it took around 30 minutes in
my case it may take lesser time if you
have the faster PC to install so be
patient and it's just clicking some next
next next buttons and nothing else it
will install QT on the fault location so
once you install QT on your PC just go
to start and you will see QT creator or
cute creator here you can if you don't
see this cute creator here you can go to
the all programs and you can find it
here and just click this cute creator
and when you open this QT it looks like
this and in the next videos I will show
you how to create your first cute C++
GUI program so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
