last video I have shown you how to use
variables in your PHP script and I have
shown you how to use these double quotes
and single quotes using this print
function so I have shown you whenever
you use this double quotes and whenever
you want to print your variable then you
will be able to print this using double
quotes because then this variable will
be passed or parsed whenever you use
double quotes on the on the other hand
and use single quotes your variable
inside your single quote even if it has
the same name as your variable will not
be parsed and it will print out
literally okay so this I have shown you
in the last video and the result of this
was variable dot PHP and I need to save
this first and then in here you see the
difference right so whenever you echo
using double quotes and you use variable
your variable inside your double quote
it will be parsed and your variable
value will be printed otherwise you will
not be able to print this value but for
example you want to print the value
using single quotes and you also want to
use this variable using single quotes
what you can do here is you can just cut
out this variable from here and you can
use concatenation to print out your
variable value so you can just write
hello is equal to in single quotes and
then you need to give this full stop or
point symbol or period symbol whatever
you say so you just give this point or
this will stop here and give your
variable name which is name and then
once again give this full stop and
whatever you write in this full style
will be so this is called
concatenation symbol in PHP so this and
this variable will be joined together
and this will be the joining force in
between your text and your variable so
one like once again when I save it and i
refresh this it shows me some error
because yeah I need to add I don't need
this concatenation symbol here because
I'm not adding any string after this
name but yeah this concatenation symbol
I need so this point or this period
symbol or this full-stop symbol will add
or concatenate these two strings like
this okay
so just remember that whenever you need
to concatenate two strings just use this
and if you are not concatenating you
will not need to use this here and once
again save it and refresh and I can see
the same results right now right so in
this way you can use concatenation
symbol or concatenate two strings now
for example I want to use some HTML to
print out some link or to open us link
or to show a link in PHP so for example
I have I want to do something like this
echo and in double quotes I want to do a
so this is the tag for showing the link
or reference so H rap if you know HTML
you will know what I am talking about
and the name of the link for example W
double w dot
google.com and then after your link name
you just close this tag and then give
your name which will be shown on on the
top of your link so for example google
and then you close the stack by this
okay
so this is a HTML code which I am
writing so if you don't know HTML code
and how to print these links you can
obviously go to my playlist and see the
HTML tutorial or you can google it it's
easy to find how to print this okay so
here what can I do is I can just give a
concatenation symbol and then I can use
those double ports for single quotes and
I can provide a break so that this link
will start from the newline I will save
it and when I ask refresh my it shows
some error double double W so it will
show an error why because your PHP code
will think that this double quote is
ending here and this is some alien alien
text for the your PHP parser because
your string is or you string is starting
from this double quote and in this
double quotes and this will once again
you need to pawn catenate or do
something like this so instead of using
this if you only use single quotes here
single quotes and single quotes and I
forgot semicolon also and then see what
happens I will just refresh and I will
be able to see my link here and when I
click this I will be able to see
hopefully Google know maybe I need to
change
this too HTTP HTTP HTTP colon slash
slash and then maybe my link will be
recognized okay so I will just go once
again and click this link and now my
Google will open right so in this way
you can if you want to use HTML tags
inside your PHP script you can use
single quotes to trim this right so I
will make a convention Oh generally for
me I have the convention that whenever I
need to use this HTML tags I use single
quotes and whenever I want to use some
variables or print out some variables
I use these double quotes here now for
example I want to add this Google as a
variable here for example I can do
something like this I can declare this
and symbol and read Google is equal to
and then I provide the name Google link
for example and end it and I want to use
this in here so I can use my
concatenation operator which is two dots
and in between you can give your symbol
like this part you also need to give the
single code here and single code here to
tell that this single quotes and here
then you concatenate your variable then
once again your quotation is starting
from here and ends here okay and once
again when I run this it will show me
Google link and when I click this Google
will be open in my browser
so in this way you can use this
concatenation operator in your PHP one
one more a little thing is for example I
want to show some escape characters also
so for example you want to print
something like this in double quotes you
want to print hello world and you want
to print it in double quotes right
inside double quotes how can you do or
how can you go about it so for example
you do something like this hello world
it will not print hello world in double
quotes right so when I save it and when
I run this it's not printing my hello
world in double quotes right so what can
I do here
we just give a break so that it's my
hollow world start from the newline I
can just use double quotes here but this
will also not serve my purpose because
that's my PHP script will think that
this will start from here and then from
here so for showing your double quote
you use this escape symbol not this but
this one and in here also whenever you
want to print this double quote here you
initialize it with this escapes operator
or escape symbol and escape symbol in
PHP is this slash so it will print this
like this so save it and once again run
the program and now you will be able to
see hello world in double quotes here
right now for example you want to print
something like this I have two single
quotes and I want to print a it's a nice
day for example yeah but this symbol is
already reserved as a single quote here
and to escape this what you can do is
the same thing you need to use this
escape symbol which is this one and once
you save it you're this single code
symbol will be taken literally okay
so when I just refresh it it says it's a
nice day with this small solution okay
so in this way you can use this
concatenation operator escape symbol and
HTML tag if you want to print these like
this so I hope you have enjoyed this
