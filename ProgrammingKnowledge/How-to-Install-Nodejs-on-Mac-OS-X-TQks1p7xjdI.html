show you how you can install and set up
node.js on your Mac so let's get started
first of all I'm going to open my Safari
browser and then I will open for example
google.com and then search for no cheer
so search for
nogf and the first link most properly
which will appear here will be from nogf
dodgy so just click the website which
says no GF dot o-r-g and here you will
be able to see two versions one is LTF
LDS stands for long term version and
other is the latest version so one we
want to download right now is the LTS
version which because it's supported for
the long term right so long term stable
version right so I'm going to just
download the LTS version in this in your
case it can be different right so let me
download it so now my download is
complete so I'm going to go to my folder
downloads folder and there I can see
this nodejs version fixed point and
point 0 package so I'm going to double
click on it and this is going to start
this kind of wizard so it's really easy
to follow this wizard once this wizard
is open you just need to click continue
here and then read the license terms and
conditions and if you agree with those
license terms and conditions then just
click continue so let me click continue
once again and then it fails to continue
installing the software you must agree
to the license so just say agree and in
the next step
just select install for all users of
this computer and then click continue
and then once again click install which
is going to start installing your
node.js on your Mac in between you just
need to give
your password for your computer here to
authenticate for the installation and
once this is done the installation
process will start and will be soon
completed so the installation process of
nogf is completed now and you can see
the location where no GFF install so the
location where no Jeff is installed is
user local bin node for no Jeff and this
comes with NPM also which stands for
node package manager which is really
important with nogf whenever you develop
your node applications you need to have
this NPM package manager right these are
the location if you want to note them
just note them otherwise just close this
window here and then open your terminal
right so how you can open the terminal
if you see the terminal here you can you
know open the terminal from this bar
from here otherwise if you don't find
this terminal here then go to the finder
so just open the finder and in the
finder go to applications and in the
application just search for terminal so
I'm going to just search for terminal
and I can see this terminal here so just
double-click on in this terminal is
going to open the terminal
right so once the terminal is open we
are going to check whether know Jeff is
installed and which version of node.js
is is installed so just type node - V
here and then press ENTER it's going to
show the version of node which is
installed and in our case we have
installed devotion 6 point 10.0 it can
be different in your case and now we
will see the version of node package
manager which is NPM so just type NPM -
V and it's also going to give you the
version of NPM which is 3 point 10.10 in
my case once both versions are verified
you just see these numbers here then you
just need to type know
here and then press Enter and you you
know you are in the node terminal so for
example I want to print something so I
can just write console dot log and then
in the parentheses and single quotes I
can just say hello world and then the
semicolon and then press ENTER and you
can see hello world is printed here and
after that undefined right so this shows
that no Jeff is installed on your system
and it's working fine right so in this
way you can download and install nodejs
on your Mac I hope you enjoyed this
