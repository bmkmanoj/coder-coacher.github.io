development environment using which you
can develop Java PHP or C++ or many
other programs related to Java so to
install NetBeans IDE what you need is
the basic dependency of NetBeans IDE is
the Java you need to have Java installed
in your order windows operating system
so first of all we will download and

able to see this sir Java I can just
click this Java icon and in here you
will be able to see different versions
of Java so you just need to accept
license and conditions and then you will
just need to install this Windows binary
or Windows executable file if you are
using Windows 8 or 8.1 most probably you
will be having a 64-bit operating system
so you need to choose this last option
just click this and the download will
start and the installation of this Java

called Program Files and in here you can
see this
Java folder in here you will be able to
see our two folders one is jdk jdk
script stands for Java development kit
and the other folder will be JRE which
stands for java runtime environment now
in order to develop Java programs in
your NetBeans IDE you just need to set
these environment variables to your
operating system so just search for
system in your PC and in the system just
click this advanced system settings and
in here go to environment variables and
in the system variables you will be able
to find a variable called path and in
here you just need to copy or you just
need to go to this JDK folder and inside
go to binary folder and copy this whole
path here all the you know binary files
related to Java are there so just copy
this path and just give a semicolon
after your all the environment variables
so just go at the last in this variable
value and give a semicolon and just
paste your folder location same we will
do for the JRE folder so inside this
there will be a JRE folder also and in
here there will be a binary so folder so
just copy this path and then just give a
semicolon and paste this path click OK
click OK and click OK so now all the
environment variables are set now we are

download section you will be able to see
some of the versions of NetBeans IDE
so there are version which you know
which you can download for developing
java SE or java ee or only for c++ or
only for html5 and PHP development but
the one i would prefer is the whole
package which is this one so just click
this download button m in front of this
all section it's a big file or
executable file but later your
difficulties will be less whenever you
want to develop some other software or
languages so just click this link and

some time to download so just wait for
it to download and once it downloaded
you will be able to see this kind of
executable file okay so that means minus

agree with these terms and condition
just click I accept and click Next and
in here also some Thompson condition
click I accept and next and this is the
location where your NetBeans IDE will be
installed and see here one whenever you
have installed Java this JDK folder
location is automatically taken by
NetBeans so that but that's why we have
installed Java in our system so that it
can automatically recognize this JDK
folder just click Next and it's it says
that it's also going to install large
fish which is a server and the location
is default I am going to leave it as
default and click Next and I will click

just leave this checkbox clicked and
click finish and now you can see this
NetBeans icon here right so you can
click this icon to launch NetBeans IDE
just click the cycle

will be able to find a different kind of
project you want to make using Java so
let's click Java and click java
application click Next and in here it
will activate your Java SC
