you how we can download and install a
virtual box on your Mac operating system
so let's get started first of all open
your favorite browser and search for
VirtualBox and the first link which will
appear here will be from virtualbox.org
just click that link and when this web
page opens we will directly see a
downloads section so if you don't see
this download VirtualBox section then
you just need to click this option for
download so just click this downloads
link or button you can say here and then
you will be able to see this download
VirtualBox page right now in here we
have different you know versions of
VirtualBox for different operating
systems and the version for OSX host is
also available so we will download this
OSX host version right so just select
the version with is OSX host and then
click on that and it's going to start
downloading this dmg file so you can see
the dmg file is downloading and it's
about 94 megabytes so it will take some
time to download so I will wait for some
time for the download to complete and
then we will see how we can just install
this VirtualBox so now the download of
this dmg file is complete so I'm going
to double click on this dot dmg file
which we have downloaded and I'm going
to minimize the browser and first of all
it's going to open this dmg file and
then once it's open you will be able to
install it so in some moment you will
see this kind of window and here the you
know instructions are really clear so
you just need to double click on this
icon so just double click on this icon
which you see here and once you double
click on this icon
installation of the VirtualBox will
start so you can see it's verifying the
VirtualBox dot P kg and once it's
verified you will see this window so we
can see this kind of window right the
first thing over for the first warning
it will give you if this package will
run the program to determine if the
software can be installed so we just
need to click continue here and then we
just need to press continue here also
and once you press continue you will be
able to see this kind of window it says
this will take this much amount of space
on your computer and if you agree with
this then you can just click install so
I'm going to just press install here and
now I just need to give my computer's
password so I'm going to give the
password of my Mac operating system and
I'm going to just press install software
ok and now the installation will start
and the installation process is not
really long so it will be completed in
few seconds and once the installation is
complete we will be able to see the
summary first of all so you can see when
you see this kind of green check icon
then you can say it's installed and you
can see this message also that the
installation was successful ok so once
the installation is successful we can
just close this window and we can even
close this window also and you can
either launch the launch pad so you can
just click on the launch pad and then
you will be able to see this VirtualBox
I can here or you can also go to the
Applications folder and there also you
can find it or you can just just right
VirtualBox here and you will be able to
find it ok so there are these three ways
to find VirtualBox and just double click
on the Virtual Box icon here and once
it's open
we can install any other operating
system as a guest operating system on
the VirtualBox right so if you want to
install Ubuntu on your Mac operating
system using VirtualBox you just need to
download the image of the Ubuntu
operating system it's freely available
on their website and then once you have
this image you can create a new machine
for example Ubuntu and you can see it
detects which operating system we want
to you know make and then click continue
and then you will be able to run open to
as a guest machine on your Mac operating
system using this VirtualBox but this we
will see in some other video so I hope
