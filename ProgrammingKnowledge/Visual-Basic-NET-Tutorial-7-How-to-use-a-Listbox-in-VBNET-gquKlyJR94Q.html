video I will show you how to use list
box with your visual basic windows form
application and this is going to be a
very beginner level tutorial so I will
you show you how to use list box how to
add items in the list box how to select
item in the list box and some other
things so let's get started let's take a
list box from our toolbox and place it
here and just resize it and second thing
I am going to take is a button and a
text box okay so I have all the things
and I'm not going to change the name of
the text box I think by now you know how
to change the text box of the tools I am
just going to take change the text of
this button and I will say this is my
add button and whatever I enter in the
text box it should go into this list box
when I press this button so let's double
click this and I will write this box one
which is the name of my list box and
then dot and I will say items dot add
and what I need to add the text in the
text box right so this is the name of my
text box which is text box one dot text
right
so let's run our program first and I add
some name in the text box and I will say
add let's add it to the list box once
again I will add a name to the text box
and it's added to the list box when I
click Add button ok so like this you
could be able to add items to the list
box now let me just show you how you can
select an item from the list box so when
you select this list box and go to the
event here there are some event which
you can perform for using this list box
so for example I am going to use very
basic or inherent event of this list box
just selected and double click it and
when you double click it it shows list
box selected index change event and you
will be able to see here in the event in
the properties just click this button
here for events and you will see here
you will be able to see this list box
selected index change event here there
is a text present here so you buy this
you know that this index is selected ok
so just double click it and here I will
say message box dot show and in the
bracket I am going to show whatever is
there in the list box so I will copy
list box
dot selected item okay and dot two
string okay so whatever I select in the
list box it should show in the message
box so let's try and run the program
let's just add some items in the list
box okay so I have these three items and
when I select some item here you see
here it shows the same name in the
message box so in this way you can
select items in the list box right and
one more thing is called selected index
of the list box so index is something
like I will just explain you what is it
first of all just drives let us one dot
selected index from here okay
and just run your program once again I
will add some text here once again some
text and some is some text and when you
now click this list box for example when
you click this first item in the list
it's a says this is the 0th index
okay so index start from 0 then this is
1 and then this is 2 so index is the
numbering you can say for the list box
and numbering start from 0 so this also
is very helpful when you are going to
use list box in your future projects and
there are many things for you which you
can do with your list box like adding
the database values to the list box and
the and many things which are little bit
more detailed or and little bit advanced
this also I will show you when I will
show you how to connect your visual
basics application with database like
MySQL or some other databases but for
now I think this is it for this video
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
