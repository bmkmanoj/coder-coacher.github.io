show you how to install xampp on your
Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system xampp is a combination of Apache
web server plus MySQL database plus PHP
and perl so if you want to make your web
server of your computer as a local web
server you can make it by installing
xampp to test your website so let's see
how we can install xampp you just need
to go to your browser and just search
for XA MVP and the first link you will
find here is from www.hsn.com X M a
stands for Apache a M stands for MySQL P
for PHP and P for Perl and expands for
the operating system you can use Windows
or Linux or OSX for the installation so
what we are interested in is xampp for
windows so just scroll down and you will
be able to see this download link here
just click this link and download will
start in few seconds so it depends upon
the speeds or of your computer how long
it will take to download so once this
download is complete this file you see
download has started and it will take
some time to download this because it's
more than 100 mb file so once this
download is complete we are ready to
install xampp on our windows operating
system so I have already downloaded this
installer so I will just double click
this and for the first time it will show
an a warning so you need to click more
and you need to click there run anyway
ok and then click yes
and in some moments the installation
will start
so the installation has started I will
just
and in between your installation it will
give you a little these kind of warnings
and you just need to click continue with
installation yes we need to continue
with the installation and click OK here
and then your setup will start so click
Next and these are the these are the
server mysql FTP server tomcat Perl and
PHP my admin these are the tool it will
install when you click Next ok so if you
want to remove anything you can remove
it but generally I like it or like to
check all the things and go further so
click Next and this is the default
location X M will be installed in your
system c colon slash xampp
ok so just remember this folder name
because we are you going to use this
folder name and fold-up location in our
further demonstration so click Next and
click Next and ready to install
so you can click Next here and exempt
will start installing itself now
so this installation will also take some
times to install so I will pause the
video once it will be installed I will
show you how to go further so now our
installation is complete and I want to
launch this control panel for xmp's so
just keep this checkbox checked and
click finish so it will launch this
control panel for your xampp and now you
will be able to see this xampp control
panel like this ok now in here you can
start this Apache web server and MySQL
database connection you just need to
click this start button here and then
Apache will be started it will give you
this small little warning and it says
private networks such as my home you
want to use it and also if you want to
use it on public networks such as
Airport and coffee shops
I generally click click this option also
and I allow access and this will start
this Apache server and to start MySQL
you just need to click this start button
and MySQL will be started also so for
now we only need to run this Apache web
server and MySQL this FileZilla and
tomcat you can use it later whenever you
want to use them but for now we are just
fine with this Apache and MySQL ok so
now once you have started these two
processes you can always stop them by
clicking the stop buttons and they will
be stopped so right now they are running
because you will be able to see the stop
symbol
and when you see the start symbol then
they are stopped and you will be able to
start them okay so now once we have
Apache web server mysql started you can
go to your web browser and just right
here
localhost' okay and click enter and you
will be able to see this screen here if
you will be able to see this example
default screen when you type here
localhost then your Apache web server is
running and exempt is installed
successfully in your computer ok
so in here you need to choose your
language I will choose English and this
is your xampp index the first thing you
need to do after installing this xampp
is to change the security so what you
need to do you need to just click this
security here this little security tab
here so just click security and in here
you will be able to see this these X M
pages are accessible by network for
everyone so these are unsecured right
now right so to make them secure you
just need to click this link this which
is provided by XM to you this link just
click this link and in here you will be
able to see this kind of a page ok so
first of all you can change the password
for your MySQL so let us change the
password
and I will read type my password and I
will say password changing okay so the
password was successfully changed please
restart MySQL okay so I will restart
MySQL and you also need to change this
password HTA access or HT access
directory so just give the password to
this HT directory or HT access so I will
give the user as root and give the
password you can remember and I will
just click this button called make safe
XM directory and now your XM directory
is protected right so once you have
followed this procedure you will be able
to write your first PHP code or write up
whatever code you want to test and you
will be able to test them so for example
I once this installation is complete you
can go to your folder where you have
installed this xampp
so in my local disk program file I will
be able to find this XM or local disk
Program Files x86 and in here I think I
will be able to find this
is this okay so in here i forgot the
path you have installed this xampp on c
colon slash xampp right so i go to that
path see in the c directory just go to
this xampp directory and click it and in
here you will be able to see so many
folders in here and what we need to do
is we need to go to htdocs and in this
htdocs there will be files which will
run whatever files you will place here
you will be able to see it in here so
this index file dot PHP is i think you
will be able to find here this one okay
index dot PHP right so this is that file
whatever you are seeing here index dot
PHP is this file index dot PHP now for
example I want to create a nice little
test to test whatever I place in here
will be shown in my browser or not so
for example I will make a new new text
document and I will name it as test and
I will open this test and I can write
here this is a test for example and I
will just save this save and close this
and now when I can go to my browser and
open this file by just going to
localhost / test dot txt okay txt and
press enter and you will be able to see
your message so it will open your test
file and it has opened this message from
the text txt file if you are able to see
these files or whatever content in the
file then xampp is successfully
installed and running on your system so
what
a file or whatever folder and file which
you will add here will be able to run
here okay so I hope you have enjoyed
