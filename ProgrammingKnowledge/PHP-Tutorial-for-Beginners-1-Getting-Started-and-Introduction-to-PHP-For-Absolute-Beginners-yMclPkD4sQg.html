PHP programming tutorials for beginners
and in this video I'm going to give you
a brief introduction to PHP so first
question comes into mind is what is PHP
and what is PHP stands for right so PHP
is a acronym for hypertext preprocessor
and it's a open source server-side
scripting language that means whenever
you make some website you need a server
to host your website and PHP is a
server-side scripting language that
means it can interpret your pages and
serve your pages to the client on the
basis of the request of the client I
will show you a brief or how PHP work
works in the later slides but yeah it's
an open-source server-side scripting
language right and why we use PHP
because PHP is a strong scripting
language which can generate dynamic web
pages and it can even integrate with the
database most of the database like MySQL
or SQL server or any other popular
language so that gives us the
functionality to make our pages dynamic
now what is the difference between
static and dynamic pages static pages
are just HTML pages with no
functionality you will be able to see
just our text there or you will be able
to just click a URL and you will be able
to go to next page but you if you want
more dynamic features for example in
email service you want to enter your
username and password and on the basis
of your username and password you want
to give some messages for example your
user name and password is wrong
then you want to show the user that you
have user name and password is wrong and
please try again or otherwise if the
username and password is correct you
want to redirect your page to the to the
other authorized page right so this
functionality which is dynamic web pages
is provided by PHP now PHP script
resides between reserved PHP tags that
enables PHP to embed PHP script within
HTML pages that we will see later
because but yeah it has predefined tags
so that you know that whatever you write
in between those predefined tag will be
a PHP code right so furthermore PHP is
an integrated language scripts are
passed at run time rather than compile
time okay so it's an interpreted
language which or script which pass your
your pages on the run time rather than
on compile time okay so if you want to
you know compile your your program at or
at compile time it will not compile or
it will not give you the result it will
only give you the result when you want
to see this result on the browser for
example okay
and it's executed server-side that we
will see in from the diagram I will show
you in a moment
and so score not visible by the client
so if you want to see the source code
because it's a server-side language you
will not be able to see the food of PHP
from the client side okay and various
built-in function allows for fast
development PHP has various functions
which are built-in and which will make
your programming really fast and it's
compatible with most popular databases
that I have already told you now in
order to see more information on PHP you
can go to php.net php.net and this is
the official website of PHP and here you
will be able to see much more
information on PHP and the very good
feature of this website is it has
documentation which is very extensive
and it's available in different
languages so for example you want to use
English and there is a very extensive
extensive manual here and you can search
for some function that you want to know
about for example I want to search for
echo function then I will just just
search for that and you will be able to
find all the documentation on this
keyword in here in the documentation so
this is a very good place to you know
know what function is used for what and
what is the functionality of what
function or keyword okay so just if you
have time just visit this website and
you will be able to find much more on
PHP now we continue with our
presentation now this is how PHP works
so I already told you that
PHP is a server-side scripting language
so this there will be a server where
your website will be hosted and all your
web pages will be stored there and there
or
so PHP resides and PHP is just like an
interpreter so on the basis of your
client request your server will you know
your PHP will interpret the values from
the database or mail servers or files
from from file system and it will take
this file system or database value
interpret those values and then once
again it will give the response to the
client so it's a server-side interpreter
which can be used for databases mail
servers or systems ok so this is how you
can use PHP now what are the popular
site using PHP if you want to see that
you can go to the Wikipedia page and
search for programming language used in
most popular website and in this list
you will be able to find here that
Facebook uses PHP with MySQL and Yahoo
uses PHP with MySQL and Wikipedia itself
uses PHP with MySQL and WordPress also
uses PHP that MySQL so one of the
world's most popular website uses PHP
for their server-side operations in your
website right so it's a very good you
know language and work learning language
to learn right so this is a small little
presentation on introduction of PHP in
the next video I am going to show you
how to you know set up the environment
for PHP so that we will be able to
develop the PHP
now website or via PHP server so that's
it for this video and in the coming
videos stay tuned and please keep
watching these videos and I hope you
