video I will show you how to search word
in the je text area or jtextfield and
highlight them with some highlighter
color for example red or yellow
something so it will work exactly like a
highlighter so whatever word you want to
find you just write it in the text box
and the when you press search word the
word same word which is present in the
je text area will be highlighted so
let's get started first of all I will
take a button then I will take a text
field and I will take a je text area
this one okay now I will just make the
size of this
textarea bigger and I will change or
change the type text of this text field
and I will make it empty and here I will
change the text as such okay so I have a
button a text field and a text area now
I will go to the source code and at the
top because this is a newly generated
jframe so I will declare some import so
write import Java X dot swing
dot
star okay so import this import at the
top of your frame and then I will go
just below inside my class and here at
the top I will make a class so in here
just below my main function which have
in it component function just below that
I will declare a new class for the
highlighter so write this and you need
to declare this class so right class my
highlighter painter this is the name of
my class extent default highlighter so
it's showing some error because I
haven't fixed the imports so let's see
what import it needs so should go here
and click here and it requires import
for Java X dot swing dot txt okay so I
will just click this and my import is
fixed here you see here and then I will
first of all I will explain the code and
then I will go to the fixed so class my
highlight painter extend default
highlighter dot default highlight
painter and in the bracket right public
my highlight painter and in the bracket
right color and give it a variable name
in my kiss color bracket close and then
this bracket and inside this right super
and pass this color variable here now
this color variable also requires some
imports or click here and we are going
to require this import import for Java
x-dot AWD TDOT color so input and my
error is gone so declare this class
first at the top of your frame then we
will declare ah sorry it's gone yeah so
then we just below that we will declare
a highlight paint for this color so for
example I want to highlight my text as
red so just write this line this will
also require some import which I will
import later so just write highlighter
dot highlight painter and right here my
highlight painter so this is your
variable which is global is equal to new
my highlight painter which is this
public method and in here I will pass
the color because this takes the color
argument so in my case I am taking color
dot red so right color I am taking to
highlight the text word which I search
so write highlighter dot highlight
painter and give it a variable name
according to yourself in my case my
highlight painter is equal to new my
highlight painter which is this method
and it takes the argument color dot red
okay and it also require one import so I
will click here
it requires Java X dot swing dot text
dot highlighter so I will just click
this and my my error is gone so this is
a global variable now we will make a
method for highlighting the word so this
is just the declaration of the color and
the method for highlighter now the next
method which we are going to make is for
the highlighter itself so we want to
search the word which is present in this
textbox and highlight it in your text
area in the text present so here declare
our method so public void highlight I
will name my function as highlight
itself and bracket and bracket closed
and in here I will pass some arguments
so J
text
component and I will give it a variable
name so variable name would be text
component and this will take our J text
area so this is the method we are
building comma string variable so with
capital s and we will also give this a
variable name called pattern okay now
we'll make our try-catch block in this
method first try/catch
and
exception e here you can give your
exception I am not giving to save the
time so here you just add a jade pain or
something like that message for sewing
showing the exception message and in
your try block write these declarations
so I right here highlight and give it a
variable name this is a highlighter
component and just give it a variable
name in my case hi a chai Li te is equal
to text comp which is this same variable
okay dot get highlighter and bracket and
break enclose and in the next line write
document it also takes a import so I
will just see what import it requires so
I will just import Java X dot swing dot
txt document so click it and my error is
gone so
declare this document doc is equal to X
component dot get document and bracket
em bracket closed and next we will
declare a string give it a variable name
in my case text is equal to doc dot get
text and inside the bracket we will pass
to argument first is 0 and second is
comma doc which is this document
variable dot get length and third is the
int variable for position so declare of
int variable give it a variable name is
equal to 0 now in here below I will
declare a while loop so a while bracket
bracket close and inside this while loop
sorry
inside this while loop I will give a
condition so right here one more bracket
and inside here write this POS int
variable paste it inside this box
and then write is equal to and copy this
variable text and paste it here dot to
uppercase dot
index off and in here we will pass a
argument inside this index of bracket so
copy this pattern string component which
we have declared in the method
declaration paste it here and write here
dot
