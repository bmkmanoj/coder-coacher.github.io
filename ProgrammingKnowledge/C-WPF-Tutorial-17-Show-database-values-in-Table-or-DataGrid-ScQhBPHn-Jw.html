WPF c-sharp application tutorial in the
last video I have shown you how to get
the corresponding values when you click
some name or data in the combo box so
when you select some data and the
corresponding values for example e
employee ID and surname and age comes in
these text boxes in this video I will
show you how to connect your data base
with the data grid view or in simple
word table so if you want to show the
whole data in a single table
you can do that in WPF c-sharp so
exactly that I am going to show you
today so let's get started stop the
process and now I have this window here
so what I will do is I will go to the
text box not text box must but the tool
box and I search for the dot or grid
here so this is the data grid which
holds our table data so just drag and
drop into your window and it looks like
this it's nothing but a blank data grid
it has no column or no rows set when you
drag and drop this data grid view you
can see in your XAML assemble view this
line of code is added which is data grid
which is this data grid auto generate
columns false and all the properties
of this data grid right what you need to
do first is go here to auto-generate
columns I will make it little bit bigger
so go here in Auto generate columns and
instead of false by default it's false
you have to make it true okay so first
thing you need to do is you need to do
this true because what we are going to
do is we are going to auto generate
columns we are not customized or we will
not customize our columns but we will
auto generate the column with the data
so that is why I made this true once you
are done with this what I will do is I
will take a button from my tool box and
drag and drop here and let me make it a
little bit smaller so we can see it and
let me change the text of this button so
I named it as load table and I change
the name of this button also
load table text okay so go to the
properties and change this content and
this button now I want when I click this
load table button my data base values
which is this data base here it's a
SQLite database which we are working on
in last few videos I want to show
employee ID name surname and age for
columns I want to show in my data grid
view as a table data okay so now I just
double click this button and I go to the
load table text button click event
before writing any of the code okay
first we write the skeleton of the code
which we are writing from the last few
videos to connect SQLite with the
database sorry to connect our
application with the SQLite database so
I copy and paste this Calton here make
it a little bit bigger so these are the
littles this is a little skeleton which
I use in every code to connect with my
SQLite database right and if you don't
recognize this code and you are watching
this video for the first time you can go
to the first video in which I have shown
you how to connect s collide with your
WPF c-sharp application and you know
what this code is first is the
connection
SQLite connection and I make a variable
for s collide connection is equal to Nu
s collide connection and I pass the
database connection to it and then I
make a try-catch block to catch any
exception
and then I open my SQLite database so I
copy this escalate Korn dot open and
then I prepare my query so this is a
string type query is equal to select
star from my table name this I will
change but this is a simple query and
then I prepare the command
so I write SQLite come on create command
is equal to new SQLite command and I
pass the query and I pass the connection
as an argument okay and then I guess
execute my query so this command dot
execute non query bracket and ragged
clothes and once my query is executed I
close my escalate connection so if you
want to copy this just pause the video
and copy this whole code now I am going
to add some more code to this so first
thing we are going to add in this code
is we are going to import one namespace
so just go at the top and right here
using system dot data okay
just import this namespace if you don't
have this if you already have this then
don't worry you are on right path but if
you don't have this import this
namespace here now once again we go to
the button click event load table button
click event this is our code and after
this first of all we will prepare our
query for example so in this query we
are passing select star from employee ID
so what we want is to show only four
columns right now in our database we
have six column
employee IDs name surname age username
and password I just want these four
columns so I write the name of these
square columns as a query so I instead
of this star I write a ID comma name
comma surname comma age okay select
these four column values from my table
okay these are the column names now
everything is done command set our
command is executed and now I want to
transfer my data into the data grid view
so this is the code in between this
SQLite close and this command dot X
collide query non query executes non
query I will write the code to transfer
my data from my database to the data
grid view so first thing I will declare
here is SQLite data adapter so right
SQLite dot adopter and give it a name I
name it as data a DP for example is
equal to new SQLite data adopter and
bracket and break it close and in here
in this bracket you need to pass your
SQLite command so just copy this s
collide command and pass it here in
between this adopter brackets now in the
second line we will declare a variable
for the data table so we write data
table DT is equal to nu
data table bracket and bracket closed
and what table we want to show in our
data grid view and we want to show this
table which is there in SQLite which
whose name is employee info so in my
database my table name is employee info
I copy the name of the table and in this
bracket
I give double quotes and inside my
double quote I give the name of the
table in the database okay now what I
will do in next is I copy my daughter
adopt a variable here paste it here and
I will fill this data with I will fill
this data adopter with my data table so
I write this dot fill like it like it
flows and I pass this data table
variable inside this fill argument okay
now in the next line what we are going
to do is we will transfer this table to
the data grid view so go to your main
window select your data grid from here
and copy the name of the data grid view
so just copy this data grid 1 in my case
this is the name of this data grid so
just copy this name go to the code
section and below your daughter to
adapter dot fill code just paste the
name of your data grid and write dot
item source is equal to copy this DT
variable once again and then write dot
default view bracket and be closed you
think this will not come here okay so we
passed our data table value which we are
taking it from the database into the
data grid view and what we are going to
do is we will update our data grid once
again so what you have to do is just
copy this data adopter variable from
here and paste it here once again dot
update and in this bracket pass the
argument DT for data table okay so this
is the code for
loading the database value in the data
grid or table so if you want you can
pause the video and just copy it and now
we are going to run this program so
let's just run it I have username and
password and it opens the second form
and when I click this load table my a ID
name surname and age column should
appear here and all the data in that so
let's try I click it and bam all the
data in the database comes in my data
grid view so let's check if the data is
correct this is my SQLite database data
and this is my WPF application so you
just check all the data which is here in
the database is also here so in this way
you can connect your data grid with your
database so I hope you have enjoyed this
