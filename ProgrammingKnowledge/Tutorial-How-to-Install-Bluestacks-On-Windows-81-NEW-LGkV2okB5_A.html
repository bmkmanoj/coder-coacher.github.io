show you how you can install blue stakes
on your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
operating system blue stakes is an
Android emulator which helps you to run
Android apps on your Windows PC if you
have Mac OS also it can run on Mac OS
also now let's get started and let's see
how we can get blue stakes on our
computer you just need to open your
favorite browser and so just search for
blue stakes and the first link here you
will find it from wwwo stakes comm just
click this link and the Screen button
you will be able to see which says
download app player XP Vista or Windows
7 or Windows 8 you just need to click
this link from here and download will
not take much time will be downloaded in
few seconds and once the download is
complete you just need to start the
Installer now sometimes blue stakes can
be really tricky to install on your
system and for that what you can do is
you can just go to the installation file
which you have downloaded and make sure
when you go to the properties here so I
will just go to the properties of this
executable file and make sure that in
the properties of this executable file
this run this program in compatibility
mode for Windows 8 is selected by
default sometimes it's selected as
Windows 7 just make sure it's windows 8
and make sure this checkbox is checked
which is run this program as
administrator and this is all in
compatibility tab okay just click apply
and click ok and then just double click
your blue steaks installer and click yes
and this will start installing blue
steaks now just click continue here and
this will be the location where all the
data we go from both blue steak just
click Next and make sure these two
options are click click Next and now you
need to wait about one minute and if you
have a little bit slower system you may
need to wait for two minutes maybe so
you can see all those apps you can see
here you can run on glue steaks and all
the tops Android app or for example
what's app or any other app which is
popular on Android you can run every app
or any game on your Windows operating
system this is the really big advantage
for those who wants to play mobile apps
or mobile games on their operating
system for example windows on big screen
so now it's preserving all the data and
by the meantime I can see this app I can
here which says all the apps will be
started from here and I can see the
start gluestick
I can also like which I can click to
start blue stakes once again from my
desktop now it will just take few more
seconds I think it's preserving user
data
so I would wait for a few more seconds
and it will be complete
now you can see this downloading games
data you just need if you want that you
want it in the minimized with no you can
just click this small icon here which
will be used to maximize or minimize
your window now it's initializing
and once it's initialized you will be
able to see all your apps
now you can see loading all channels so
glowsticks categorizes all the apps in
some categories for example categories
for top apps spotlights or kids or
puzzles or games so you can browse
tsquare categories and once you decide
that you want a particular app you just
need to click this app so for example
let's see which app I want for example
you can just click this more button in
the top apps and you can see all the
apps which you can download there are
many apps here so for example I want to
download this app you need to have a
valid Google account for this so just
click the app and click OK and now this
will ask you to give your Google account
credentials so just click this and say

your Android first and then it will ask
you to give your username and password
for any Google account as you can see or
whenever you buy our new Android device
