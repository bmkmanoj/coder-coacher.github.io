we have seen seen how to populate this
combo box with your database values and
this time we will see when you select
one of these database value
corresponding data should appear in this
in these fields so for example I have
this database in my SQL and I will
choose John's John and corresponding to
dot on John which is employee ID one
surname Bell and age 27 should appear
these text boxes so how to do this
I will show you now so let's get started
go to the program want to and select
this combo box and by default if you go
to the events here this sign
you can see by default its some event
here is selected index change so if the
index of this combo box changes then it
it will show some values here so we
don't need to change its default event
just double click it and make space for
writing your program first thing you
need to do is copy the name of this
combo box
over here and enter the program right
string this cap sign and then come more
value for combo well then our combo box
name and so I write pointer text and
close so this will take the value from
combo box and place it into the spring
variable now go to the code we have
written last time for fill combo method
this code and in this function we have
written our code so in the function the
whole code you can copy and paste it in
this combo box selection selected and
exchange method this will save our time
to write the code so this is this has
already made this code has to make the
connection with the database and this is
to pause the query so what I have done
is I have taken the combo box value in
the string variable name and from my pin
combo method I have taken all the code
from this string to the end of this
catch block in my
combo box selected index change method
and now I will change this query
previously we have written stuff to
select star from database dot e data
which is by this database and this table
so dr. base dot y dot ax okay
so this query will be added a bit we
will write select star from database dot
e data where and then write to single
quote them to double quote and in
between plus plus and in between we will
write or variable which we have taken
from our combo box here so take this
combo box variable from mobile and pace
it paste it in between this plus plus
sign
okay
so select star from database dot table
where our name is equal to because we
are filling name into our combo box
according to our last with you so select
star from database where name is equal
to the value in the combo box and names
we are taking from this column in the
database okay so now what will happen
when you select this name this should
make some destroyed I mean this should
show the corresponding dot according to
the name selected so go to the try catch
block and here is the while loop we have
written instead of this while loop you
write if so if this selected query is
okay then what we will do is I will
delete all this
dot am
if condition and we will write our code
once again so what we will write take a
string value means sorry string this cap
symbol and then employ ID variable so i
ID when is equal to
is equal to
slowly
is equal to
this M my reader variable name from my
data my SQL data reader then arrow
pointer and then white get int 32 and
bracket and bracket closed and in here
because we are taking int we need to
write into 2 into 2 string and bracket
because our employee ID is a int
variable you can see from here these are
all integers
and if you go to database and say alter
table
if you open your tables yeah
you can see our employee ID is a int
data type and age is int data type
that's why we need to convert our int to
string to in order to show it into the
textbox
otherwise we cannot show direct integer
value into our textbox so that is why
this conversion is written and in here
we will pass what e ID which is this
column named employee ID column name he
I D okay
so the next thing we need to do is copy
this to four times and this is for
showing the employee ID in your employee
ID text box so go to your employee ID
text box here and copy the name of this
employee ID text box PID text like is
and paste it here and then arrow
text
and in here you know this bracket should
not be like this right equal to and this
e value variable name so it takes the
employee ID in the form of string and
then it will place into the Eid textbox
and one thing here I forgot the are two
strings okay and then the next is the
name so I will write name value and
instead of this get int I should write
string because it's the string we more
don't need this string anymore and this
is for the name any name which is this
column name name okay
and once again for the surname it's also
a string so we will just copy and paste
it here and the value so name variable
name and here also we will write surname
okay and this is the age so we will
write age value which is a integer so
get int 32 and here right age to string
which is this age common okay
so just we have written here and now you
have taken these name value in this
variable and just go to your form and
copy the name text field name from here
it's called name text and copy
and just paste it here arrow sign and
then equal to your this name value okay
just copy once again paste it here once
again paste it here in order to save
time and this variable share this age
variable here
and just I need to see the name of my
surname text field so it's surname text
copying it and
taste it in stead of this text and just
see the name of your age text field and
copy it and paste it
Atena fee
so what we have done is we have taken
these column values from the database
and place it into the string variable
and then string variables to the text
field here okay so let's try and run our
program let's see if it works or not yes
no it's not working because this the
spelling mistake to string I have
corrected here but not here so paste it
here once again and let's see if this
time our code works or not no let's see
why okay so the mistake is I haven't
taken this text and written this here
so after in your text box named arrow
pointer and then you to write this text
here also text and here also the text
okay so let's try once again
and yes this time we are lucky in mid
France so enter your password and
username okay and you can see all the
names are filled here from our last
video code and when we choose some name
here according to the name all the data
should appear here so let's see John yes
one John Bell and this I want to choose
this one and yes the dot appears and
let's verify our data from our database
so when I choose this person the
employee ID is appeared here his surname
is here and his age is here so it's
showing me the correct values
so in this way you can see how to speaks
us how to show the corresponding values
in the combo box and in the text box you
can show so that's it for now please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
