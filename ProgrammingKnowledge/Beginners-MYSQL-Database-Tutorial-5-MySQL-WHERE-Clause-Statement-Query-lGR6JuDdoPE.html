last video we have seen how to use
select clause in your statement or in
your query in this video we will see how
to use where clause in your query so
suppose you have a table in which you
have this data and you have some
software and from which we want to see
this data and you just want to see the
employee ID or the information of
employee where employee ID is equal to
one so how you can do this I will show
you right now so what you have to write
is select
from your database where the ID is equal
to one so this query will show the rows
where or should show the information of
the employee where employee ID is equal
to one so let's execute this query it if
it's works or not no it doesn't work
because I haven't used star here so now
it should work properly yes it shows me
the information of the employee where
employee ID is equal to one now suppose
you want to show first two calls first
two rows of your database for example
you want to show the employee
information where your employee ID is
equal to 2 or less than 2 so how will
you show this when the same queries
select star from your database dot table
name where employee ID is less than or
equal to 2 and let's see how it works
and yes it works perfectly fine so only
first to employ well we employ
information will be seen in the same way
you can use greater than sign to see the
employee ID information greater than two
you can also use any of the column for
example age H is equal to 33 I want to
show John John's information so that H
is equal to 33 I will execute it and it
works if I want to show the employee
information where H is greater than 30
and I will execute this query all the
employee information where the employee
is greater than 30 will come so in this
way you can use where clause in your
MySQL and work according to it so I hope
you have learned something new this time
please rate comment subscribe and bye
