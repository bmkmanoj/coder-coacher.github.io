tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video I am going to teach
you about simple math and math operators
in C programming so basically there are
some operators which you can use to do
your math in C and these are called
multiplicative and additive operators
and the first operator is this plus
symbol which is used for addition second
is minus symbol which is used for
subtraction third is Asterix which is
used for multiplication fourth is this
for a forward slash which is used for
division and the last is this modulus
operator which is also called modulus so
these are called multiplicative and
additive operators now how we can use
them so for example we have two numbers
in the a is equal to 23 for example and
comma b is equal to 45 and you want to
add these two numbers how you can add
these two numbers you can just declare
another variable called sum and then you
can add these two numbers like sum is
equal to a plus B okay and the result
you can print it in printf function so
you can just say sum is equal to
percentage D okay and comma or some
function some variable okay which is
this one you can just compile and run
this program and
two returns error because I forgot
semicolon save your program and compile
and run your program it will give the
sum of 23 and 45 right so it will just
print sum is equal to whatever is the
sum of these two values which is 68 like
this okay now in the same way if you
want to divide or subtract these two
numbers so I want to subtract 23 by 45
you just do a minus B which will be a
minus value right so I will just compile
and run my program and this will not be
some but the subtraction I forgot to
change the variable name but the result
will be the subtraction of these two
numbers which is 22 right so you can
just name the sum instead of sum when
you are doing subtraction you can name
it as subtraction for example now in
order to get the multiplication you just
change the variable name as
multiplication and just use Asterix for
the multiplication right so a Asterix B
will give you the multiplication of
these two numbers and here you can say
is product product is equal to this
multiplication okay and compile and run
the program it will give the
multiplication of these two numbers and
in the similar way if you want to divide
two numbers this is interesting so this
is the product of these two numbers and
in order to divide two numbers let's say
this is division variable and in order
to divide these two numbers you just use
forward slash right and let us take two
simple numbers first of all for example
8 and 2 and I will just
build and run this program and it will
ideally give us 4 because 4 8 divided by
2 is 4 right so it gives us 4 as
expected but whenever for example I have
9 and I want to divide it by 2 and by
the way this is a integer values so
let's change it to float if 9 divided by
2 is 4.5 so that is why we will save it
in float variable compile and run the
program and will give us the value let
us see what value it gives us first of
all and it gives us 0 because we haven't
changed this thing modulus app and
compile and run the program in my
computer I don't know why it takes a
little bit time to compile this program
and it gives us 4 which is not expected
because 9 divided by 2 is 4.5 but what
this forward slash symbol do is it will
give you the whole division for example
9 divided by 2 is first of all you will
divide the 9 by 2 then you will give 4
and it will leave the point values 0.5
it will leave always by using this you
will always get the multiple so 4 or
whenever you have 11 it will give you 5
and the remainder it will not give you
okay and in order to get the remainder
so 11 divided by 2 is 5 point 5 and when
you divide by a divide 11 by 2 it will
you know fully divided by 5 and it will
give the remainder of 1 right so in
order to get the remainder you use the
modulus operator and let us change it to
modulus modulus and modulus and try to
run the program at it will give one okay
so this modulus always gives you the
remainder and this division always give
you the hole multiple values so one and
when you use this it will give you five
because it will always skip division
always skip the remainder and remember
only shows the remainder and nothing
else so in this way you can do simple
math in C there are other operators in C
also which I will show you in the
further videos but these are the simple
math operators which are called
multiplicative and additive operators
and C and you can do math with these
operators and one more thing if you want
to know what is the precedence of these
operators if you have seen in your
schooling you have something like PD
Moss or something like MD a s something
right and P stands for parentheses right
so parentheses a has the main priority
then multiplication division and then
addition and then subtraction so always
follow this rule to do the math and you
will be good to go I hope you have
