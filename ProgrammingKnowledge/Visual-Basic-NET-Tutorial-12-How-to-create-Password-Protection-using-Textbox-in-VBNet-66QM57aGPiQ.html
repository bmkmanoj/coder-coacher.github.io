last video I have shown you how to
create a simple login form with the help
of your visual basic windows form
application so for example when I enter
some random password which is not
correct it shows me password is not
correct but when I enter the correct
password second form opens and the first
form disappears right and in this video
because in the last video I haven't
shown you how to protect passwords so
for example when you enter some password
here the other guys or other people can
see your password which is not good in
real-life situations you want to hide
your password from the others right and
you want to show something like stars or
something like a dollar sign instead of
your real password so I will show you
how to how to simply achieve this
password protection with your Visual
Basic what you need to do is you just
need to simply select your text box and
go to the properties and just you will
be able to see here password care so you
can define a password cat here for
example I will define a password care
which is Asterix and now when I run the
program and when I enter some number
here it is coming as at Asterix right
and when I enter some wrong password it
still says me password is not correct
and when I enter a real password
it opens the second form but the
advantage is my password is protected
and nobody apart from me can see the
password right and you can change this
character according to your wish for
example you want to change this
character as dollar sign and now when
you run the program it will it will give
you dollar sign instead of Asterix so
you can just select a password CAD
according to your convenience and
protect your password from other users
so I hope you have enjoyed this video
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
