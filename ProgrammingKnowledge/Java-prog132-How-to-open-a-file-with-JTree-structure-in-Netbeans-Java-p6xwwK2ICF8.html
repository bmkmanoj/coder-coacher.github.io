last video I have shown you how to use J
tree and show a folder of your choice in
the Jade tree structure in this video I
will show you how to open these file
which is present in your J tree
structure with the help of a button so
when you select this file and when you
press the Open File button the file will
open so let's get started first
right-click your J tree and go to the
event and go to my mouse click event and
press it and you will come to the mouse
click event of that J tree here
and in here we will write our code but
we need to declare a variable which
should be used globally so I just go to
the bottom of my code and I'm like
string j3 where Forge a tree variable so
you can name according to your
convenience
this is a string which will hold the j3
part okay
so just copy the string also and just go
to the event
once again event
mouse click mouse click event here paste
your J tree variable is equal to is
equal to go to InDesign and copy the d3
variable name my name my variable name
is J tree 1 and paste it after this
equal to sine dot get
No okay
selected path
not to string what do you do is it will
take the path and convert it to the
string but this string is not usable so
you need to replace some slashes and
some commas from it so just right after
your two string right dot replace all
and just copy these things so double
quote in between this square brackets
and double slashes in between that
square bracket and double slashes once
again and we will replace all these
slashes by nothing so just double quote
and nothing between them dot replace
your comma dot space so double quote
comma and just provide a single space
here comma double quote and double
slashes so if there is any comma and
spaces are there please replace it by
this double slash okay so just pause the
video if you want and just copy this as
it is this is in the j-3 mouse click
event you need to do now just go to a
design go to the palette
and take a button from you this button
when we click it will open the document
so I will name this as open file and
name its variables Open File button okay
and just right click it go to its event
action and action perform once again
event action connection perform and we
go to its action perform method and in
their favor right our method first thing
you need to do in this method is make a
try-catch block and in this we will
write our code so go to the button
action perform method and make this
try-catch block and in here we will
start with our code so right bye
selection
sorry so once again right fine and again
variable name is selection is equal to
Nu PI bracket and bracket closed and in
here you will give the name of the
variable you have declared at the bottom
of your code which is je travaille okay
so that I just copied that will enable
you can see here J tree where and paste
it here in the next line right if and
else condition
and in the if condition
and right
just copy the selection variable paste
it here not exist if selection exists
then what you need to do is once again
right if bracket
and these two backups
and in here right desc
well
but is dekstop supported okay
and in between here right I'll copy this
illness once again paste it here not get
desktop not open the file and in between
the bracket just copy this selection
variable here and if the condition is
not true in the else condition what you
can do is just show a message so right J
option pain not show
message dialog and yeah just try this
and then here you can show your message
so you can write a WT just pop the pages
do not support it so this type of
desktop is not supported and then comma
in double quote you can write arrow
and
what is the L right now see
after that coma
you'll be right
here you can write J motion pain dot
information message Surrey on
I messed it up
no information okay okay so in the else
condition just show the J option being
dots show message dialog and in the
bracket this comma your message
customized message and then comma error
Comanche option pain dot information
message so this is the offense condition
of first this if otherwise for this if
we have provided this condition and for
this if we can provide the condition
else and then close and in here just
copy this once again this J option show
message and paste it here once again so
you have 2f conditions and if some error
comes then it will show some messages in
the first this if-else condition it will
show a WT dekstop is not supported and
in the outside if-else condition you can
write here file does not exists or
whatever you want so this is the code
just if you want just pause the video
and just write the code and now we are
going to try our code so just right
click and run
and it's running so suppose I want to
open this PDF file so I select this was
select any PDF file and I will click
open file so it must open the PDF file
and yes it opens to selected file for
example this PDF file I press open and
it opens the same file you can see so in
this way you can use J tree to open the
files of your chosen folder so I hope
you have enjoyed this video and learn
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
