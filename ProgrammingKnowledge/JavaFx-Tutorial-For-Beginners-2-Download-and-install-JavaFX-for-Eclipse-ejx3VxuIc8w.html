show you how you can add JavaFX support
in your Eclipse IDE now by default
Eclipse doesn't provide any JavaFX
support for you so you need to add
JavaFX support in your Eclipse IDE so
there are two ways you can add JavaFX
support in your Eclipse IDE one is by
adding a jar file to your Java project
or other is to add a Java FX plug-in and
then you will be able to directly create
a Java FX project so we will see both
ways so first way is to add the Java FX
jar file so go to your Eclipse IDE and
create a new Java project from here and
I'm going to name it as Java FX demo for
example and click Next and click finish
and then go to your project and here we
are going to create a new class called
hello world for example so right click
on it and create a new class and name it
as HelloWorld okay now to add a Java FX
support in this class or in this project
what you need to do is you need to
right-click your project first so
right-click your project and go to the
properties and in here go to the build
path so in here you on the right hand
side you will be able to see this
category called build path and this
category go to the category called
libraries ok now select the default
library here and you can remove it for
now and then you can add this library
once again so add library and then just
select JRE system library
okay click Next and here by default I
have JDK 8 installed in my system which
is the latest version of JDK but JavaFX
is available on JDK 7 also so if you
have JDK 7 it's ok right
so click finish here and now this is the
important stage so once again click on
add library here and then click user
library and click next and by default
I can see Java FX here but for the first
time when you come here you will not be
able to see this because I have created
this so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to click this option which says
user libraries and I'm going to remove
this for now so I select it and remove
it and I'm going to add it once again so
I will click new here and I will name it
as Java FX ok click OK and now you just
select this and then click this option
called add external jars ok so click
this option add external jars and then
you need to browse to your Java folder
wherever its installed
most probably it will be installed in
your C directory then go to Program
Files and then you will be able to see
this Java folder in this Java folder you
need to go to this JDK folder and in
this JDK folder go to the JRE folder ok
and inside this JRE folder go to Lib
folder and inside this Lib folder you
will be able to see a jar file called
GFX SWT dot jar select this and click
open ok and now you can see this jar
file is added
to your user libraries so just click OK
and click finish and click ok so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
paste here the sample Java FX code so
this is the sample Java FX code we are
going to look this code in details in
the next video I will show you how it
works
step-by-step but right now we want to
check whether this Java FX support is
working in our Eclipse IDE or not so
this is the sample code for Java FX I
will save it and now I am going to
compile and run it so I'm going to just
click this green button here and it will
build this and it's running this Java FX
sample code so now we know that this
Java FX support is added in our project
now there is a second way to add a Java
FX support in your Eclipse IDE and this
option will enable you to create a Java
FX project from this file option itself
so let's see how we can add this Java FX
support using this Java FX plug-in in
Eclipse so in your Eclipse IDE go to
help and then choose the option which
says install new software and in here
what you need to do is I will give you a
link in the description and you need to
copy this link from here and paste it in
here where you see work with ok
so paste this link there and then just
click Add and you need to give a name to
your repository so give a name like this
e in the bracket FX then outside the
bracket clips ok so give this name to
your repository ok so just copy the link
from the
description and then give this name to
your repository and click OK and it's
going to search this JavaFX plugin
support so just select all from here
right and then click Next and in here
you just need to click once again next
and in here you just need to read this
license terms and condition and if you
agree with these license terms and
condition just click I accept the terms
and condition and then click finish
now it's going to install this Java FX
plug-in in your Eclipse IDE so you need
to wait for that
you
and once the installation is complete
eclipse will ask you to restart this
Eclipse IDE so you just need to click
yes and it's going to restart your
Eclipse IDE
and once your Eclipse IDE has been
started you can go to files here and
then you can go to new and you can
create a new project here and in the
projects you will be able to see this
new option called JavaFX now after
installing this plug-in right and here
you can select JavaFX project and click
Next and in here you can give the name
to your project for example Java FX 2
and click Next
and click finish now go to the project
which you have recently created and in
here you will be able to see this Java
FX jar is already installed here and
then you can go to the source folder
here and inside the source folder you
will be able to see a package called
application and inside the package you
will be able to see two files one is a
Java file another is a CSS file so we
will open this main dot Java file and we
have already some default code here
right so we can run this by just
clicking this green button once again
and now you can see the sample Java FX
window here which is called stage which
is right now blank ok so these are the
two ways you can use to create a Java FX
project in Eclipse I hope you enjoyed
