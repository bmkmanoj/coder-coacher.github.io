last video I have shown you how to
create a PDF file using a third-party
DLL called
I take stock with your visual basic
windows form application and I have also
shown you how to create a paragraph in
the PDF file and how to create a new
page in the PDF file so if you have some
doubts and you don't know how I created
the PDF file then just watch the last
video and this is the code we have
written last time now in this video I
want to show you how to add a list to
your ITEX shaft PDF file using your
Visual Basic windows form application so
basically I am going to use the same
code to create the document but in this
document I am going to add a list so
let's see how can we do it but first of
all let's enclose our code in a
try-catch block so that if any error
occurs it can catch the exception so at
the top of my button click event I will
write try and I will press ENTER and
this will make a trying catch block and
I mean copy the all the code I have
written last time and I will paste it in
the try block you can what you can also
do is you can give finally clause in
your trial block and you can close this
document in the finally so finally when
your triage pry code is executed then
this will be called and your document
will be closed ok so this also you can
do but I will give or in the try block
itself my close of my document and in
the catch block I am going to show the
exceptions I will say
messagebox not sure and I'm going to
show the exception so I will say e x dot
message okay so this will show any
exception if any exception occurs now I
am going to create only one page so I
will delete this code which everything
for creating the new page and this is my
code for making a paragraph in a PDF
file now I want to add a list in this so
I will go below this line where I have
written PDF dog dot add a new paragraph
which is which says hello world and just
below this I will create a list so in
here I mean just
first of all copy and paste my code this
is the code to create the list and now I
will explain what this code is doing
then this code I have declared a
variable called list as object of a
class list from your ITEX shop class
okay and then I in the bracket I have
passed the argument which kind of list
this is so I will say copy this list dot
unordered this unordered can be changed
with number of type of list for example
alphabetical list numerical ordered
unordered upper case these are all the
option you can choose but for now I'm
choosing unordered list okay so this is
the list and in the second line I'm
providing the indent so let's just
comment this line for now and I will
show you what this indent is doing
afterwards and then I will just copy my
list object dot add and I will add a new
list item in this list so I will say new
list item and just in the bracket just
pass
a list item you want to give for example
one and in this same way I'm going to
add some more item in the list so just
title list dot ad and whatever item you
have I have added four more item to my
list which are two three four five so I
have the list of 1 2 3 4 5 which is
unordered list right and then I create a
paragraph which can be the title of your
list so just provide or just copy this
PDF doc object dot add and just add a
new paragraph so just write a new
paragraph and inside this write the
title of your list and then after this
just add the list itself so just write
PDF dogs dot add list which is your this
list now when I run the program and when
I click this create PDF it is created in
my project folder if you remember Steff
right so project folder bin-debug and
this is my PDF file so I will open this
and you see here a list is created which
is an unordered list and which contains
the item 1 2 3 4 5 now every time you
run your program for example just I
click this create PDF you need to close
this PDF otherwise this will show an
error so right now for example my PDF is
opened and I'm trying to create an PDF
which is open in my crabbit reader right
so I click this button will show an
error you see this is the error message
which is coming from try-catch block and
it's showing the message that the
process cannot be cannot be actually
cannot be processed because this is used
by another process right
and once you close your PDF file and
once again you create PDF then it will
not show any error so you just remember
that whenever you are creating the PDF
your PDF should be closed right so this
is a small tip now suppose we want to
add our indent to our list indent is
just like the spaces just like this so
it's one indent to indent just like this
and the unit of indent is f so I'm
providing 30 F indent to the left left
is this side okay so this is the indent
part okay now when I run the program
once again and I create the PDF and I
have opened the PDF once again you can
see it we have an indent in our list
which is this part of the list item so
in this way you can give the indent to
your list okay now what I am going to do
is I'm going to add one more list which
is of kind Roman list so this is a
normal list and you can add different
type of list with in your PDF file so
this time I am going to add a Roman list
right so just below miles weather where
I have ended adding the list and above
my PDF Doc's got close I will copy and
paste the Roman list code here so this
is the Roman list code so we have once
again declared variable of class Roman
list so just write them Roman list as
new Roman list and in the bracket just
right through comma 20 and then just
copy this Roman list variable and once
again we are going to provide the index
Roman Lestat indent left so it will
provide the in then to the left is equal
to 30 F whatever you can play with this
unit to give the indent and then I have
simply added the new items to my list
like this like I have done for my last
list right and then in the paragraph I
have given a new title to my list which
is a Roman list and then I have added
the Roman list itself to my document so
this is a code for creating a Roman list
and once again I will run my program and
I will click create list and once again
when I open this you see there is a
Roman list Roman list means these list
items are in Roman case right 1 2 3 4 5
ok now suppose you want to add a 1 list
inside other lists this can also be done
so for example you want to add this
normal unordered list in your Roman list
what you can do is you can just delete
or not delete but comment this title of
this list first so I will just commend
this so this is the title because we are
we are going to insert this normal list
inside this Roman list so I have
commented out the title and I will copy
the title of the list and add to the
instead of 5th item I will add list here
so just in the Roman list what I'm going
to do is I'm going to give the title of
my list and and in the next liner we
copy this code once again and paste it
down
and I will copy the list variable we
have created which is list itself and in
here I will paste this list variable so
what this code will do is it will create
a list of Roman list and inside this
list we have another list which is
nested list which is of kind or
unordered list so let's see what is the
result of this kind of list create
document and I open my simple PDF once
again and you can see here I have the
whole Roman list and inside my Roman
list I have my normal list so to make it
more clear I'm not going to add my list
in here inside my document but I will
just show the Roman list and I will just
cut this and I will add it after the
second item so if you want just copy
this code and once again when I run the
program create document it's already
open so I will need to close it once
again click and I will open my document
and now you can understand better so
after my second Roman list item I'm
inserting the third third item which is
a list ok so you can make a nested list
also so in this way you can make lists
with your I TechShop DLL and your visual
basic windows form application project I
