tutorial or visual C++ windows from
application in this video I will show
you how to open any file or any
executable file with the help of your
windows form application using C++ so
for example I have taken a button like
this open Exe file so when I press this
button it opens a dialog box and I can
choose any file from here which I want
to open so for example I want to open my
Google Chrome browser so I will just
select it and you see my browser is open
one more time for example I want to open
a text file so I will select this text
file and click open and my text file is
open so any file which you want to open
it will open for you
okay so let's see how I did this
so first of all I will stop debugging
first of all yeah and then what I have
done is I have taken a button here and I
named it open Exe file so they go to
your tool box and take a button and name
it according to your convenience okay
and then I will select this button and
double click it and I write this code
code here
so first three lines of code is to open
the file dialog to choose the path of
the file or the exe file you want to
open so write Open File dialog this cap
symbol Open File dialog variable name in
my case Open File dialog 1 is equal to
GC new Open File dialog this is the
Declaration of Open File dialog variable
then write Open File dialog which is
this variable named arrow point the show
dialog so it will open a file dialog for
you now
when you select a path or any exe file
or file from it we want to copy that
path and save it or store it into a
string called file path so I declare a
string cap file path is equal to Open
File dialog which is this this variable
arrow point the file name so it will
copy the file path or exe file path and
store it into my string variable and
then I simply write process double colon
start and this is the file path
I pass into this process one more thing
about this apart from this if you having
if you are having some error or if this
gives some error you have to go to the
top of your code and go wherever you're
using namespaces are declared and if
this line is not present in your code it
will give some error so add using
namespace system double colon
Diagnostics so this is important to open
the exe file or the process double cone
start code so just go to the top and
just to clear using namespace system
double colon diagnostic and and bottom
you just need to write these four lines
okay and then when I run this and I
select any file for example pass XML
which I have shown you in previous video
it will open my realize or I want to
open
some PDF so it will open the PDF for me
also so in this way you can open any
executable file or any file with the
help of this button so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
