tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
you what is recursion and how we can use
recursion in Java so it's very common
practice to call one method from another
for example we create a static method
add and we can call it inside our main
method right so it's very common and
everybody knows that Java also allows to
call a method from itself like for
example you can call add inside your add
method itself and this type of
programming is called a recursion or
this kind of programming when we call a
method from itself
it's called recursion and very basic or
we can say hello world program for
recursion is factorial for calculating
factorial so let's create a method to
create a factorial for some number now
those who don't know what is factorial
what is the meaning of factorial we will
I will just give you small gist of it so
a factorial is something like this so
whenever you want to create a factorial
of some number it's n which is a number
multiplied by n minus 1 multiplied by n
minus 2 until 1 so for example we want
to create or when we want to carry
calculate the factorial of 5 this is
equal to 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 and x 1 ok so
this is how we can calculate factorial
now let us create a method to
free to calculate the factorial of a
number so we can create this like this
public static this should be public
static and this is going to return
integer value and we named our factorial
as factorial itself and it takes an
integer int and for example or capital n
as we are showing here and then we will
try to find some algorithm which
calculates the factorial so if the
number is 0 if you know if we want to
find the factorial of 0 its 1 right so
if n is less than or equal to 1 then we
will say that the answer or we will
return the answer as 1 right so
something like this and here we will
return 1 ok otherwise else we will
return the value of n which we will take
it inside the bracket then the value of
n minus 1 right so we can say indirectly
that we want to calculate the factorial
of n minus 1 ok so we will call the
method itself and we will pass n minus 1
here ok and then we will just close this
and here we just want to return so I
will just add return
so this type of calling I am calling
factorial inside my you know factorial
method itself and what this basically is
doing if the value of n is less than
zero or less than or equal to one we
will return one because factorial of 1 +
0 is 1 otherwise we will return the
multiplication of the N which is 5 for
example if you want to calculate the
factorial of 5 we will return five x
factorial of 4 right so once again it
goes here and now we want to calculate
the factorial of 4 and then once again
it goes for x factorial of 3 it goes
once again here 3 and factorial of 2 and
it goes once again factorial of 2
multiplied by factorial of 1 and
factorial of 1 here when n becomes 1 or
0 we will return 1 okay
so indirectly it's calculating something
like this okay and whenever we want to
print this for example says o and we
will print this and we will call
factorial of 5 and let us see what's the
answer you will run the program and it
should be not this should be out okay
and we will run the program and the
factorial of 5 is 120 which is true
right in the same way we can calculate
the factorial of 4 and the answer will
be 24 because 4 multiplied by 3 is 12 x
2 is 24 x 1 is 24 itself right and 24 x
5 is 120 which is the factorial of 5 so
this way of
for calling method from itself is called
recursion and you can do it something
like this so I hope you have understood
the basic concept of recursion and I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
