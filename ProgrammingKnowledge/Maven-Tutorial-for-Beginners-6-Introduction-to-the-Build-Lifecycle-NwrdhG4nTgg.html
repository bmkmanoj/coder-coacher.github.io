maven tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen some commands to
build our maven project and create a jar
file now in this video we will see how
maven build lifecycle works now maven is
based around the central concept of a
build lifecycle and what this means is
that the process of building and
distributing a particular project is
clearly defined now for a developer
who's developing this project this means
that he is only you know required to
learn a small set of command to build
his maven project and the palm or
project object model will ensure that
they get the desired result okay now
these are the list of commands which our
developer essentially needs to learn and
these commands are validate compile test
package integration tests verify install
and deploy now some of the command we
have already seen in the last video we
have seen compile command test command
and install command from this list right
so in order to you know validate your
project whether everything is correct in
your project or not or any information
or necessary information is available in
your project or not you use this
validate command now these commands
follow some hierarchy so for example
whenever you give the compile command
which is used to compile your source
code it's also going to you know
validate first and then compile your
code and for example you run this test
command then it's going to validate
compile and then run this test so it's
going to you know follow some hierarchy
so we have run the install command last
time
so what maven has done for us is it has
done
datian for us and compliation for us
test packaging and if we have
integration test is going to do the
integration test and then verify and
then run the install command so all the
above commands before the command are
executed in order to run you know
install and if you do the deploy then
all the above command will be executed
now we have seen validate compile is to
you know compile a source test is to
compile your test package is used to you
know package your code which you have
compiled in distributable formats such
as jar okay the integration test we
haven't got any integration test but if
you have integration test then this
command will compile and you know deploy
your integration test the verify command
run any checks to verify the package is
valid and means the quality criteria
okay the install command we have already
run last time the install command will
install the package into a local
repository for use as a dependency in
other project locally and the deploy
command is done in an integration or
release environment and it copies the
final package to the remote repository
for sharing with other developers and
projects so these are the some of the
important phases of your maven builds
lifecycle and these are the command you
you know need to learn in order to
compile your project and package your
project and build your project right
there are some other command which we
have seen in the last video
for example clean and this is not the
part of this build lifecycle but it's
you know the command clean handles the
project
cleaning right but this is not the part
of this builds lifecycle and some of the
command like default and site which we
will see in the later videos are also
not the part of this build life cycle
but they are also used with maven so
this is how they even build life cycle
works I hope you enjoyed this video
