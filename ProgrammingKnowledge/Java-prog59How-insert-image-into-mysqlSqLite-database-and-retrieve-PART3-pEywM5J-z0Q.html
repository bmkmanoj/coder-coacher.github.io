name of next obtain this is the name of
my label which I have put inside the
desktop paint so I copied it and pasted
here dot set icon and in the bracket of
set icon I will paste format here if it
does not appear automatically so this is
my code for extracting picture on to my
jframe and let's try to run my program
and here you can see the text of pain
inside that long label and when I'm
gonna press press is this button I must
see a picture here so let's try yes when
I press the button I can see my picture
which I have saved in my database here
so instead of this symbol you can add
image of some employer and some other
thing and now I will tell you how to
show the picture when you click into
your table so when you click in the
table you can see your employee
information and also his picture so how
to do that first of all I will copy my
client block which I have made earlier
for images by this button so I copied
this code so I copied the code and and I
will go to my table
right click it go to event
mouse mouse click and this is the code
if you remember I have shown in the
ninth video which is taking the values
from your J table
show it into the text field so if you
don't remember or you don't know this
code we can just see a video number nine
this video get values from J table and
set it to the text field of napkin and
next one it means Java
and you must go here and what you have
to do is paste your try-catch block or
all the stuff you have copied for the
image here okay and just copy these two
lines which is from with your number
nine and cut them and paste it above
your trying catch block for the images
okay
and here we are just we have just
written the SQL query for employee ID
one only I will make it when you click
anywhere any row of the table the
respective photo will be so shown off
the respective image will be shown so
make a single quote code inside double
quote inside double plus sign and inside
just copy your this table click event
which I have made in video number nine
and paste it here this is very big I
copied something else
so I copy like a basic once again paste
it inside the last signs so this is what
you have to do and let's see what
happens when we run the program so now
when I click these table row my
respective image of the employee must
come so when I click here this image
comes when I click row number two my
second image comes here so in this way
you can extract your image into an index
top pane and using jlabel
and in the next video I will show you
how to save the images from your
jframe itself so you don't need to save
it into your database you will be able
to save it from your jframe itself so
