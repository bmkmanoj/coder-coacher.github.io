tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
an overview of Android activity
lifecycle so in the last video I have
shown you that whenever you go inside
this Java folder in your app and when
you click this main activity this is the
main brain or main logic of your Android
activity application and this is a Java
class which inherits from activity class
but when you take a look at this here
extend means inheriting from this class
right but you don't see that it's
inheriting from the activity class its
inheriting from action bar activity so
it's like a multiple inheritance and at
last the base class or superclass here
is the activity class so to demonstrate
this this main activity is inheriting
indirectly from activity class what you
can do is you can just control just
press control + or control and hover
over this action bar activity and click
it and you will reach to the action bar
activity and you can see this action bar
activity is inheriting from this class
which is fragment action so you can just
control just press control and hover
over this pregnant fragment action and
click it and now you can see this
fragment action extends from activity so
indirectly your main activity is
inheriting from activity class right so
now every activity has its life cycle
for example when your program or
activity launches first method it you
know looks for or it calls is
this method which is oncreate method and
we are just overriding this method from
the class we are inheriting from right
so here we are calling it and the first
thing when we start our application is
we want to launch the layout or set the
view of the layout layout is just this
design right so the first method which
will be called here is the oncreate
method in the same way here you can call
different method for example whenever
you run your Android app you can you
know you can user can resume this and
you can go to some other you know
Android app for example this Android app
and the other Android app which was our
actual app was running in the background
because it's not closed but it's running
in the background but you can close this
app also by you know going back and
close it so there are some method are
which are called when you do these all
actions when you go to your menu here
you can call your app by clicking you
know on the app and it will open like
this right so when you click this app
icon or when you you know do some other
cool things with your application what
are the method which are called this you
can write here and the overview of these
method you can see on Android you know
website in the documentation this link I
am going to give you in the description
of this video so you can go to this
documentation this is really extensive
documentation and here
you will see a diagram which will
demonstrate the basic lifecycle of an
activity so this is this is the same you
know picture as this and what happens
when you launch your application first
method which is called as I have told
you is on create and this on create
method calls this set content view which
sets the layout for you for the activity
right then if you add this method or
overwrite this method on start this
method is called when your activity
starts okay so after creating your act
layout you can call this method so this
method is called so this is the you know
chronological lifecycle of your activity
so these are the method which are called
one by one if you you know added this
method in your Java file mean activity
Java file then you can you know resume
this application or pause this
application right and in between this
application runs okay so these are the
chronological you know order of these
function which can be called by your
activity so resume then activity is
running then if you want to you know
call another activity for example you
are on the home page of your application
and you want to see the about page of
your application you go or you click
some button and then this activity which
is running is paused and then your new
activity you know going is going to
start okay and then if you unpause this
directive it is no longer visible and
stopped okay and whenever you shut down
or
you know you close your application it
destroys your activity and shut such
shuts down right so you can go to this
page and you can read about these
activity and these functions so what
every function means but I'm going to
give you a example how they are called
in this chronological order so that we
have the better understanding which
method is called when when we you know
launch our application here okay
so that's it for this video in the next
video I'm going to give you this example
of calling all these method one by one
and we will see how they are called
whenever we launch our activity so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
