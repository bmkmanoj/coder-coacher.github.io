video I will show you how to take a
screenshot of your desktop or your
screen of your computer and save it in
two different forms and also I will show
you how to show your screenshot in the
jframe also so let's get started first
of all go to your swing containers and
take a button which when we click it
will take a screenshot and I will also
take a label from here which will hold
my screenshot picture okay so this is a
jlabel and just this is a button I will
just change its text as capture image
and I mean
remove the text of the label and now
just double click here or write like
your button and go to event action and
action perform and in here we are going
to write our code so first of all we
will make a try-catch block so here
mm right this try-catch block so try and
in here catch exception e^x and in the
catch right the option pane dot show
message dialog in the bracket null comma
this e^x so this will catch exceptions
if any and in this try block now we will
write our code so in here write this
right rectangle and give it a variable
name rectangle I have given it the
variable name screen rect is equal to
new rectangle and in the bracket right
toolkit dot
default toolkit bracket dot get screen
size bracket and bracket closed and it's
showing me some error so I will right
click it and I will click fix import
because it require some imports so let's
see which import it require it requires
Java dot aw t dot toolkit import so and
all these are the import it requires so
I will just right click it and fix
import and it fix my inputs
so write this line and in the next line
write this line so write buffered image
and give it a variable name to buffer
image variable is equal to new robot
bracket closed dot create screen capture
and in the bracket you will just pass
this rectangle variable screen rect and
this also showing some red lines so I
will just right click and fix import if
you want to know which import it needs
just click this button and you will know
which imports it requires so just right
click and fix import and our import is
fixed so write this and in the next line
we will write image
icon and give it a variable name I am
naming it icon itself is equal to new
image
I can once again and bracket bracket
closed and in here we will pass our
buffered image variables so just copy it
and in this bracket just pass buffered
image okay
so what these three lines are doing is
first of all we created a rectangle
variable which takes the screenshot or
which holds the size of your screen shot
so in the rectangle argument we are
passing toolkit dot default toolkit dot
clean shot screen size so it will take
the size of the screen and then in the
next line we are creating an image
buffered image variable which will
contain the screenshot image so I am
writing this robot dot create screen
capture and in here I am passing the
rectangle size or the size of my screen
the next line is for showing this buffer
image into the label so we cannot
directly transfer this buffer image
variable into the label which is this
label so we need to convert first this
capture buffer image variable into an
icon and then we can set this icon into
the label so now just you need to copy
the name of the label and in here below
this image icon code just paste your
label
and dot fat icon and you are just
passing this image icon in here in these
brackets okay so what will do is it will
take the screenshot and set it into this
label so first of all let's see if this
works or not so I'll right-click and run
file and here is my file so when I click
my screenshot should come in the label
so I click it and you can see the screen
is bigger so that's why it's not coming
full but when I stretch it or stretch
like this it will come so this
screenshot will come into my label now
we will see how to save this image into
some folder or and into some different
files like jpg or PNG so just you need
to write below your code this code just
right this image IO variable and if it
shows some error just see which error it
shows and just it's showing fix import
so right click and fix import once again
dot
right and in here we will pass some
arguments so first argument will be the
same the buffered image variable so this
contains our image so just copy this and
pass it here in the first place and this
second argument is for the type of image
you want for example I want PNG image so
i will write p and g just like that and
in the third argument we will pass the
path of the folder in which we want to
save it so just right instead of null
new file sorry file
and in the bracket right these and in
here we will pass the path of our file
so once again it needs some imports so I
will right-click it and fix import so it
requires Java i/o file ok
and in here we will pass the path of the
folder so for example I want to show my
image or save my image on the desktop
itself so I will give the path of the
desktop and if it shows some error lines
so just give double slashes here and
after your desktop you just give the
name of the file or name of the picture
so I will name my picture as screen shot
dot PNG because my file is PNG ok so
just write this and now when you run the
program run and when I click this
capture image it shows the image into
this label also and when I see my
desktop it has captured the image here
also on the desktop ok
so in this way you can take the
screenshot of your screen and you can
show it into the label and you can save
it into the folder in different format
also so I hope you have enjoyed this
video and you have learned something new
this time so please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
