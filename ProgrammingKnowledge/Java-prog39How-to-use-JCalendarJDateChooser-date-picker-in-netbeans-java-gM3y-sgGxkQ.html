have learned how to populate on J table
and in the previous video we have
learned how to use your chaise like that
today I'm gonna show you how to use J
the chooser for example if you want to
enter date you have to write and then 2
0 1 2 - so sometimes it's if you want to
and so many dates so many data it's very
difficult to type these kind of dates
again and again so today I will show you
how to use a date chooser which looks
like this when you click this should in
jaded truth you can choose any date
month and yeah from here when you click
that it comes here this is called jaded
chooser and how can you use it in your
program I will show you today first of
all go to your google search or whatever
your browser and write it here download
so you write this download chicken in
the dot char and in the search you can
see Todd TOCOM just keep that
and go to its home and you have to
download this je calendar 1.4 dot zip ok
so just click it and save it wherever
you want unzip the file and save it at
your specified location I have already
done that so I don't need to do that so
do that and go to your NetBeans IDE and
go to your ballot right click into your
ballot and here you will see palette
manager click palette manager so palette
manager will open and then click Add
from jar and then wherever you have
saved your Jay calendar just click that
I have saved it on my desktop sign I'm
getting it here just click J calendar
and press next and you can see so many
components are available so for example
I want J calendar I will click it this I
will click Next and this here it will
show where you want to see your
component so I want to see in controls
swing controls so I will select that and
click finish and close so you can see a
new J calendar component will come or
appear here and then you just need
to drag it here this is the J calendar
and we wanted J they'd choose ur so once
again go to your palette manager add
from jar J calendar 1.4 next and we want
J they choose not to do the date so we
do this press next I want to see it in
my swing controls finish close and then
you can see Jade and chooser here when
you drag it here you can
run the program and see our deals and
when you click this thing the date
format will appear so you can choose
your month the year and the date to just
click it and you can use it like that
one more thing you can also change the
property of this Jada's chooser from
clicking it and going into the
properties in here
here date format string you can define
what in what format you want to see it
so clicked here for example I want to
see the year first and then the date and
then
the D click it and paste it here ok and
click OK and then if you run run the
program
and when you click some date it will
come in the same form as you choose here
month and date okay so that was the
tutorial on how to use on how to extract
your day jaded chooser I hope you have
learned something today and please rate
comment and subscribe and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
