last video I have shown you how you can
order data or filter data or find and
replace data in Access database using
these tool items here and I have also
given you a little introduction how to
create a form with your database now in
this video I am going to show you how
you can create and design your form so
that it will look interactive for
example I will show you how you can add
buttons to your form or how you can add
charts to your form so let's get started
we already have this data which we have
created in the first video right and I
have also shown you in the last with you
how you can create a form what you need
to do is you need to go to this create
tab and you can select this form button
and it will give you the form like this
so let's create a form which is a
different form from this and we will try
to design our form according to
ourselves right so let's design a form
okay so once again we are in create tab
and this time we need to go to this more
forms here and we will use this time
form wizard to create a form just click
this form wizard and in here you can
select the columns you want to show in
the form suppose if you want to show all
the columns just click this button or
otherwise if you want to do not you
don't want to include some column you
can just select the column and just pick
this one arrow button here and it will
go here so whatever fields are here will
be shown in the form and whatever fields
are here will not be shown in
the forum for example I want to show all
the fields in the form okay so I will
just select this and click Next and here
you can decide which type of form you
will want to show of the V which you
want to make there are four types you
which you can decide the first is called
columnar which is a default form type ii
is tabular third is a datasheet and
fourth is called justified i'm going to
choose this default column layout and i
will click Next and in here you can
choose the design you want to give to
your form you can change the design or
the layout at the runtime but yeah you
can choose your style from here so when
you click here you can see different
design and whatever design suits your
needs you can just select the design
okay for example right now I'm choosing
this equity style and I will click Next
and this here will ask you whether you
want to open the form to view or enter
information otherwise you can design
your form first which we are going to do
so I will select this radio button
modify the form design and I want to
save this form to the name employee info
form for example ok and make sure this
is selected modify the forms design and
I will click finish and now we are in
design mode here you can do
lot of designing stuff so what you can
do here is you can for example you want
to change the background color of these
boxes you can just select all the box
right click it and fill background you
can select the spill background I will
choose this light green color for
example and you see here it's changed
and similarly you can change these
labels also so I will select all these
labels and right click and I will choose
for these labels a little bit darker
color for example like this okay this is
just an example you can choose your
colors and design your form as you wish
you can also resize these columns and
text boxes like this or you can just
select all these values and right-click
and you can align them on the Left white
top for example I want to align them on
the top I select them these are already
on the top let's align them on the Left
no it's not moving and on the bottom for
example so it it aligns itself it's
already aligned - it's not aligning you
can change the size to fit or to grid or
- tallest shortest for example I choose
to fit and it will fit to the your word
which are there in the text boxes or
labels right and for example what I want
now I will go to the layout view to
change the views you just go click this
button and I will go to the layout view
and I can see
how my design is looking and I want to
for example change the font size I will
once again go to the design view I can
move this title wherever I want
so for example first of all I change the
font size and font size will be for
example 26 I can make it bigger so it
can fit and I want to make it in the
middle okay once again I will go to the
layout view and in here also you can add
some more things for example we have
chosen some design in in the initial
stages of this form and we are creating
this form you can change these designs
by navigating these new design patterns
like this like this so for example
eyeing like this so I change I can
change my design of the form in addition
I can add date and time to my form so
when I click this date and time and I
can choose the format I want to show I
only want to show the date for example I
do not want to show the time or usually
uncheck this and I will just leave this
as default and I will click OK and you
can see here date is included in the
form now for example I also want to
change the font color I can change it to
white and I want to make it bold and a
little bit bigger 20 so I can do it like
this make it smaller a little bit and
brag and drop here okay you can also add
a logo by clicking here
just click here and choose your logo and
you can show it on the title here but
since I don't have any logo right now
I'm not adding it but yeah this logo
also it is also here so you can change
it now for example once again we go to
the design view for example you want to
add buttons so what I will do is in my
design view I have this tool called
button I will click this and I will
place my button here and here it will
give me a custom button wizard and I
what I can do is I can add these buttons
so for example I want to add a Save
button or add new record I will go to
the record operation and I will select
this add new record I will click Next
and I will change I don't want to use
the picture for example so I will choose
this text and I can change this text
from here right now I think this text is
OK for me so I will not change but you
can change this text from here click
Next and you can give the name to your
button also so that you remember it I
will simply give the name add record for
example ok and to click finish so this
is your add record button in the same
way for example I want to add a Save
button I will click this and place this
button here once again go to the record
operation select save record and next I
will choose text
and I will click next and I will give
the name to it save and I will finish it
and this gives me the same record right
now for example you want to change the
style of these two button what you can
do is you can just select any text box
here you can just click this button here
and just apply this style to this button
in the same way I will just make it
bigger so save record you can see save
record once again for add record and
like this okay and for example I want to
unlined this button I can just select
both of them right click and what I will
do is I will go to the layout and I will
say steak so this past text now for
example I want to and add up some more
button for next or navigate my daughter
I can add it dole button also go to the
button add it here and I will say record
navigation first of all I will select
the the first record next this time I
will choose this picture because this
looks nice and I will click next give
the name for example post first record
okay so in the same way you can add some
more buttons one this time I will choose
the next button and our next finish once
again
the last button and its next finish and
once again the pitch previous record
okay
and finish and then I can arrange these
buttons like this so it looked like a
navigation bar kind of a thing okay so
like this
and you can give the layout tabular or
step layout step okay so whatever you
want to give like this so I think this
is okay for me now for example you want
to add a chart to your form what you can
do is generally we write that query
first and then add chart but since I'm
going to I mean I mean teach you query
in the next video so I will not use the
queries but the default the design for
the charts right now and you when you
learn query you can more interactively
add chart to your form so for example I
want to add a simple chart right now I
can go to this button called chart drag
and drop into my form once again running
drop into my format will give me a
wizard right now I don't have any query
so I will not select query but if you
have queries man you can select ready or
you can select both and I will click
Next and in here I can choose which
column I want to use in my chart so for
example I want to use date of birth in
my chart I will select this and filter
it here and I'll click Next and then I
can choose which kind of chart I want so
I want to this chart click Next
and see the preview of the chart click
Next and click finish you can see here
and once you go to the layout view you
will be able to see your form design
like this so in this way you can do many
other things in this form just need to
play with these buttons for example you
can add combo box radio buttons groups
and many other things you just need to
play with these items and see what you
can do with these items you can add
these page numbers also so just select
this and select the format or page
number and click OK it will add the page
number to the header ok so I hope you
and you get to know many things to
create the form and I hope you have
learned something new this time in the
next video I will show you how to query
the database so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
