Linux command line tutorial for
beginners and in this video we will
learn about the basics of group
management using Linux terminal so I'm
going to show you a bunch of commands
and first come on I'm going to show you
is a command called groups command and
this command will allow you to see which
are the groups your current user is
connected to so my current user
I'm login logged in with this
programming knowledge and these are the
groups my current user is you know
connected to okay so these are the
groups my current user is a member of
right now the next command I'm going to
show you is to list all the groups which
are available on your operating system
so this command is cat so this is a
directory called etc' and in this etc'
directory there is a file called groups
and all the groups are listed there so
we are going to just write etc' and then
just write group here and then press
ENTER and it's going to show you all the
groups which are there on your systems
right and you can see there is a group
called jenkins and the last you can see
the user which is connected to the group
so for example my user is connected to
this group for example or the user from
which i'm logged in is connected to LP
admin also right so this is the command
for listing all the groups available in
your Linux operating system right now
the next command is to add the new group
to this list of groups so these groups
are added to this file
in you know date wise order so whatever
groups you will add now it will be added
to the bottom of this file okay
so let's add a group so I'm going to
write sudo and then write a command
called a group ad so just write group ad
and then the name of the group so for
example I want to add a group called
Java here I am going to press ENTER and
I am going to give my password so this
Java group will be added to the file in
the et Cie group
okay so just cat this once again and you
can see this group is added to your you
know group list right in the same way I
can add multiple groups for example this
time I want to add CPP group and then I
want to add Python group and for example
I want to add database group right and
once again I will see all these groups
using this cat ETCs forward slash group
command and you can see all these groups
are added to your group list right now
the next command is to delete these
groups how we can delete these groups
okay so for example I want to delete the
group called a CPP then I can just write
sudo for giving the root access and then
we are just going to write rope del for
deleting the group and the name of the
growth for example CPP okay so press
ENTER and then list the groups again and
now you can see this group called CPP is
deleted now the next command I am going
to show you here is how you can assign a
user to a particular group so for
example I want to assign the user for
example this user program
knowledge to the database group how can
I add this user to this database group
so for this also we will write sudo
first of all and then just write G PA SS
WD right and then right - a flag for
adding the group and - D flag for
removing from the group removing user
from the group right first of all we
will add the user to the group so - a
flag for adding the user and then the
username which you want to add to the
group so programming knowledge and then
the next a is the name of the group you
want to add it to so this is the name of
the group you want to add and this is
the command
okay so sudo G passwd - a for adding the
group then the username and then the
group name and press enter and then you
can see we can see the message adding
user this to the group this right and
then we can list the group once again
and you can see this user is now the
member of the database group right now
if you want to remove this user you can
just write instead of for a flag you can
use the flag for removing the user from
the group and press enter and you can
see this message removing user program
programming knowledge from group
database and we can verify it by just
you know printing the content of this
file again and you can see the user
programming knowledge is no longer the
member of database group right so in
this way you can use group management
and these are some of the command which
you can use for group management in your
Linux operating system using terminal I
