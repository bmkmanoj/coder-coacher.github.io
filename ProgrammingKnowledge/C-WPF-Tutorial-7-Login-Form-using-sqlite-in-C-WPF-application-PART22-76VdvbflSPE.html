don't need to give this long path but if
you are your database is outside your
debug folder or is a bit away from your
Exe file folder then you can give the
path also so write data source is equal
to database dot DB which is my database
name then semicolon version is equal to
3 semicolon and double quotes so write
this line at the top now in this button
click event for login page what I will
do is I will create a connection with my
SQLite database so write this line here
so first declare this s collide
connection right SQLite connection and
give it a variable name s collide corn
in my case is equal to new SQLite
connection and here in this argument of
this SQLite connection you will pass
this connection string variable here so
this just copy this and paste it here
and then just copy this SQLite
connection variable here and write dot
open now here we can also provide this
try catch block so if this dot of ways
faces dump some exception then it will
catch the exception catch
and just give this and here you can
right
exception e X and in here you can give
the message box dot show and in the
bracket just copy this e^x and dot
message okay now in this try-catch block
after this SQLite con dot open what we
need to do is we need to pass our query
so so here we will write this line so
right string and give it a variable name
because it's it is my query string so i
will write query is equal to then i will
pass my query
so I will write select star from
employee m4 which is my table name of my
database so this is the table and this
is called employee info that's why I
have written here so select star from
employee m4 where user name so my column
here is called user name so I have
written where user name is equal to then
write this single quote and inside
double quote and inside this give this
plus sign and write this dot text
underscore username dot txt this is my
textbox name so this text box name is
text underscore username so that's what
I have written here this dot tex under
cool username dot txt okay and then
after this end of this single quote
right and password is equal to single
quote double quote plus and then I will
write this dot txt and
scope password dot txt this is my
textbox name of for the password right
so I have written this query then in the
next line I will click create the
command for this query so I will write
this line right SQLite command and give
it a variable name create command is
equal to new SQLite command and in the
argument of this SQLite command just
pass this very variable as a first
argument and write this SQLite con
variable as a second argument so write
this line now in the third line I will
write here these two lines so I will
execute this query now so write create
command which is my this SQLite command
variable dot execute no and non query
and bracket and ragged clothes and
declare a new variable called s collide
data reader and give it a variable name
called dr for data reader is equal to
create command dot s execute reader and
break it and break it close in the next
line for login page I am creating a
integer called count is equal to 0 and
then I will create a while loop so I
will write while bracket and break it
close from here and in this while loop I
will copy this dr variable from here and
then I will write dot read and here
close these brackets and now in this I
what I will do is I will copy this count
inter variable and
will do plus plus and bracket closed
okay now after this while loop what I
will do is I will create a condition so
what condition I am going to create is
right if and give it just close this
first if condition and first of all
right if count is
equal to one then I will pass some
message which shows like this in this F
condition I have written message box da
show username and password is correct so
what I am doing is I am writing or
entering the username and password and I
am passing this query to query the
database and it goes to the while loop
and it searches for the username and
password and while in the while loop
it increases if it's fine it finds the
username and password and if it finds
the username and password once then your
username and password is correct and I
will just copy this condition to good
time more so 1 &amp;amp; 2 and if this count is
greater than 1 then you will write
duplicate username and password and you
can also write try again right
and if this count is smaller than 1 then
you can write username and password is
not correct okay so that is your code
for the login page okay so now we are
going to run the code now so run this
code and first of all we will just see
the table what we have in the username
and password so I have 3 employees right
now and first employee username and
password is 1 and 1 second you employee
username in this password in
user name is two and two and in the
third employ my username and password is
one and one again so this is a duplicate
username and password which I created
for a reason to show this demonstration
so now when I run the program and it's
running and I write here one and one
username and password and I click here
login it shows me duplicate username and
password
why because this username and password
is present two times and two employees
cannot have the same username and
password that's why I have given this
condition now when I write here - and -
employee ID then it says me username and
password is correct because it's present
only once and username and password is
correct and when I give you a three and
some random value and I click it says me
username and password is not correct
okay so now your login page is basically
working right you just need to change
this username content if you want so it
will look good and here also password
just change the content so now it's
looking better okay so in this way you
can create a login page for your WPF
c-sharp application using your SQLite
database I hope you have enjoyed this
