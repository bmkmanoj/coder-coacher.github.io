tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will see how
to create a new activity and open it
using our main activity or first
activity so for example for some reason
you want to open us new activity or run
the next activity using your first
activity how we can do it we will see in
this video so right now I have this
blank project or you can say hello world
project and if you don't know how to
create this project you can just go to
the initial videos of this series and
see how I have created this blank
project so this project right now have
only one activity which is our main
activity right now to add a new activity
to your app what you need to do is go to
your app here so just select Android and
in here in the app category you just
need to go to this re s or res folder
and res Stanford resources folder and
inside this resources folder there is a
folder called layout right you just need
to right-click on this layout folder and
go to new and we are going to go to the
activity and we will select a blank
activity from here so select the this
plank activity and in here this wizard
will open you can give a name to your
activity for example second activity
okay and everything is by default are
created for you and just click finish
once you click finish there will be a
second activity which will be created
for you and now you will be able to see
in in your layout folder in your
resources directory the
we'll be a extra XML file created for
your second activity which is activity
underscore second dot XML similarly in
your Java Java folder you will be able
to see that there will be a new class
added to your Java folder which is
second activity dot Java file and in the
manifest folder here there will be a
file called Android manifest dot XML
file and in here also you will be able
to see that this new activity is added
to your draw to your you know mean
manifest XML file right now what we are
going to do is we are going to add in
this manifest file where your main
activity XML element is there and now
you have this second activity tag right
so by default it's a blank tag in a
sense that it just have the name and the
title but unlike this main activity it
doesn't have this intent filter tank so
with what we are going to do is we are
going to copy this intent filter from
here so just copy this and go inside
your second activity element or tag here
and just make a space here and paste
this intent - filter here right and in
here what you need to do is you need to
change this name in the action and the
category so the in the category first in
the category are tag you just need to
change it to
the default because the launcher of our
app is the main activity which is this
one and the second activity is the
default activities just delete this
launcher from here and just to dot
default okay and similarly this name
should be the name of your package okay
so just go to your activity underscore
second dot XML file inside your layout
folder so just go here and go to the
text of this folder so this is my
activity underscore second dot XML file
and in here you will be able to see our
tools : context is equal to comm dot
example dot whatever your package name
is right you just need to copy this path
from here which start from comm dot
example or whatever your package name is
just copy this path and once again go to
your Android manifest dot XML file and
instead of this and Android dot intend
dot whatever dot mean in your action tag
you just need to replace it by your
second activity package name which is
comm dot example dot whatever your
package is okay
so this will be similar to this thing
okay so second activity second activity
okay now everything is done now we are
ready to you know create some code to
open the second activity from our first
activity so I'm going to open my first
activity first and in here in the main
activity what I'm going to do is I will
just remove everything and in here I'm
going to add a button and this button
I'm going to use to open my second
activity so I will just change the text
to open
second activity for example okay and the
ID I will leave it as default which is
button okay now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go to my main activity dot
Java file here so this is the Java file
for my main activity and in here I'm
going to cast this button so first I
will create a button instance so private
static button for example I name my
variable as button submit and now what
I'm going to do is in here just below my
on create method I am going to create a
new method as I have been doing in the
last videos which is a public void and
for example this method I named it as on
click button list now okay it's not
going to take any argument and now we
will write the code of this method okay
so first thing first first of all we are
going to cast this button to its ID so
button SB M is equal to button and I
will find it by ID so find view by ID r
dot ID dot button which is the ID of my
button and now I am going to take my
button underscore SBM variable and I
will add or set a listener to this
button variable so dot
set on click listener and inside this
set on click listener I will create a
new on click listener so new on click
listener right so this is simple right
and inside this on click method we are
going to create a object of our intent
class so this is the class which we
which will help us to open the new
activity which is our second activity so
let's create an object of intent intent
intent for example variable name is
intent is equal to new intent and the
constructor of this intent takes a
argument which is the package name of
your second activity or whatever
activity you want to open so as you
remember that we have changed the name
of this action tag here which was this
one so I'm going to copy this path from
here comm dot example dot whatever add
at the last your activity and name comes
so in here I will copy this path from
here and I am going to go to my main
activity and as an argument of this
intent constructor I am going to pass it
here okay so now everything is done now
I just need to call its intent to start
the activity so there is a method called
start activity which takes intent as an
argument okay so in this start activity
just pass your intent variable and now
everything
is done now we just need to call this
method inside our on create method so
just copy the name of this method and
just call it inside our main method and
now we are going to run our application
so now our activity is running now which
is our main activity I will click this
open second activity button and once we
click this our second activity opens by
this button we can go back to a first
activity and once again when we click
our button it opens our second activity
right hello world okay so in this way
you can open your second activity using
your first activity by using this intent
method so in tenth class so I hope you
