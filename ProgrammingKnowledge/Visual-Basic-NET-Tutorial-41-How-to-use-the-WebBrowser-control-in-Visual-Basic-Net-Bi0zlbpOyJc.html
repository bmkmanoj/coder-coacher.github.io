show you how to use web browser control
in your visual basic windows form
application using this web browser
control you can open any web site or URL
in your windows form which is this form
so let's get started I'm going to take a
button from here and I will take a text
box to enter the URL of any website and
I'm going to take our web browser
control which you can find here and I
will resize it a little and if you want
you can dock or anchor this web browser
by going to the property called anchor
and just anchored it to the right side
bottom and I will change the text of
this button as navigate now I will just
select this navigate button and double
click it and in here I will write the
code to navigate some website so here I
will write web browser 1 which is the
name of my web browser dot navigate and
in the bracket we will pass the URL
which way we are going to enter in the
text box so we will write textbox 1 dot
text okay now when I run this program
and this textbox I can enter any URL for
example www.google.com and when I press
this navigate button it will open
google.com in your web browser control
you can see here now just to make this
web browser little bit advanced we can
add some more functionality to the web's
of the browser for example we want to
add the functionality for going forward
and going back and refresh your website
then just add some more buttons here and
I'll just resize it and I'll take one
two and three buttons and if button I
will change the text of this button as
go forward the button and change the
text as pull back and this button I will
change the text as refresh okay now I
will just select my go forward button
and in here I'm right web browser one
dot go forward and in the same way I
will click this go back button and I
will write web browser one dot go back
and in the refresh button double-click
it just and just right browser 1 dot
refresh okay now when I run the program
once again I'm going to write
www.google.com and I will say navigate
and it will open Google in my web
browser control and for example I'm
searching for YouTube here so it will go
here and I will just open YouTube from
here now I want to go back so I will
click this go back button and it will go
to the previous URL I have navigated
once again I can go back and in the same
way I can go forward and I can go
forward right and if I want to refresh
my page I can just refresh and my page
will be refreshed one thing you will
notice here is in this text box your URL
is not changing when you are going back
it's always remain
www.google.com/mapmaker back or when we
go forward this we can fix easily by
selecting your web browser and going to
the this events button here this little
button for events like this and search
for the property called navigated and
double click here and we reach to the
property called the browser navigated
right and in
just right textbox1 dot text which is
our text box name and is equal to web
browser 1 dot URL thought to string okay
so what this line will do here it will
just whatever you are you URL you are
navigating it will just print it or
print just copy it to your text box once
again we are going to run the program
once again we will open www.google.com
and we will navigate and once again we
are going to search for YouTube for
example and go to the YouTube and if you
can see here the URL is constantly
changing according to our navigation so
when we go back it goes back to the
Google search when we go back it will go
once again to the Google search so the
URL is changing according to the
navigation so in this way you can make a
simple browser in your visual basic
windows form application I hope you have
