Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn about options in
Scala now in Scala option is a container
which can give you two values it can
give you an instance of some or it can
give you an instance of none so now
let's see how options are useful and how
we can use it so in this example I have
a list and this list contains 3 elements
1 2 3 and I have a map which contains a
map of integer verses some name so let's
say I want to find something inside this
list so how can I find in a list I can
use a method court called find so my
variable name list and then dot find
will give me whatever I want to find so
I want to find anything which is greater
then let's say 6 so I want to find
something which is greater than 6 but we
can see there is no value which is
greater than 6 in this list so what will
it return so when I hover over this find
method you will see the return value is
an option and this option is what we are
talking about these options so what this
option is doing so in the return you can
see an option value containing the first
element in the list that satisfy P or
none if none exists so let me print the
result of this fine so I'm going to just
write print Ln inside these parentheses
and let me just run this code and it
gives me none which is an instance of
this thing so because there is no value
which is greater than 6 in this list is
going to give me none now let's say I
give here the value 2 which satisfies my
condition and there is a value which is
greater than 2 in my list so this time
let's see what I will get so I'm going
to run my code and it gives me some so
an option can give you two kind of
result either none or some so if the
values using find method if this
condition is fulfilled then it's going
to give us the first result otherwise if
this find is not satisfied that is going
to give us the instance of none in the
same way there is a method in map also
so I'm going to just write print Ln and
there is method in map so I'm going to
just write map which is my variable name
dot get and this is going to give me
when I write inside these parentheses
are key it's going to give me the value
associated with it so the value
associated with key 1 is Tom in this
case and when I hover over this get
method you can see the return value is
also an option and this is also going to
give us none if this key doesn't exist
or the result if this key exists so let
me run the code and let's see what the
result is so it gives me some Tom
because this key exists inside my list
so that's why it returns me the value
associated with this key same for the
value let's say two so forth key 2 it's
going to give me max so now the question
is how we can extract
the value from this some instance so
this is giving us the instance of some
but we want to extract the value out of
this fine let's say so we want to
extract 3 out of this fine so to get 3
out of this fine you can use a method
called get on your option result so this
is going to give you an option as a
result this fine and when you call a
method called get on your option then
it's going to give you the value inside
your sum or when it's none we will see
other result a little bit later but
let's say this value exists so let me
just run this code and you can see now I
get 3 out of this option sum right so
same we can do here so when we call a
method called get on option which is the
result of this get method then we will
get our value here now let's say in my
map I'm going to give 5 here this key
doesn't exist so what happens now so I'm
going to just run the code and it will
give me an exception so it will throw an
exception and it says no such element
exception so because there is no element
and we are trying to access the value of
that element that's why we are getting
an exception now to avoid an exception
we can use a method called gate or else
so we can use a method called get or
else and then we can just print out in
the else condition whatever we want to
return so let's say we want to return no
name found and
let's run the code and you can see it
prints no name phone so when the value
exists so let's say I'm going to just
give three here it's going to return me
the value which is associated with this
key if the key exists and if the key
doesn't exists it is going to give me
this value which I have defined as my
else condition okay so let me run the
code it's going to give me no name found
same you can do with your list find also
so I'm going to return let's say a
number so I'm going to just return 0 if
this value doesn't exist so I'm going to
give here 6 once again and let me run
the code and it returns me 0 because
none of the values inside my list is
greater than 6 and when this value is 2
which is there in my list then it's
going to return me the result so that
means you can use get to get the value
or otherwise but the better way is to
use get or else in this case you will
not get an exception which is thrown
when the value doesn't exist now let's
see how we can define an option let's
say we want to define an option we can
just say Val and then the variable name
let's say opt is the variable name and
then we define the data type which is
option in our case and then we want to
define which kind of option we want to
give so let's say we want to define an
INT option and then we can just assign
some so we can either assign some and
whatever sum we want to provide here
let's say 5 or we can provide a none
value so instead of giving this we can
give
instance of none also which is also
valid
so let's print the value of this opt so
I'm going to just write print Ln and
then I'm going to just say opt and then
we are going to just check whether this
option is empty or not so there is a
method called is empty is going to
return as a boolean value so if the
option is empty it's going to return as
true and if the option is not empty then
it's going to return as false so right
now it's none that means it's empty so
it returns us true now let me assign
some value here so I'm going to just
write instance of some and any number
because this is of int type right this
option is of int type so I'm going to
just run the code and now it returns
false because there is some value for
this option now if I want to get this
value out of my option as I said I can
use a get method so I can just write get
this is going to give me the value out
of this sum so this is how we can use
options in Scala I hope you've enjoyed
