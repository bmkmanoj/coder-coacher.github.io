on PHP programming tutorial for
beginners and in this video we are going
to write our first hello world code in
PHP so first of all we will start our
Apache server so go to your Start menu
and in here search for XA MVP which we
have installed and open XMPP control
panel form from here so open this
zamp control panel and when this control
panel starts we need to start the Apache
server right
and in this notepad plus plus by the
meantime we are going to write our code
and just go to your folder wherever you
have installed this sxa MVP server or
XMPP folder in your computer so in the
second video I have shown you how to
install XMPP so go to that folder
wherever you have install XMPP I have
installed it in C and XMPP folder and in
here I have told you that in this HT
dock all your Program Files will be
there right these all will be there so
what we are going to do is we are going
to make a new folder here and we will
call it as anything whatever you like
for example to Tory year or YouTube
whatever you wish to write here YouTube
okay so and go in that folder and we are
going to create a new PHP file here okay
so just go to your notepad plus plus and
copy the same location whatever you made
right now this will just copy the
location of the folder YouTube in my
case you can change it as your personal
folder in htdocs' but remember it should
be in HD dog and then go to your node
plus one which we have install right in
the last video click this tab here right
click it and save as and you can search
for the part where ever you want to save
it so you you want to save it in the
same folder as your as your XA MVP right
so here is my XMPP folder and htdocs'
and this folder I have created YouTube
and in here I'm going to write my or
create my first PHP program I will name
a test test dot PHP for example and I
will save it and now we can start our
programming by the mean time this XA MPP
server has already started and in here
when we start this server it will still
give you this error because in the
config file you need to make the change
I have already told you that and when
you go to this config here its 8080
right so whenever you need to start
there this if this server will be
started on the port 8080 and not on the
port 80 right and then you for now you
don't need to start this MySQL server we
are not going to use this Mike's MySQL
database for now first start your Apache
server right now let's see if what and
how we can write our first hello world
program so every PHP program start with
this script of with these tags
so it will start with this tag this
smaller than symbol thence question mark
and then PHP and then it will end with
this greater than symbol okay and
whatever code you will write in between
here I forgot to give this question mark
here so the starting tag is like this
every code which you write in PHP will
be written in between these two tags so
this tag is the starting tag I will make
it a little bit bigger so you can see
and so every PHP code will start from
the tags like this and and with the tag
like this okay so we will see in some
slides what does the PHP code look like
structurally similar to C and C++ okay
so a PHP code will be structurally
similar to PHP C++ and C in a way that
it can be and it can support procedural
language like C and it can be used as a
object-oriented programming also to some
degree which C++ is right and this
object-oriented part we will we are
going to see it later but for now we are
going to see the procedural path okay
and all PHP statement and with a
semicolon
right and each PHP script must be
enclosed in the reserved PHP tag like
this and like this okay so I have
already shown you this so I will go to
our code here and I will write something
to echo so I have this echo function we
use it for printing something on the
browser for example and after this echo
function whatever comes in these double
quotes will be printed on the browser so
for example I
hello world and remember every PHP
statement end with semicolon so don't
forget to add the semicolon at the end
of your every line of the code right I
will save this program and I will open
my browser and I will write here local
host local host and my port is 80 AD so
localhost colon 8080 you need to write
if you are running on port 80 here not
8080 but only ap you don't need to give
this port number port 80 is by default
the local host port right if you are
running on port other than ap for
example in my case I'm running on a DAT
you need to give localhost colon 8080
and the location of the PHP file you are
in so if you remember we have created
this YouTube folder and inside this we
have this our test dot PHP okay so in
our browser we will write you tube this
is the folder and then you need to give
the path of your text file right just
give slash test dot PHP and when you run
this or press ENTER you will be able to
see this hello world yeah okay so this
is the basic code to print hello world
right and every every code which you
write in the PHP don't forget to end
this code with this semicolon and always
start this your PHP code with this
starting tag like this and end with
ending tag like this now to comment to
give some command for example we will
see in the slides so too
give the comments PHP support C++ or
Java style comments like this slash
double slash here
it also supports shell style comment
like this hash and to also support C
style comments like this so we will all
we will see it all all the comments for
example its suppose this support this
double slash and whatever you can write
here it will be not executed by our
compiler right for example I can write
here this is a hello world code for
example okay and whatever code you will
write in this double slash or for
example I can run by the same thing
using my hash symbol okay and I can
write the same thing using this C style
comments like this slash Astrix mystics
slash and whatever you write in between
this will be considered as a comment so
you can provide comments in three ways
in c++ time like double slash in shell
style using this shell or or this hash
or like c style using this slash and
Astrix and Astrix and slash and this all
code which you write in this comment
section will not be executed so i will
save this file and once again when i
refresh this this code will not be
executed this is just for your reference
okay now for example if you can you can
also say i i want to print this hello
world in two different lines so I can
just write hello here and world here and
let's see what is the response the
spawns will always be the same okay
because your
mine is ending here right and it is
indicated by the semicolon so this code
and this code will be considered as one
line of code okay
and PHP also support HTML tags so if you
don't know how to use HTML I have the
playlist in my channel you can search
for this HTML tutorials or otherwise you
don't even need to follow those if you
don't want to it's really easy to
understand this HTML tags so for example
I want to break this hello world and I
want to print hallo in one line and
world in other line I can use HTML tags
like these and I can give this break tag
to break the line and for example I want
to print this world in capital capital
letters or bold letters so I can just
give this bold tag here and and this tag
like this okay and when I save this and
when I run the program or when I run
this on the screen I will refresh this
once again you see hello on one line and
world on other line and world is in bold
letters right so this PHP supports HTML
tags also right so this is how you can
write your first program or first hello
world program in PHP and the later
videos I'm also going to show you how to
code this PHP in in details so that's it
