Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use date picker
in Java effects so let's get started I
have created this sample project which
is called date picker and in the
application package I have this main dot
Java in which I have added this main dot
F XML file and I have this main
controller dot Java class which is blank
right now and I also have created a main
dot F XML file which is blank right now
so first of all I'm going to open my
main dot F XML file in scene builder and
in here first of all I will go to the
search option here and search for date
picker and drag and drop into my anchor
pin right now
there are some properties which you can
use for a date/time picker so first of
all let's preview this date/time picker
so go to preview here and then click
show preview and you can see you can
choose the dates like this right so the
week information is not present here
right so what you can do to you know
show the week information you can select
your date picker and then you can choose
this option which says show week number
okay and then it's going to you know
show you the weeks also okay so just
check this option and once again preview
it and now you can see on the left hand
side the week 45 46 47 and the week
number right there are some other
options also you can set the editable
option which makes your date time picker
editable or not editable by default its
editable so you can you know enter your
own date here for example 25 for 2015
something like this
okay and when you uncheck this option
you can't add it your date so I am NOT
able to enter any date you can just
select the date but you cannot add it
this date okay
now let's see how we can you know get
the date and print on some label so what
I'm going to do I'm going to take a
label from here and then I'm going to
name my label for example date and the
label ID also I'm going to change label
ID will be show date okay l BL for label
right and the ID for the date picker I'm
going to give it as for example D P for
date picker right save your code and one
more thing we must do here is to connect
our controller to F XML file so go to
controller here and choose application
dot main controller now save your code
here and go to your project and refresh
your project and then go to your main
controller dot Java class and in here
just declare this date picker and label
okay so at the rate FX ml private date
picker DP which is the ID which we have
given right and in the same way we will
declare the label so just declare a
label and the name of the label was just
see the label name here just copy the
same name and paste it here okay and
import the label from JavaFX scene
controls now we are going to create a
public void method for listening to the
date/time picker right so it will be
public void and the name is for example
show date okay and it's going to take
one argument which is
action event and give the argument name
for example event and then what we can
do here is we can you know get the value
which we have selected from the date
picker something like this so you need
to include our local date class so just
use local date and name it as for
example LD for local date is equal to
take your DP which is date picker right
dot get value okay so it's going to
return you the date whatever you have
selected in the form of local date right
now you can take your label and then set
the text on this label something like
this so take your LD variable which is a
local date variable and then call a
method called two string which is to
convert this to string right save your
code and one more thing you need to do
here is you need to link this function
from your date picker right so just
select your date picker and then go to
the code and in the on action you just
need to choose this show date method
from here save your code and refresh
your project and then run it so right
click run as java application and our
app is running now so I'm going to
choose some date and now you can see the
date is printed here right some other
date it's printed here and you can
choose any other date which will be
printed here so this was a short video
on using date picker in Java effects I
