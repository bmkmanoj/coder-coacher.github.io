shown you how to use setter and getter
method to protect your member variable
from accessing by the other classes or
the main class and I've also shown you
why we need to use setter and getter and
why it's a good practice to use setter
and getter in object-oriented
programming now c-sharp has its own way
of setting and getting these values and
that is through properties through
properties you can also do the same
thing and even better by setting and
getting the values and not exposing your
member variables of the class so in the
last video I have given you an example
of cook class which has the member
variable book ID book name and book
number of pages and I have shown you how
you can protect these variable by using
set method and get method so if you
haven't seen that video please see that
video so that you can understand the
setter and get own method and I'm using
the same code from the last time so we
have the book class and these three
member variable and I have shown you how
you can set and get values right now
let's see how we can do achieve the same
thing to protect your variable by
properties so first of all I have shown
you how you can set or you can create
setter and get a method for this ID of
the book and we have just used this set
ID and get ID now let's see how we can
do it by a properties the same thing so
what we need to do here is
instead of this setter and getter method
we use public and the return type which
is in our case integer because ID is an
integer so we will write in public in
and give the name of your property so
for IDE I will give for example this
property called ID and this will not
take any argument here and for setting
the values I use the keyword set and
then in these curly braces
I just enclose my earlier set setter
method like this and in the similar way
what I will do is I will just use the
keyword jet and I will use these curly
braces and in this I will return my ID
which is this variable so how we have
declared this property ID here we have
use keyword to set the value and how we
are setting the values in the same way
we have done in the setter method but
instead of this ID because this set is
not taking any argument right and for
example I want to set ID so instead of
set ID method what I can say is IDs v1
which is a the object of book class and
we can say B 1 dot ID is equal to 10 for
example so I set the ID is equal to 10
now where this 10 goes in this property
so it's it we use the keyword value to
assign that property or assign that
value to your set
method because it's not taking any
argument right so we use keyword so
whenever for example you assign b1 which
is an or object dot our property name
which is ID is equal to 10 this 10 will
be stored in this value and then it will
see if this value is less than 0 and if
it's less than 0 it will show the
exception or throw the exception
otherwise it will assign this value to
your ID right and when you call this ID
so for example I want to access the ID I
can simply use my B one dot ID and
replace it here right and let me comment
this second console dot white line
so now to access your ID you just need
to use v1 dot ID okay instead of get
method so this is how you define
property in C shop you use set method to
set the bed value and just remember that
you need to use this value to store
whatever is assigned to your variable or
to do whatever you is assigned to your
ID and then to get the value you just
return it here like this and to access
this value you just need to give the
same thing b1 dot ID right we can do it
do the same for our book name class we
have declared set book name and get book
name right so I will just delete this
argument because we are property you
will not take any argument but it will
return a string so I will declare public
string and let name this proper
the book name right and for setting once
again we use the keyword set and in
these curly braces we enclose our code
for setting the value right and for
getting the value we use the keyword get
once again get and in these two curly
braces we return whatever we want to
return so string or we will just return
this okay and we can take delete this
get and set method and this will do just
fine this works just fine for example
for setting the book name I can say v1
dot and it will give me this property
now it is called book name right and I
can assign any value to the book name
like this as we assign it to some
variable so I will give the name the
c-sharp book okay and I can access it
once again very simply just copy this
and you can exit this access this
property like this so when I run the
program it shows some error let's see
what ok because I haven't used the
keyboard value here and it doesn't know
what this is so I need to pass in the
value keyword this will this just
remember always it doesn't take any
arguments that method doesn't take
anyone women instead of argument you
just need to pass the keyboard value
here and value here right now when I run
the program it shows the result book ID
is 10 which we have assigned and book
name is c-sharp
book okay so I can say a book name is
theshia now if you have remembered in
the last video we also have this
variable called number of pages and it
was we we have already assigned a value
to number of pages as 250 so it's not
possible to set the value for number of
pages so how we can define the property
for this instead of this get number of
pages what we can do is we can just only
use get property and we can avoid using
set property for that and now it will
just give you the value of number of
pages but you cannot set the value of
number of pages so just I will just copy
this and I will say book pages is and I
can call this property number of pages
here okay
and when I run the program it will run
fine book pages s 250 okay now if you
don't have any conditions and you just
need simple set and get method for
example you don't need it if if your ID
is less than 0 or you need don't need to
check that if your book name is null and
you just need to set and get value
without any special special conditions
like I have illustrated in the last
video for example I will give you an
example so I have a private member
private int this will be int and we have
for example author so this let's take it
as a string and
or so we have author private member so
for getting and getting and setting this
private member what we can do so we can
define public which I have shown you in
the last video right public void void
and then you are set for the property so
I will just use this and I will say set
author and what I can do I can pass a
string variable for setting and I can
just use public string and get author
say in get author for getting the value
right so this I have shown you in the
last video what this you can do here
right and in here I will use the author
string author and this author will be
assigned to this open so this taught
author is equal to your father you pass
right and you can return this in get
method for
returned this dot author so if you don't
have any condition to check and you will
have of a new program at last you will
have many field in which you don't even
need any condition you don't even need
to check any condition and you will just
set and get value like this so it's more
easier to handle these things or these
airports by using properties so what we
can do instead of using this getter and
setter simple getter and setter without
any conditions I will say public and the
return type which is string and I will
say this property is called author and
then I will enclose it in this curly
braces and I can say get and set ok and
this property will work same as these 2
getter and setter function so your code
is ready used very much here right this
property get and said to just using
these two get and set your c-sharp code
we'll know that the set will have to set
the property or set the variable some
variable and this ket is used to access
the value of the variable right so I can
just remove this getter and setter
instead of that I can use this property
and even you can make this hole
really small like this
and this will become a one-line code for
you right
instead of writing getter and setter
method you can just use cat and said if
you don't have any condition right and
let's try to assign some value to the
author property and access it so I will
use P 1 dot author you can see author
property is visible and let's say author
name is for example programming
knowledge okay and I can access this
simply by v1 dot or okay so book but the
author is P 1 dot author when I run the
program
it will work fine okay so this property
makes it simple to get and set values of
the member variable so I hope you
understood the concept of properties and
I hope you have enjoyed this video
