tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we are going to see
how we can use loops in C and we will
start with while loop how to use while
loop in C programming now first of all
what are while loops so or even you may
be wondering what are even loops in C
now as the name suggests loop loop is a
piece of code which will execute again
and again and again
until and unless some condition is true
okay now for example we want to print
the values of integer from 0 to 10 and
we don't want to use printf again and
again to print the you know print one
print two or printf one print of to
print of 3 instead of that we want just
want to use one line of code printf and
we want to print from 0 to 10 using the
single line of code which is printf we
can do it by using while loop okay so
our loop is a something which executes
your code again and again and again
until and unless some condition is true
now how to use while loop so let's use
the same example to print 10 numbers so
I will declare int I is equal to 0 as my
variable and then I want to print number
or integers from 0 to 10 or 0 to 9
itself so while I can use while loop by
this keyword while and then comes your
condition
and then comes your curly braces and
inside those curly braces comes your
condition so inside our while loop we
want to print the integer ten times
right so print F and then we will say
value of I is equal to percentage D
right comma I okay and in this in these
brackets comes your condition okay so we
will check whether I is less than less
than ten if I is less than 10 then we
want to execute this code okay and if
this I whenever it goes greater than ten
or like this we want to go out of this
loop okay so this is or this bracket of
while is evaluating our condition okay
now we will just give the semicolon to
our code and then we will increment the
value of I like this I is equal to I
plus 1 okay this expression I is equal
to I plus 1 you can write in short by
writing I plus plus okay so there are
two ways of incrementing the value of I
like this I is equal to I plus 1 or you
can do I plus plus it's same as I is
equal to I plus 1 so we will use I plus
plus 4 now okay and then let's try to
compile our code so what it is doing it
is checking this condition if this
condition is true it will print this but
because I will never be true
cause first of all I is equal to zero
and this condition in this case what I
have written will never be true I is
equal to zero which is not greater than
10 then this loop will never be executed
while why because this condition is not
true at the first place so this code
will not execute okay so let us see what
happens when we compile and run the code
and nothing happens and this is what we
were expecting but when we check is less
than 10 then because the value of I is
equal to 0 it goes to this while and it
goes to check this condition whether 0
is less than 10 and it will say yes 0 is
less than 10 then execute this code
which will print 0 and then increment
the value of I by 1 which is 0 plus 1 is
equal to 1 and then it will do it again
and again until this condition is met so
let us try compile and run the program
and we can see the value of I is equal
to 0 value of I is equal to 1 but I
forgot to give the line break so we will
give this line break from here and then
once again we will run the code like
this so it has printed value of I is
equal to 0 in the starting and then
value of I is equal to 1 then value of I
is equal to 2 3 4 until I is equal to 9
okay so what is happening here at the
first place the value of i we have
declared it as 0 so it goes to a while
loop and it checks this condition that 0
is less than 10 so it goes inside this
because the condition is true and it
prints this message value this should be
value of I is equal to whatever the
value of I is zero right now so it will
print I is equal to zero and then we are
increasing the value of I by one right I
plus plus is equal to I is equal to I
plus one so now the value of I becomes
one and it goes once again to check this
condition whether I is less than ten so
I the value of I is equal to one which
is less than ten once again it will
print value of I is equal to one and
increment the value of I by 1 which is 2
once again it goes again and again until
and unless I becomes ten here so when I
becomes ten here it will go here and see
10 is not less than ten so it will not
print any code here because this
condition is not true and then it goes
out of the loop so this is what
happening in this code right so once
again run this code and it will run and
it will print zero to nine now for
example you want to print until ten we
can just write if I is less than or
equal to ten then print this code so
this expression is I is less than or
equal to ten okay so run the program and
now this prints from zero to ten okay so
once again a loop is something which
iterates or execute your code again and
again until and unless some condition is
true so in this in the case of while
loop the condition is this thing we have
provided and it will execute again and
again until and unless this condition is
met okay
