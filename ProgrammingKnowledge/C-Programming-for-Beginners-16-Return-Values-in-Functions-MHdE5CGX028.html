last two videos I have been showing you
how to use functions in C and in the
last video I have shown you how to use a
function with arguments or parameters
now in this video I am going to show you
how you can use function to return some
value right so till now we have been
writing functions like this with a void
but from any function you can return
some value which can be of any type for
example integer double character or a
string or anything so let's see how we
can use a function to return a value now
for example we want to make a function
which gives us the product of something
this example I have shown you last time
if you remember and what I was doing in
this function is I was asking the user
to enter two values so it says please
enter two values number one and I scan
first number and I scan the second
number and then I passed it past these
two numbers to this function now let's
say we want to make a function which
gives us the value or product of
something and then we want to process
this number so we will make a new
function here to return some value so
for example we want to make a function
which gives us the multiplication of two
numbers or product of two numbers so and
it will return something so what we are
going to do we are going to right first
of all return value earlier we used to
right here void because we were not
returning anything but this time we will
return some integer from the function
that's why we are writing int here right
and then write the name
the function for example product this is
the name of the function and what this
will do will take two argument in a
comma int B and it is going to give us
there is result as a product of these
two numbers so in order to return some
value for example product of these two
numbers we use a keyword called return
okay
and because we want to return product of
a and B we can write a Astrix B right so
we can return the product of a and B and
what this basically mean is this where
this function will take two parameters a
and B and then in here it will make the
product of these two numbers a and B and
then it will return this number as an
integer right and then we can use this
number for doing some other mathematical
stuff or anything else so for calling
this function we can call it just by its
name and because we have the code from
the last time in which we have declared
two numbers and we were asking user to
enter two numbers this is really basic
so e by now you may have known what this
code is doing it's just taking two
values from the user and then we will
pass these two values X comma Y to our
product function right
and then this X comma Y will be replaced
here in the place of a and B it will
give multiply these two numbers and then
it will return the product as an integer
so because it is going to return our
product we will define an integer for
example int P R or D so this integer we
will use
integer variable we will use to store
the product which will be returned by
this product function right so product
or pre or OD is equal to product because
this function is going to return
something as an integer and we will
store this integer which this function
is going to return in this variable
right and then we can print the value of
print printf and then we can print
product is equal to percentage D comma
PR OD which is this one this variable
right and let's see what happens when we
compile our program I will just make it
a little bit smaller so that we can see
all our program I will run the program
now and it's saying something let's see
what's the error and the error here is
undefined reference to print F so there
should be P small right run the program
and it says enter first number for
example 20 I press ENTER and the second
number for example 30 and when I press
ENTER it gives us the product of these
two number which is 600 right and what
this has basically done we have given
two numbers X is equal to 20 Y is equal
to 30 so now X is equal to 20 which is
replaced here
and Y is equal to 30 which s is replaced
here so 20 and 30 is passed to this
function and this goes here then it will
multiply 20 and 30 and then it will
return the result into this variable
which we can store
okay in a simple you know simple usage
if you do not understand still what this
is doing then what we can do is we can
directly pass two values for example 10
and 60 for example I am taking simple
values so that you can understand so
this is basically 10 and 20 we have
passed to this function because this
function takes integer so we need to
pass only integers here right so 10 will
be replaced here at the place of a and
when 60 will be replaced here at the
place of B now 10 will be multiplied by
60 and then it will be returned and this
value we can store it in another
variable for example this variable which
we can use for something or for example
if you want to use this function in or
if this variable for some other use so
what we want to do is for example the
result result is equal to and then do
percentage D and what we want to do is
whatever product B you are getting from
a product function we want to add 10 to
it and then show the result okay so we
will call product and let's delete this
thing for now and we will make it more
simple so what we are going to do is we
are going to call this function called
product and we will pass two values for
example we pass this time 5 and 5 once
again so 5 into 5 is 25 right this is a
simple parameter I am giving so that we
know the result so Y into 5 is 25 which
will be returned by this product and we
can add 10 to
ten to it and the result will be 35
right so let's try and run the program
ad says result is equal to 35 so you can
use this function which returns integer
value as a you know parameter which you
can you know do automatic operation on
this parameter or on this function also
so in this way you can use function
which returns value okay and don't
forget to use this return keyword
whenever you are returning anything so I
hope your understood the basic concept
of function which returns when I hope
