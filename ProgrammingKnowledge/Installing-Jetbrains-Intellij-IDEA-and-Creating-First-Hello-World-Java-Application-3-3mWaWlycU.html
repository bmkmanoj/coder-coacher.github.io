show you how you can download and
install IntelliJ IDEA for developing
Java projects on your Windows 8 or 8.1
operating system and I'm also going to
show you how you can create your first
hello world Java program using this
IntelliJ IDEA IDE so first of all we are
going to download and install IntelliJ
IDEA but make sure that you have already
installed Java JDK
in your Windows operating system in
order order to develop Java programs so
just search for IntelliJ on your browser
and the first link will pop up here will
be from JetBrains comm slash idea you
can click this link and in here you can
just click this download IntelliJ IDEA
or click this download button from here
so I'm going to click IntelliJ IDEA from
here and in here you can see two options
for IntelliJ IDEA one is Ultimate
Edition which is a paid version of
IntelliJ IDEA which is more premium and
it has more features but for learning
purposes we can use this community
version which is free to use and
open-source ok so I'm going to choose
this community version which is free and
click download community and it's going
to download this idea c / 14 point 0.3
dot x exe 14 point 0.3 is the latest
version at the time of making this video
save this file and it's going to take a
few minutes to download I already have
downloaded this executable file so I
will directly go to this executable file
which is this one in here you can see
this idea 14 point 0.3 from here so I'm
going to double click this file from
here which is executable file and now I
can see the setup wizard for IntelliJ
IDEA ok so I'm going to click
next and this is the default location
where this IDE will be installed it's in
C program files x86 slash JetBrains
slash IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 14
point 0.3 click Next and in here you can
create the desktop shortcut for your IDE
I can choose this I'm going to leave it
as default the set second option which
is create associations ok so I will
click Next here and click install it's
going to install this IDE in few seconds
or it can probably take one or two
minutes to configure in and install this
IDE and now the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is
installed in our system make sure that
you click this checkbox to launch your
IntelliJ IDEA IDE when you click this
button finish button ok so make sure
that it's checked and click finish
and it's going to launch IntelliJ IDEA
IDE now for the first time when you
start IntelliJ IDEA it will ask if you
have some previous version of IntelliJ
obviously I don't have the previous
version so I will leave it as default
which is I do not have previous version
of IntelliJ and click OK
and it's going to start my IDE
and now the IDE has been started so I
can create my new project so I can click
this create new project button here and
it's going to create or give me the
project wizard okay
and in here you can choose you know you
can see different option for developing
Android JavaFX application Gradle groovy
but I want to choose this Java option
from here and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to choose the SDK so I told
you you need to have Java JDK installed
in your system in order to run your Java
programs so in project SDK you need to
browse for the JDK folder for you okay
so just go and click new and click jdk
from here and jdk is in my c folder so
go inside your c folder and go into the
program files here so you need to choose
this program file folders and in here
you will be able to see a folder called
java and inside this you need to choose
your jdk folder inside your java folder
ok so once you choose this jdk folder
click ok which will provide the path for
your jdk which is Java development kit
ok and click Next and I will click Next
once again and in here you can give the
name to your Java project for example my
first Java project for example ok and
click finish and it's going to create a
new project for you called my first Java
project
and for the first time it will you know
ask you for these warning just allow the
access and here also for the first time
when you open this IntelliJ IDEA it's
going to give you the tip of the day
every time you open unless you don't
want them I'm going to close it and I
can click got it okay so I have this Pro
checked here okay
so what I can do is I can just go to
source and inside the source I can see
there is no you know Java file here ok
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right click and I'm going to create a
new Java file or new Java file here so
right click and go to new and create new
Java class and you can give the name to
your Java class for example my Java dot
Java for example ok click OK
and it's going to create a new Java
class for you now you can see the font
here it may be you know possible that
it's too small pond for you to change
these fonts what you can do is you can
go to file and go to settings and you
can change the font and color for your
editor by searching for font in here and
go to font and you can create your own
font style so you can just click the
save as button click save as and you can
name your font style here it's going to
create a copy of all the previous point
and create a new copy for you awesome
you can create my font click OK and now
you can change the
size of your font for example by default
it's twelve you can change it to 20 and
it's going to become big click apply and
click OK and now you can see the font
has been changed so this is the justa
empty java class and here you can create
your main public static void main right
so I can write PS VM which is a shortcut
and click tab and it's going to
automatically create this main method
form for me okay so just write PS VM and
click tab and it's going to
automatically create the main method for
me me in the same way I can just write s
out and click tab and it's going to
write a code for me which is system dot
out dot print line and inside this print
line has an argument I can just write
hello world and now to run my project I
can right click and run my Java project
so just click this run my java dot mean
and it's going to compile my program and
run it and you can see hello world
printed here ok
so this you need to do for the first
time from the next time you can just
click this green button to run your
programs so for example I can just write
hello world YouTube I add this extra
word here and I can just click this
green button here it's going to run my
program compile my program first and is
going to print hello world YouTube in
here ok so in this way you can install
IntelliJ IDEA for developing Java
programs in Windows 8 or 8.1 I hope you
