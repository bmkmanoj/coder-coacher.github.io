learn about creating classes and using
classes in Python now we all know that
Python is an object-oriented programming
language and in object-oriented
programming language a class is an
extensible program code template for
creating object providing initial values
of States and implementations of
behavior now this definition of class
you may think that you know what is this
so let me give you an example suppose
you want to create a class or you want
to save some data for a person now
person has some attribute for example
first name last name and for example you
want to print the person's name so a
class can also have member functions or
member methods right so we are going to
take this example of person and we are
going to create a person class and we
are going to give the attribute to this
class as first name and last name and we
will try to print the person's name okay
so let's see how we can create a class
in Python now in Python the class is
created by using the word class itself
and then you give the name to the clasp
in our case we want to give the name to
the class s person so we will give this
person name to the class and then this
colon comes and inside this class you
can define member functions or member
variables
now how you can define member functions
in a class you just need to give for
example I want to print the name of
first name and last name of the person I
can create a I can create a method to
print this so I can create a function
like this print full name for example
this is the function name but we all
know that function whenever we want to
define a function we use def in front of
a function right and then we can pass
some argument here now whenever we use a
function inside a class the first
argument we give to the member function
is a keyword called self and this self
is nothing but a pointer or the self
points to the class itself okay
so this class whenever we create an
instance of a class which I am going to
show you how you can create an instance
or object of a class this self point to
the object of the class so just wait for
a while and you will understand and then
you pass the name of the argument so for
example first name and last name okay
then colon and then you can give the
definition to the class so for example I
want to set the value of first name and
last name so what I can do is I can use
the same keyword self to call the first
name variable and last name variable of
the class this should be
last right and then we use a dot
separator to call them so for example
you want to set the first name we just
use self and first name is equal to
first name and then in a similar way we
can just define the second variable or
second setting the second variable which
is last name so self dot last name is
equal to last name okay it's better to
rename this function as set fully named
okay so what this function is doing its
setting the first name and last name to
the variables in a class or member of
variables in the class which are first
name and last name for whatever argument
you pass here first name and last name
will be passed to the member variable of
the class which are also first name and
last name okay now we have already
created this class and now we are going
to create a second member function to
print this first name and last name a
full name okay so we will define the
second function called print full name
and this will not take any argument and
we are just going to return or we are
just going to print the first name and
last name okay so we are going to print
here first name so to call any member
function or member variable of a class
you just need to use self and self just
indicates that it's a member variable or
member of a class okay so always use
self and we
going to print a self dot first name
which is the first name and then we can
just give a little space here to
separate them first name and last name
and then you can just take the last name
and print it now in order to create an
instance of a class so how you can
create an instance of a class this is
just a definition of the class right we
have done defined the definition of the
class right now in order to create the
instance of a class so that we can use
this class we can use this class by
creating the instance of the class so
whenever you want to end the class and
you want to execute in this class just
remember that you start from the corner
here right so and don't forget about
indentation in this class declaration
when you start with no indentation here
then you are in the new line and you are
outside the class okay now in order to
create a instance of the class or object
of the class we can just define the
object name for example person name so
this is the object name or instance name
of a class we want to give and then is
equal to the name of the class and then
this these brackets okay and this will
create the object of person class that a
named person name okay so let's try to
run the program and let's see if it
contains any error or not save okay and
it doesn't contain any error so it's
running fine but we want to use the
member function of the
so how we can use this member function
of a class we can use the member
function of a class using this instance
of the class or object of the class okay
so just take the object of the class and
in the next line we just copy the object
of the class dot and then we can see
there are two options which are member
functions of the class print full name
and set name so I'm going to take set
name set name of the class function so
this is the member function of a person
class and we are accessing this member
function using the instance or object of
the class okay and in between we give
dot separator so that now this instance
can call the member function so member
variable of the class and now we can set
the first name and last name
for example programming is the first
name and knowledge is the last name okay
so we have set the first name and last
name of the person and just remember
that this is used as a default so this
will be automatically taken by by your
class and these are the two important
you know two important argument which
you need to pass and this will be taken
automatically okay so self is by default
for a member function invisible in a
sense that we you just need to pass the
other arguments except for the self
argument so first name we passed as
programming and last name we pass test
knowledge
so this is setting
the first name and last name of a person
now in order to print this name we can
once again use the instance or object of
a class dot we can call the second
function of a class called print name
which takes no all argument right and
now let's try to save the program and
run this so run this and what it's
saying it's saying that this member
function which you are calling which is
print full name doesn't have any
arguments which is zero argument right
takes zero argument but one was given
right so I intentionally leave this self
in this function so that we can see this
error so always remember you have to at
least pass self
whenever you define a member function in
a class so if even if it doesn't take
any parameter or argument
you need to pass self to a member
function okay now when I save the
program and run it it will run fine
right
it prints the name programming space
knowledge which I wanted to print right
so always remember few things whenever
you define a member function in a class
always use self as a first argument and
then give your rest of the argument and
even if your function or member function
doesn't take any argument you just or
you must pass at least one argument
which is self okay once what is self
self is
a pointer to the class instance so this
self is pointing to this person name and
this is called class instance and
whenever we create the class instance it
will assign this person here at the
place of self and then it will be named
will be set as person name which is this
instance dot first name
person name dot last name and then
whenever we call this function it will
print person name dot first name person
name dot last name so in this way you
can use or you can create classes in
Python there is lot more in defining and
creating or using classes in Python this
is just starting or create how to create
a class in Python so I will show you how
to use other functionalities in class in
later videos and hopefully you
understood the concept of the class and
hopefully you enjoyed this video please
