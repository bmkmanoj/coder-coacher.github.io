video I will show you how to use a jigs
with your JSF web application so if you
know till now we have made a project
which looks like this so we have this
button and when we click this it goes to
the next page we have already set our
background we already said our this
front image and till now our application
looks like this so for demonstration of
Ajax first of all I will like to let you
know that what is Ajax so a Jaques with
the help of a Jaques
you could be able to load your content
without refreshing your pages so Ajax
lets you load your content without
refreshing this pages so let me give an
example then it will be clear so till
now we have in our web pages folder we
have this index.html file and second dot
XHTML file so I will just go to this
index dot X HTML file and in the last
video we also made this user dot Java
class which have a string and get set
method for this string variable okay so
I will use this class which I have show
shown you in the last video so if you
don't know how I made this class just
see and watch the last video so I go to
the named X dot XHTML this is the code I
have written in the previous videos
so I will go in the body and inside this
form h : form and here i will make space
little bit space and here i want to add
one more button and one more input text
so what I will do is I will add input
text and you can give ID to it is equal
to input text to this time because we
already have input text one value value
we are going will use the same value as
this username so I will make use of this
class itself which I have made in the
last video so inside this value just
give this hash and then user dot name
okay and just close it
now what I will do is I will make a
button so for making this button I can
copy this button command which I
previously shown you and I just changed
this ID for this and I will change this
button also so I will name this button
as load value for example and action
right now I don't want to give any
action to it so I will just remove the
section from here so what I have done I
have made a input text and a button and
now I want to show this text below this
so I will just make a break first so it
will come on the next line and now I
will make output of my button action
perform so I will write H dot
H underscore output text and then the ID
ID you can give a text to and then
here I will provide the value so what
will be the value whatever I enter in
this input text the same output H much
must show here ok so I will just copy
this and paste it here and I will just
close it so I have written this code
right now and now I will run this
program so it has given me some this
text box and I have this load value but
button so now whenever I put any value
in this text box and when I click this
load value button you see it shows this
value here once again but what is
happening here is whenever I press this
button it's refreshing every time it has
to load every time and it has the page
is refreshing at every time but in some
application we do not want to refresh
this page when we load something in the
same page we just want to show this text
as it is so by using Ajax it is possible
to load your text without refreshing
your page so how can you do that now I
will show you so we have this so one
more thing I would want just want to
clarify here you could see the same text
here and the same text here why because
in my form I have this this and this all
are setting the same value that is why
you see the same value in three places
so don't worry about that and don't be
confused
that why this is happening yeah we'll
provide one break for the button okay so
now we want to load our content without
refreshing the page so what I will do
here is in this command button I have
closed this command button here but I
will not close it here and what I will
do is I will close it like
this
like this
okay so this is closing and inside this
command button tag what I will do is I
will provide a Ajax function tag so
whatever you right after this F it is a
gorgeous JSF tag so it takes first
argument as event this event is the
event which you want to perform so I
want to show this text whatever I enter
in the input text it should come on this
output so event is the input ID so I
just copy this input and I just pasted
it here and then I render this so I will
provide Brenda and I will copy this
output text wherever when I press this
button it takes the text from here and
it outputs in this output text right so
I will copy this output tag or put ID
and paste it here and then I will just
close it okay so what I have done is
inside this button tag I have given a
Ajax tag which takes the argument event
which takes the input and which takes
the argument render which takes the
output text ID okay so in this video we
have written this code right now okay
now once again we run the program
and showing me some error
so let's see white showing the error in
here I think instead of event I must
have written execute because we are
executing this command here and showing
the output and now when I run the
program it shows me the page so notice
here I will write hello YouTube
here and when I press this load button I
will just close these so you can see
here if it's refreshing or not so when I
press this load button it just refresh
the content here but it's not refreshing
the page some other text it just
refreshed the content and it's not
refreshing the page so in this way you
can use Ajax for refreshing the content
but not refreshing the whole page again
and again if you want to make this code
more easy just you can just remove these
this button from here and we will you
can just use this
Ajax alone and we can use now we can use
event argument and inside this event you
can pass any event for example I write
key up so whenever I press the key and
when I unpressed my key key up event it
will execute this command so let's see
how it works I run the program it shows
me this content so I write whatever I
will write here
when I press the key and I unpress the
key when I unplug the key this event is
taking place okay so whatever I am
writing here it's going directly below
here printing here okay so this is the
easy way to use Ajax in your web
application so I hope you have enjoyed
