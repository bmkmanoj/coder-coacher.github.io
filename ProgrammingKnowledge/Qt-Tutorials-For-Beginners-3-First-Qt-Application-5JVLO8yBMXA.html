cutie tutorial for beginners in the last
video I am showing you how you can
download and install QT on your Windows
operating system and I've also shown you
how you can create this simple test QT
project in order to test whether our
installation was successful or not now
in this video we are going to create our
first QT project from the scratch and
I'm going to explain you each and every
line of code line by line so that we can
understand what is what in QT so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
close this project which I have created
last time so just right click on your
project and then click close project ok
and it's going to close the project now
we are going to create a new project so
go to file here and then create a new
project so just click new file or
project and in here this time we are not
going to choose this QT widget
application but we are going to go to
the category other project which is this
category and then we are going to make
an empty QT project so just choose empty
queue make project ok so it's an other
project and then just choose empty queue
make project and then click Choose and
then gave the name to your project so
I'm going to name it as hello world ok
and then click Next
and use the default configuration click
Next and then click finish ok so what
it's going to do is it's going to create
a project for you and it's going to
create one file for you inside your
project which is hello world P ro or
hello world dot P R which is the project
file for your project right now it's
just like a make file for your C++
program if you have used C++ earlier
then you know what is
makefile right or see makefile so it's
just like a see make file or a make file
in QT which is called queue make okay so
let's define some fields in the queue
make file first and then we are going to
create our main dot CPP file actually
let's just first create a main dot CPP
so right click on your project and then
click add new and we are going to create
a new C++ so choose C++ and then choose
source file here okay and then click
Choose and in here just write main dot
CPP okay so it's going to create our
source file called main dot cfpb click
Next and it's going to be the part of
your hello world dot P ro so just click
finish ok so now you have here main dot
CPP which is blank right now as soon as
you add this main dot CPP in your
project go to your hello world dot P ro
file and you can see there is this
source field created here and then this
file name is added this means this is
the part of our project this main dot
CPP now in order to add or compile our
program using QT widgets we need to add
some you know variables here so I'm
going to just press ENTER and in here
above this source I'm going to define
some fields first field is QT so just
write QT is equal to as I have shown you
in the first video that QT GUI
application mainly uses two main
libraries one is code library and other
is GUI library okay so you need to just
add these two names or key word after
equal to in your PR Oh file so just
write QT is
two core space GUI so this is going to
add these two libraries one is core
library and other is GUI libraries into
your project okay now next step is to
define which version of QT we want to
use so for example you want to use QT 5
and there is QT 4 also available right
so I'm just going to add a little code
for that so just write greater than and
then just write QT major version and
just give comma here and then give 4 ok
so we want to use the major version
greater than 4 okay and then just give
colon here and then we want to create a
QT widget application so just write QT
once again and then write plus equals
widgets ok so just write widgets here so
this is basically we are saying that we
want to make a widget s-- application
actually I forgot to here also to add
this plus or concatenation symbol so you
need to write QT plus equals core and
GUI ok and just add this line also and
then save your project file by pressing
control and s button okay so controllers
which is going to save your project ok
now we are going to go to our main dot
CPP file and in here we are going to
include some libraries so just write
include and the most basic and important
library in QT is Q applications so just
write Q application ok
so this is the most important library in
QT and now we are going to create our
main functions just right in
mean and in here we are going to pass
two arguments which are just right int a
r g c so just right here G C and then
care pointer argv as we do in normal C++
programs right so just write and then
give these square brackets here okay and
then just give these curly brackets and
in here first of all we are going to
define the object of queue application
and so just write Q application here and
just define the object of it so just
right up here and the constructor of
this queue application takes two
argument which are these arguments right
argc first and then a r GV which is this
one okay now in the next step the bow
most basic QT application you just need
to add you know queue application class
and create an object of it and then you
can just return so just return app dot
exe C so just call a method called exact
here okay so I'm going to just save this
file and I'm going to build it once
first of all and if I see green here
then I will be able to run it so I'm
going to run it by clicking this green
button and what it's going to do is it's
going to do nothing because we don't
have any widget inside this QT
application now whatever you right
between these loo two lines of code will
be added to your GUI application so this
application object we have created to
manage application wide resources right
so in here first of all I'm going to for
example r1
to add one label inside my QT
application I can first do or include a
cue label so just write Q label so
include a Q label and then we will be
able to create a Q label objects just
write Q label and name your label for
example label itself and I'm going to
create a pointer of this object and is
equal to Nu Q label and the constructor
of this label takes so one argument
basically which is the text on this
label for example hello world okay so
this is the basic you know text which
will be shown on your label now if you
just take your label object and then
just call a method called show then once
again you compile your code so just save
everything save all and then it's going
to compile your code once again and once
you see green here you can run your code
and you can see hello world is printed
here and you can see this label
basically which has the text this hello
world now let's add some more
you know attributes to our label so for
example we want to add some title to our
label how can we do that so just use
your label object once again and then
call a method called set window titles
set window title which is this option
okay and this is going to add a title to
your
you know window of your label so for
example I'm going to write my app for
example okay and then once again save
your program and build it and run it so
I'm going to just run it and you will be
able to see when I just make it bigger
that it's showing the title my app which
is this one right now you can see it's
you know whenever I run my program it
just shows this label in this small
little space right so I want to resize
my label so what I can do I can once
again use this label and call the method
called resize okay now it takes two
arguments one is the width another is
the height so just give 400 by 400 for
example and then save your program build
it again and then run your program again
and it's going to show you the label
which is 400 by 400 okay so this is the
very basic QT project we have created
and I've shown you how you can add these
you know queue make fields here in hello
world dot PR o file and how you can add
the basic application headers and how
you can create a your most basic QT
application now from the next video I'm
going to create your normal widget
application and we are going to see more
details about the QT widget application
but I just wanted to show you in this
video how this QT project is created and
what is what
line by line so I have created this
video so I hope you've enjoyed this
video please recommend subscribe and bye
