show you how to add the list to your
table to your report the bag open so
suppose you have some list to show in
your report for example the first item
second item third item and you want to
show it in the form of your list how you
can do that I will show you today so
till now you made this code in which you
have shown table pictures title
paragraphs and all so suppose after your
table you want to add some lists so go
to the code where your table is ending
so document dot add table here my table
is ending and before document dot close
I will write or I will insert my list
okay so let's get started first of all I
will declare the list variables so that
right here calm dot I text PDF dot
it's calm dot i takes PDF dot txt dot
list
and the variable name is list for
example is equal to mu and I will copy
this list declaration once again and I
will paste it here and after that
bracket and semicolon so this is my next
list variable declaration and after that
I will write sorry my mouse moving past
so the right list dot add element and
you
first I so this will be your first item
of your list in the same manner I will
copy and paste and I will equate
Oh Titan so suppose I want to add for
item in to the list so I will write this
and then I will write document which is
a document variable which is this
variable document or this variable
document dot add and in here the rest
list variable comes automatically which
is this so this is the code for making
lists and let's try to run the program
and see if it's ready trance or not yeah
so my program is running I mean take
report report is saved let's see what
happens to my report I will go to the
folder where my report is saved and here
you can see the list so first I will
second item third item so it will show
in the form of list but one thing you
can notice here sorry one thing you can
notice here is my list is not shown in
the form of number so suppose I want to
show here a number one two three four
like that so what I should do now soon
I'll go to my program here and after
your declaration of list calm got a text
PDF text dot list list here in the
bracket you have to write true comma 20
for example here 20 is the number of
items of the list maximum number of
items so you can define write anything
here whatever is the maximum number of
item you want to show it here so for
example I want to show 20 I town so here
I can provide up to 20 items in the list
so you can change it from here so now I
want to run the program run let's see
what changes occurs in to our point I
will press report okay I will go to the
folder where my report is saved
make small loud and you can see numbers
are shown here one two three four so in
two ways you can show lists into your
report either in the form of numbers or
either - or something so that was the
tutorial on how to make lists into your
eye report hope you have learned
something you please rate comment and
