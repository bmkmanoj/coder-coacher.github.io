show you how you can log in to a website
using your visual basic windows form
application so let's get started what
I'm going to do is I am going to take
two text boxes for username and password
of the website for entering username and
password of the website and I am going
to take two labels one two and I am
going to take two buttons one button is
to open the website and one button is to
login to the website so let's take two
buttons and I'm going to just change the
text of these but labels first first is
username so I will write user second is
password sorry word password and first
button is to open website so I will say
open web for example and second button
is to login so I will say login and let
me change the font size so you can see I
will select all the controls and I will
go to fonts and I will change it to both
60 okay so now what I'm going to do is I
am going to take a web browser so that
we can verify that we have really logged
into our into this particular website
okay so I will take a web browser here I
can drop into the forum and let me
resize it okay
now first of all I will use this open
web button to open a web site in your
web browser so just double click this
button and in here just right web
browser 1 which is the name of your web
browser dot navigate and in the bracket
just pass the URL of the website which
you want to open so for example I want
to log into Facebook
or log into my Facebook account using
the visual basic so I will open this
www.facebook.com just copy the URL from
here and in the double quotes just paste
your facebook URL ok now this will open
the Facebook of website any our web
browser ok
now in the second button just double
click the second button and in here we
are going to get our website and take
the ID of the login and username text
boxes so let's see how can we do it so
here just try it once again web browser
which is the name of your browser in my
case web browser one dot document dot
get element by ID and in the brackets
what we are going to do is we are going
to pass the ID of the username and
password so just give double quotes here
and how we can find the ID of
this text box and this text box what you
need to do is just right click your
browser and and on the same page you
need to right-click and just click view
page in source or mu paid source okay
and this will open the source of your
webpage which is our HTML and JavaScript
and all source code of the web website
now in order to search for a login and
password just control the app just click
control app which will open this find
option in Chrome or any other browser
and in here you can see email or phone
so we can search this text box by email
or phone so just write email in the find
and this find the text box in here and
you can see here we find email or phone
here okay and we want to find the ID of
this text box which will contain email
so here is the ID of this text box which
is email itself so I will just copy this
from here so you need to copy the ID
right so first is login ID or username
which is email in this Facebook and I
will paste it here and then I will just
say dot set attribute and I want to set
attribute which is called value and
second option or second argument will be
the text which we are taking from the
username text box right so we will say
Xbox one dot text okay
so the name of my user name text-box
east xbox one that's why I have taken
written text box okay in the same way I
will just copy this code and I will just
paste it on this first line and now I
just need to change the ID of the
password so let's see what is the idea
of the password and if you see here
carefully we will be able to find the ID
of the password which is this one ID is
equal to pass okay so the idea of the
password is pass in Facebook okay I will
paste it here and this will remain same
but the text box which we are using is
now text box - for the password okay so
just write these two nines and now let's
see if it works or not our code is not
finished but let's see if we are able to
set the values so I will first of all I
will just open the website by clicking
this open web and it opens this Facebook
website right and I will type some
random username and password and let's
see if it sets to these text boxes or
not so I will click login
and you can see password is set here and
username inside whatever we write here
okay and now we are going to change the
type of text we will enter into this
password text box because we don't want
to show our password to the other
viewers right so let's cancel it and go
to your form and just
select your password text box field and
go to the properties and search for the
property called password care so this is
password gap and whatever character you
will enter here it will replace the real
text by this character so for example I
want to so show this dollar symbol
instead of my password so whatever
password I will write it will replace
all the character of the password by
this dollar symbol okay so it will
protect my password now the third and
last line of code which we are going to
write here is we want to log in or we
want to be able to press the login
button somehow right so what we are
going to do is so once again we will
write web browser 1 which is the name of
our browser dot document dot get element
by ID and this time we are going to
search for the login button ID okay so
in double quotes let's search for the
login button ID so once again when we
see carefully here the idea of login
button is login button itself see here
and just copy this login button ID from
here and paste it here and then what we
are going to write here is just after
that just right dot invoke member dot
not dot but what member we are going to
invoke is we want to click this button
so we will right click okay so just
write this line and these are all the
lines we want to write now let's try and
see
whether it really works or not so I have
this program running and I will give my
username of my Facebook account and I
will give the password and first of all
I will open that Facebook page by this
open web which will open the Facebook
page you see here and right now it's
empty and when I click this login button
you see it enters the username and
password and it opens my Facebook page
okay so you can always go to my facebook
page which is programming knowledge and
you can give me a parent friend request
or join my pages I hope you have enjoyed
