I have shown you how to make a pie chart
and this time I will show you how to
make a bar chart so today we are going
to take an example for students as we
have taken last time so suppose we have
4 student and they have scored different
marks so we will plot a chart for the
student and the marks so let's get
started go to your palette and take a
button and name it as bar chart and then
right click your button go to event
action actionperformed
go to my button action perform and here
we will write our code so first of all
to write default
category gotta set this variable as not
assess itself is equal to I will copy it
and write new and I will paste mine if
one category dr. set once again and
bracket and semicolon so it will show
some error because I haven't fixed my
import so I will right-click and fix
imports and my error is not gone that
that means I have some spelling mistakes
let's see where is my spelling mistake
here category CA te and T E category and
then if I click and fix input and my
error is gone then I have to write copy
this variable name data set paste it
here dot set value
so it will show you three free fields in
the first field for example I want to
show the mark so we show you mark so
stood in one scored 80 marks for example
in the second field you have to write
whatever you have to take in no y-axis
so I want to take on y-axis and in the
third field you have to write whatever
you want to take on your x-axis so I
want to take student name on x-axis so
for example 80 marks is scored by
student one student one and copy this
line and paste it
I will paste it four times because I am
taking the example with four students so
for example second student score 50
third student scored 25 and old school
student scored 95 I will change the
student name also student one student to
student three its 204
these are the marks and student names
you can name tentative and then after
write it right J free chart and then
space chart is equal to chart factory
chart factory dot we are creating bar
chart so click create bar chart and you
can see so many fields for bar bar chart
chart Factory dot create batch up and
here in the first peel you must write
the title of your bar chart so I will
name it as student score for example and
second field you
have to write the x axis title so I will
name it as student name because I'm
taking student or I'm writing I want to
show student name on my x-axis so this
is the titled student name on my x-axis
and then I have to write the title for
the y-axis so my y-axis titleist marks
and then here this is already default
data set which is my this data set
variable so fourth field is data set
which it will come automatically or you
have to copy it and paste it here in the
port field after that here you have to
write plot orientation which must also
come automatically and if it doesn't
come you must write this and I want to
show my bars in vertical knotting
horizontals I will change it as vertical
and in the last three fields I will
write false true false
so the title of my bar chart then x axis
title y axis title my data set variable
which is this and then my orientation I
am taking vertical and then falls
through true and after that semicolon
and then
in the next nine
I will wait
P sorry category
category lot P whatever whatever you
billion want to take is equal to chart
which is this chart got dot get category
plot okay and then semicolon and it will
show some error maybe the spelling
mistake right-click and fixing both
first and error will go and after that
we will declare P which is this variable
e dot side great
sorry not set range great paint I mean
give it a color for the grid color dot
black give it black color for the grids
and then I will define chart frame will
define my frame frame is equal to new
new charge period frame once again and
bracket and semicolon so this is my
frame in which I will show my bar chart
so I will give it a title which is chart
student and after that comma this is
this chart so this chart I want to show
in my frame so I will copy it and paste
it here okay
and in next line you should fight frame
not set visible
in the bracket right true so I will
setting it visible and I will send its
signs also frame dot set size and give
it a size for 50 by 3 sorry
50 you can give it any height in width
and let's try to run our program this
was your code
and I will go to my tab and I will click
this bar chart and my bar charts should
appear I click it and you can see my bar
chart is here in which is my y-axis
title marks is my excessive exercise
title student name this is my main title
student score and this is my frame bar
chart title student but I think I have
taken four student and yeah it is
showing only three students so I have to
check what mistake I have done because
four bar should appear here at rate of
three because we have defined the score
for for student and I think here's the
mistake - in one two three and I weren't
given it the different name fourth
student so student four and now I will
run the program and it must show for
student it's it's showing me the for
student data with different scores so
that was the tutorial on how to make
abides a bar chart and the next tutorial
I will attach my bar chart with my
database like this pressure temperature
volume flow and rotational speeds so
thanks for now and please rate comment
