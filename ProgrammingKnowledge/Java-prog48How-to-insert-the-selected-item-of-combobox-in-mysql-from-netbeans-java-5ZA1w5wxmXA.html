asked me how to insert data from your
combo box into your database so today I
will show you how to do that for example
I want to replace this text field from a
combo box so go to your pilot just
delete this text field first and in
place of this and take a combo box and
place it here and I will enter some
values in H properties in the model
change the values from I will enter 120
so for example I enter six or seven ages
here you can go in up to 50 or 60 and
that's okay and I rename my combo box as
/h okay
so this is my combo box and then I want
to save it I will click the Save button
right click even action action performed
and this is our code which we have made
earlier in order to save the data so you
can see this line has error because we
deleted the text field instead of this
line we have to write first of all
declare a string string whatever we want
to give the name of the string is equal
to copy the variable name of your combo
box like couple combo box variable name
is combo age I paste it here dot get
selected item
not to strength so you have to write
this and then just copy this string
variable name value and paste it here so
this is a two line code which I need to
change in order to save the value from
the combo box so let's try and run
program and let's try to save the values
so this is
my run screams I have six into seventh
anything you think and I will choose the
age 24 for example when I press okay
Milo is already saved and you can see
the data comes here so today you will
learn how to say the values from your
combo box so that's all for now please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
