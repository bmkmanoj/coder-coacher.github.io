maven tutorial for beginners and in this
video we will see how to exclude
dependencies from our maven pom dot XML
file so for example in the last video we
have added this dependencies for
hibernate in our pom dot XML and you can
see there are lot of transitive
dependencies added to our maven
dependencies because of this hibernate
jar file and one of the dependencies
here is JBoss logging for example and
let's say for some reason or the other I
don't want this JBoss logging jar file I
want to use some other type of logging
for example log4j or any other logging
jar instead of this Jeff boss logging so
I want to exclude this from my project
so how can I do this
so to exclude this JBoss logging jar
first of all you need to know the group
ID and the artefact ID of it and the way
of you know knowing this is a simple you
just need to press ctrl and hover over
your hibernate and just click it and
this will open the hibernate BOM file
and go to the palm dot XML file for the
hibernate and in the dependency you can
just copy the group ID and the artefact
ID of this JBoss logging ok so just copy
these two elements from here and then go
to your pom dot XML file and inside the
dependency element in which you have
added this hibernate you just need to go
just go below this version element and
then add one more element called
exclusions ok so just add exclusions
inside the exclusion element we need to
add exclusion
okay so exclusion element and between
this ex exclusion element we just need
to paste this group ID and the artifact
ID of JBoss okay so this will exclude
the JBoss logging jar from our
dependencies so you can see right now
it's there this JBoss logging jar file
but when I press save here let's see
what happens so this is our JBoss and
once we press this button
our JBoss dependency is gone here right
so the jar file for the JBoss is not
anymore
there once again when we just remove the
exclusion and save the file and then we
are going to see this JBoss logging jar
file here so this is how you can exclude
a particular jar file from your memory
dependencies right so I hope you've
enjoyed this video please welcome and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
