last video I've shown you how to
download and install Visual Studio
Express Edition for creating your
c-sharp projects and we have created our
first project in c-sharp and we were
able to output this message on the
screen because welcome to the tutorial
now in this video I am going to show you
how to input and output values using
c-sharp for example or the user want to
input some values and on the basis of
user input you want to show the output
how can you do it I will show you in
this video so let's start for example I
will declare a variable string not this
but strength and I will name the string
as name okay and right now I will nee
and assign the name as for example
programming okay so this name which I
have declared is called a variable and
this string which is in front of the
variable is called the datatype and a
variable is just a value holder or
placeholder for this value okay and this
datatype I'm going to discuss this these
data types in detail but for now just
imagine that this is a variable name and
this can only contain the string value
string means these kind of word or this
kind of sentences right now for example
you want to show this variable name on
the console how you can do is you can
just write in the console right console
dot right just you can just output it by
saying the
the name is and then give this plus sign
and then for this equal to but this plus
sign and then just copy this variable
called name and place it here and what
this plus sign is it's called a
concatenation operator and what it does
is it concatenate this string which is
all also a string and this string and it
will show the output together so it will
show idly show the name is programming
right let's run the program I will just
click this green button here or I will
just press control f5 and it's showing
the name is programming so in order to
show the value of variable what you need
to do is you just need to give this plus
sign and the name of the variable okay
now for example you want to input the
value of name or input name and then
what you want to show the output this
name right what you can do is once again
I will go on the top and I can write
console dot right and inside I will give
a string and I will say please enter
some name okay and then instead of
assigning the name to this variable I
will ask the user to give the name so I
will just delete this and instead of
this I will write
console dot read line and what this
console dot readline does is it enables
you to enter the value enter a string so
it reads a line which you enter okay so
what this idly do is it will ask to
enter the name and when you enter the
name that will be shown here okay so
let's run the program and it says please
enter some names for example I write you
tube and I will press ENTER and it says
the name is YouTube okay so it works
like this now for example you want to
enter the surname also or you want to
enter two names what you can do is you
can just copy this and paste it here and
this name I will call this name name one
and I will call this name - okay and I
will say please enter name one and here
I will say please enter name - okay so
for example I want to enter two names
what can I do here I can just print the
first name is so I can write first name
is and
you can just give this plus sign once
again here and again you can write and
second name is and just give this this
will contain the first name and this
will contain the second name just using
this plus operator okay so this will
also print out let's see what it prints
out so I will run the program it says
please enter the first name so I will
write YouTube one and press ENTER and
the second name I will write YouTube too
and when I press enter here you see it
says first name is YouTube 1 and the
second name is YouTube - okay so the
concatenation works like this now there
is a other way you can print these
values and this other way is called you
by using placeholders so instead of
doing like this what you can write is
you can write the names are four names
entered are and then you give a curly
braces and inside you give 0 and once
again give end and once again give curly
braces and give one and in here give a
comma and not this one but comma and
give the first name and once again the
comma and give the second name ok so
what this code is it's a place old it's
called a place holder
and this placeholder will show the value
of the first value you will pass after
gamma and this placeholder will show the
second value after this comma so second
value is named too right
and it's charged it starts from 0 so 0 1
and if we have the third value we will
write name 3 for example and in here we
will write once again of curly braces
and - okay so it will show the third
value also but right now we don't have
any third value so just remember this is
core called the placeholder and whatever
is the zeroth value which is name one
after comma it will just replace this by
this name and will just replace the
second value by this ok and I will run
the program once again and I will say
this time 1 2 3 4 5 for example and
second name is max okay and I will press
ENTER and it says the names entered are
1 2 3 4 5 and max right so in this way
you can use this console right to output
the values and console.readline to input
the values now what we have done till
now is for the string but suppose you
want to show the integers for example
once again I will just delete this or I
will keep it here I will declare a
variable integer so I will declare int X
and I will say is equal to is equal to
console thought we'd line so instead of
using string you want to use the integer
and what I have I have written this in
front of this X and it's showing this
squiggly line here and showing that this
is not possible because read line only
takes the string values and not the
integers and this variable we have
declared is an integer right this data
type of this variable is an integer and
this is not possible so what we can do
is we need to pass whatever string we
have entered into the integer and then
show it by or then place it into the X
so how we can do it you can just write
int dot parse and in the bracket you
enclose this console dot read line and
what this line will do is whatever
string or whatever line you will enter
it will just convert this string into
the integer and then place it into the X
right and for this I will do the same
here so for example I will say please
and number one and please enter number
two okay and you want to show the
addition of these two numbers this
should be Y for example okay and if for
example you want to show the addition of
these two numbers
so what you can do here is you can
declare a third variable in int Z equal
to X plus
why okay and what this does is whatever
you write the value of x and whatever
you enter the value of y it will add
those two values and place it into this
Z okay and for example you want to show
the addition so that you can write the
sum of values 0 which is X so just copy
X here and value Y which is y so copy
and paste Y and then write is and we
will we will assign or we will learn
choose further placeholder for Z so just
write curly braces - and then here write
said ok now when we run the program it
will ask us to enter the first value
let's give space here because it's a
little bit confusing and here also ok
run the program once again and I will
enter first number for example 355 enter
I will enter the second number
675 for example and I press ENTER I will
give the output the sum of 365 and 675
is 1 0 3 0 it is correct right so in
this way you can output the values and
by user inputs ok this should be so I
hope you have understood the concept of
inputting and outputting the values on
screen and please keep watching this
video I am going to cover lots of things
so please stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
