MongoDB tutorial for beginners now let's
see the brief introduction of MongoDB
before we will try to install MongoDB on
our Windows operating system so what is
MongoDB MongoDB is a document oriented
no SQL database that means it's not a
relational database it's a non
relational database now what is the
difference between relational database
and non-relational database or we can
say what is the difference between no
SQL database and SQL database now SQL
database for example MySQL or PostgreSQL
has a relational database format for
example they have tables columns and
rows which are related to each other
right but in no SQL database these are
you know collections or these data are
not related with each other and they are
non relational right now MongoDB is a
schema free database and it's based on
binary JSON format and this special
format is called Beeson in which B stand
for binary and s o n comes from Jason
now MongoDB organizes itself in a group
of documents which are called
collections right and using MongoDB auto
sharding in order to you know scale
horizontally is easier and this is the
advanced feature which we are going to
see later and MongoDB uses query
language which is a simple query
language and it has a rich document
based query which is little bit
different from your normal you know
relational database queries and it's our
open source database right now let's see
what is the difference between MongoDB
versus some
relational databases so as I already
told you that MongoDB uses collection
versus the table so in normal relational
databases something like MySQL or other
SQL database they use as tables but in
MongoDB instead of tables we use
collections right and now inside these
collection we have documents instead of
rows right so in the relational database
if you know that every table can contain
multiple columns and rows we have the
replacement of row in no SQL database or
MongoDB specially which is document
okay so collection is like a table
document is like a row and field is like
a column okay so instead of using table
row and column terminology we are going
to use collection document and field
right and collection isn't strict about
what goes inside it like your normal you
know
relational database it's a little bit
strict or what should go inside it but
this collection isn't so strict and it's
schema-less okay so this is a small
brief introduction about MongoDB now
let's download MongoDB on our Windows
operating system and let's dive more
into MongoDB so open your favorite
browser and search for MongoDB and the
first link which will appear here will
be from MongoDB dot o-r-g just click
this link and in here you will be able
to see two buttons one is download
MongoDB another is MongoDB cloud manager
we want to click this button which is
download MongoDB and in here you can see
there are different variants of you know
downloads available for Linux Mac OS and
solaris we want to download it for
Windows operating system and in here
they have different flavors you can see
here we want to download it for the
64-bit operating system so we will just
leave it as default and then click
download now save this MSI file anywhere
wherever you want to save it and once
it's saved we will be ready to install
MongoDB on our Windows operating system
so now this MSI file is downloaded so
I'm going to click this MSI file and I'm
going to minimize my browser and now you
can see this Windows installer is
starting and you just need to click Next
here and you just need to agree with the
license terms and conditions and then
click Next and you just need to you know
choose this complete option and then
click install ok and now it's going to
install MongoDB on your Windows
operating system and in few seconds
MongoDB will be installed and now you
can see MongoDB is installed on our
Windows operating systems so we can just
click finish now let's see where this
MongoDB is installed on our Windows
operating system so open your folder
explorer and go into c directory here
and in here go to Program Files and the
Program Files you will be able to find
this MongoDB folder and cite this
MongoDB folder click on server and then
the version 3.2 and you will be able to
see this bin folder here right and in
here you can see a bunch of executable
file now there are two executable files
which are of interest for us
one is Mongo dot exe and other is Mongo
D dot exe now Mongo D is a Mongo daemon
which is going to run in the background
and is going to accept the can
action from MongoDB so it's a background
process right and this Mongo dot exe is
a command-line shell from which you are
going to work with your database so in
order to work with MongoDB you just need
to run Mongo D which is Mongo daemon in
the background and then you can open
Mongo shell to work with your databases
right now let's see how we can open this
Mongo D in the command prompt so what
you can do is you can right click on
your Start menu and open the command
prompt and then you can you know go or
browse to this path which is up to this
bin folder or otherwise the short cut
for you know opening this folder is hold
your Shift key so just hold your Shift
key and then right-click your mouse and
then you will be able to see this open
command window here so you can just
click this it's going to open the
command window in this folder and then
in here you just need to run Mongo D
first so just write Mongo D dot exe and
then press ENTER and it's going to you
know give you this error and let's see
what this error is so you can see it
says C colon slash data / DB not found
so in order to work with MongoDB you
need to have this kind of folder
structure in your C Drive which is data
/ DB so we are going to create this
these folders inside our C Drive so open
folder Explorer once again go to your C
Drive and then create a new folder here
and we are going to name it as data and
go inside this data
folder and create a new folder which we
are going to name it as DB okay so data
and DB okay so you need to have this
kind of folder structure in order to you
know work with MongoDB which is C data
and DB okay
so once you are done with this you can
run this Mongo D command once again so
Mongo d dot exe and press ENTER and now
you can see Mongo D is running you can
just click allow access from here and
then you can see this is ready to take
the connection so I'm going to maximize
it and you can see waiting for
connections right now what we are going
to do next is we are going to open one
more terminal to you know open this
Mongo dot exe file okay so once again go
to this folder bin folder inside Mongo
DB right click before right-click you
need to press shift so shift and then
right click and then open command window
here once again and I'm going to
maximize it this is our previous shell
and this is our new so in here we are
going to once again run Mongo d dot exe
and press ENTER and now you can see here
connection accepted here right so when
you are you know run this Mongo D exe is
going to you know open this kind of
interface and now from this interface
you can connect to your databases and
from this this is running in the
background this other you know command
prompt which runs a Mongo ddotty exe
right so it's taking the connection and
for testing it for example we will just
type here DB and press enter and you can
see we have a sample database here which
is called test
okay so this is all about installation
of MongoDB in the next video we will
learn more about MongoDB so stay tuned
and please rate comment subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
