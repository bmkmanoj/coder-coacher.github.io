show you how to use radio buttons and
checkboxes into your program so for
example we have the employee info jframe
which we have created earlier in this we
have some information of the employees
like his employee ID his name surname
and age and now we want to add one more
information of the employee into a
program which is gender so for example
he may be male or female so I will add a
radio button or check box to decide
whether he is a male or female so let's
get started so first of all make a label
and name it as gender and then go to
your palette and take renewable and
place it before your gender and I will
name my me first
and similarly I will take one more renew
button for female
and I named it as so I have taken two
radio buttons and one is male and one is
female so now when I run the program and
when I click meal it's clicked and when
I click email it's also cleared but I
don't want that I want only one by the
male or female should be clicked not and
both both at the same time we don't want
that so either male or female should be
clicked when we clicked either of them
so how to do that
what we have to do is go to your palate
and take a button group and drag into
your jframe so when you only leave the
button group into the jframe you cannot
be able to see where is your button
group it's hidden in the jframe so don't
worry about it
you will use it and require so now you
click meal and go to its properties and
in the properties you can see there is
an option called button group go to its
combo box and this is our button group
one so just select it I've selected
button group one and similarly go click
your female radio button and also go to
its property go to button group and
select your button group one so this is
the same button group we have dragged
into your j-frame so for example if you
track one more button group into your
jframe and when you click female and
when you click here you have to button
groups but we want only one button group
in our program so you can see when you
click female you can see they are
grouped in group number one so now when
you run the program
and when you want to select female of
meal I want to select female for example
and then when I click male my female
radio button is automatically unselected
so in this way I can only select one
option either male or female so you can
use this technique whenever you have so
many radio buttons to use and you want
that only one radio button is selected
at a time so this is about using radio
buttons in a similar way you can also
use check boxes there is no difference
in checkboxes and radio buttons other
than the appearance so they can also be
used like same so for example I want I
have three fours checkboxes yeah and
I know I have to button groups one I
have assigned to this and second I want
to assign to this for checkboxes so that
only one can be selected at the same
time so I will select one two three four
by my control but pressing my control
button and selecting I will right click
go to the properties and I will go to
the button group property and I mean
click button group to so these four are
connected with the help of button group
two and when I run the program
I can select only one time and if you
one don't want to use button group you
can remove it also so it's not necessary
you have to use it but if your program
requires to select only one option at
the time then you can use button group
so that's all all for this tutorial in
the next tutorial I will tell you how to
add these checkboxes with your database
so whenever you click this the mail
option will go into your database and
whenever you think this but female
option will you go into your database so
that's all for now please rate comment
