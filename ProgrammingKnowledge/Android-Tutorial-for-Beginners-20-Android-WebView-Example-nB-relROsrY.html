tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use webview with your Android
activity so let's take an example and
let's see how we can use web view in our
Android activity so first of all what
I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
button and I will change its text to
open URL okay and also I'm going to
change its property which is layout
colon width to fill parent so that it
covers all the widths now I'm going to
take our text add it from here so go to
the text field and take a text add it
from here I'm going to take this plain
text but you are free to choose other
text view also or added text also now
this added text also I'm going to change
the property for the layout underscore
width or layout colon width to fill
parent okay so it fills the width now
the most important thing we are going to
use here is the webview so just search
for a webview in the palette and drag
and drop into your activity and then you
can resize your webview and you can
change the property of this webview to
fill parent so the layout width of this
I am going to change it to fill parent
and the layout height also fill parent
okay so it can cover all the remaining
area of the activity now what I am going
to do is in this edit text let's enter
some default text so that we don't have
to type a long URL for it for the first
time
so let's open for example google.com
with this so I'm going to add the URL
HTTP colon double slash and then
www.google.com okay
now we are ready to write the code for
our activity so we will go to the Java
and in the main activity dot Java file
we will first of all declare these
variable which we have used so let's
Stickley add this variable
you
ok so I have declared my all three
variables one for button one for edit
text and the last for webview now we are
going to make a function for the button
click event so let's make a function
void the or better public void public
void open URL and then inside this
function first of all we will cast our
three variables which we have declared
one is for button and add a text and
browser
you
so now we have declared all three
variables or we have casted over all
three variables and now we will add the
button click event to our button
variable so let's add a button click
event button submit dot set on click
listener and here we will set a new on
click listener and inside this on click
method we are going to write our code
but first of all let's do the important
one important thing so to open any URL
or any web page you need to provide the
permission to open or to permission to
use Internet right so go to your
manifest folder in your app folder and
in here you will be able to see a folder
called Android manifest dot XML and in
here you can set your permission so go
just above your application element or
tag and in here we will provide our
permissions okay so in here what you
need to do is you need to type this line
of code which is in the angular brackets
you need to add this tag called user -
permission and then give the name
Android : name is equal to in the codes
Android dot permission dot internet okay
so you need to add this extra line to
your Android manifest dot XML file now
everything is ok now we are ready to
write some code for our on click
listener so let's take this browser and
what we are going to do is first of all
let's declare our string to get the URL
ok so string you
l is equal to and then we will take the
text from the added text so URL text dot
get text and then we will convert it to
string and then this URL we can pass to
our West web view right now let us take
this browser variable and let's set some
properties to this browser so the first
property we are going to add here is
first of all get settings and then set
let's set the images loading of images
so load image automatically is equal to
true and the second property we are
going to set is for the JavaScript so
browser dot get settings and then dot
set JavaScript enabled is equal to true
and the third property we are going to
set is for the scrollbar so browser dot
set scroll bar style and then in here we
will use this view dot so we are going
to set scroll bar scroll bar inside
overlay so scroll bar inside overly okay
and now we can load some URL to our
browser okay so what we are going to do
a we can just call our loadurl function
on our browser load URL and it takes a
string as an argument and we have
already extracted our string or URL from
our added text in this URL right so we
can pass it here
so now everything is done hopefully so
just call this open URL function in your
oncreate method and let's run our
program so our program is running now
and you can enter any URL in this added
text of a default URL is HTTP colon
slash www.google.com so let's click this
open URL button from here and let's see
if it opens our URL yes it opens right
so it opens up a web page when we click
the button and we can go back once again
and we can just click it once again and
it will open your URL in the web view so
