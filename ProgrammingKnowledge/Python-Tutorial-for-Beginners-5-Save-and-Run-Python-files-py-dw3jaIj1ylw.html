tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I'm going to
show you how you can save your program
or how you can save your Python program
to use this program in the future so for
example you want to save your Python
program and run it whenever you need in
future how you can do it I'm going to
show you in this video so till now we
were using this Python shell and
whatever code we write in this fight and
shell it will execute this code very
well but it's not able to save your
program so whenever you just close the
spider shell your program is gone it's
and it's not saved anywhere so let's try
to make a new file of new Python file so
that we can use this Python file
whenever we need and we don't even need
to worry about closing this shell okay
so how you can do this is you just need
to open this Python shell you already
know that you can just open this Python
shell by going to your Python folder and
just open idle Python GUI from here and
this is that I didn't idle Python GUI
which is a Python shell so just open it
and just go to file here and just click
new file and this will open a new file
and you can save this file as Python
file but first you need to write some
code in here so I'm just giving you an
example how you can make this Python
file and how you can run it so for
example we want to calculate the maximum
of three values what you can do here is
you can calculate the maximum of three
values like this so I have already shown
you how you can take the input like by
using this input function and how you
can convert this input to an integer by
just typecasting this string value which
you get from
input to the integer and save it into
variable so in the same way we have I
have three valuable x y&amp;amp;z which are
taking inputs from the user and what I'm
going to do is I'm just simply
calculating the maximum value of these
three number which you have user health
and third and I'm going to print this
maximum so maximum I'm calculating this
from a function called max which I have
shown you in the last video that can
take any number of argument right now I
have only 3i argument because I want to
compare three numbers and calculate the
maximum value so let's try it
to save this first so you just need to
save this program in order to run it so
you just need to go to file and just
click save as and in here choose your
path for the Python file and just give
the name of your piping file for example
test and make sure that this here save
as type is python file here which is dot
py file or dot py w file and save your
file and now once your file is saved you
can just run it just go to this one tab
and you can just like this run module or
f5 key okay so I'm going to run module
and this will run my module like this so
I'm going to give three numbers for
example 22 second number 33 third number
44 and it gives me the answer that
maximum of these three values is 44
right I can do this in a better way that
I can print something first that the
result is or the max of three three
values is and it depends upon you how
you can run this is just an example okay
so how do you want me
your program you are free to make it and
this is just an example how you can save
your file but still it doesn't solve our
purpose because it's running our code in
the shell and we cannot you know always
run our program and you cannot open our
Python shell everywhere you know you
want to run your Python file as an
executable file right you don't don't
need to you know open this Python shell
every time you need to run your Python
program and how you can run your program
directly is you just need to go to the
folder wherever you have saved your
Python file so I have saved my file in
files here but there is a little
correction you need to make in this
program and what is the correction
because it's taking three inputs and it
will take three inputs and it's going to
print this answer and just after you
know giving you the answer or printing
the answer it will instantly exit so
what you need to do just need to give
something so that it can stay so just
write in put and in put in here you can
just give string that please press ENTER
to exit and this will you know keep your
screen on and until and unless you press
ENTER it will not exit just save your
program once again just go to file and
save it and then go to the python file
wherever you have saved your python file
okay just go to the python file you can
right-click and you can open if you go
into if you are going to open
it it will open it in the Python
terminal and this will run your program
directly you don't even need to use this
Python shell or what you can do you can
just directly double click it and it
will open your Python program and it
will give you the option
please enter first number I will enter
first number 11 second number 43 third
number 43 and when I press ENTER it will
give me the answer which is 43 the max
of Treena values is 43 and now it will
give me this option that press ENTER to
exit and when I press ENTER or any other
key I will exit from my Python code okay
so once again you can save your python
file by going to this file tab and make
a new file and just save your file once
you have done writing your code you just
need to save your file as a py files you
just need to go to file and save as and
you just need to give a name to your
file and make sure that it's a Python
file type ok once your file is ready you
just need to or once your food is ready
you just need to save it and once you
have saved your file you just need to go
to the file and run it if you have
remembered I have shown you in the first
video or that Python doesn't compile
your program button directly runs your
program so you don't need to compile
your program with it to win run your
program directly ok and if any error
occurs in your program it will give you
the answer at the runtime but I'm not at
the compiled time so this is why you can
run your Python file directly like this
by double clicking ok so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please rate comment
