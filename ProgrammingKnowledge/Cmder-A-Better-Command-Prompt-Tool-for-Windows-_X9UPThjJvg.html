show you how you can download and
install a command-line tool for Windows
which is better than the native windows
command-line tool which is called
commander now if you have you know used
command-line tool on Windows ever it
looks like this so I am using Windows 8
and it looks like this and if you are a
developer or if you want to use a
command line for your work then using
this command line tool is not you know
satisfactory I would say for example you
are building a node application and you
need to run node commands here and this
works fine but for a developer they want
more than this kind of boring
command-line tool now you can say
Windows 10 has already been there and
their command line tool is little bit
better but it's not so much better that
we can love it for example so let's see
what command line tool I'm going to show
you and let's see what's the difference
between them so what we are going to do
is we are going to download and install
a free command line tool which is called
CMD ER and we say it command tool okay
so just I type CMD ER commander and the
first link which will appear here will
be commander dotnet right so just click
this link and this tool is free command
line tool so you can use it for free and
in here you can see the first look of it
it will look like this and to download
it you can just click this download
button now there are two you know
versions of it one is the download mini
version which is 6 megabyte and if you
are interested in the whole
functionality then you can
you know download this 80 megabyte
download installable file okay so it's a
zip file so it's not an installer it's a
zip file so you just need to extract it
and you just need to you know run the
command line tool from there okay so let
me save this zip file and once this zip
file will be downloaded it will take
around one minute on my PC it can take
more or less time depending upon the
speed of your computer and once it's
downloaded we will see how it works okay
so now the download of this zip file is
complete and I have already extracted
this zip file this file will look like
this so you just need to extract it in
the folder of your choice okay after
extracting it you will see this
executable file which says commander dot
exe you just need to double-click it
very simple stuff and I'm going to
minimize everything and by the mean time
it will start okay now here you can see
unlock and continue command and visit
home page and exit and it says that some
of the dll's are missing you don't need
to worry about them you can just say
ignore and continue for now okay and
then just skip this version for now ok
and now it will open this command line
too and you can see when you you know
start this command line tool the
difference between these two command
line tools right so you know when at the
time when you open it it will look like
this very sleek and you know you will
love it from the first step itself you
can you know follow or execute any
command which you can run on Windows and
even which you can run on your Linux or
UNIX command line tool for example
l s- l and list all the you know files
and the permissions of your files and
folders right or a CD or mkdir or many
command line commands it can execute and
the best thing what I like about this
command line tool is for example if you
want to open to command line you know
command line or command prompts what you
need to do is you need to open the
command prompt - or you know two
terminals for to command line you know
commands if you want to run in parallel
right for example in case of Mongo you
need to run the Mongo daemon in
background and then you need to execute
the Mongo shell itself right and in that
case you need to open two terminals at
the same time and it's not I mean very
elegant in case of commander what you
need to do is you can just right click
on this icon at the top and you can just
say new console it will give you this
option you can say start and we'll start
a new terminal you can see side by side
right so you can navigate between them
like this you just need to press these
tabs and you can open multiple terminals
like this on commander this is the
feature which I like this command-line
tool also comes with SSH so if you want
to you know control a remote PC or a
Linux operating system it will help you
so just SSH and whatever is the IP
address of your PC then you will be able
to you know access this that PC so you
can see when I press SSH and it gives me
one bunch of the options right and yeah
so you can
you can just use it and see if it's good
for you or you want to stick with the
old command-line tool it's on your you
know choice but I am you know lately
using this command line tool and I am
loving it so I wanted to share with you
so that's it I hope you enjoyed this
