video I am starting a new video series
on SQLite database and in this video I
will show you how to get started with
your SQLite database on Windows machine
so why this Eska light is very
interesting is because it's a
self-contained database and it's a
serverless database that means it
doesn't require any server for it's
working so mostly it's used in mobile
application because it's a server less
database and you can transfer your
database from one computer to another
computer without any server requirement
so now let's download the binary and
install it so just go to download and in
here we will search for the windows
binaries so I will go here and I will
download this SQLite zip file ok so just
click it I have already downloaded it
and this file looks like this so it has
only one Exe file called SQLite 3 dot
exe so what I will do is I will go to my
C folder which is this C folder computer
C and I have made a folder called SQLite
2 for example and in here I will extract
my SQLite file this escalade zip file so
this only contraint contains one
Exe so I can drag and drop this into my
C and s collide folder now let's get
started with this database so go to your
Start button of your windows here and
press CMD + enter and in here write CD
because I have created my database in
the C file so write CD and backslash and
you reach to the CD C directory of your
command prompt now this is in my s
collide to folder so Casca light to see
the s collide - okay
and now I will create a new database so
write the name of this exe file which is
s collide 3 first of all I will show you
this s collide 3 is in this folder now I
will write as skin light 3 and then the
name of your database so for example I
will name my databases company dot DB
and I will press Enter this has created
a database in my folder so now I will
create a table in my company dot
database so I will write a query for
creating a simple table so I will write
this course right
create table and the name of your table
then in the bracket you need to pass
what column you need in your
our table so first column in my table I
want employee ID and which is of integer
datatype
so first the name of the column and
space the datatype of your column second
name so after comma right name and this
is a is of string datatype so I write
Val cap and the length of my string
comma the title of the employee this is
also a string type where cap and bracket
and bracket close and don't forgot
forget this semicolon and then I press
ENTER and it has created a table now I
will check that SQLite has really
created a database for me or not so for
that I write select star star from the
table name so my table name is employee
and I will press ENTER and it's giving
me this command because I haven't
entered the semicolon here so I will
give this semicolon this is important
and once again and it says
error syntax errors that may be because
my file or the table is empty so I will
enter some data in my table so I will
write this command insert into employee
values and first column is for employee
ID so I write employee ID 1 0 1 comma
the name of the employee so inside this
single code write the names John Smith
comma the title of the employee so for
example CEO and then once again I press
ENTER and it has created inserted data
in my table so now let's try once again
this same select star from employee and
press enter and now it shows me the data
so employee ID and then the name and
then John Smith John Smith and the title
CEO now I can enter more data inside
this table for example insert into the
table name and value 1 0 2 the name and
the title once again and press ENTER one
more data and I will insert one more row
of data so insert into employee and then
once again employee ID name and the
title and press ENTER now I will do
select star from employee and it should
contain these three employees in my
table so press ENTER and yes it has
these three rows of data so in this way
you can create your first
table in your Escalade database in the
next few videos I will show you how to
install a good SQLite manager for your
database because working on this command
prompt is really irritating sometimes
for big development projects so this is
just I wanted to show the install
introduction that's why I have used this
command prompt but maybe in the next
video I will show you how to download
and install up free SQLite database
manager to create the database and
manage your database so stay tuned and
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
