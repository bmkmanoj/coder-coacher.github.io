video I will show you how to play a
sound in loop last time I have shown you
how to play a site the music or audio
only when you press a button it plays a
single time but what if you want play a
sound multiple times or infinitely so I
will show you how to play a sound in
loop today so what I'm going to do is I
will take a button and place it anywhere
it's just for demonstration so I will
name it as sound loop okay
and I have in my folder sound file which
is a dot WAV file or dot WAV file it
sounds like this I will play it you have
mail
so this song fan mail this sounds like
this you have mail and I will try to run
or play the sound infinitely or in
dilute so I will go to the buttons
action action perform once again that
failed the pattern action perform and
first of all you need to import some
files so I will go at the top and I will
write
import some dot audio dot star semi
colon semicolon so you need to import
this file and then once again go to our
connection perform we will start from
and here you need to write what
Audio audio player MGP we name this
variable is equal to once again copy
this and paste it here on you player dot
layer right semicolon and in the next
line I'll write audio stream PG M so
this is the audio stream and then in the
third line I will write audio data
variable name so and one more thing
sorry so one more thing you need to
write is
continuous
audio stream yes rename it variable on
speed is equal to null so this will be
our loop variable to which we are going
to run our program and move and then
quickly we make try-catch block
try/catch
and the catch but y'all can write the
suction e
and now the track catch what to write
copy audio stream variable name and
paste it here is equal to you on your
stream
and in the bracket right new file
inputstream current and then file it
back so I will close this and then here
you need to give the file path some have
copied my path and paste it here double
slash is everywhere and in the next line
is copy this audio data variable and
write it here is equal to VG and audio
stream variable dot at closed then copy
this loop variable paste downwards equal
to MU
you continuous all your stream and
in between here will come
all your data variable and then this
code in the try catch block is done and
after outside your try catch block you
will copy this audio player variable
name and then write dot start and in
here we will write loop so it will run
in loop this loop variable comes here so
this is basically the code of playing
sound in the loop let's try to run the
program so my program is running now and
when I click this sound loop my audio
will run in blue so it would it must say
you have me in the Europe mail
continuously so I will press this button
you have mail you have mail you have
mail you have mail you have mail you
have mail you have now you have now you
have mail you have now you have mail so
you have seen that the sound was running
in loop continuously unless I have ended
my program so in this way you can play
sound file in the loop so I hope you
have learned something new this time
please rate comment and subscribe and
bath now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
