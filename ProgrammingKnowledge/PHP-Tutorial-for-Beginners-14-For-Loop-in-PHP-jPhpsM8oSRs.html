last video I have shown you how to use
while loop and dowhile loop in your PHP
code in this video I am going to show
you how to use for loop in your PHP for
loop is also a kind of loop but it's
more flexible in a way that you don't
need to declare these counter or
increment counter like this you have to
do in while loop you can do it in the
construct of your for loop these things
and you don't need to declare them like
this so for example first of all I will
just delete all the code from here and I
will just show you the construct or
basic skeleton of for loop so the basic
skeleton of the for loop is like this
you just use for keyword and then it's
like while loop you give some condition
in these brackets and in this curly
braces you give your statement but this
for loop has three three categories here
separated by these semicolon and first
category is the initialization of the
value you want to use second is the
condition and third is the increment of
the value so for example I want to
achieve the same what I have done in the
last video I want to print some strength
ten times so how can I do it using for
loop just use for and then I would just
give the basic constructs to this for
loop and then what you do here is give
declare a variable and initialize it by
a value for example I declare some
variables called counter will like I
have done in the last video counter and
I initialize this by one then I provide
the semicolon here and then I provide
the condition so I want to print
something then
time so I provide this condition if or
counter is less than or equal to 10 I
want to keep on printing and then I will
get the semicolon and then I increment
the value so I will increment the value
of counter once again like we were doing
in the last video like this so you don't
even need to declare this counter I
outside your for loop it will take care
of this initialization like this and it
takes care of even the increment like
this and now you can just echo something
for example programming knowledge and
the counter by this concatenation symbol
dot and I will give the break here also
okay and I will save it and hopefully it
will print the same thing okay so it
prints the same thing here so for loop
is so also working like this but what is
the flow of your code is first of all
your code will come here it will declare
a variable and initialize this counter
variable by 1 then it goes and check
this condition and on the basis of this
condition for example if they initialize
this and counter is equal to 1 and
counter which is 1 is less than 10 then
it executes this code and then performs
increments okay
first initialization then comparison
then execution if the condition is true
and then this increment happens okay so
this is the flow of your for loop so in
this way you can use for loop in your
PHP code I hope you enjoyed this video
