show you how to install TeamViewer in
your open to Linux operating system
TeamViewer is a remote desktop control
software so you can manage or you can
control your operating system for
example your Linux from a remote
destination so let's get started just
open your favorite browser and just
write TeamViewer
download ok and press Enter and in here
it'll open a team of your website and it
will show so I will go to the team of
your website first let's go to the
TeamViewer website and go to this
download section and in here you have
some installation for your Linux system
so according to your Linux version or
Linux
what type of Linux you have 32 bit of
64-bit you can just and download these
Deb files or this zip file so I'm going
to show you how to install it with this
Deb file ok so I will download this zip
file for 32-bit Linux because my Linux
is a 32-bit operating system so I will
download this Deb and I will say keep it
will download the TeamViewer Deb file 1
once this team via dot Deb file is
downloaded I will open my terminal and I
will go to the
folder where my dev file is present so
this file is present in my download
folder so i will write CD / or we give
the path downloads and I will see my dev
file which is this file so first of all
I will install by my file with the
command sudo dpkg - I and then my team
pure under school Linux so I will write
TeamViewer Linux dot dev file and I will
press Enter
and I will give my password and will
start installing my TeamViewer so it's
not a very long process it will install
in some seconds in your system and once
it's installed you need to go to this -
home so click dash home
and in this dash home in the search just
search for TeamViewer and you can see
here timber over nine if you want to use
TeamViewer frequently just drag and drop
into this toolbar here and just double
click it to open to view it will open
TeamViewer in your system and for the
first time when you install TeamViewer
and when you want to run it you need to
accept this license agreement
so if you agree with the license just
click accept license and now TeamViewer
is working on your system so now for
example I want to check whether
my team here is really working so this
open to operating system I am running on
a virtual machine and I have Windows 7
host machine and in this Windows 7 host
machine I also have TeamViewer there
also right so for example I want to
connect this guest machine which is open
to machine to my host machine machine
which is a Windows machine and I want to
operate this Linux from TeamViewer using
this Windows 7 host machine so I will
open my TeamViewer in Windows first and
I will just give the ID to connect to
the TeamViewer which is the same as my
Ubuntu operating system TeamViewer ID
and I will click connect to partner and
it's going to give me a prompt to give
the password and now it's
my Windows host TeamViewer is asking for
the password from the dim view of for
this ubuntu so this is two zero seven
one for example so I will write the
password and I will say logon and in
some moment you will be able to see the
TeamViewer virtual machine in your
TeamViewer terminal so now I have my
TeamViewer virtual machine and I have my
other virtual machine which I am running
but this is running on TeamViewer I will
just minimize it a little and you can
see both the screen at the same time
this is my actual virtual machine and
this is my team viewer so whatever I do
here in my team view I want to for
example minimize or close this web
browser it closes in both the screens so
in this way you can install TeamViewer
and view your open to operating system
in the remote nation and you can control
your Ubuntu operating system from some
remote destination I hope you have
