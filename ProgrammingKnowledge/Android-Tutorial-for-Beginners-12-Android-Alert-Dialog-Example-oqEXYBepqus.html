tutorial on android app development for
beginners and in this video we will see
how to use alert dialog box on our
Android activity alert dialog box you
can use to alert the user for some
action for example by clicking some
button user can decide if you want to
you know close your application or not
so let's get started and I will just
take a button to open this alert dialog
and I will change the name of this
button as a lot for example now I am
going to go to my main activity dot Java
and in here I am going to create a
button variable so private static button
button underscore SPM for button submit
okay
and now we are going to create a method
which we will call on button click event
so public void on button click listener
and in here inside this method I am
going to cast my button submit variable
which is this variable which I have
declared and I will assign ID to it so
button find view by ID r dot ID dot the
ID of the button okay now I am going to
use this button to set a on click event
okay so button dot
set on click listener and inside this
function we will create our new on click
listener and inside this on click
listener we are going to create a load
dialog ok so let's create an alert
dialogue a lot dialog and we will name
it as a lot for example alert or
variables so a lot dialog dot builder
with capital B and we name it as a build
up for example is equal to new alert
builder alert dialog thought builder and
we are going to create this a lot dialog
box on this activity so we will just
assign it to this class and now in here
we are going to create a message for
this builder so I'm going to copy this
variable which is a builder and then we
will call set message method on this
builder so set message and inside the
set message we can you know call some
message inside the set message so in
double quotes for example we can display
a message do you want to close this app
ok and if the user want he can close it
so we will provide the some method to
this alert box for example set
cancelable and this should this alert
box should not be canceled label so we
will just set it as false and then so
let's shift it to the next line so that
we can see it better and then after this
we have set the cancel button to false
and then now we are going to set the
positive button for example yes if in
condition if candy death condition
arises that we want to display yes or no
condition a button on this alert dialog
box then how we can do it
so set positive button and in this it
takes some arguments so when you hover
over this method you will be able to see
that it can take some argument or you
can just directly hover over this and
click inside this method and it will
show what are the argument its it takes
so the first argument it takes is the
title or text of this yes button so we
will just give yes to it
and the second argument which it takes
is the on click listener because it's a
button so that we can set an on click
listener on this button so we can set
positive button and negative button for
to condition if the condition is true or
condition is false okay so the next is
the new on click listener and in this on
click listener it will create the on
click method for you automatically and
in here you just need to call finish
okay finish method just closes your app
gracefully so if the user wants to close
the app he can click this yes button and
will close your app gracefully otherwise
just go outside this set positive button
and just go below that and dot set
negative button and we can set negative
condition also and the first argument of
this is the text on this button second
argument is the on click method so new
on click listener and in here also we
can call a method to cancel this dialog
box so in here you can see this dialog
variable inside this on click method so
just call this dialog dot cancel and
this will close your alert right and now
outside this negative button I will just
give this semicolon here so that we can
close this method so what we have done
basically here is we have created a
method and inside this method we have
created a button variable and we have
casted it and we have taken the ID of
this button
and then we call on this button set on
this onclicklistener
new onclicklistener and inside this on
click of this main button we have
created our builder for the alert dialog
right and on this alert build a variable
here we have called set message so this
is the message it's going to display the
second method we have called a set
cancel label so it's not going to show
any cancel button so we have set it to
false then we have called set positive
so this is the positive button it's
going to show at this alert dialog and
the text is going to show us yes and on
click event of this button we are just
closing our app gracefully otherwise we
have set the negative button for the
negative condition and we will just
close this app close this alert dialog
box by calling this button this method
called dialog cancel okay and I think in
here where I have defined alert dialog
dot builder a underscore builder is
equal to new alert dialog in here I must
remove this brackets from here and
instead of this we can just call you can
just call the name of our activity class
which is mean activity and then we can
call this on main activity so in here
after builder just before this this you
just need to write main activity dot
this okay so now we have created our
builder right just below this build a
method of builder code just below this
we are going to create our a lot
along now also a lot dialogue and we
will name it as Alert is equal to and
now we will take our builder for the
alert dialog and we will create a new
alert so alert builder dot create right
after this this from this alert dialog
instance you can set the title on this
alert box for example a lot and then you
can call show method to show this alert
dialog box so a lot dot show okay so now
your code is complete so we can call
this method inside our on create method
so this is was our method so just copy
this method and inside your oncreate
method you can call this method so just
paste this method inside your oncreate
method now I am going to run my
application so my application is running
now and this is my alert button so when
I click this alert button here a new
alert dialog box appears right the title
of this alert is alert which we have set
and this is the message which we have
said do you want to close this app right
and there are two buttons no and yes
for example we click no button nothing
happens just this alert dialog box
closes right now once again I'm going to
open this alert dialog and this time I
will click this yes and when I click yes
it gracefully closes my app right
once again I will start my app open it
no nothing happens it just closes the
alert
log and yes it closes my app so in this
way you can use a lot dialogue in your
Android activity I hope you enjoyed this
