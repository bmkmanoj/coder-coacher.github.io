audience tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn how we can create
custom modules in no chairs now in the
previous videos we have already seen how
we can use built-in modules in node.js
and the example of that was using the
module called HTTP so in the previous
videos we have used a built in module
which was already built in a node.js
which was called HTTP and the way we
have used it is like this so we have
used this require keyword and then use
the name of the module which we wanted
to use right and we have assigned this
module to variables so that it has
created an instance of this module and
using this variable we can call any
method inside this module which it
contains write in a similar way in
node.js
we can also define our own custom module
now for example we want to define a
module with says hello in different
language so we can define our custom
module now for that what we can do is we
just need to create a new file for every
module we want to create so let me go to
the command line and let's see what are
the files which are therein inside my
project right now so as I can see I have
right now only app dot chess which is my
main file you can see here also the same
right and now I'm going to create a new
file for example I'm going to say that
it's a hello dot J's for example and in
this new file we want to create a
function for example
I'll create a function and first of all
let me create a variable which has the
name say hello in English for example
right and to this variable I will assign
a value which is returned by our
anonymous function so we can define an
anonymous function like this we have
already seen in the previous video and
then this function returns for example
let's see what it returns so it returns
hello in English something like this
right and the way we can use this
function in our main app dot J's is we
just need to use a keyword called
exports right so here we have defined
this variable and if you use instead of
this VAR if you use exports something
like this then you can use all the
content of this file in the other file
for example right now how you can use
this file content into the main file for
example we use the same construct we
just use var and let's say our variable
name we want to give here is hello right
is equal to require just use require and
as we have done in the built-in module
we have just called the name of the
module for example we were using HTTP we
have called the name of the module so
the rule in node.js is whenever you are
using a built-in module which is not
created by you then you can use
something like name of the module
only otherwise if you want to use a
custom module you can just write
something like this so you can just
write dot and then forward slash and
then for example the name of the file so
hello dot J s something like this okay
and now using this variable you can call
a function so I will just use semicolon
here and then for example I will just
console.log the value which is returned
by that function right and then what I
want to do I will just use this variable
and then call a method which I have
defined here which is this one so
whenever you you know require any file
for example all the method inside that
file are available in this file which in
which you have required this file right
so I can just write something like this
and then don't forget these brackets
because this function have these
brackets right without any argument
right and then save your code and then
go to the command line and then just run
your app so just write node out dot
cheers and it gives me error so let's
see what what the error is the spelling
of export is wrong so just write exp so
RTS right so just write exports thought
say hello right and then once again run
your code and now it prints hello okay
so in order to you know use the content
of one file into other you need to use
this keyword before your function name
for example right now if you want
use multiple functions you can just
write something like this so for example
first function is say hello in English
then the second function is say hello in
Spanish for example and it says hola
something like this right now this
method is also available so both the
methods are available now in the amp dot
JS file so instead of using say hello in
English we can just say say hello in
Spanish and then we can run our code
once again add prints hola right so this
is one way of for you know using a
module custom module right the other way
is you can just use something like this
so what you can do here is you define
your functions these variables remove
the export from here something like this
and then you just use these colons here
and then here you just write module dot
exports and in the curly braces just
enclose both the functions something
like this okay and just use comma I am
and also don't forget to assign this
value here okay so just write module dot
export and then you have these object
inside these curly braces for example
say hello in English and say hello in
Spanish and this is also this kind of
you know export can also be used so
let's see what's the result
now I hope it will be same it's the same
result right so this is the second way
of exporting your you know methods right
the third way of using modules is for
example you have these object and
elements here right and then you can
assign this to some new object for
example who are hello right and then you
can just use module dot export and then
assign the value of Hello here right and
we are not doing anything special here
you see we were using this module dot
export here right and what we have done
is instead of using this we have
assigned the value of this object to a
variable for example var hello and then
we have just assigned the value of hello
and we have exported this module right
so essentially the same but this is more
readable so this says that this is our
hello module and it have two functions
inside it right and it's also going to
give the same result so once again run
the code say is the same
let's use both the function so say hello
in Spanish and say hello in English and
then we can just run our code head
prints hello and hello hola
right so in this way you can define a
custom module in nodejs I hope you've
