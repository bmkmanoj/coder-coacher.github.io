Scala tutorial for beginners and in this
video I'm going to give you a brief
introduction about Scala so first of all
what is Scala so thus named Scala is an
acronym for scalable language and Scala
is a modern multi-paradigm programming
language designed to express common
programming patterns in concise elegant
and typesafe way
so Scala is a scalable programming
language for components software with
the focus on patterns like abstraction
composition and decomposition and not on
primitives now Scala was written by a
developer called Martin address key who
is from Switzerland at EPFL before
writing Scala address key formally
worked on generic Java and Java C and
Suns Java compiler Scala is a statically
typed language as Java but it's little
bit different from Java now first we
need to understand what is statically
typed language
so in statically typed language a
variable has a type and can hold only
values of that type right so if you need
to declare a variable you need to
declare its type also right you must
specify type for every variable that
means type error are caught by compiler
and not at runtime so Scala is also
statically typed but it uses type
interfacing that is it figures out the
type so you don't have to figure them
out so the good thing about Scala is
less typing more fun and type errors are
caught by compiler but the bad thing is
you need to be familiar with more kind
of error messages now Scala runs on JVM
that is Java Virtual Machine and it's
fully interoperable
with Java that means you can use any
Java code in Scala and you can use Scala
code in Java also now Scala has the
functionalities of object-oriented
language as well as functional language
and also it has dynamic features that
means Scala Bland's object-oriented and
functional programming in a statically
typed language now if you're thinking
about the speed of Scala compared to
Java
it's almost as fast as Java programs and
it has an advantage of having a shorter
code so address key who was the inventor
of Scala reports 50% reduction in most
code over Java so if you are using Scala
Over Java you can write less and achieve
more and also Scala have fewer errors
you may have encountered null pointer
problems in Java but there is no null
pointer exceptions or problems in Scala
Scala is also more flexible so if you
want to write multiple classes in one
file you can do so in Scala
so why learn Scala the simple answer is
because Scala is practical so Scala can
be used as a drop-in replacement of Java
as we have already discussed in the
previous slide so you can use your java
code in your Scala code and also the
vice versa so you can use Scala code in
Java code also that means you can write
mixed scala slash Java projects the next
advantage is you can use Java libraries
in your Scala code so if you want to use
different libraries which are already
defined in Java you can import them in
your Scala code and use them the next
advantage is you can use different Java
tools
to develop your Scala code so for
example you can use and Maybin j-unit
etc and you can also use SBT which is a
popular tool for writing Scala
applications now it has a decent IDE
support also so you can create your
Scala project on a NetBeans IDE or our
IntelliJ IDE or Eclipse also supports
Scala project Scala also have Scala IDE
available on internet so this is a
Eclipse based IDE which is a Scala IDE
you can download from Internet for
developing your Scala projects so if you
are a Java developer or a C++ developer
or a ruby developer there are few
advantage of using Scala over these
languages so let me a list few of them
so you can get the power of the platform
in dependency of Java libraries but
without the boilerplate and verbose code
so if you are using Java you need to
create many boiler plates for many
functions for example getters and
setters and whatnot and you need to
write a verbose chords but in Scala you
can write the same code in fewer number
of lines so if you are writing your the
same code as you are writing in Java for
example you will achieve the same goal
in fewer number of lines next is you
will get the simplicity and productivity
like Ruby but with static typing and
compiled bytecode in addition when you
are using Scala you will get the
functional goodness and concurrency
support likes Haskell but without
complete paradigm shift and with the
benefits of object-oriented programming
now what I find especially attractive in
all of its magnificent features among
other is that most of the
object-oriented design patterns which
require lots and lots of boilerplate
code for example in languages like Java
are supported natively
in scala for example singleton pattern
are available via object a doctor and
decorator patterns are available by
traits and implicit s-- visitor pattern
is available by a pattern matching and
strategy pattern is available wire
closures for example and finally there
is a full interoperability with well
supported Java platform so you can mix
Java and Scala in both directions and
there is not much penalty nor
compatibility problems when switching to
Scala after having experienced the
annoyance of Java which makes code hard
to maintain when you write lots and lots
of Java code so this was a brief
introduction about Scala from the next
video we will see how we can install
Scala and how we can write our first
caller code so stay tuned and please
