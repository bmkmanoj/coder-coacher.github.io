shown you how to use include and require
function to include files in your PHP
program so I have shown you how to use
this include function and this required
function and what I was doing I was just
including this simple header to it and I
was just including this PHP variables to
my page 1 and pH 2 right now for example
first of all in what I am going to do in
this video or what I am going to teach
in this video is include once and
require ones variable and let's see why
we can use a why we need to use a these
include once and require once variable I
will give you a small demo demo so for
example I have this include header dot
PHP which is this one in my page 1 dot
PHP I included this and I will just
refresh this and it gives me programming
knowledge which is a message or which is
the header in the header file and
whatever message I am printing here
which is this one right now for example
somebody or by mistake I included this
header file
more than once right I will save it and
I will refresh my page and what it's
done is it has included this header file
three times and I will be able to see
this header three times right but
sometimes you don't want to you know see
this so what you can do is you can use
include one or require one's function so
for example I will write include
underscore once and this takes this
bracket and inside this bracket you can
pass the same header file name ok but
still
have declared this include once here
which includes this header file but
still I am in I'm you also using this
include function also and let's see what
happens the result is it included this
hide a file using include one function
once so we can see this message and it
also included this header file using
include function so you see this message
two times right but for example we just
cut this code and paste it below your
include program and let's see what
happens now and now you will be able to
see it is just printing once so what
this include ones in sure that that you
have only included this header file once
ok so whenever you want to include your
header file once use this include once
function ok same you can do it with
require and require once so you have
this require function in page 2 o dot
PHP and I can just use require
underscore once function and I can use
this header name here and whenever I
call this page 2 dot PHP it will only
include this header file once again only
once right so this will work with
require also and include also so just
remember that if you want to include
your header file once just use this it
include once or require once or if you
don't care about including your header
file more than once then you use this
require so I hope you have enjoyed this
