javathread tutorial for beginners in the
last video I have given you the overview
of threads in Java and I have told you
in the last video that you can create
threads in Java in two ways
one is by subclassing from thread class
and other way is by implementing the
runnable interface and in both cases you
need to implement this run method so in
this video I am going to show you this
first way of creating class by
subclassing from the thread class so
let's go to our Eclipse IDE here I have
a blank project whose name is thread
demo and inside this project I'm going
to create a package and I will name it
as lesson one for example and inside
this lesson one package I'm going to
create a class called
demo and it's going to have this mean
method and I'm going to finish it now as
I told you we want to extend from the
thread class in order to create a thread
so I will create a class and this class
I will name it as my class which extends
from a thread class second thing we have
learned that we need to implement a run
method in order to create the class
right so to implement this run method
you can just right click and go to
source and in source you can go to
overwrite slash implement methods and in
here you can see all the methods you can
override or implement and the method
which we want to override is this run
method so click this and click OK and
it's going to implement it now right now
we don't really need all this you know
auto-generated code so you can delete it
or leave it it's on you what I want to
do is I want to
for example perform some code for
example I want to print some Number ten
times right so int I is equal to zero
and I should be less than zero and I
plus plus and I want to print the value
of I ten times this is very simple so I
will just write this out and in here I
want to print the value for example
value plus I and what this code is going
to do it's going to just print the value
of I right so now we will go to our main
method in our demo class but first of
all let me correct this it should be
less than ten I should be less than ten
right it should not be less than zero so
let's go to our main method in our demo
class and we can create an instance of
this my class and we can call it my
class is equal to new my class and you
can use this my class object and call a
method called start on it so remember
you don't need to call a run method from
your my class but you need to call a
start method if you call run on your my
class object it's going to run like a
normal program no thread will be created
but if you call the start method on your
my class object which extend from the
tread class is going to create a thread
and then going to call this run method
automatically so let's run our program
now so just run it and what it does it
prints ten numbers right or zero to nine
right so nothing special how will you
know that threads is really running so
what we can do is we can create a second
instance of myclass
and we can call it my class one for
example so we have created two instance
of myclass one
this one and one is this one right and
now let's run the program and what it
does it's printing values 0 to x value 1
to x and here you can see threads in
effect right so what's going on you have
created first thread and you can have
created second thread and first thread
is called first and then second thread
is called first and then they are
running concurrently to print the number
values now how will you know which
thread is calling which value here so in
order to know that there is a function
in the thread class which we are going
to call in our this print line method or
system.out method our and just call
thread dodd current thread thought get
ID ok and it's going to give you the
current thread ID ok and then you will
know which thread is running or which
thread is printing which value so right
let's run the program once again let's
run it and now you can see what is
happening here so here you can see the
thread number so the number is given to
the thread and in this case the number
10 is given to the thread 1 and number
11 is given to the thread 2 right and
it's using thread 1 and printing value 1
2 3 4 5 6 until 9:00 and it's going to
take the thread 2 and it's printing the
value from 0 to 9 right but they are
running in sequence right now now in
order to check further that these
threads can run in concurrency what we
can do is we can use our method claw
called tread sleep so just use a method
thread dot sleep and what it does is it
takes an argument which takes
milliseconds so or for example we want
to pause this thread for 100
li seconds it's going to pause this you
know method for 100 milliseconds but
when you are called this method it's
going to ask to enclose it in the
try-catch block bit because it can throw
ok so I just click this small bulb here
and then just click this around with
try-catch and it's going to surround it
by try-catch right and now let's run it
once again so let's run the program once
again and now you can see first of all
first thread is called and then the
value 0 then second value 0 then first
then second then first then second so in
this way you know that they are running
in concurrency or so in this way you can
create a thread or create different
threads by extending from the tread a
class in the next video I'm going to
show you how you can implement this
runnable interface to create the same
threads so I hope you have enjoyed this
