video I will show you how to use
do-while loop and do until loop with
your visual basic windows form
application so I have this basic form
made and I have this button which I have
changed the text called while loop okay
and I'm just double clicking this button
to go into this button click event here
I have declared a variable called the X
as integer and I have initialized it
with a value of 1 ok so just this one
line I have written and which declares
our integer X which is initialized by 1
now for making a while loop we write do
and while and here we write a condition
so we can write do-while X is less than
10 when you press enter here it will
create a Auto code completion here
called loop and when you for example you
want to print your integer in the
message box so I'll write message box
dot show
and the value of X is and I will give
the m % and X here so this code will
print X until and unless this condition
is met and for example we need to give
some other condition to increment or
decrement or whatever you want to do
with X in this case I'm going to use X
is equal to X plus 1 and now let's try
and run the program so when I press this
button the value of x initializes with 1
because our first value was 1 and then
it increases one by one until and unless
10 is reached until and unless X is less
than 10 right so this is do-while loop
and how it is different from for loop
it's different in one respect only which
is you don't know the number of
iteration your loop is going to iterate
and in the for loop you predefined the
number of iteration right so that is the
basic difference now there is a a
do-while not loop also for example I
write do-while not then it will give me
or it will follow the opposite of this
condition X is less than 10
right so it will follow the this
condition and it will keep on looping so
for example I write X is greater than 10
then it will take X is less than 10 and
will work like previous code for example
I run the code and it's initializing by
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
so while when you give not conditioner
it will act opposite of this or reverse
of the condition you have given there is
one more condition of while loop you can
make is do until loop okay so for
example I write here do until and I gave
here the condition is equal to okay so
this condition a will occur or this loop
will keep on iterating itself until and
unless X reaches 10 so generally we use
equal to sign with an till and other
condition will do while undo while not
loop okay so once again I run the
program it will still do the same thing
but the only situation change here is
it's it's waiting for this condition to
be true okay
so when you have some specific cases
then you will be able to understand and
use these condition in a better manner
this condition do until you can
right like this also so you can write
while not it will still work like do
until you sew it on you how you want to
iterate your condition and how you want
to they use the loops and what is the
situation dependent on what which want
to use it so I hope you have understood
the basic concept of do-while do until
and do-while not loop I hope you have
learned something new this time please
