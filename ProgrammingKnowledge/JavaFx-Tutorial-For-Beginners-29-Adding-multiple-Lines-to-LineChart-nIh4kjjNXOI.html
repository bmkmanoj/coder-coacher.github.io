Java fix tutorial for beginners in the
last video I've shown you how to use
line chart in Java effects so when I
click this button it's going to load
this kind of a line chart now for
example I want a line chart with
multiple lines so this is only one line
chart but for example I want multiple
line chart how can I do it let's see so
I'm going to continue with my last
example which I have shown you which is
this example in which I was creating a
XY chart series and then adding it to
the chart using this button method okay
so I'm going to add the new code to this
button method itself so this was one
line so to add multiple lines what you
can do is you can just copy the same
code for the series and then once again
paste it here so you have two instances
of series right and let's say this is
series one variable and just to replace
this everywhere in the second series and
then you can change the values here okay
so for example four hundred one hundred
eight hundred and five hundred okay so
this is our second line series and let's
change the legend value also for example
this is p1 and this is p2 okay and to
add this new series to the line chart
what you can do is you can just keep
this code line chart get data but in
here instead of using ad you must use ad
all ok so just use ad all and then you
can add multiple series here so
Oh series and then series one variable
okay
now save your code and run it once again
and when I click this load chart button
it's going to give you the two lines
series okay and you can see the legend
here pay one and pay two in the same way
if you want a three line chart what you
can do you can just paste it once again
then series two and just copy it here
once again and then change the values
for example here and 650 for example and
this will be pay three and then add this
series two to your chart something like
this okay save your code and run it once
again and now you have a chart with
three lines okay so in this way you can
add a multiple a line chart in JavaFX I
