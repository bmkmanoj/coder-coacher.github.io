tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how we can download and install Eclipse
IDE on our Windows operating system and
we have also seen how we can configure
Eclipse to run our Java programs now in
this video we will see in detail how to
create a new project and what is the
ecosystem of this Eclipse IDE and we
will see how to do some important
settings in this Eclipse IDE so let's
get started first of all once again I'm
going to create a new project and then I
will go to the file menu here and then
select new and just select Java project
and in here in the project name I will
give the name to my project and this
name should be for example first project
for example ok and then everything
remains same so you can see use an
execution environment JRE by default
Eclipse detects this GRE and it also
detects JDK 8 folder for us so we don't
need to provide any part for executing
our program right the next thing is we
just press Next button and in here we
will see that Eclipse will create our
new project folder for us and it will
also create a subdirectory or subfolder
for us which will contain all our source
file ok and the default output folder
will be first projects
/bin we are going to see this folder in
a moment so just remember this that your
default folder will be default output
folder will be first project which is
your project name which is provided by
you slash bin folder you can change it
also but upon now we will leave it as
default okay and then we will click
finish now you can see I have two
projects in here listed so in Eclipse
you can you know open as many project
you want but you need to run these
projects so that you know you can run
one project at a time right so you can
select this project and you can build
and run this project otherwise you can
run this project ok so it depends upon
you which project do you want to run and
the other project which is open for now
you can close this project by right
clicking this project and just go to
this option called closed project and
then this project will be closed that
means this project will not be a you
know visible or open in this Eclipse Pro
perspective right to delete it I mean
from your perspective or package
Explorer you just need to right click it
once again and you just need to click
delete this doesn't mean that it will be
permanently deleted there is the option
to delete it permanently which is this
one the lead project content on the disk
so you can when he would check this it
will be deleted from your computer or if
you uncheck or if you leave this
unchecked it will be only deleted from
this Eclipse project Explorer for now
okay so I will click okay so this is
deleted but this other project exists in
my computer but it's not open in this
package Explorer here right so I have
this first project and this have this
source folder right you can just right
click this folder which is source folder
and then add packages to your folder so
what are packages packages are used to
you know define different workspaces or
different folder you can say in your
class so for example you are working on
two different different classes classes
I will explain you later but for example
you want to make a program for two
different cases in one project then you
can create a package for both of the
cases so for example I want to create
for this first project I want to create
a lesson one case for example so I will
just write lesson one okay and then I
can just finish this and as soon as I
finish this this will create a new
folder inside my sauce folder so let's
see how does my folder structure looks
like so I will open my C folder and
remember where we have you know saved
our project so at the starting of this
Eclipse IDE we have seen that we have
saved our project in the workspace
folder in your user and whatever your
computer name is so here is the
workspace folder and in here there is my
project which is first project
and in here I have the source folder
which is this folder and inside this
folder now I have lesson1 folder which
is this package folder so whenever you
create a folder create a package it will
create a folder inside your source
folder and in here we have nothing for
now but we will create some code for
this okay so I will minimize this and
now inside our package we are going to
add a new class and this class we will
name it as my class for example and just
see how I have written the spelling of
this my class m in my is capital and C
in class is capital right so it's camel
case notation so just remember this and
in here which method stop would you like
to create you just need to check public
static void mean and I will explain you
in a moment what is the meaning of this
but just check this option this is
important for now okay and then press
finish and then it created this class
for us class name is my class so every
Java project or every Java program you
make have at least one class and inside
this class you have at least one method
which is called mean okay so let's I
think this is not totally visible for
now so to change the font size of this
text editor what we can do is we will
just go to the windows folder and go to
the preferences and in here in the
Preferences there is a
search box here you will search for
phones and infra points you can see in
appearance there is a category called
color and fauns so just click this and
in here you will be able to find
different categories for example basic
CV as debug gate and there is a folder
or there is a category called Java you
need to go inside this category and then
inside this Java category there is a
category called Java and eater text font
just select this and click Add it and in
here you can change the font size or
font styles or whatever points you like
so for example I want to make it bold
and for example I want to make it 24 for
now okay and whenever I click apply my
font changes ok
in a similar way I can change the font
of my console console is this space
where your output will be shown so hello
world I want to change the spawn size of
this font of the output of the console I
can go to the category called debug and
in here console font in console font you
can edit it and make it bold or whatever
your size you want to give click OK
apply and it becomes bold and the size
you give now I was talking that every
Java program has at least one class
whatever class you declare and at least
one method which is called mean a method
is nothing but a small piece of code
which performs some action so this
method and this public static void I
will I am going to explain in detail
what are these things but just
for now just to understand that every
program will have this main method and
whatever you write inside this curly
braces after this main method will be
executed okay so for example first of
all before writing any code I should
teach you about comments so comments are
important for example this is our
comment and comments are important to
document your program so for example I
want to define what is the purpose of
this class or what this program is doing
I can provide comment easily so to make
a comment you just give forward slash
and then this Asterix symbol and then
press ENTER and when I press Enter
Eclipse is intelligent as an intelligent
IDE so it knows that I want to give in
command so you can see it has
automatically created this kind of
comment for us and whatever you write
here for example this is my first
program or something this you can do it
inside these comments so these comments
will not be executed by your program but
this is only the information you're
documenting for your program ok so this
is not executed while you compile a
program so this is one way of writing
comments the other way of writing
comment is writing two slashes like this
ok so this also after whatever you write
here same comment I can write here and
then you know I can write my comment
after these two double slashes and this
also will not be execute
right so whenever you create a project
it has a class and this main method and
you can see there is a perspective here
called outline and you can see your
package is listed here your class is
listed there your main method is listed
here so whenever your program becomes
lengthy this will help you to you know
quickly access your methods and classes
and packages wherever they are so for
example I click here mean I my cursor
goes to mean whenever I click my class
see here what happens I click my class
and my cursor goes to my class right I
click lesson 1 my cursor goes to lesson
1 right so this perspective helped us to
access our method of classes you know
quickly now whatever you write inside
your main class will be executed and
this program will be executed and give
you some output so Java has already have
some inbuilt classes to help you program
for example most important class in Java
is called system with the capital S so
just write system with capital S and
when you give dot java
because eclipse is an intelligent ide it
will give you this popup menu and it
will show you what are the method
available inside this system class and
this system class has so many method you
can see and we are going to use you know
use a method called out here
dot print print line print LM okay and
inside this print Ellen so you can see
you can just click this method of your
choice and you can double click and in
here you can write your first comment
for example you want to print hello or
hello YouTube you can do it like this
and once you write this this code will
help you to print hello world whenever
you run your program so for example I
want to run my program I will
right-click my project and I will run as
java application or i can directly click
this option run my class dot java ok so
i will just click this green button here
and it will open the save and launch so
whenever you write some code it's better
idea to save your program and if you
don't save it clips will prompt you to
save your program and then it will run
your program so I will save this ok and
this prints hello YouTube on my console
right so this system is a class and
whenever you hover over any inbuilt
method or class in your Eclipse editor
it will give you this help pop-up window
here so you can see what this code is
used for for example the system you can
see some you know description is here
the system class contains several useful
class field and method
it cannot be instantiated so whenever
you are
about some code and you want some
description of this functional method
you can just hover over this class or
method for example you want to have the
description of this out and what this
does is the standard output stream so it
prints it helps you to print some data
right so in this way you can hover over
the codes and see the description right
you can also press control and click the
method so press control and then hover
over any method you want to you know
have the description off and then click
it and when you click this you will go
to the class which has this definition
of this system so this system dot class
is an inbuilt class so don't be confused
by all these big things for now just
understand whenever you write system dot
out dot print line and inside the
bracket whatever comments you comment
you write will be printed on this
console right but I just wanted to show
you how you can you know get some help
or description or whatever from the code
itself that's why we have installed this
intelligent Eclipse IDE so I hope you
have understood the basic you know
things about this ecosystem of Eclipse
and creating the project and I hope you
have enjoyed the video please rate
