how to embed YouTube with you inside
your Visual Basic windows form
application so you have this blank form
and you want to embed a YouTube video
inside the form how can you do it I will
show you so just go to your toolbox
first and right click your toolbox
anywhere and just click this option
called choose items from here and in
here go to calm component tab which is
this tab and in here search for the tool
called shock wave Flash Player which is
this one so search for shockwave flash
object and by default its unchecked so

click OK and once you do this you will
be able to find this shock wave flash
object inside your toolbox so this will
help us to embed the YouTube video just
drag and drop this object inside your
forum and it will load this shockwave
flash object and if you want you can
resize it and you can anchor it to all
the sides ok and now what you need to do
is you need to have my YouTube video
link so for example I will copy a video
link you YouTube video links so just
copy the URL of this video whatever
video you want to embed and then go to
your Visual Basic project once again and
select this shockwave tool and in here
in the property
search for the property called movie
which is this one and in this property
we are going to paste our link right so
just paste the link of your video inside
this movie property and we need to just
add it this link a little so this HTTP

Basic windows form so now you can play

video anywhere else on the browser you
can just play it and it will run the
same just one thing it requires our
internet connection obviously and it
will just run as it is as a YouTube
