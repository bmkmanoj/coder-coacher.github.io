video I will show you how to use
autocomplete properties with your combo
box and text boxes so let's get started
I will take a combo box from my tool box
and I will take a text box from my tool
box and what I will do is first of all I
will select my text box and I will go to
the property explorer here and I will
search for the property called auto
complete custom source autocomplete mode
and autocomplete source so let's give a
custom source to the text box first so
what I will do is I will select this
property called
autocomplete custom mode and here I will
click this small button and here I can
add custom source for example list of
names so I will add some names here and
okay so I have included four names here
and I will click OK
and then what I need to do is I need to
select what mode I want to choose there
are three mode suggest append and
suggest append both at the same time
first of all I will select this suggest
mode yeah and in the third property I
need to select what is the source type
of my autocomplete so I will select
custom source because I have selected
the custom source from here right so
select this custom source and when I run
the program and when I enter some word
or letter here it will show me the
suggestions here right and this concept
you can utilize for example I want to
show the list of the countries and I
want to see the suggestions okay so we
have selected custom autocomplete mode s
suggest and append
what it will do is it will not show the
suggestion but it will append the name
so for example I write M here that will
append all the other words or all the
other letters of the name here right and
it will not show any suggestions and
when I choose suggestion and append it
will append and suggest suggest both now
for example on a bigger application for
example I want to show or and see the
list of the countries as a custom source
so what I will do is I have the list of
the countries which you can take it from
the internet for free and I will copy
this and I will paste it in my custom
source block okay and this these name I
need to remove and click OK and in
I have once again suggest append so it
will append suggest at the same time and
here I will say I want to search for
let's see what is what country we want
to search Germany so it's when I just
entered GE and it will suggest me all
the suggestion with the letter GE and I
have two options
and it also appends the first suggestion
in my text box and for example I write a
I get all the suggestions and first it
will append the first suggestion in the
text box okay in this way you can use
this custom suggestion second thing you
can choose from here is the auto
complete source as other types for
example file system so when I run the
program once again it will give me when
I enter something it will suggest me the
file system right now there is no file
system right now and for example I want
the all URL complete source or yeah auto
complete source so I will select this
all URL and when I run the program it
will append for for example I will write
MSDN or Google then it will give me all
the options which I have recently
browsed with the URL Google or Microsoft
whatever suggestion it has to offer
so in this way you can use to suggest
URLs also and you can explore all the
kind of suggestions from here recently
used list or all system source and file
some directories and other lists are
there and the same thing you can do it
for your list box also so you can choose
the custom source like that only and
just you can select all the modes from
here and you can choose all the source
from here but one more suggestion or one
more source autocomplete source option
the combo box has is the list item so
when you want to bind the database
options with your combo box you can do
it with this list item book but right
now I haven't shown you how to bind your
database with visual basics so I will
show this option in the future videos so
I hope you have understood how to use
autocomplete just play with this
property and see what's better for you
now I hope you have enjoyed this video
