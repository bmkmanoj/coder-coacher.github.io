tutorial today I'm going to show you how
to use menubar and toolbar in order to
make your program presentable
the first question comes into mind is
what is many value in any software you
can see such kind of a bar so that you
can open new project open new window or
exit the project or the software this is
called menu bar and right below it the
small symbol you can see in a bar and
this bar can think these small symbols
is called tool bar so let's get started
go to your palette pick up and you are
and just place it in your Jeffrey and
then once again go to your helmet and
pick up tool bar and place it in your
jail frame
besides tool bar now this is your menu
bar and this is a tool bar so in order
to make if your menu bar functional just
right click add from palette and click
menu item
so this menu item will be added then
just I leave the name which you want to
appear so that for example I name it as
new and this is the shortcut in this
field you can put the shortcut for
example yeah for opening the project if
you press ctrl shift and o the project
will be open so here also we can do that
just double click it
this window will open just click in
keystroke and press whatever you press
it will be shown here so I press ctrl n
go control new control you will be in
turn here plus ok so new control new now
you can see after new project new file
there is a small line separating new
projecting file and open project this
small window this is called separator we
can add this separator also in order to
make it very presentable so just go to
file right-click go to your palette and
then separator so this small line will
be appeared here once again go to your
file right-click add menu item this time
I print Primos
C or s e here I will
print control on see in order to close
the program so this will appear like
this now if you want to make your
clothes functional just right click it
go to event action action performed and
you will directly go to your source code
what you just need to do is we already
made the close window close method so go
to that the third I think I have made
that close method in login frame I will
show you here
I already shown this in the previous
tutorial so if you don't know how to
write a close method watch my previous
tutorial how to close previous window
and opening the new window this is the
method called close will copy it and
paste it in a employee info Java Pete
and
I just copied it off and for this you
need to import also these two files
while once again copying it and pasting
it here so these error will go
once again closed program is
window.event when closed event is equal
to new window event this comma window
event dot window closing and two will
get dot get default toolkit dot get
system even Q dot host event and in the
brackets right when closing event and
just import these two files and just
copy your method and paste whatever you
have opened event action action
performed here we have previously open
made a method and just paste close here
thanks TIA
and just and calling the close method in
this close action performed in a third
so just let's fight run the program
and you can see your toolbar is appeared
here in your file in which you mean new
and close appears here when I press
close
so I think I did some mistake because
the technician is not taking place let's
see what's the mistake when we click
once again right-click event action
performed right click event action
performed action action performed and we
have to go in the method J menu item X
action performed and I think previously
it went into J menu action performed we
have to go and J menu item action
performed so just copy close here and
just paste here let's now let's see what
would be the result I go I press click
close and it goes on more thing I want
to show you menu bar also you can add
such buttons
just I'm ranked button from palette and
make that into a toolbar and change the
name once again close close and just if
you go to its method by action perform
and just paste the same clothes here
also then you can close your window from
the toolbar also this is the tutorial I
gave about closing using menubar and
toolbar I hope you have enjoyed so
