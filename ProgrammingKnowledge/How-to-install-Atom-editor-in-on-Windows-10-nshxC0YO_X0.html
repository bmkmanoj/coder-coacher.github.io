show you how you can download and
install atom edita on your Windows 10
operating system atom is an open source
text editor which can be used for
developing various programming languages
so it's essentially a text editor but
it's very customizable text editor so
it's really useful for developing you
know modern node.js applications mostly
it's popular for developing web
application but you can develop any kind
of you know application for example C++
Java or any other application also on
this editor now the best thing about
this editor is you can install various
packages in you know item and then you
can customize it to do anything so let's
get started and see how you can install
a tomato so just search for atom and the
first link which will appear here will
be from atom dot IO okay Adam is a
github project so if you know github
then it's the same company which has you
know produced or created Adam okay so
now we are in a DeMeo website you can
directly see this red download button so
just download it and it's not a very
large file so just save it wherever you
want in your computer and just wait for
a download to complete right once the
download is going to complete we are
going to install it so download is
complete now for this atom setup
executable file so just click this
executable file I'm going to minimize
the browser for now so now we can see
that atom installation has been started
and we don't even need to press any next
button for this so it's you know
installation started automatically and
as soon as the installation will
complete
we will be ready to use Adam on our
Windows operating system so just wait
for a few seconds and just wait for the
installation to complete and then
automatically the Adam auditor will you
know launch so Adam has been installed
on my Windows operating system and I can
see it's launched automatically after
the installation and for the first time
when Adam will start it's going to look
like any other text editor you may
encounter but for example lately I have
been using it really you know
extensively for developing my node.js
applications and this is the best thing
about it that you can install different
kind of packages related to you know
JavaScript or node.js or different
programming language and you will be
good to go so let's see how we can you
know install a package in Adam so I can
see on the welcome window that there is
a button called install package right so
when you just open installer you can
just click open installer and it's going
to open this kind of you know package
installer or you can you know just press
ctrl shift P which is also going to open
the same kind of setting editor so I'm
going to let me close everything for now
and we are going to see from the scratch
what happens so right now I don't have
any file open and I'm going to press
ctrl shift P this is going to give me
this kind of you know pop-up window and
in here I can just type install packages
and theme so just click this option and
here you can see there are some featured
packages which you can install or you
can
you know install the packages for
yourself for example I can just search
for packages related to node and it's
going to search for all the packages
related to node for example no debugger
which is really a useful tool whenever
you want to debug node.js and node
resolver you can see and many other
plugins for example I want to search for
JavaScript plug-in so I will just say
Java Script and I'm going to search for
JavaScript plug-in and they are going to
search for JavaScript plugin and we will
see some JavaScript plug-in so I can see
language JavaScript JavaScript language
support in atom and you can see
different kind of you know es6 support
for javascript and let's search for for
example some kind of beautify item
already comes with some beautiful plugin
but let's search for some beautify
plugin which can beautify our code or
it's good for you know code highlighting
so you can see the number one is atom
beautify which is going to you know when
you install it so whenever you want to
install a plugin you just need to click
install and it's going to be installed
and then you can use this plugin so
whenever you want to for example use
this plugin you can right click on your
window and you will be able to see this
option beautify this code using you know
this plugin and if you want to know more
about this atom beautify plugin or any
other plugin just click on it and just
read the readme file so you can see how
it works you will be able to see the
original HTML and after the beautifying
effect the HTML thing so there are many
packages and
many you know themes also if you want to
change the theme of atom you can do it
you know easily so it's a highly
customizable editor which will be
customized according to your needs and I
I mean I have been using it so I want to
recommend it to you also and if you find
it good just use it so I hope you
