Linux command line tutorial for
beginners and in this video we will talk
about bash RC file in Linux and how we
can use it and what is bash RC file so
first of all what is bash RC file the
bash RC file is a script that is
executed whenever a new terminal session
is started in interactive mode right so
first of all for example you open your
terminal and just check whether you are
in your home directory or not by default
you are already in home directory
whenever you open your terminal right
now in here you can just write LS - a
for the listing and you will be able to
see there is a file called dot bash RC
and this is the file which is
responsible whenever you open a new
terminal this file is executed this is a
kind of a script which is executed first
whenever you open a new terminal session
right so let's go inside this dot bash
RC file so you can use Nano to display
the content of this bash RC file so just
write nano dot bash RC and you can go
inside this file and you can see the
content of this file like this or I am
going to just exit by just pressing
control X or you can use the command
called G added so just read G add it and
then dot bash RC write this is also a
kind of GUI editor which is used as an
editor for your you know text file or
any other file right so just write G
edit and dot bash RC and press ENTER and
this is going to open this file in this
kind of GUI editor right
so in some operating system I'm talking
about the Linux operating systems this
bash RC file is already there and some
strips are already there inside this
batch RC file so for example I'm using
this open to operating system and it
already have a bash RC file and it
already have this kind of script inside
this bash RC file right now in some
other kind of call in X operating system
a few days ago I was using for example
Linux Mint it doesn't have this bash RC
file right so anyway if it exists it's
ok and if it doesn't exist you can just
create one for you using this Kadlec G
added command or not no command it
doesn't matter right so now what we were
talking is that this script is executed
whenever you open a new terminal right
so whatever you add to the script it
will be executed first whenever you open
a new terminal session right so just go
at the end of this file and if you
create a new bed dot bash RC file it's
ok just go at the end or if you have a
new just right there just right for
example echo and then in double quotes
this is a test right so just write this
command here you already know what is
echo command right and then just close
this pressure on C file ok and now we
are going to open a new terminal session
and this terminal session I can open
from here just go to file and then you
can just say open tab or you can just
press control shift T to open the new
tab you can see the new tab is open so
this is first tab we were in and this is
a new tab we have created and as soon as
we have created this new tab this text
we have written in the bash RC file is
executed right so this is a test and
this was we have a written echo command
for this right so using this we know
that this bash RC file is called first
because it's executing our echo command
also and then your you know your normal
terminal operation you can do right once
again we can add it the bash RC content
so I'm going to just go to the gadget
command so get G added dot bash RC and
this time instead of echoing something I
can use some aliases for example right
so for example what I can do here is
instead of echoing I can do a layer so
just write LS LS is equal to for example
we want to do the long listing and the
color also so LS minus minus gala is
equal to auto and then we will say -
he'll also we want to do that long
listing also right and I will save the
content then I will close this and once
again I can just close this tab and open
the new tab this time I will go here and
then click open tab and now whenever I
do LS and press Enter is going to do the
long listing with the color options for
me right so in this way you can
customize your bash RC file mostly we
use this bash RC file for a number of
things for example if you want to set up
the environment variables whenever for
example you install Java you need to set
up the Java home environment variable
and this can be done using this bash RC
file right or whenever you want to use
git and you want to see which you know
repository you have
checked in or you have flown you can
write the script for this and then you
will be able to see in the terminal
itself which you know version or which
you know get script get repository you
have right so for this batch RC file is
really useful so I hope you understood
the basic concept of dot bash RC file I
hope you enjoyed this video please rate
