tutorial on Java programming for
beginners in the last video we have seen
what is a class and how we can declare a
class and how we can declare an instance
of a class and use them now in this
video we will see how to use a class
constructor and what is a class
constructor so first of all we will
start our tutorial by making a new class
so I will go to my package and I will
right click and go to new and I will
create a class and I will name my class
as cube by this cube class I'm going to
you know cat or I'm going to calculate
the volume of for cube using different
length breadth and height so I'm going
to declare three variables in length and
breadth and int height so that I can
calculate the volume using all these
three variables and then I will declare
a method which will return int and I
will name it as cat cube volume and this
will take nothing else parameter and
what this method will do is I'm going to
just return the length of the product of
length into breadth multiplied by height
okay so this is the volume of the cube
right length into breadth into height
okay
and this was get cube volume right so
I have declared this class now I'm going
to initialize an instance of the class
so I will create a cube and I will name
my cube instance as cube 1 is equal to
new cube right and this cube with the
round bracket is called the constructor
of your cube class and the most basic
property of constructor is even if you
don't define a constructor Java will
create a default constructor for you
whenever you create a class so we
haven't created this constructor method
explicitly anywhere here in our class
but this is default constructor which is
provided by Java for us and we can also
define a constructor for us and the
constructor name is always same as
exactly the same as that last name so
for defining a constructor
you can just write cube and it for
default constructor I'm not going to
pass any values right now but it can
take values ok our parameters so here
you can provide parameters as you can do
it with the method but the most
important property of constructor is it
has the same name as class and it never
returns any value so constructor never
returns any value so you cannot return
like this in constructor okay now what
I'm going to do is this constructor let
me print something so this oh and I'm
going to print we are
in constructor ok and in our main class
in our main method we have just defined
the instance of this cube class and
nothing else and when we run the program
it prints we are in constructor that
means whenever you create an instance of
a class
the first method which is called or
which is initialized is the constructor
of the class ok so you can define a
constructor and if you want to
initialize something you can do it with
the constructor because it's the first
method which will be executed right so
constructors are generally used to
initialize values in a class so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to initialize
some value like length is equal to ten
variable web breadth is equal to for
example 20 and variable height is equal
to 30 for example okay so this is the
default constructor we have defined and
in here we have defined the value of
length breadth and height so that if
user even don't initialize this length
breadth and height we are going to
initialize or Java will initialize this
value for us using this default
constructor so now what we can do is we
have initialized the instance of the
constructor and using this constructor
we can print or we can call get queue
volume method ok so not here but here
cube which is the instance of this cube
class dot get cube volume
and this will return us the product of
10 into 20 in 200 which we have
initialized these values as right now
you can provide multiple constructors of
constructor overloading to the class so
you can provide this constructor which
we can consider as default constructor
and in here we are going to provide
three parameter int L comma int B comma
int H okay and this parameter will pass
to our length breadth and height okay
so this is called constructor
overloading so we can define two
constructor at the same time both with
different pair of arguments and this we
will call it as default constructor and
whenever you want to provide some values
by yourself you can use this constructor
right so what we are going to do is we
are going to define second instance of
cube class cube cube - which is second
instance is equal to new cube right and
now we can just call the same method gap
cube volume but using cube to instance
and here we will define length breadth
and height for example 20 comma 20 comma
20 okay so Java is intelligent enough to
understand that this constructor is this
one and whenever you don't provide any
argument whenever you hover over your
constructor and just
we'll click it and we'll go to the
default constructor here right so now
when we run the program one will give us
the product of these values 10 into 20
into 30 with just 6,000 and other will
give us the value of our product of
these value 20 into 20 into 20 which is
8,000 so we can define multiple
constructor with different arguments as
we require with our class ok so this is
all about constructor I think and once
again I'm going to review what our
constructor constructor are the member
method in a class which have the same
name as your class exactly the same
constructor never returns a new value
constructor can take parameter or they
cannot I mean you can it's totally on
you if you want to provide any parameter
to a constructor or not you can define
multiple constructor and use them with
the class so I have defined constructor
with no parameter so I can define it
like this and I have defined a
constructor with 3 parameter length
breadth and height so I can define it by
like this ok so in this way you can
declare and use constructor in Java I
