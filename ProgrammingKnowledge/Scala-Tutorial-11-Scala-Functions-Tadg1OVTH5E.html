Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how to use
functions in Scala now first of all what
is a function a function is a group of
statements that perform a particular
task now how do you know that you need a
function in your program now if for
example a particular piece of code is
repeating again and again in your
program most probably you have to
consider in closing that piece of code
which is repeating into a function now
how we declare a function over what is
the basic syntax of a function so a
function start from this keyword def and
then you give a function name and then
in these parentheses first of all you
provide the argument so argument and
then you provide a data type of that
argument for example int or string or
whatever data type that argument have
right and then coma and then the next
argument and then colon the data type of
the next argument right and then you
just give the school in here and then
you'd give the data type of whatever you
are returning or whatever you want to
return from your function let's say it
returns int value so you write the data
type whatever the function is returning
right and then equals and then these
curly brackets in which you write some
statement so let's say we want to add
two numbers using a function so I just
give a name add to this function which
takes two numbers so x and y are two
numbers and they are of data type
integer right now the result will be
returned in the form of integer that's
why the data type of result is also
integer and what we can do we can just
write return and then X plus y here so
this is a very simple function which
adds to number and returns the result
and how you can call that function for
example I want to print the result of
that ad function I can just write print
Ln and then inside that println I can
just call this function for example ad
and then I will just write 45 comma 15
let's say okay and let me run the code
that's going to give us the result which
is 60 the addition of these two numbers
now Scala is very flexible language and
it allows us to declare a function in
different ways so this is one of the way
in which you can declare a function let
me show you the other way so let me copy
this function and let's just copy and
paste two or three times because I want
to show you this thing in two or three
ways so let's say I'm going to use a
function called subtract and I'm going
to use a function multiply and let's say
I want to use a function divide okay
every function takes two argument of
type integer now as I said Scala is
really flexible so you can avoid writing
this return keyword Y you can avoid
writing this keyword because whatever is
the last line of your function this will
be considered as a return value
automatically if you don't write a
return keyword so here you have a choice
of writing this keyword return or you
can just write it something like this
and avoid writing this keyword return
and the last line of your function is
considered to be our return value so in
this case we only have one line so it
will be considered as a return value and
here we want to do that subtraction now
let's say we have a function which is
very short and we want to write it in
one
so we can avoid writing this curly
braket so we can just write this and
award adding these curly brackets so
something like this and here you can
just write Asterix to multiply and here
you can even remove this return keyword
which makes your function more short
right now let's make this divided
function also the same so I'm going to
remove these curly brackets from here
and then I'm going to also remove the
return keyword and then I will add this
forward slash to divide X by Z now in
cases where Scala is certain that it's
going to return a certain type of value
certain data type of value then you can
avoid writing the return data type also
so for example we are certain that this
divide function is only going to return
an integer we can avoid writing this
return value and then we can even remove
this semicolon okay so that makes our
function more shorter and concise so
these are the four basic ways of writing
a function in Scala and now let's call
all these functions so I'm going to just
call the subtract function here and then
multiply function here and then divide
function here and let's see what's the
result we get so you can see these are
the result we get from these functions
now let's say we create an object so I'm
going to just create an object at the
tall let's say we have object we declare
our object and the object name is Matt
in which I want to just include all the
math functions right and let's say we
have this add function inside this math
object so I'm going to just copy this
add function and paste it inside the
math function now how I can use this add
function from this math object
so it's really a simple once again so I
can just write print line and then I can
just write math which is the object name
thought the function name which is ad
and then the argument which it takes for
so for example 45 comma 15 and then just
close the print line parentheses okay so
because it's an object we don't need to
create a new instance of this object
right so if it's a class we need to
create an instance of this object with a
new keyword but because it's an object
we can directly use dot operation on
this object and then call the function
which is inside that math object so let
me run the code once again it's going to
print the value of that function once
again now let's say I have a function
let me declare a function so def Square
and this function only takes one
argument so let's say it takes one
argument of type int and it returns the
value so it will return equals X
multiplied by X which is X square okay
so the function which only takes one
argument we can use the syntactical
sugar with these functions so for
example let me just copy and paste this
here and then this square function here
so math dot Square and let's say we just
give three here as an argument we can
use it something like this so it's going
to give us the square of three you can
see like this
or you can use this notation so math
space and then square space and then
whatever you want to give as an argument
so this is also a valid operation right
so if the function has only one argument
you can write it something like this so
math space square
space whatever the argument is and it
will work perfectly fine you can see it
works perfectly fine so this is the
syntactical sugar which Scala provides
you if you have a single argument
function this type of functionality we
have seen in the for loop also where you
have provided the range so for example
you have provided the range between for
example 1 to 10 in for loop right or one
until 10 for example so this is the same
syntactical sugar which we have used in
the for loop in order to provide the
range right so because that two method
takes one argument you can see the
signature of this argument it only takes
one argument that's why we can use these
functions like this ok so this is how
you can use functions in Scala I want to
teach you more about functions in the
next video so stay tuned and please rate
