tutorial on Python programming for
beginners and in this video I am going
to give you a introduction to Python and
how you can download and install Python
on your Windows operating system so
let's get started so python is widely
used general-purpose high-level language
and its design philosophy emphasizes
code readability and its syntax allows
programmers to express concept in fewer
lines of code then would be possible in
language such as C so let me give you a
little overview of Python first so
python is a scripting language and it
includes object-oriented concepts also
and it's a portable and very powerful
language and it's often called a
programming language for beginners
because it's really easy to learn Python
and it's really easy to implement if you
have little codes or a little concept if
you want to implement very fast you can
use Python to implement them and it has
mixed features like programming
languages like Java and Perl
screams and what are the uses of Python
it can be used to make system utilities
it can be used to make gooeys gooeys
stands for graphical user interface and
there are some ID es which you can use
of which there are some platform which
you can use to create GUI so this these
are some of the platform on which you
can make GUI application for example QT
platform or Windows platform on cpk
platform you can make
interactive gooeys using Python you can
also use Python to make internet
scripting as a internet a scripting
language and you can also use Python as
a embedded scripting language even you
can use Python as a data bits
programming language artificial
intelligence and image processing
so there are widely used
you know implementations of Python and
you can use Python in many you know many
fields so it's very good idea to learn
Python and it's really easy to learn
Python that's why you can you know learn
Python if you are a beginner in
programming ok so let's see how we can
install Python on our Windows operating
system so just open your favorite
browser and search for Python and the
first link here you will find is
www.hyken.com just click here and in
here you will be able to see the
overview of python by browsing these
tabs but the tab we are interested in
right now is this download tab and in
here there are two versions one is the
very latest version and one was a little
bit slightly older version but very
stable version also what we are going to
do is we are going to download this
latest version so I'm going to just
click this download button and download
this Python 3.4 point one at the time of
making this video this is the latest
version and once this download is
complete we will be able to install
Python on our system so now I'll
download
is complete I will just run this and
it's preparing to install and this is
the first option or first wizard with
Python setup wizard you will be able to
see and for now I just want to use
install for all users and I will click
Next and in here this is the default
location where Python will be installed
and this is the name of the folder
because it's 3 version 3.4 so the folder
name will be Python 3 4 ok just click
Next and then these are all the
utilities which will be installed if you
want to customize you can customize it
but I will leave it them as default and
I will click Next and this installation
will start and saying that it will take
several minutes to install python so you
need to wait until it process is going
on and once the process completes I will
go through the next steps so let's wait
for some time and I will pause the video
for now so while this process is going
on I will give you brief of compilation
in how this Python language interprets
or compiled itself ok so if you have
learned any other languages like C C++
or Java you know that this language is a
compiled you know first you need to
compile this file like Java or some
other program and then once you compile
your program it will produce our
executable file and then you can run
this executable file and you will be
able to see this kinds of kind of a
result but Python is
interpreted language that means you
don't need to compile your Python
program because it's a interpreted
language it will directly you or you
will be able to run directly your
program and it is a runtime compliation
it will do so if any error occurs it you
will be able to see them only at runtime
okay so there is no need to compile or
there is no feature to compile your code
in Python it will just execute your
program directly so this is the little
difference between the programming
languages like Java C or C++ that in
those languages you need to compile your
program but in Python instead it's an
interpreted language so you don't need
to compile this it will be executed at
runtime okay now our installation is
finished so I will just click finish now
once your installation is complete you
will be able to go to your Start menu
here and you will be able to see Python
in these options otherwise you can go to
all programs and in here you will be
able to see python and whatever version
you have downloaded for python so i can
see this folder called python dot -
space 3.4 which is a version for python
i have installed and when i click this
folder i can see a few files here so
there is something called python command
line and i will click this first python
command line first and this is a command
line tool which you can use to execute
your python scripting language or python
programs right so for example i want to
execute
something here what I can do I can just
print something so I will write print
and in the brackets in the earlier
version before three or before Version
three you don't need to give these
brackets to execute your message but
after version three you need to use
these brackets in order to print your
message like using print function so
print is a built-in function to print
your string or whatever you write in
these brackets so I will just use double
quotes and I will write hello hello
world and when I press ENTER that will
give me hello world right so there are
something you will notice when I have
printed hello world that first you don't
need any semicolon or any ending ending
declaration in Python so if you have or
if you are used to some languages like C
C++ or Java you know that you need to
end your line using semicolons right but
in in your a Python program you don't
need to use semicolons here and the
other thing I have already told you that
you don't need to compile your program
you just hit enter and it will run your
program right so this is a command line
tool the same functionality you can use
a GUI tool also to write the program so
if you want to develop your program
using command line you can use this
Python command line I will just close it
for now and I can even use or Python
even provides a GUI which is
idle to program a Python so I will just
go to this folder once again and I will
click this idle Python GUI and it will
open the same shell command but it's
more interactive and you will be able to
see the same Oh same command line
structure here now for starting because
I think these fonts are little bit
smaller so I can make them bigger by
going into the option configure idle and
in here I can change the font size of my
shell right so for example I want to
increase it to 16 so that I can see
better and you can also see better let's
make it to 18 even so you will be able
to see more better okay so once this is
done in here
also you can just write print and in the
brackets you can just give your message
for example hello world and whenever I
have or when I write this you will be
able to see different colors for
different you know structure so because
a print is a function it will be
highlighted in different color and hello
world is a string so it will be
highlighted in green color for example
so this in this way you can read the
program in a better way and this is why
we generally use this Python GUI or
which is called idle to program ok and I
press ENTER and gives me once again the
result hello world why
now I think this that's it for this
video in the next video I am going to
show you how to use other features of
Python so stay tuned and please wait
them and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
