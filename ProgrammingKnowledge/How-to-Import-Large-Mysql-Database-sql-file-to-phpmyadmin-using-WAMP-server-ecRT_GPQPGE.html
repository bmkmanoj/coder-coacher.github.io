show you how you can import a large SQL
database on your PHP myadmin
which is running on your web server so
let me show you what problems you may
encounter while importing and then I
will show you the solution how you can
import a large database so for example I
have a database which is code bind dot
SQL for example and it's around 250
megabytes and I want to import this
database in this PHP myadmin MySQL
database using this web server so one
option I can see here is this import
option so I can just select my MySQL
database and then I can just go to this
import tab and I can select this SQL
database which is this one select it and
then when I click go here it's going to
work on it and it says you probably
tried to upload a file that is too large
please refer to the documentation now
some people may suggest you that you
need to change the php.ini file and you
need to change the limits of mysql
database in PHP my ini file which is
this one but I will show you the more
easier way of doing it so what you need
to do is you need to go to once again
ramp server icon here and in here go to
MySQL and in MySQL you need to select
MySQL console so we are going to open my
SQL console and in here my password is
by default no password so I will just
press ENTER and in here you need to give
the name of your database which you want
to use for example I want to use a
database called code bind which is this
one you can see here so I will just say
you
good mind at that press Enter
so it will switch this database to the
code bind so code bind is my current
database in which I am working right so
this is for switching the database now
to import your database you just need to
write source and the source of your SQL
file so you can just go here and copy
the part from here or you can directly
type your path here so source and then
give the path here and keep in mind that
instead of using these back slashes here
you need to use these forward slashes
okay so just give these forward slashes
something like this and at last the name
of your database file in my case it's
code bind dot SQL so just write code
bind dot as QL okay so source and the
path to your database and the database
name right and press Enter and now it
will you know start the process of
importing the database into your MySQL
database and when it's finished then
your data will be imported in your
database so let this process to complete
and then once again check your database
again so now the process is complete you
can see every you know document or data
is imported and then you can just go to
your database and then see the data
which is imported here so in this way
you can import a large data in your PHP
my admin in your ramp so I hope you
