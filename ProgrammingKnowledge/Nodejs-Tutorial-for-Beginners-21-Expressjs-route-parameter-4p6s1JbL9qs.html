no jest toll for beginners and in this
video we will learn how we can pass
parametres and parse parameters in url
routes using Express so in the last
video we have seen how we can you know
pass these kind of route and you know
whenever you ask or whenever you give
this kind of URL for example your IP
address and port and then whatever route
you give according to this you know you
see the response right but for example
you want to give the dynamic route so
for example you have some database right
now we don't have database but in the
future you will be using a database and
you wanted to you know query the
database so you want to want to pass
some parameter for example you have the
student database and you want the
student data using his ID or his roll
number or any other thing for example
right so how we can pass parameters in
the URL you will see in this video using
Express so what we do is we are going to
I'm just going to copy the code which
I've written the last video for this so
just copy and paste the same code but
instead of this route for example you
want a student route so I'm just going
to write students here and then we want
to get the student according to the ID
which is given in the URL okay so
whenever you want to pass any parameter
you give this coulomb before the
parameter name okay so just gave the :
this kind of : and then any you know ID
or name whatever you want to give so you
can give for example name
here or so name or age anything whatever
parameter you want to pass and we will
be able to pass that parameter and then
according to this we can give the
response so for example you want to just
pass this ID 1 which is passed using the
URL route okay so in the response for
example I am going to write that you
have rested to see the student ID and
then I'm going to just give the ID now
in order to pass this ID we need to take
this request and then dot param and then
the name of the ID for example ID itself
okay and let's save the code my node is
running using the node Mon so I don't
need to rerun it and I'm going to just
go to the browser and here I'm going to
just give student and then the student
ID for example 12 right and you can see
I think it's students not student so I
must give you a student sprout and you
can see it gives me the response you
have requested to see the student ID 12
because I have passed 12 here right I
can pass any number here and it will
give me that number right so once again
any number and I can see this number
here right in the same way I can pass
the name also so instead of ID I can use
name and here also name and here also
name right so name name and must write
name here and must save my code and then
refresh my page using some names for
example mark and then refresh and now it
says you have requested
to see student named mark now if you
will be using some kind of a database
then you can you know take this name
which is passed using the URL and then
you can query the database on the basis
of this name and then you can give your
response so we will take a little
example for example we have a JSON you
know data so I'm going to just write for
example you are students and then this
is a JSON so we have a student data
Jason and then I'm going to just write
one and one is so rule number one or ID
one so ID one is marked for example then
ID - is Tom and then ID three is for
example John okay and then I'm going to
just replace here name with ID and here
also ID and here also ID right but we
want to you know reply on the basis of
the ID requested we want to give the
name right so here I will write name and
the way you can do this is you can just
take the students because it's it's a
kind of an associative array you can
take the student and then using square
bracket you can you know get the value
on the basis of key passed here right so
I'm going to save it and then I'm going
to refresh it and I'm going to just give
the ID one for example right it's going
to give me mark right because in our
Jason we have the name mark as ID one
right for example - it gives me Tom and
then for example I pass three it gives
me John right so in this way you can
pass parameters
as a URL routing in Express and that's
it for this video in the next video I am
going to give you some more insights
about Express or stay tuned and please
recommend subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
