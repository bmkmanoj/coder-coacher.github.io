tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video we will see how
to use wrap content and fill parent
properties with your layout width of
your widgets and we will also see if
time permits how to use a password field
in Android activity so for example I
will take a button here and for the
first time when you are drag and drop a
button it's a property layout property
when I say property in here when you go
to the property called layout colon
width its property is set to a wrap
content and wrap content just mean that
the component just want to display big
enough to enclose its content only okay
so it's button content is only button
and the button size or width is enough
to show the button text on this button
right in the same way the layout height
is also a wrap content here okay so the
height is also enough to show the button
content okay but whenever you change
this layout width for example I am going
to change it to fill parent see what
happens it fills all the width of your
activity here right so the fill parent
method the component or in the fill
parent method the component want to
display as big as it its parent and the
parent is activity here right and fills
the remaining space right so whenever
you change the layout width to
Phil parent it fills all the all the
space in the parent okay and parent is
the activity now I will change it to
wrap content itself and now I'm going to
change the layout height of this button
to fill parent and now whenever you do
this for layout hide it fills all the
hide right all the space which is
available in the height of the parent
right and when you do fill parent for
both it will fill all the space of your
parent okay so these are some of the
properties related to the layout height
and layout width and whenever you for
example I will just change it to M wrap
content both of the width and height and
then I will just change a to match
parent and then also it will match the
parent space also okay and I can do
match parent in layout height and it
will cover the whole height or space in
the parent okay so this is how you can
resize your or you can adjust the layout
width and layout height of your widget
okay now let's see how to use how to use
a password field in Android activity so
what we are going to do is we are going
to drag and drop this password in text
field widgets so go to the text field
category here and drag and drop this
password category okay part password
text field from here and I'm going to
drag and drop this and this
here I'm going to give the width as fill
parent okay so it fills the parent okay
and now this password whenever I run the
activity here always comes the you know
it hides the characters and it only
shows the specific character which you
want to display okay
so when I run this app on an emulator
you can see whenever I want to enter
some text in this password text field
you see it's every character is replaced
by this dot okay now we will use this
button to show whatever we have entered
in the password field so what we are
going to do is we are going to go to our
main activity here so in the project I
am going to go to main activity dot Java
file and in here in the main activity
itself I am going to declare two
variables one is private added text
added text and I will name it as for
example pass for password or pass
underscore word okay and in the same way
I will declare a private button
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a method so that on button click
event this method is called and then we
are going to display this text so what
we are going to do is we are going to
declare a public void and we name it
this method as add listener on button
button okay and we are not going to pass
any argument to this and then inside
this method
what are we are going to do is we are
going to cast these password and button
fields
you
so because the name of our button or ID
of our button is button itself and added
text is a text itself button and added
text that's why I have used added text
in word buttons here okay now what we
are going to do is we are going to take
this button and in here this button and
then we are going to add a listener to
this button so button and then dot set
on click listener on click listener and
then inside this listener we are going
to create on click listener okay so we
will create a new instance of on click
listener new on click listener and then
in here when you click a click enter
it's going to create a method so let's
let me readjust the code a little bit
now inside your on click method here you
can display a message now to display a
message in Android you need to import a
library called toast and toast is a
library which we can use to show
messages so an Android messages are
called toasts okay so we will import
now once you imported this library we
can display the message using toast
inside this on click event so to display
a message you just need to write toast
dot make text and inside this make test
the text you can display a message okay
so what you can do here is you just need
to give the name of your activity which
is in our case it's main activity so we
will pass this as a first argument dot
this and the second argument we are
going to pass is the password field
which we are going to take so this is
our password variable
in this we are going to give the show
method so just go outside the make text
method and just write dot show okay and
this will show this text message
whatever we have entered in the password
field okay so this is also one kind of a
button listener we have made indirectly
and this button lives now we can add
this method to our on create method here
like this and then your activity will
listen for this button click event right
so now we are going to run this and once
this runs we are going to see how we can
display a message using this text field
so our app is running now and we are
going to enter some text here as a
password for example YouTube okay and I
will click OK and when I press the
button it shows the message YouTube and
it disappears after some time okay for
example I can enter some other text
programming knowledge and I will click
the button and it shows this message
programming knowledge okay so in this
way you can use password field and toast
which we which is a short form of
messages in Android using this Java code
