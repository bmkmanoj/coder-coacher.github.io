bootstrap tutorial for beginners in the
last video we have seen how to use
buttons in bootstrap now in this video
we will see how we can add staked column
using grid system in our bootstrap page
so for example you want to add some
articles here in your web page which are
horizontally stacked how we can do it
let's see so I'm going to go to my code
here and in the previous video I have
shown you how you can add this container
and inside this container I have this
Jumbotron div element so I will go
inside this container and just below
this Jumbotron develoment I'm going to
create a new div element div and I'm
going to add a class which is row ok and
I'm going to close this div now inside
this row dev element
I'm going to create one more development
for the column so just I will paste one
more div element and this time this is
for columns so for column we add first
of all co L and then the size for
example MD and then the number of
columns for example you want to use four
columns then we gave four here okay and
inside my column dev element I'm going
to add a h3 tag and in here I will write
head one for example for heading 1 and
just below this h3 tag I'm going to add
a paragraph for example something like
this and I'm going to save this and I'm
going to run it on my web page and it
will look like this ok and in the same
way you can add multiple columns inside
your room right so this is our first
column which has the column width of
for or you can say it's covering four
columns right and if you remember in the
video in which I have shown you how to
use grid system I have told you at that
maximum you can have twelve column
inside a row right so for we have
already covered so we can add eight more
so I'm going to copy this column div
element inside the row and just paste it
below my column element three times okay
and save it and then I will refresh my
webpage and what it's going to do is
it's going to add these three staked
column right now when I resize this so
just observe and I resize it when it
goes to medium it you know this
horizontal columns stakes to vertical
columns right so because we have given
Co L minus MD here M distant from medium
so whenever your browser size is medium
it's going to stake vertically right so
if you can see here this is you can say
it's a large you know browser size and
then when it goes to medium size like
here then your columns are stacked
vertically right now if you want to
stack this column when this browser size
will be small for example something like
this then what you can do is instead of
MD you can add SM and SM stands for
small okay so SM SM and SM and just save
it and I'm going to refresh my web page
once again and what I'm going to do is
once again I'm going to shrink my
browser and you see at the medium-sized
browser it still staked horizontally
right but when we shrink towards the
smaller size then it will stake
vertically right so medium you use
whenever you want to stack vertically at
the medium-sized and small you use
whenever you want to stake at the small
size right so one more thing which is
remaining here is you can add some
button to this column just before below
your paragraph here so I'm going to just
go below my paragraph and in here I can
add this button of type button but this
will be for example danger right so you
can perform some action with this button
okay so here yeah and yeah and I'm going
to save it and refresh my webpage and
it's going to add this button so when
our browser is of large size it will
look like this and this will look nice
so in this way you can add staked
columns in your bootstrap web page I
