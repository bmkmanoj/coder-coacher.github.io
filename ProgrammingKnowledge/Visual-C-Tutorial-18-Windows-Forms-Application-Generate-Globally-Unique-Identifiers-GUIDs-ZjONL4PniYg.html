last video I have shown you how to
delete your data from the database in
this video I will show you something new
this time I will show you how to
generate a globally unique identifier
with the help of your visual C++ and
windows form application first question
comes into mind is what this globally
unique identifier or GUI ID so we will
see we will go to the Wikipedia search
and we can see that globally unique
identifier is a unique reference number
used as an identifier in computer
science so GU ID is a unique number or
unique hexadecimal string or exit
decimal digits which is unique so nobody
has the same copy of GID as you have so
that's why it's globally unique
sometimes it's required in the program
to generate a GU ID for example in the
database you want to give employee a
unique ID which is only belongs to the
particular employee so you can see in
the table and you can provide one unique
ID to your employee also so that's one
of its uses you can think of your own
use so now I will show you how to
generate
that unique I'll you so sub first take a
button here and I will name it as in the
property text I will change the name and
it matters JY d for globally unique
identifier and change the name also geo
ID okay so this button text edge has
changed now double click this button in
order to go to its function
oh but me take event and in here we will
write our code so write system then this
double colon string then this cap sign
and now write new geo ID so we named
string variable as new gyd which is
globally unique identifier is equal to
system double quotes
0i d BB goats new GUI d dot - strength
like a term like a close so what it will
do is every time you press the button it
will generate a new GUI D and place it
into this string variable now how to see
that so for example we want to see the
OID in the message box so right message
box and just copy this string variable
and place it here so it will show in the
message box your new GUI D so these are
the two lines which is already short
code but very useful code so let's try
and run it it really generates a new geo
ID or not it has some error
let's see what's there so here is the
error I forgot to write this bracket so
write this system double quote string
cap new GUI D is equal to system double
quote gyd
double quote new gyd this bracket and
then to string and now let's try and run
the program once again
and now it runs so username/password
it's correct and when I press this
button globally unique identifier it
will be generated which is this and this
is unique for you so nobody can copy
nobody has the same copy of this these
digits that's why it's special but you
can see sometimes you don't want these
dashes in between the GU ID you want the
GU ID as a whole and because this is a
hexadecimal number so you want these
letter to be capital letter F BC because
generally the hexadecimal number are
represented in capital so now what we do
is we will replace this minus sign or -
symbol in between this hexadecimal code
and we will make our letter in uppercase
so let's see how can we do that so go to
your code once again and here what you
need to write is
so right after your string to string
right this arrow and right replace
bracket and in the bracket right double
quote come on double quote and in the
first double quote you have to write the
symbol which you want to replace so we
want to replace this - sign and in the
second double quote you will write the
symbol you want to replace with this so
I don't want to replace I don't want to
place any new character in place of this
- so I write nothing I'll leave it like
double quote with no space and now I
want to make my string in uppercase so
right arrow pointer and then right - up
and let me change my string into
uppercase this will this will replace my
- symbol with nothing and this will make
my string into uppercase so let's try
and run our code once again
username password and okay
and now when I click this let's see what
happens you see all the letters are all
the bits or bytes of this word is
capital hexadecimal word is capital and
the - or - symbol in between is gone so
this is your final result which you can
use in the database or wherever you want
so I hope you have learned something new
this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
