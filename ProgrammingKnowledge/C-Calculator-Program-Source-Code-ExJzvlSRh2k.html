to make a calculator program in C++ so
first of all I will show you what I'm
going to do in my program so I'm going
to print the string
welcome to the calculator program
whatever version you want to give
written by your name and this stars
which is under the line and then I'm
going to ask the user please enter the
operation which you like to calculate
for example plus minus multiplication
division or s where S stand for swap so
when I enter any operation for example
plus and press enter then the program
will ask please enter two number to
apply your request operation and
whatever is your operation so I entered
plus so here it will print class and it
will ask for first number so I will
enter first number as 6 for example and
press enter and then it will last second
number and 78 and then I press enter and
then it will show the addition of two
number six and 78 is 84 so in the same
way I am going to do subtraction
multiplication division and swap so
let's get started so first of all you
have to include your standard wires
which is include IAO stream and include
math C math okay then you have to write
using namespace STD then write int main
which is your main method then in the
main method you should first of all
define your variable so first variable
we are defining is number one and number
two which are our two numbers which is
of double type and the operation
variable which is of character type okay
then we are going to print your name or
your tagline on the screen so write C
out welcome in the double quotes right
welcome to the calculator program
version 1 written by your name and do
the end line so it will change the line
and then write C out in double quotes so
many stars so that will look like a line
okay and then end line and once again C
out in line and line and line so it will
shift your cursor
three lines below then we are going to
receive the variable from input so right
see out in double quotes
please enter an operation which you like
to calculate in bracket plus minus star
division or swap and then semicolon and
below write C out double goes S stand
for swap because this line is not
completed so we have to take the rest of
the line in the next line then we are
going to input our operation this
operation stand for plus minus
multiplication division whatever you
want to enter so write C in operation
close semicolon and then we are going to
shift our cursor by two lines and then
we will write C out please enter two
number to apply apply your requested
operation and whatever your operation is
your operation name is operation because
this is the variable name we have taken
so right seat out and then this to
greater than greater than sign and this
will print your operation which you have
chosen and then end line greater than
greater than
first number so it will ask for the
first number to input and write C in
number one so it will ask to input the
number one after that right second
number and seed input so it will ask for
the second number and then end line so
it will ship the Kherson and yeah we are
going to use switch function so that
operator can be decided or operation can
be decided and make a switch case and in
switch brackets you have to write
operation this is the same variable name
we have declared here when the switch
write operation then curly braces and in
case + and don't forget when you want to
enter spring as a case this character as
a case you have to enclose it in a
single quote this single quote so case
one see out the addition of two number
whatever your numbers are number one and
number two
and yours business
and then see out number one plus number
twos in this we add your two number and
then change the line and after that
write break so do after doing the plus
operation it will break your switch
operation and go to the end in the same
way when you enter - we go into the -
case and it will show the subsection of
two number whatever number you have
entered is number one - number two and
it will make your operation same way for
multiplication see out well tip location
of - number number one and number two
number one into number two and break
then in the case of division we'll do
the division of two number this and this
because when you divide an above and
zero it's infinity and we don't want
that
so if number two is equal to zero this
is a condition we have been if number
two is zero then we should print out
invalid input or not valid and or in the
else condition we should divide the
numbers okay then break and in the fifth
case we are swapping the number so the
out swap of two numbers one and two
there's the swap function play using
swap in the bracket number one number
two settles
number one become will go to the place
of number two number two will go to the
place of number one and then see out
first number number one and the second
number number two so it will swap and
then we shift to lines and if nothing of
the five variable is not enter then it
will show unknown command as default of
switch-case ola right default : see out
unknown come on and complete your switch
curly braces and then after that you
should write system pause because I am
using Visual Studio it need system pause
in order to cause your screen whenever
you are for example this screen will go
immediately if you don't write system
pause so write system pause and because
we have declared into main so we have to
return something so we are returning
zero and complete your braces so this
completes of program and let's once
again run our programs how it looks it
will of looks like this welcome to the
calculator program it will show your
name please enter the operation you want
to perform so this time I will want to
perform division and I have like the
first number as 5 and second number I
deliberately enter 0 so it
be the wrong conditions it should show
us invalid input so the division of to
number not valid it shows not valid
because the / answer is infinity so this
is the calculated program I hope you
have learned something from it so thanks
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
