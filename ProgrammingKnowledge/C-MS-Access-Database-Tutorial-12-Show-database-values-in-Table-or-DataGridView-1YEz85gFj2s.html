video I am going to show you how you can
connect your Microsoft Access database
with the dot up grid-view or table in
c-sharp so suppose you want to fetch all
the values from the database and you
want to show it in your windows form
application in the form of a table how
can you do it I will show you in this
video so I will go to the toolbox and I
will drag and drop this tool called data
grid view which will hold our value in
our in the tabular form right and then I
will go to the tool box and I will drag
and drop a button here this button will
help us to load the table right then I
will change the name of this button as
BTN underscore load table for example
and I will also change the text of this
button as load table ok now what I am
going to do is I will just double click
this button and what this button will do
is it will load the data in the table
right I will double click this button
and I will use the skeleton of the code
I have been using in this last videos
which is this one and I will also
explain this pole briefly and if you
don't still understand this code just
watch the last videos ok so in this code
what I am doing is I am writing the
try-catch block which will catch any
exception or error for any exception or
ever occur during the execution of this
database connection and database command
code and in the first line of this trial
block I am opening the connection with
the database and this connection is a
whole oledb connection object which we
have created in the last videos right
and then in the next line we prepare our
command so we declare
object of oledb command and this is our
command object and then we give this
command the connection so this
connection is given to this command and
in the next line we prepare our query
right now it's blank but we will make
our query in a moment and then we pass
our query to this command right now in
in the last line whenever you open the
board or open the connection with the
database you need to close it and in
between I will write the code to connect
this database to data grid view so let's
see how we can do it so what we need for
connecting the database value to the
data grid view is oledb adopter which
will help us to fill the data grid view
so i will write well it DB dot adopter
and i will name it there da for example
is equal to new oledb dot adopter and as
an argument of this well EDB adopter
constructor i will just pass my command
object here which is this one right ok
now in the next line what I am going to
do is I will declare a data table
so I will write dot table and I will
name this object F DT is equal to new
data table ok
and this starter table we will fill it
with the values or this data adopter so
we write first of all this data adopter
dot here
and then we will pass this DT or dot
table objection okay and then in the
next line what we are going to do is we
will just copy the name of our data grid
view which is start a gridview 1 then we
will say that a gridview 1 dot data
source is equal to whatever data table
we have ok so these are the four these
are the four line we need to connect we
need to connect our data base to the
data grid view in C shop now let's write
the query first so let's see what data
base I have and on the basis of that we
will write the query ok so suppose we
want to fetch all the values from this
data base which we have which I am using
in this demo and we have this data table
called employee data and we want to show
all the columns PID first name last name
user name password and all the columns
then it's simple we just need to pass
select asterisk or star from your table
name my table name is employee data
right
so I'll write glowing data okay
now let's run the code and let's check
if it works or not or let me just close
this because it may cause the connection
conflict and now our form is running
we'll give the user name and password
and we reach two
the second form right now when I click
the slowed table button it is supposed
to load all the values from the database
here and you see here all the values
from the database is loaded in this data
grid here and you can match it with your
database values also so I will open this
once again open and you see here you
have employee ID first name now last
name and the other values so for example
I have username password and date of
birth country and phone number and pay
but in some situation for example you
don't want to show username and password
in the table or you don't even want to
show those phone numbers
then how come you show only employee ID
first name last name and pay for example
so for that you need to change the query
instead of this Asterix selects test ik
you need to give the column names so
just give the column name for example I
I D I just need to close my form so i
will write select the ID which is my
table column name right EW right then I
will take first name last name and P so
comma first name comma last name comma P
these are all the column names in the
database right and now when I run the
program let me close this first and when
I run the program and we will go to the
next form and when I click this we only
have these four column values okay so in
this way you can filter your columns
from the database which you want to show
in this dotted red view
okay and this even shows the title of
your table columns so in this way you
can connect the dot a grid view with the
Access database values I hope you have
