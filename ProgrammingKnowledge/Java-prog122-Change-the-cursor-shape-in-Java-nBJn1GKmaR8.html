video I will show you how to change the
shape of your cousin so for example when
I hover over this jframe my cursor shape
is normal default cousin but when I
hover over this button my cursor shape
changes to this hand shape and when I go
this to the normal jframe it shows
normal default Casa and when I go to Jay
this area you see here it's normal and
here my cursor shape is changed so in
this video I will show you how to change
these cursor shape when you hover over
different buttons or Jakob buttons here
here anywhere so let's get started what
you need to do is first go to the J
component
on which you want to change your cursor
shape so for example I want to change
the shape of my cursor when I hover over
this button so I will right click it go
to its event and then go to Mouse motion
okay
event and then mouse motion and then
mouse moved click this and you will go
to its method knows motion method of
this button and in here you need to
write a simple code what code you need
to write is
right
Gazza and cause our variable so i'm name
it as Cu r1 is equal to nu and we copied
this closer to paste it here and then
break it and break it closed and in this
bracket copy this curve placed it here
dot whatever shape you want to give when
you hover over this button so for
example I want to show this north cursor
cursor let's see how it looks like and
in the next line you just copy this
variable name of this button on which
you want to change the cursor and paste
it here and then write dot set
cursor and this very member the one will
come here so in this way you can change
the cursor shape when you hover over
that button so let's check how our code
performs
okay so it's running and we see when you
go on this button and you hover over
this button to show this shape and when
you go normally on other places it shows
your default color shape here shape
change so you can see in the same way
you can change the shape on other J
components I will show you once again
you for example I want to change my
cursor when I hover over this list I
will right click it go to its event and
we go to Mouse motion and mouse moved
and in here
in this method what I was right is what
I have copied or I have written in
earlier code and I will just change this
variable name as J list
jlist
and this time I want to show something
else goes a dot let's see what all the
other colors I will show this WB sighs
close of an example and now I will run
the program
it's funny running
grunts and you can see the normal Kazuya
and when I follow this it shows the
different shape yeah yeah so in this way
you can change the shape of your cursor
I hope you have learned something new
