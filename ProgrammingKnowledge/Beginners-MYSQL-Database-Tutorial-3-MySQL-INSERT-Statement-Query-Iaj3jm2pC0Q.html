last video we have seen how to create a
new schema on you database using MySQL
workbench and also with the help of
query and we have also learned how to
create a table inside your database in
this video we will see how to insert
values in your not to be stable and some
other things so let's get started first
of all we made this database called
database only so go here and click this
and in this table the table name is II
data I have changed the table name and
just click right click this table and go
to edit data so we will come up with our
table with 4 columns we have created
last time the first column is employee
ID second is near third is surname and
fourth is age now we are going to insert
some values in this table so just double
click these cells and you can insert the
column so
and this age 25 second
John
is age t 3/3
check
which is 40 for example a fourth employ
age is so simply you can insert these
values in your database and when you
click when you done with inserting click
apply and in here comes the query insert
into database dot e dot a--
which is our till table name and then
white you are column in which you want
to insert data and then the values so
and then apply and our data is inserted
successfully so if you go and right
click and go to hundred table once again
our data is saved you can see now
I want to insert this data with the help
of query so what I will do is I will
select my second database which I use or
inserting data with the help of queries
so I will select this and in my query
tab here I will write insert
insert
into your table name which is data and
then some better good practice to
indicate your schema also soil right
database dot e data so it indicates that
sorry
one two three it indicates my database
which is this database database 1 2 3 .
this table so it specifies my database
and my tailor and then I will make
brackets and the columns in which I want
to make changes so first column is ID
employee info comma 2nd column is name
third column is so named
so new
and
odd column is a page okay and then write
values and once again make a bracket and
close it and in here we will insert the
values
so first the employee ID or this ID so
this is an integer I will write one
comma name or for example third column
is surname I will make some so again and
fourth column is eight so i will write
34 is his age so this is the query in
order to insert a first row in your
database one two three and in the table
II data this which is this and I will
click this execute button and it says
some error unknown column mark so we
will see why it's not
so let's see what is the mistake here
here I have written insert into database
name dot my table name and in this
bracket my column names and I have
written values 3 and Mark and bill these
are characters so if you want to insert
the character it cannot identify that
it's a character so you have to surround
it by single quotes like this and now it
identified that it's a worker variable
so now when I execute my query
it shows me duplicate entry because I
will write for here because I have
inserted already three values previously
what testing my query so once again and
yes
it's saved you can see here my green
indication comes so it means that my
query is executed so let's see my data
is inserted or not yes this is the
fourth column I am inserted and the
error which comes previously is the
duplicate entry for primary key because
I have already inserted one two three so
I have to insert fourth time so in this
way you can insert data into table with
the help of workbench also and with the
help of this query also once again we
will go to the query to insert a data
into the table you need to write insert
into database dot tables name your
columns in which you want to enter your
data and the values you want to enter
and remember that if you want to insert
where care variable you need single
quotes surrounding that value of that
Nauta
so keep in mind this and you will be
good to go so I hope you have learned
something new this time ease rate
committed subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
