tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are strings and how we can use
strings in Java so first of all what is
a string a string is you can say is a
sequence of characters or in other words
you can say a string is a character
array and how you can declare strings in
Java you just need to use this keyword
called string and then you can name your
string whatever you want so I named it
as my string is equal to and then in
double quotes whatever string you want
to assign so for example hello world you
can do it something like this and this
string you can just print it using
system dot out dot print line system dot
out dot print line and you can call your
string here and it will print your
string right this is very simple stuff
now
there are some properties and functions
related to strings which we can use for
example I want to get the length of the
string I can just use this string or I
can declare a variable called my string
length my string length is equal to the
variable name of my string dot length
okay and this function length will
return the size or length of the string
so the length of the string as we can
calculate one two three four five
and five letters for world and one for
space so eleven should be the length of
the string and let's run the program it
returns eleven right so this length
function will give you the length of the
string now for example I can modify this
string I will declare some one new
variable called my string in lower case
so you can convert your string to
lowercase all the letters in lowercase
like H is capital here and for W is
capital in world you can just convert
them into lowercase something like this
so use your string variable name - and
then lowercase just use this function
and then it will convert your string to
the lowercase run the program and it
converts hello world from hallo it
converts H to lower and from world it
will convert world to lowercase in the
same way it will convert your string to
the uppercase so I will change it to
string in case like this and I can
convert to the uppercase so I can just
use taught to uppercase and will convert
your string in capital letters like this
it will print your string okay and there
are some other properties of string for
example you want to join to string you
can do it something like this
hello in double quotes plus world in
double
and this means your can concatenating
two strings one string is hello and
other string is world and whenever you
use this plus sign between them it will
concatenate or join these two strings
okay so it will not affect our result
it just removed the space because this
world and hello doesn't contain any
space if I gives any space here and it
will give you the space here okay so the
other function you can use with this
array is notary but the string is with
the replace function for example you
want to replace some character from this
string I will change it to the original
value hello world and I want to add or I
want to change this e to some other
letter for example a okay so I can use
something like this I can use this my
string then dot replace and I can
replace my old character so I will
replace character E by for example
character a okay and it will search for
all the characters in this string it
will replace it by a so when we run the
program to give the result h-e-l-l-o
hello world instead of h-e-l-l-o right
for example our string would contain
more than one ie here and then we run
the program it will can convert or
replace our e by a okay so you can
replace the characters in the string
using this replace function you can do
more things
this replace function you just need to
hover over this function and just see
the examples which is suggested by
eclipse here so examples are replaced
the characters you can replace or you
can replace some more strings or
something like this
okay so this is how you can use strings
in Java there are other functions in
strings which you can use you just need
to add a dot to your variable and see
what you know function suits your you
know your requirements you you have this
concat function which concatenates you
have this index of some character if you
find I want to find some index of the
character for example I want to find the
index of for example o then I can just
write a character oh and then I can run
this program and it gives -1 for some
reason I have to see this you know this
index off and what it does and you just
need to hover over the function and then
you just need to you know see what's
what this function is doing so it
returns -1 the index of first occurrence
of the character in the character
sequence represented by the object or
minus 1 if the character does not occur
okay so this was 0 if this was o I would
have got the right answer which is 4 0 1
2 3 4 ok so just find your function
which suits your requirement and you
will be good to go
in this way you can use strings in Java
