shown you how to install Apache web
server on your open to operating system
plus how to install a PHP with your
Apache web server in your Ubuntu
operating system now in this video I
will show you how to install MySQL
server plus how to install my PHP admin
or PHP myadmin
to your Ubuntu operating system so first
of all we are going to install the MySQL
server so just open your terminal and
right here sudo apt - get install MySQL
server and it will ask for your password
so give your password of your computer
and right now it's saying that my skill
server is already installed in my system
because I already have my SQL Server but
if you want to install this my skill
server it will give you a prompt that it
will require some memory and it will
take this much amount of memory you just
need to give yes
or Y command and just hit enter and then
in between it will ask for your root
password so just give your password and
just remember your password for my SQL
Server and it in this way you will be
able to install MySQL server on your
system otherwise I will also provide a
link with this video so that you can see
how the detailed instruction how I have
installed my SQL Server to my open to
operating system now you once this MySQL
server is installed let's install PHP
myadmin
with MySQL server and other libraries
with your open to system so in your
terminal once again give the command
sudo
apt - get install and then we will write
live Apache to - mod - auth - MySQL
space PHP 5 - my MySQL - PHP my admin ok
so just give these commands so what it
will do is it will install PHP myadmin
PHP support for MySQL and MySQL support
for a bar chain ok so just give this
command and press ENTER and it will ask
for your permission here and if you
agree just say Y and press ENTER and it
will install PHP my admin' and other
apache libraries with my sphere and one
again it will ask for the password and
here we want to use Apache - web server
it will give this light all lik HTTP D
also but just we want to select a budget
- so hit space to select this Apache and
then hit tab key to highlight this okay
and then hit enter and then it will
install all the packages for PHP 5 and
MySQL support for your Apache web server
and now it will ask you if you want to
configure PHP my admin with your
database so of course we want to do that
so just hit enter because yes is already
highlighted and now it will ask for the
password which you have given for your
MySQL server so when you have install
MySQL database get what they have shown
you a prompt which you have to enter
your root or / root password so you must
have given some password in your MySQL
installation when you have install MySQL
server so in here just re-enter the same
password which you have given for MySQL
server so I will give my password and I
will hit tab and I will hit enter once
again it lasts for a new password for my
H my PHP myadmin
so this password can be same or
different from your my still server
password so I will give the same
password as my mascal server for
simplicity
and I will hit tab and I will hit the
enter and once again I need to confirm
my password so I will give my password
once again and tab and enter now I will
clear my terminal first and now what I
will do is I will provide a symbolic
link for my SQL admin to my webpage
folder so i will write sudo and then Ln
for link - s and then my part for the my
PHP my admin so write user or first this
route then user share PHP my admin this
is my admin and then I will give the
path to the my www folder of Apache
so I will write bar www and I will give
my PHP myadmin name as PHP my admin'
once again and this should be my mini ok
I will hit enter and
created a symbolic link from my PHP
admin to my apart a www folder now let's
try and check whether everything is
working or not
so I will open my web browser first and
my web browser I will write local post
slash PHP my admin' write my okay and i
will hit enter and now you will be able
to see this PHP my admin login page here
if you don't see this login page what
you need to do is you need to restart
your Apache web server which I have
already shown you how to reload your
Apache web server and then I have shown
you how to install Apache so if this
page doesn't doesn't show then just
restart your Apache web server and just
give this link once again and it should
work and now I need to give my username
which was root and the password for my -
my PHP my admin which I have set earlier
okay and I hit go and it will open my
PHP myadmin and here I can create SQL
databases and other database related
activities from by using this PHP
myadmin
so in this way you can install PHP my
admin with your MySQL database I hope
