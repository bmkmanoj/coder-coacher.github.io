cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will discuss about HTML and
style sheets with cutie widgets so HTML
widgets and you know windows are HTML
aware so what do I mean by that so let's
see an example I have this demo project
and I'm going to go to my main window UI
file and I'm going to take a label here
right now there are some properties here
to change the fonts of your label for
example this one but if you want to do
more then you can use for example HTML
attributes to use with these labels so
how we can do it for example I want our
text here hello world and I want it in
bold you can do it from here also bold
but let's say I want this hello world to
show in red color so what I can do i can
just write here this HTML tags if you
have learned HTML you know what this
font
you know element is so just write font
here and then is equal to the attribute
is for example color just right color
and is equal to red for example we want
to we want the red color here right and
just close this font here so whenever
you give this and whenever you whenever
you double click it once again and you
can go to the source here and then you
can just you know add it the source from
here so something like this font right
so when you see in this rich text it
will show in red color right now let's
say we want this in bold you can just
provide the bold attribute which is be
in these angle brackets and then just
close this be here and then go to rich
text and now your text become bold
for example instead of bold we want
italics you just write I here as we do
in HTML instead of be replace this by I
and then your phone becomes italic right
or for example you want some headings
you can just give h1 here and here also
h1 attribute and go to rich text box and
you can see as one you know tag is
applied here and when you click OK you
see your font color and this h1 tags is
applied to your label so what I wanted
to say is this label and other widgets
are HTML aware right for example let's
say we want here to show some table
which is HTML kind of table not the
table view but HTML table to just
display some kind of table so what we
can do here
we can just give the code for the table
I have the sample code for showing some
table you can just find this table HTML
table online and you will be able to see
lots of code there right and when you
see here in the rich text box the table
is created and when you click OK you can
see this table is also you know possible
to show in the label right so you can
play with these HTML you know elements
and tags and see what you can do more
with your widgets now the second thing
is style sheet as HTML also have style
sheets like CSS files you can also give
these style sheet attributes to your
widgets so for example I will take a
push button from here right and now what
I want here is I want to show the color
of this push button as once again red or
any other color so just choose your push
button here and go to the property
called style
sheet here there's a property called
style sheet just open this property and
in here you can you know give these kind
of properties like gradients and colors
or fonts or any resources like you know
background images from here also right
so for example I want to give the color
is equal to red so as we can do in you
know normal CSS file just write color
and then give this colon and then give
the name of the color for example yellow
color and then the semicolon here okay
and then click OK and you can see the
font of this push button is yellow now
let's say it's red so that we can see it
better
so just do red and click OK
and now it becomes red right so there
are some you know more style sheets for
example font size or font styles or font
family you can apply here for example I
want the font size equal is equal to 12
pixel or 12 PX I can just go here and I
can just write font size is equal to or
colon 12 PX or let's say it's 20 px
right and click OK and this font size
becomes 20 px right or you want the font
font style to be italic so you can just
use this and then in here just write
font style and italic and give semicolon
here click OK and now one style become
italic or for example you want let's say
some kind of mixed font of view for
example you want some kind of font style
so let's give some fun style or just
give this kind of other phones right so
you can just give font
a Dalek large and the font is Times New
Roman right and you can remove the other
things and then click OK and now you can
see this font is applied here right or
once again the font size we can apply or
change here for example 12 PX here and
here also I forgot the semicolon so just
give this and click OK
ok so this becomes 12 PX right now let's
say we want a line added here and we
want to give some styles to our line
added so I'm going to take a line add it
here and let's say we want to change the
attribute of this so for example you
want to change the border attribute of
this line edit so what we can do here is
we can apply the things here so just
choose this go to style sheet here and
let's say the border width here we want
to apply is to pixel model style is
solid and the border color is a dark
blue for example right so just click OK
and you can see this style is applied to
your line added here okay so you can
play with these things and see what you
can do more for example you want to give
the image background image you can also
do from here so for example I want to
choose this main window widget and I
want the style sheet from here so for
example I will first of all add our
resource file layer so I'm going to
right click and add new and go to Qt
resource file choose from here I am
going to name it as resource itself give
next and click finish
yeah and in here I'm going to add a new
prefix for example I am G for image and
then I'm going to add a file here so I'm
going to add a file I already have a
file in my project which is inside my M
folders I'm going to just choose this
background image and click OK and you
can see the path is defined in our
resource file this resource file how to
use them I have shown you in the
previous video so hopefully you you know
remember this thing right so once again
we are going to go to our main window
dot UI file choose the background choose
the stylesheet property here so I'm
choosing this main window right to the
stylesheet property and from the
resource you can just go here also and
choose the background image and then
choose this background image which you
have chosen in the resources right click
ok so you can see this attribute is as
added to your style sheet and click OK
and this background is applied to your
main window this is the image right so
in this way you can use HTML and style
sheets in QT I hope you enjoyed this
