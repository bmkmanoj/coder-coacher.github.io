will show you how to sort your data or
search your data and set into the table
between two values for example if you
want to show in the table the pressure
between 15 and 35 for example so you
must enter these values somewhere and
here in the table only you want to see
the values between 15 and 35 so how
would you do that
I will show you today so go to your
jframe I've already taken a combo box
and these text field and given them the
variable name and I also take a button
and given it the variable name in order
to save time in the combo box I have
written pipe names from which I can
choose on the basis of which I want to
choose pressure voltage flow temperature
rotational speed and talk
so I will choose here whatever I can
choose here those were dildo that value
will be selected and you can give you
the minimum and the maximum value and
when you press ok it will be shown into
your J table so let's get started I
click your J button go to event action
index when performed and in here I've
already made my try-catch block so it
says you can make it also hope and then
right here we want to declare two
strings first is
is equal to the name of your minimum
text field copied variable by variable
name is mi m dot get text
the same way declare another string
whose variable name is two and your text
field variable name my text field max
where every name is max declare two
variable in which you take the text
value and decay another strength
as you wish and yeah
you copy the name up here
combo box copy the variable name of your
combo box
combo box variable names parameter paste
it here dot get selected item
so
right this and here it will show error
because item is not a string so after
get selected item you should write dot
effect string then there we go now we
will write our query so right here
string
is equal to
you should write select star from
whatever is your table name my table
name is user info here and then right
where is your column name so we are
sorting right now the date between the
pressure column so I will write the
pressure column name here so write
pressure and then we must fight between
and here is the tricky part
between what so you write single quote
inside single quote ake two double
quotes inside double quotes you take two
plus sign and copy your minimum value
variable name paste it here and then
white and and white the same thing again
whatever you mean a mystic understand to
this maximum variable variable name so
where pressure between Lu 1 and value 2
and then here white yes T connection you
prepare statement on dot
prepared statement
and in here let's go like that turn out
right the palace 3.0 KST not make good
query and after that you must copy the
name variable name of your table so my
my copied pasted here then dot set
mortar
and inside the set model right DB you do
not
wasn't
two nested
no result set to table model slide here
this
and I think now you're good to go
but yeah we forgot one thing we forgot
to place a condition where we choose the
jcombobox to the value for from
jcombobox so we have to write here above
the try block you have to write F
condition and just close the try-catch
block in if condition and then in here
write your variable name which is temp
this is the variable name for the combo
box selected item so I write equal to
and double quotes write the parameter
name so my parameter name for example I
want to choose first pressure I will
copy it and paste it here so whenever I
choose pressure this code will open and
once again else if
Yeah right a P is equal to double goats
and in here you can write the second
value from the jcombobox which is volume
flow so you can copy it and paste it
here so if you write the same code in as
above for pressure in here and if you
select volume flow then this whole code
will be same but here we are selecting
the value with the value where your
volume flow rate well you should change
so instead of pressure you should write
the name of your column name which is
volume flow so I will place it here
wonderful whenever you choose volume
flow then this very very take place so
now let's try to run the program and
check let me write or not
so in here for example I want to see
only loaded and in between I want to see
the value between 22 and falling unglue
50 I will write 20 and 50 I want to see
value flow and when I click OK
yeah volume flow rate we can see only
would be 20 and 50 and all the other
less than 20 and more than 50 values are
not shown in that table once again I
want to see the pressure between 10 and
35 so you press ok
and now you can see only the pressure
between 10 and 35 or I want to see the
pressure between 1020 you can now see
the pressure between 10 and 20 so this
was a tutorial how to sort your values
in the J table I hope you have enjoyed
in lungs of different new and I think I
should close this video now so please
rate comment and subscribe and thanks
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
