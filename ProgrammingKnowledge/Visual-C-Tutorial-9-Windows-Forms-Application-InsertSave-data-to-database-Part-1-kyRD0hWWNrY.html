we have seen how to make this login page
for our visual C++ windows form
application and when we give some
username and password it checks into the
database and it shows us where the
password is correct or not and if our
password is correct then it goes to the
second page now in this video I will
show you how to save or insert data into
your database with the help of your C++
windows form application so what I'm
gonna do is I will take some text fields
here and I will take a button here which
I will call save and I will save my data
from that button so let's get started
let me explain how I'm gonna do that so
go to your second form design which is a
blank form except for this exit button
and what I will do is I will take a
button
and I will take a lab
and we take a text box
okay this bigger and what I will do is I
will just select this label and copy and
paste it four times because I need four
labels one two three and four and I need
four text B so one two three copy and
paste so what I have done is I have
named these labels as a ID that is
employee ID host name last name and age
and these values i will enter in these
text boxes and I will press Save to save
data this four field I have taken
because in my MySQL database I have
these four field employee ID name
surname and is so I have taken into my
application these four fields I have two
more fields in my database that is
username and password but I am not
taking them when entering the data from
this form application and what I want is
when I press this Save button it should
direct the data new data should go into
my database directory here so when I
receive a new data 9 something but every
will enter will enter in this database
so let's get started so go ahead and
make these button text field and labels
and then I will double click this Save
button and which will lead
me into the method of this button click
okay so first thing what I need to do is
as in my previous video to link my MySQL
I have used this name space using this
name space my SQL data collection from
form one and I will copy it and paste it
into my form to where we want to paste
it just below this using namespace
system drawing so using namespace MySQL
DOM is built client just pasted below
these used namespaces what it will do is
it will link your second form with the
database okay
and the second thing you need to do is
when we have written our code for
logging button I will double click this
login button and you can see we have
written a code for login
so what this code does it it connects
your SQL with this port and with this
localhost to your MySQL database and
then pass your query into the database
so I will take whole code from here copy
in order to save time and then I will
add it this code so I have taken all the
code in between this method you have to
here
just take this code okay and I will go
to my second form which is this same
form and I will once again double click
the Save button and then between this
method I will paste all that code and
what I don't need is this if conditions
so I will they need all the if and else
condition which we have used in our long
page and I will also delete this
variable count which we have taken in
when we were writing our login code the
rest of the code we need so just take a
look at it this will connect
your program to the database and this
will pass your query so what I have now
is this query but in order to save data
into my database I need to pass a
different query which is insert query so
I will just change this query just take
a look look at it right
insert
into sorry into insert into your
database name dot your depth table name
so if you can see in my SQL database I
have a ID he name surname and age and my
database name is database itself and my
table name is e dot ah okay so this is
what I am writing here insert into
database dot e data okay and then
after that write these brackets and I
will take my for film which is this Eid
named Solomon H and I will write it here
so II I D comma name oh ma
so name comma pitch okay and then
after that I will write we delete all
this which I have used in previous query
okay so I delete all this tilt this
semicolon the semicolon we are using to
close our query so our query looks like
this insert into database dot e data and
the PO field which we want to save and
then right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
