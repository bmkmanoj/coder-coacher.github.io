show you how you can download and
install Ubuntu operating system on your
Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system using VMware Player so hopefully
you have a VMware Player installed on
your Windows operating system if you
don't have I will put the link so that
you can click and see how you can
download and install VMware Player on
your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system after installing VMware Player
you will be able to see this kind of
desktop icon on your desktop so you just
need to click this vmware player but to
install ubuntu on your vmware player
you also need to have open - iso file so
this is a file how you can get you just
need to search on your favorite browser
Oh Ubuntu and in here www dot you bun -
comm just click it and in here you will
be able to see the open two versions to
download so you just need to go to
download and in here open to desktop and
in here you will be able to see which
version of Ubuntu are available at this
time so at the time of making this video
there are two versions available one is
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS which is a long term
version and other is Ubuntu 14.04 nine
months and then they will release a new
version of Ubuntu
so generally I will recommend this LTS
version
this LTS version will be valid for
almost five years so just first of all
you must know what type of Windows
operating system you have most probably
if you have relatively known computer
you must have 64-bit operating system
but it may have you know 32-bit
operating system so to check on Windows
8.1 you just need to go to system search
for system and click it and in here you
will be able to sign in system type what
system you have I have 64-bit operating
system so I will choose 64-bit operating
system and click download and in here if
you want to donate to Ubuntu you can
donate otherwise Ubuntu is open source
and free so you may not wish to donate
if you want and you can just drag every
slide to zero and then you can just
click this download button so once you
click this download button you will be
able to see the download open to
download here so you can see open to -
14.04 0.1 - desktop
- AMD 64 dot iso file so this will be a
iso file and it will take some time to
download maybe 10 minutes or 20 minutes
because it's about 981 mb file so just
download this file I have already
downloaded this ISO file open - 14.4 ISO
file so once you download this file you
are ready to install Ubuntu
VMware Player so just open your vmware
player and just click this option here
create a new virtual machine and in here
you can choose which option you want
so you just just need to click this
installer disk image file which is iso
file and browse for your iso file
wherever it is so this is my iso file
location which i have downloaded from
ubuntu and then click I will install the
operating system later okay click Next
now you need to choose which type of
operating system you want to install so
just choose Linux because open 2 is a
Linux operating system and we are going
to install Ubuntu 64 so just choose
Ubuntu 64-bit ok click Next
and in here you can give the name to
your Ubuntu operating system I will
leave it as default but you can change
this name and the location generally I
will leave as default click Next in here
you can give the I mean the maximum disk
size to your operating system so 20 GB
is enough for 64-bit or Ubuntu operating
system but if you want to increase it
you can increase it from here for now I
will just allocate 20 GB for me it's ok
and then I will click Next and this will
show the your settings so what settings
you have chosen for Ubuntu and just
click finish
once you click finish you will be able
to see
this virtual machine is created here
right now once you create your Ubuntu
virtual machine you can change its
setting by going to added virtual
machine settings and in here you can
change the settings for example by
default it allocates only one processor
to the virtual machine but you can
choose more processors for example I
will choose 4 for now and in here hard
disk you will be able to see the hard
disk current size and system maximum
size 20 GB so it's ok for me and then
here is the cd/dvd options network
options and other options are here okay
so in this CD / DVD option you need to
choose your ISO file once again so just
click this option CD / DVD auto-detect
is by default selected but you need to
choose your ISO file so just click this
radio button use ISO file and browse for
your ISO file wherever your ISO file is
so my ISO file is here once again I will
choose my ISO file which I have
downloaded right now from Ubuntu website
right and then there are some other
settings here if you want to play with
but I will leave them as default for now
and this memory also you can increase it
to suit your requirement for example I
will increase it to 2 GB and in here in
the options tab you have the options to
choose a shared folder
and virtual VMware tools so which are
the tools which are required by your
guest operating system but for now I
will leave everything as default and if
required I will install them later
once everything is set you are ready to
click this play virtual machine button
so select your operating system and
click play virtual machine and for the
first time it will show you this these
options click OK for every option and
here software updates you can choose
download and install the following
software will be available VMware tool
for Linux so these tools are required by
your guest operating system for example
Ubuntu to you know give you better
performance on virtual machine so if you
choose you just click download and
install and it will download this these
VMware tools and it will increase the
resolution or other features of your
Linux virtual machine so I will just
download them and install them and I
will let this process to go on and by
the meantime my Ubuntu virtual machine
has been started and it's ready to
install select your language in here I
choose English as my language and I will
click install Ubuntu so just click
install Ubuntu and in here to show
preparing to install Ubuntu and it will
give you this option that you must have
at least 6.5 GB available space which we
have we have 20 GB and you have
connected internet I also have this
and in here the option to download
updates while installing is a good
option and if you choose you can install
third-party software and click continue
and then we will go to the next step
which is this computer currently has no
detected operating system what would you
like to do so you just need to choose
the first option which is the default
option erase disk and install Ubuntu
don't worry it will not erase your host
operating system it's just a virtual
machine so you can safely select erase
disk and install Ubuntu it will not
erase your original operating system so
just install now and the location you
need to choose if you need to change you
can change it but it's ok for me so I
will click continue and here you can
choose your keyboard layout so for
example by default it's English
but if you have a keyboard layout to
some particular country or language you
can choose it from here for example my
keyboard layout is German so I will just
search for a German layout which is
keyboard layout so I will just search
for German which is here and in German
also there are many options but I will
choose the first option
general option and in here you can you
know print your key keys so that you can
check whether it's working or not and
click continue
and now you just need to give the name
to your Ubuntu operating system which is
your names for example programming
knowledge and then you need to pick the
password for Ubuntu operating system so
you just need to know remember this
password in order to log in once again
so just choose a password which is most
appropriate for you and then require my
password leave it as default click
continue and now the installation has
been started so it will take some time
to install Ubuntu by the meantime you
can also click this install VMware tool
which will enable some features on your
order system so click yes and click ok
and I will let this process to go on and
a once some important step occurs I will
restart the videos so now it's
installing system files and after this
it's almost complete so I will wait for
this process to complete also so now our
installation is complete and this one
too is telling us to restart this
virtual machine so I will just click
this restart and for the first time when
you install Ubuntu on VMware or any
other virtual machine it may take some
time to restart so if it does not
restart you just need to power up
your virtual machine and then start your
open to once again so for example in
this case let's wait for three or four
seconds otherwise we will restart or
start Ubuntu by ourself but Ubuntu is
restarted by itself so we don't need to
do anything right now and Ubuntu is
ready to use so you just need to give
your password and enter your password
and now we are almost ready to use
Ubuntu so in some moment hopefully we
will see the sidebar here and now
sidebar is here so we can use the
sidebar I will click this maximize
button but nothing happens so what I
will try is I will try this option enter
full screen mode and still it doesn't go
in full-screen mode so I will change to
this option so to solve this problem of
this screen resolution what you can do
is you can go to your system so just go
to system settings so go to this small
button and go to system settings and in
system settings you need to go to
display settings so just click this
display settings here display and in
this play by default when you install
Ubuntu on virtual machine its resolution
is 800 cross 600 but the actual resolve
Ellucian for our machine we need is one
three six zero cross seven six eight or
for better this illusion you can choose
the upper options also but for now I
will choose this option six three one
three six eight zero cross seven six
eight and then I will click OK or apply
from here and now it opens this in
better resolution but this also for my
system or my screen it's a little bit
lesser so I will increase it once again
to one nine to zero because my computer
resolution is this one one nine to zero
cross one four four zero okay so you
need to set the resolution according to
your screen computer screen and so I
will choose it once again and apply so
now the configuration is totally fine
for me so I will just say keep this
configuration and apply keep this
configuration and just close it so now
this has increased your resolution also
and now you can start using Ubuntu on
your virtual machine as a normal
operating system so I can open terminal
and it will open it and you can use it
however you want so I hope you have
