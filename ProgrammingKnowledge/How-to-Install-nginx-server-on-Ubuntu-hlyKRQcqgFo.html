video I will show you how to install
engines web server on your Ubuntu
operating system so first of all what
you need to do is go to your browser and
type www.gmail.com
we choose Germany and copy these two
lines of code according to your country
so these are the mirror part of the
packages and then what you need to do is
go to your terminal and in here and in
here type sudo nano
et Cie / @ / sources dot list and press
enter
and it will ask for a password then I
will open a list and at the bottom of
your list you just paste those two files
which you have copied and then ctrl o to
save the file and press ENTER and ctrl X
to leave the file okay
then on your terminal write sudo apt-get
install engine X + + Enter
and your nginx VD + es Delta
so once your nginx is installed then
write sudo so it's
nginx restart n plus Delta and
restarting nginx and nginx is restarted
to check that nginx is really started
and the web server is working go to your
browser
and type here
local host
presenter
and if you see this message welcome to
engine X that means engine X is
installed in your system once your web
server is started you can check other
things on this engine X once again go to
your terminal and here type CD use a
share engine X slash www hope you
remember the path correctly so first
enter and yes it goes to that location
and then write LS to list out the
content there
and we have 50 X dot HTML and index dot
HTML in our www.www.hsn.com well this is
the code sudo nano testify HTML press
ENTER and it will go to the blank nano
text editor there write this and write
your message this is a test
and it's a game skirmish
and then control poor to save enter and
control X to exit and once again go here
and go to the terminal and type sudo
service Ingenix restart and press enter
our service is restarting and we started
and are now go to your browser and
instead of localhost white local loads
slash test dot Ashley press Enter and
you can see this is a test so you have
successfully run the test HTML also on
your server
so once again go to your test terminal
and now I will show you some more
details about internist so write CD to
go to your route directly and then type
CD C / Ingenix
+ enter and then get out to direct these
and then here it contains and gen-x coms
side available and side in a loop these
are three very important factors of
enginex we will see one by one so time
we will type sudo know X and X dot go
and in here you can see the details of
the configuration like worker processes
user and
all the other things here so I will
exert it now I will show you the sites
available CD sides available and then
write sudo default so whatever is
written here is the configuration of
your localhost so your test dot HTML
file is taken from this root folder and
your server name is localhost by default
so you can change this server name as
your domain name also like whatever
test.com on test dot de whatever you
want and here you can define the
location which I will tell you later so
that's it for now
I hope you have learned how to configure
nginx into your Ubuntu operating system
these rate comment and subscribe and bye
