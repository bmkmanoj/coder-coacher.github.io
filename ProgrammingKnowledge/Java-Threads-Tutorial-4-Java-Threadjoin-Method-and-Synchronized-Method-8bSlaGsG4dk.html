javathread tutorial for beginners in
this video we will see what does join
keyword do in Java threads and how to
use join keywords in Java so let's get
started I'm going to give you an example
and I will show you how you can use this
join keyword so I have this blank
project with a blank mean method and
first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define a simple thread object
so I'm going to call thread t1 is equal
to new thread and inside this
constructor I am going to implement this
runnable here and then I'm going to call
the run over load here so implement the
method let me close this thread
constructor with semicolon and this
bracket and inside this run method what
I'm going to do is I want to once again
create a for loop and this time I want
to iterate this for loop to around
10,000 for this example okay and now
what I want to do is I want to create a
private variable which will be a static
one and which will be an integer okay
and I will name it as count and I will
initialize this count as 0 ok and now
what I want to do is I want to increase
this value of count inside this for loop
by 1 every time this for loop iterates
ok now similarly I will create a second
thread object
this is our first thread object which is
t1 I'm going to copy this and I'm going
to paste it just below this and I'm
going to name it as t2 ok so we have a 2
thread object t1 and t2 and I want to
start thread 1 and thread 2 now so I
will just call t1 dot star
and t2 dot start okay so what this will
do is it's going to start the thread one
and then thread two and then what I want
to do is I want to print the value of
count now
so this out and I want to print the
value of count okay and if you want you
can just write so what I want to do here
I want to increase the value of count
which is this variable and I want to
increase this value in both the threads
so both the threads will share this
count variable and increase its value
when we iterate over this loop okay so
this count variable is accessed from
thread one also and tried to also and
what we expect we want to print the
value of count at the end of the threads
1 and thread two now let's see what
happens when we run this program so
let's run this program and let's see
what will be the output so we will run
this and here we can see the value of
count which is printed here is 0 now the
reason for this is when we create thread
1 and credit read to and when we call
the start method on this thread 1 and
thread two this returns immediately when
t1 dot start is called
and then this returns immediately after
t2 dot is called and then this will
print the value and after printing the
value this thread t1 and t2 will start
so basically this thread 1 and thread 2
will not wait to end themselves before
printing the value of count that is why
this is printing count is equal to 0
why because thread 1 will stop
but thread two will start and it will
before looping through this loop it will
print the value of count because this
start will not wait until this thread 1
is dead and thread 2 is dead and it will
print the value of count before the end
of these two threads that's why we can
see the value of count is equal to zero
okay now to solve this problem what we
can do is we can use a keyword called
join okay so what we are going to do we
are going to use the keyword called join
on t1 and t2 so let's introduce this
join keyword join and this joint throws
so we need to enclose this join inside
our try catch block so when you click
this bulb you see that add throw
declaration or surrounded by try cast so
we will surround it with try catch block
and inside this try catch block we will
also call t 2 dot join okay
so what does this join keyword do here
okay so let's see what this is doing so
in Java this join method can be used to
pause the current thread execution until
and unless the specified thread is dead
so when we call this join this join will
allow this thread to be dead or to be
you know finished until and unless this
second thread is called and finished
okay and once these two threads are
finished and then only we will print
this value of count here okay so this
join waits for the thread to complete
and then only allows the execution of
other code after that okay so now let's
run this
program and let's see what happens so
I'm going to save this and run this and
now it's printing the value of count
around 13,000 something okay let's run
it once again
11,000 something right run it once again
10,000 something okay so this at this
point it's increasing the value of count
by one and we will expect that this
count should reach at least 20,000
because we are you know iterating 10,000
in one thread and 10,000 in other thread
right so we will expect the value of
count should be 20,000 but it's not
20,000 when we print this value it's
around 10,000 and it's random
nine thousand nine hundred and eighteen
thousand three 150 so why this is
happening now so okay this join will
wait for the thread to complete but this
operation we are doing on this count
which is increasing the value of count
by one is really slow in the terms of
computer execution so for example this
count is something like this okay so it
takes the value of count and then
increases the value of count by one and
then places in the same variable count
so in the computer terms it's a long
process and for example both the thread
if they want to access this variable at
the same time one will win and it will
increase the value of count by one okay
so in this way both the threads are
trying to access the value of count and
increase it and that's why this count
value is not reaching up to 20,000 now
to solve this what we can do is we can
use a keyword called synchronized
so what we will do now is we can create
a method for example public static void
and we can name it as in count to
increment count okay and what we can do
inside this method is we can increase
the value of count by one as we were
doing inside this loop okay and we can
call this in count inside our for loop
instead of this count increment like
this okay
in here and in here so basically this
method is not doing anything but when we
add a keyword called synchronized here
so let's add a keyword called
synchronize let's see what happens when
we run the program so run the program
and it prints twenty thousand two now
it's printing twenty thousand two
because in our condition I should be
less than or equal to ten thousand so
when we do I should be less than ten
thousand here and here and we will save
the program and run it once again it
prints twenty thousand and we can run
this program many times it will always
print the value of count is equal to
twenty thousand now what this
synchronized keyword is doing here now
in Java every object have its intrinsic
lock and what this lock does is it locks
the axis of certain variable when this
lock is called until and unless it does
its operation on this variable and it
can be only accessed by one thread only
so this lock or this intrinsic lock can
be called only by one thread at a time
and if two threads wants to access a one
variable which is logged then one thread
has to wait for the acquiring of the
lock and other thread will acquire the
lock and do its operation
so the synchronize calls this lock in
background so this count can be accessed
only once by one thread at a time okay
so one thread acquires it and increase
it and then other threads acquires it
and increase it okay so in this way this
synchronized solves the problem of
thread interleaving in a way that it
allows this variable to lock so that it
can do its operation and then allows the
other threads to do its operation so in
this way the keyword join and keyword
synchronized works in threads in Java so
