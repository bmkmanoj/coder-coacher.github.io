cutie tutorial for beginners in the last
video I've shown you how you can create
your first duty application using your
Qt creator ID and this was the project
we have created last time so I'm going
to just close this project and this time
we are going to create a new application
using the GUI application I widget right
and we will see how the designer works
in QT and how some of the functionality
works in QT designer so let's get
started
first of all oh just click this file
menu item here and then click new file
or project and in here this time we will
choose application and we are going to
choose Qt widget application and then
just click Choose and in here just give
the title of your project for example
first GUI and then click Next and then
click once again next and here you will
see the information for your GUI
application and you can see the class
name for your GUI application for your
window is main window so in here you can
change the name of your window which is
going to appear when you start your
application so for example you can say
my window and you can see the header
files and the source files take the same
name as the class name but you can even
change these class name and header name
like this so if you want the different
header name then the class you can just
add it from the header file and source
file from here ok but for now I'm going
to leave everything as default so once
again I'm going to show you what I did
new
and then application qwidget application
choose and then first GUI so I will just
say first GUI and then click Next and
then next okay for now we'll leave it as
default but remember always you can
always change this class name and file
name so it's not necessary that this
name should be the same which is the
default but you can change it so you
just need to click Next and then click
finish here now it's going to create you
this is kind of a project now in the
last video we have seen what does this
PR o dot PR o file does so first of all
we will go into the first Cuidad PR o
file and you can see here I will just
minimize this and you can see here it
includes the core library and GUI
library by default right and in here
it's saying that it's a widget
application and the target for this file
or project is first we which is the name
of my project and the template which is
used for this project is M which is a
GUI application and it's including some
source files so source files are main
dot cpp and window dot cpp main window
dot cpp so you when you go here in the
source folder you can see main dot cpp
and main window dot cpp so whatever
source file are included in your project
it should be listed here ok now it's
also giving the header file list so
whatever header files you have in the
header section for example main window
dot edge it should be added something
like this so you just need to add this
field headers plus equals the header
file names and you also have this main
window dot UI file this
this is the user interface file for your
project or especially for this class
which is mean window class right so in
order to add this UI file you just need
to use the field form plus equals main
window dot UI which is the name of this
file okay so this is your project file
now let's go to our main dot cpp here
and we can see that it has this main
method of function here and it's
creating the object of queue application
which I have explained you in the last
video right and it's returning this a
dot exact which is the object of queue
application which is a dot exact right
and whatever you write in between these
two lines of code will be you know
executed as your GUI for example right
so what we are doing here is we are
creating an object of my window class
which is this class which is
automatically created by QT for us so
you can see when you go to the main
window dot H there is a class called
main window right so this object is
created in your main method which is
this one and just calls the function we
just show on this object of main window
right and this will be responsible to
show your windows these two lines of
code now you can perform different
operation in the main window class so
let's go to the main window not header
class and in here you can see here first
of all it's inheriting from Q main
window it's just saying QT that this
will be your main window template kind
of thing right so there are different
the templates you can use in cube D for
example main window or dialogues or
other kind of windows so it's the main
window okay now it's using this
namespace which is UI which is basically
telling this UI you know file that just
include this main window in the UI okay
and then we have this macro here so what
does this cue object macro is doing here
so there is a term called MOC or meta
object compiler which converts this
macro if it's included in your file then
it takes all the header files and it
converts this these header files into
equivalent C++ code right so this macro
indirectly tells QT that we are going to
use you know GUI application and we are
going to use the signals and slot which
we are going to learn in the next video
what is signals and slots so if you add
this it makes it easier or it allows us
to create signals and slots for our
widgets right and whatever widgets or
class or header files you include here
it will convert into the language which
C++ understand okay or equivalent source
code for C++ right now you have the
constructor which takes one argument but
we are going to leave it as default and
we are also have the destructor right so
what this destructor is going to do
whatever pointer object we have we are
going to delete all the pointer objects
in this destructor and the private
access specifier we have an object of
main
the window which is this class right and
we have this object named UI okay so
this object is going to access all the
widget you will add in your main window
and using this object you will be able
to access all the widgets we are going
to add in our UI now let's go to CPP
file here and you can see we have the
constructor and what it's doing in the
constructor first of all it's
initializing this UI object with a new
main window and then this object is
calling set up UI which is going to open
your window okay
and in the destructor it's deleting this
UI object simple right so now we will go
to our main window dot UI file so just
double click on it it's going to open
this kind of kind of designer for you so
it's similar to other designer if you
have seen in the other languages like
C++ or Java X Java FX or Java swing
application right so you have some
widgets here which you can drag and drop
into this main window and then you can
change the properties of this widget you
have dragged using this property
you know attributes right so for example
we take a push button here okay
now every push button has its object
name by default its push button 1 or
push button or something like this so
whenever I add two push buttons you see
first push button name is push button
and second push button name is push
button underscore two right I'm going to
delete this push button for now but you
can change the object name of this push
button from here so for
example push-button close for example
right and press Enter is going to change
the object name of your push button you
see here when I just make it bigger this
name is now push button close because I
change it from here now if you want to
change the text on this push button you
just need to double-click on this push
button and then just change the you know
text on this so for example click me and
you have other option of changing the
text which is going to the property
called text here which is this one and
then just add some more item or you can
change the text from here also okay so
you can see whenever I add something to
the text its visible here right now for
example let's run the application and
let's see what happens we can see our
button in the window so it's going to
compile our code first of all you can
see it's building the code and now it's
showing our main window and we have this
click Me button here and by default this
main window has status bar and toolbar
so what is status bar status bar is at
the bottom of your window you can see
there is this object called status bar
which will be at the bottom and there is
a toolbar which is at the top so this
toolbar you can even drag and drop and
whenever you want to add something to
this toolbar you can you know add it
from here so you can see I can just pick
this toolbar and I can just move it
outside you see this is my toolbar and
once again I can you know pick and place
this toolbar anywhere in my main way
though right now let's add some code in
the button so that it can show some
message for example or you know it can
perform some action right so for example
whenever I click this button I want to
close this main window how can I do this
so I will just close it for now and what
I'm going to do here is let me just
minimize this thing and in here you can
see there are some buttons here so by
default this button is selected which is
added widget so we are in added widget
mode right you have some other modes
like layout modes for horizontal and
vertical layout you know and we have
this mode called added signal and slot
so just click this second button which
says added signal and slot and as soon
as you click this you will see here this
mode is changed for this GUI application
or GUI and whenever I hover over this
button it shows some red you know color
on a tip right so to add a functionality
to our button just click on the button
and then move out move out your mouse
and then you can see it's making some
line kind of thing and just release your
mouse so just release your mouse and
it's going to open this configure
connection UI for you now there is
something called signal and slots
concept in QT GUI application which we
are going to see in detail in the next
video but it's something like input and
output concepts whenever you press the
button which is the input then what will
happen so for example you want to close
our application as the output of
inputting the
but right so anyhow I will choose
clicked and just choose this just click
this checkbox is going to show you more
options so just choose this clicked here
and then choose this close here so our
signal is clicked and slot is closed so
whenever I click the press button it's
going to close the application so just
click OK and you can see clicked and
closed and then once again we can go to
our added widget mode and then this
signal and slot will be will not be
visible but in the background it's you
know functioning so once again I'm going
to run my application and let's see what
happens now so now when I click this
button it's going to close the
application right once again I click the
button and it's going to close the
application now if you want to remove
this signal and slot functionality you
just need to you know select it and
right-click on it and then just delete
this so this will be you know removed
the signal and slot functionality now
for example I want to have some label
here and I'm going to display some text
on it so what I can do here I can just
go to edit widget mode once again and in
here I will just search for a label and
I will make it a little bit bigger and
you can see it has some text which is a
sample placeholder text which you can
change from here so for example you can
change it to status right and what I
want to do is whenever I click this
button I want to change some I want to
display some message in this label so
what I can do
there is one more method of giving
signal and slots to our widget which is
right-clicking on your widget for
example I will right click on my button
and I will go to the slot so I will just
do this go to slot and then in here I
will just choose when it's clicked so
just choose clicked and click ok which
is going to create our function in your
main window class you can see there is a
function which is on push button closed
clicked and whenever we write some code
inside it it's going to be executed
whenever we click the button right so
for example I want to display some text
on the label so I will just go to the
main window UI once again and I will
just select this label and first of all
I will see what is the object name of
this label so you can see the object
name of this label is label itself which
is here right label so I will go to my
edit mode here and when I go to the
added mode so I'm in design mode and
when I go to the added mode by clicking
this button it will show some XML kind
of you know this file here so this is
the code behind for your UI you can say
right and you can switch to UI mode by
clicking this button switch mode it will
go to the UI mode so we want to go to
main window dot CPP and we have this
function here so in order to set some
text on this label you just need to use
UI which is our object UI object which
we have created if it's small for you I
can make it bigger and then just call
this label object from here so we have
seen there's a label you know object
name this indicates the label which we
have included right so this name should
be same as this name right so it's knows
that we want
to change something in label and once
again call a function called for example
set text okay
so set text and it takes one argument so
for example you can say button is
clicked okay and then save your code and
run it once again and once it's compiled
and run we will press our button and we
will see what happens to this label so
when I click this button it changes the
text of this label to button is clicked
right so this is other way of you know
creating this event based of you know
functions in QT so that's it for this
