Scala tutorial for beginners in the last
video we have seen how to use functions
in Scala now in this video also I'm
going to show you some more ways of
using functions in Scala so let's get
started so in the last video I've shown
you this type of notation to use
functions in Scala so you can define an
object and inside the object you can
define your functions and you can call
your functions like this so object dot
your function name right now first of
all in this video we will start with the
default value for your function so in
Scala
you can provide the default value for
your parameters that is function
parameters so for example I can define
the value of first parameter is equal to
45 here and this will be the default
value of this parameter and let's say
the second parameter have the default
value of 15 and here where I call these
parameters I can remove these parameters
let's say I don't pass any parameter to
the add function right so let's see what
happens now so I run the program and it
prints 60 so it adds 45 plus 15 and
gives us the result so if you don't
provide any parameter to a function
which already have the default values it
will take the default values so the
default value is taken in this case and
it adds the default value and gives us
the result now let's say we just provide
the first value let's say we provide
this time 60 here so we just provide one
parameter even though this add function
takes two parameters so let's see what
happens in that case so in this case
this first parameter or this parameter
which is passed is assigned to the first
parameter right so this 45 is replaced
by 60 in this case and the 15 will
remain the default value
cause we haven't provided the second
parameter and the addition of 60 plus 15
is shown here right so if you provide
only one parameter it will be assigned
to the first parameter and if you have
multiple parameters for example you have
three parameter for example you can
provide 15 here so this 15 will go to
the second parameter and so on
now in the last video I haven't shown
you how you can declare a function which
doesn't return so for example I will
just declare a function print with Def
of course so in front of the function we
use a keyword def and then it takes two
parameter let's say let's say it takes X
which is a int and Y which is also an
int and what it does it doesn't return
anything so : unit so in cases where
function doesn't return anything you use
this return keyword unit okay it's
equivalent to wide in some other
languages and then you can write equals
and then you can just give these curly
brackets right and let's say we are
going to print Ln the addition of these
two numbers X plus y let's say okay and
I'm going to just provide the semicolon
here it's not necessary but let's
provide that and now I just call this
function here so print and let's provide
the parameters here so hundred and the
second parameter is 200 let's say and
save your program and then run it and
it's going to return us the value 300
now I want to show you one more
interesting feature about Scala so I'm
going to just remove these default value
from here and you can use for example
some operator as a function name so
let's say I just give plus as a function
name right and I just give for the
square I can just give Asterix X tricks
for squaring the number right so
is completely valid notation in Scala
this is not operator overloading we are
doing this is just our declaration of
the function we are using right so here
instead of this ad we can just write
plus because the function name is plus
right now and instead of square we can
just write Astrix Asterix and it's a
perfectly valid notation so in Scala you
can define the function name as
operators also this is not operator
overloading this is just function
declarations so this means for example
you declare a val some variable and then
you add two numbers let's say 10 plus 20
then it means that this plus is also a
function which takes one parameter and
you can see when you hover over this
plus operator you can see it's
definition that it's a function here
which takes one parameter so plus is not
an operator it's a function in Scala in
the same way for example when you do a
strict symbol here and when you hover
over it it's a function in Scala right
you can see deaf then asterisks and then
it takes one parameter now in Scala
functions are treated as first-class
citizens that means you can assign a
function to a variable and this we can
do using anonymous functions so let's
see how we can use anonymous functions
so to use an anonymous function for
example I declare a variable add let's
say once again and then I can assign a
function to it so how can I assign a
function so I can just write by these
parentheses without giving any name to a
function and then I can just say X and
then the datatype of X which is int
let's say and then Y and then the data
type of the Y here I want to just write
Y and then I
can just use this notation so equals
arrow and then I can just return X plus
y okay and this is an anonymous function
which will work similar to this ad
function which adds two numbers and then
returns the value and assigns the value
to the add variable and then we can see
the answer
so let's print Ln the value of AD
variable this time so the ad is a
variable in our case and then you can
call this so variable using these
parameters so let's say 300 comma 500
okay and then save your program and then
just run your code and you can see this
result is printed here so this is how
you can declare an anonymous function
which doesn't have any function name and
you can assign this function anonymous
functions value to a variable like this
so that's it for this video in the next
video I'm going to most probably show
you how to use higher-order functions in
Scala so stay tuned and please rate
