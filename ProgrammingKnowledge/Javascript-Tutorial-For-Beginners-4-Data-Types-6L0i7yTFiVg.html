JavaScript tutorial for beginners in
this video we will learn about data
types in JavaScript
so there are basically five data types
in JavaScript which is strings numbers
boolean arrays and objects arrays an
object we will learn in further videos
and in this video we will discuss about
string numbers and boolean data types so
to declare variable in JavaScript you
need to declare it with a keyword called
var and it's like a data type in
JavaScript so unlike in other languages
like Java or C++ you literally give the
data type like int or bool or string
here but in JavaScript you give just
this keyword called var and then your
variable name so for example my number
and then you can initialize this
variable by some value for example 10
and by initialization JavaScript deduce
the data type of a variable so here it's
initialized with a number so this data
type of this variable will be a number
right now let's print this value so
there is a function in JavaScript which
is called alert and it takes one
argument it can be a string or a number
or anything right so to print a variable
you just need to copy it and pass it as
an argument of this alert function and
save your code and refresh your webpage
and it gives you this number in the form
of alert ok now this number can be of
different type for example if you want
to initialize this variable by a decimal
number or floating point you can use it
something like 10 point 2 1 3 or some
decimal points right or it can be a
exponent value so you can initialize it
something like 10 e5 which means 10 into
10 to the power 5 so let's save it and
refresh our webpage it will give you
this value right or you can do something
like 10 e minus 5 which means 10
multiplied by 10 to the power minus 5
and save it and refresh our page and it
gives you this decimal value right now
to declare a boolean value in JavaScript
you do the same so var the variable name
my bowl and then you declare it with
true or false so it can be true or it
can be a false value ok so a boolean is
a data type which can contain either
true or false so this time we are going
to initialize it by true for example and
just pass it in here in the alert
argument and save it and refresh your
web page it will give you true okay and
if you would have initialize it by false
then it will give you false so refresh
your webpage and it gives false here
okay now let's see how we can declare
our string in JavaScript so once again
gave var and then give the name to your
variable for example my string and then
is equal to and in double quotes
whatever you write in between the double
quote it will be your string right so
for example my name is whatever right
and just passed this variable in the
alert function and save it and refresh
your webpage and it gives you this
string value here okay now for example
you want to display a string with some
double quotation or something
so for example something like this okay
and this will give you the error so when
I save it and when i refresh my web page
it gives me nothing and it gives me the
syntax error and it says missing
semicolon before statement okay and you
can even go to this error by clicking
here on the right hand side and it shows
me this line okay so this error is
coming from this line we know right and
why this error is coming because these
double quotes you cannot use inside your
string variable so you can you know add
any string inside your double quotes at
the left hand side and the right hand
side but whenever you try to include
these double quote inside a string it
will give you an error and it's obvious
because javascript will think that this
string starts here and ends here okay
and whatever comes after it doesn't know
what is it so to you know avoid this
error what you can do is you can use a
operator called escape operator okay and
you can use it something like this so
you use backslash just before your
double quotation symbol so here and here
and this means whatever comes after this
double slash it will be considered as a
part of the string okay so save it and
refresh your webpage and now it will
give you the answer so my and in this
quotation and then the name okay
something like this now there is a
keyword in JavaScript which is called
the type of and this keyword whatever
you will write after this for example
I'm
writing this variable name my string
after this type of keywords separated by
one space then it will give you the type
of this keyword okay so let's save it
and let's see what it returns so I will
refresh it and give me string so this
keyword gives you the datatype of your
variable okay so you can check what this
variable is so my bool and save it and
refresh your webpage once again and it
will give you boolean okay and once
again I will pass this my number here
and save my code and refresh my webpage
and it gives me this number so you can
find the data type of a variable or some
value using this type of keyword so in
this way you can use data types in
JavaScript I hope you enjoyed this video
