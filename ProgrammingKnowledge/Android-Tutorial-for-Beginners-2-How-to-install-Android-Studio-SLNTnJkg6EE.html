tutorial on android app development for
beginners in the last video we have seen
how to configure and install java jdk
which was a prerequisite to install
android studio now in this video we will
see how we can download and install
android studio itself and we will also
see how we can configure our first
application using android studio so
first of all open your favorite browser
and search for android studio and most
probably the first link you will see
here is from developer.android.com slash
tool slash studio and click this link
and in here you will be able to see
somewhere the download link so this is
the download link down download android
studio now i will click this link here
and in here there will be a download
button download android studio for
windows just click this link and here
you will be able to see some license
terms and condition you need to agree to
download android studio so just click
this link and click download and save
the file now this is a relatively big
file I think it's about 828 MB so it
will take some time to download so just
sit back relax and you know grab a cup
of tea while downloading this and once
this is downloaded I will show you how
you can install and configure android
studio so download is complete now so we
are going to run this executable file
for Android studio and I'm going to
minimize everything so we can see
clearly
so now Android studio executable file is
running it will ask for the
authentication click yes
and now the setup will start just click
Next click Next
agree with the license and condition in
order to install and this is the
location which is default location where
Android studio will be installed and
this will be the location for the
Android SDK folder so just make a note
of this this we are going to need if
some problem occurs related to SDK so
click Next and click install and the
installation will start and it will
finish in few seconds
so it's not a very lengthy process it
was complete in few seconds you can see
here as it's complete we are going to
configure the SDK so now our Android
studio setup has been successfully
completed we just need to click the next
button and then it will prompt you to
start Android studio so just uncheck
this button or this check box for now
and click finish so now our Android
studio setup has been completed now what
we need to do is if you are and on
Windows 8 you just need to search for
Android studio or if you are on Windows
7 you just need to click the start
button and just right-click on Android
studio and run as administrator ok so
just run
right-click on Android studio and run
Android studio as an administrator so
just run as administrator and now it
will start Android studio so enrich to
you for this first time it will ask for
the import if you have a previous
version of Android studio it will ask if
you want to import your previous Android
studio settings or otherwise if you
don't have you just need to go with the
default value and click OK and Android
studio now it's going to start
Android studio is IntelliJ based IDE
IntelliJ is very famous you know company
or you can say for developing IDE s so
they have very good IDE s for developing
Java Python C++ and many other
applications so Android studio is
developed by developed by IntelliJ and
right now our Android studio setup is
downloading the Android SDK tools this
is a one-time process so don't worry
every time you are run Android studio 2
it is not going to do this this is just
for the first time Android studio is
going to download these SDK tools so I
will wait for these tools so download so
everything is successfully done now now
we just need to click finish and this is
for the first time whenever you start
under studio for the first time you will
see the interface like this now before
creating the first application we need
to configure SDK or some packages so you
just need to go to this option called
configure and then you just need to
click SDK manager and it will open SDK
manager and in here some of the packages
you will see you can install and some of
the packages are optional so you don't
need to install each and every packages
you just need to install whatever
packages you can see here so right now
install 9 packages you just need to
click this button but additionally
make sure that you just go down and in
the extras category here the last
category will be the extras category and
the last option I think will be this
Intel x86 emulator accelerator and in
short it's called haxm installer this is
the emulator we are going to use to run
our Android app ok so just check this
checkbox and VR we will be done right so
you just need to click one option here
which is Intel x86 emulator as Loretta
now in my case it's already installed if
it's not installed then you need to
install it ok so just check this
checkbox if this is not installed right
and now just click install 9 packages or
whatever number of packages it will show
here ok and now you need to confirm and
accept licenses just accept and click
install and it's going to install all
these packages and once these packages
installs we will be all ready to open or
create our first application so now the
download of these packages are complete
so I'm going to just close this and now
we are ready to run our first Android
application so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
