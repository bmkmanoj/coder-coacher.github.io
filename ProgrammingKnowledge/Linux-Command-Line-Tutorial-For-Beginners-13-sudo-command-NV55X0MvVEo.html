linux command line tutorial for
beginners in this video we will learn
how we can use sudo command in linux so
first of all what is a sudo command you
can say sudo is the command which rules
them all the abbreviation or full form
of sudo is super user do so it allows
you to some extra privileges as an
administrator or a power user so let's
see how we can use a pseudo in Linux now
first of all I'm going to open the
terminal and right now we are in our
home folder right by default
now for example I will first of all list
out all the directory which are in the
root directory so we'll just to LS and
then this forward slash now for example
I want to make a directory inside this
etc' folder so what I'm going to do is
I'm just to see Det see and here I want
to create some directory for example so
this etc' directory contains some of the
configuration files and other files you
can see and let's say I want to create a
directory for me for some purpose right
so I will just use mkdir which we have
already seen that this is the command
and for example I will say new there for
new directory ok and I will press enter
and now this gives me this error that
mkdir creates a direct here new there
which doesn't have permission so it's
showing the permission denied error this
is because for example on my Ubuntu
Linux operating system by default when I
the terminal it doesn't have the
administrative or root privileges so we
need to use a special command which is
called sudo in order to tell this Linux
terminal that we want to execute this
command as an administrator right so
let's see how we can use it so whenever
you see permission denied most cases of
permission denied can be solved by this
sudo command
because sudo allows us to run any
command or most of the command using
administrative privilege or super user
privilege okay so let's see we will just
give the same command but this time we
will just add a sudo in front of this
command right so sudo mkdir new
directory which is the name of the
directory and what this command does is
first of all when I and press enter is
going to ask me the password for my
computer it's the same password which
you provide at the time of login right
so I'm going to provide my password and
this password will not be shown on the
terminal it will be hidden but you just
need to type your password and then
press Enter and you can see here this
sudo this mkdir command is executed with
sudo or super user privileges and
because you have already provided the
password once now you don't need to
provide the password in the same session
in the terminal right so let's see if
this directory is created or not this
time we didn't see any permission denied
error and most probably it will create
this new dear directory so let's see if
it's created or not
so let's search for new deer and
hopefully we will be able to find this
directory this is here so you can see
this new directory is created so super
user command allows you to execute some
command which with the superuser
privileges right now whenever we will
you know learn how to install some
third-party software something like GCC
or G + + or any other libraries which we
may require to perform some tasks most
probably it will ask you for this super
user privileges for example there are
some command in Linux most of the time
in Debian operating systems that you can
give apt-get install command so have to
get install and the name of the software
which we want to install for example you
want to install GCC you will just give
GCC or for example C++ or any other
software for example but this apt-get
install command you know ask you most of
the time whenever you are installing
some software this is super user
privileges so you just need to add sudo
in front of it and then give your
password so that this software or
library can be installed on your system
right so sudo is forgiving the
administrative privileges right now for
example I will open the next terminal
you whenever you press control shift T
is going to open the new terminal as a
second tab so I have the first term and
second tab so ctrl shift T will open the
next
tab now whenever I will give sudo - s
and then press ENTER and I will give the
password here once again which will not
be shown by the way on the terminal and
press Enter
you can see earlier I was having the
user privileges which is the name of my
PC but now I have the root privileges so
it changes to the root user and then you
can see the asterisks here right this
not Asterix but this hash symbol here
which means you are now in super user
mode so you can easily you know do
anything as a super user okay so
whenever you will give sudo - s you will
go into the super user mode
automatically and that now you can
execute any command using a super user
as yourself right now this is the small
introduction for sudo su has many
capabilities which we are going to learn
slowly when we learn more about legs and
more commands and then we will see
slowly how it can be used in more
efficient way so this was just a brief
introduction how you can use sudo so I
hope you've enjoyed this video please
