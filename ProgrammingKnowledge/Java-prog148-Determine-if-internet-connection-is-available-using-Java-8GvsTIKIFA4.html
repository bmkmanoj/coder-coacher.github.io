how to check whether active internet
connection is present in your computer
with the help of your java swing
application so let's get started what I
have done is I have taken a button J
button from my swing controls and I have
added it it's text just right-click and
added its text and just I have made this
button font size a little bit bigger so
just take a button and change its text
and then double click this button and
then go at the top and write import Java
dot net dot star and then in the button
click event here what we are going to
write is first of all we will make a
try-catch block first so just make try
and catch the exception and finally try
and catch the exception just write this
kind of skeleton for try catch block and
in here inside this try try block or
above this tried block right here socket
sock is equal to new socket and in the
next line right
I net socket address and write a DDR for
example is equal to nu I net socket
address here and close the bracket and
inside these bracket we will pass two
argument first will be the sum site name
so that we can check whether this site
is reachable or not and second is the
port so I will use port 80 and here I
will use www.google.com for example so
write this and in here inside this try
block we will copy this socket object
from here and right dot connect and
automatically it will take this I night
socket address and second argument just
pass here for example 300 this is packet
and now you can show this in a J option
pane so let's try to show the answer or
result in J option pane so right just
below your socket dot connect code just
make a simple J option paint code so
Java X dot sewing dot J option paint
dots show message dialog and first
argument would be null for example
because I don't want to give any title
to it and second option will be the
result so result maybe we can show it in
the boolean format so if packets are
received then we will say
string dot value off because we are
converting the value from bullion to
strength so we write true or else you
can just show this message here true
okay
and in the catch block first catch block
here just copy and paste the same
joptionpane and if the so if the packets
are not received then we will write
false here and then in here in this
other try catch block which is covered
in this finally right copy the socket
and right dot close
okay so just write this code if you want
you can just pause the video and copy
the vid copy the code from here and just
right-click and run the code and we will
check if the code is working or not so
right now my internet is connected so it
should show true message so just see I
click it and it's showing true that
means my internet connection is
available and for example I disconnect
to my internet or I disconnect from my
internet so I will write whoa disconnect
from the internet and now check this
internet connection is available or not
now it's saying false that means it's
not getting the packets and it's saying
false once again check so we I will a
connect to the internet once again and
internet connection is available yeah
connected and I will just press this
button is internet connected
and saying true so in this in this way
you can check whether the active
internet connection is available on a
computer or not so I hope you have
