going to show you how you can show the
time dynamically so if you see this time
this time and date I have shown you in
the 13th video Java proof
13 and in that video I have shown you
how to show date and time so if you
don't know this code or displaying date
and time you can click to that video
which is video number 13 I will also
provide the link below so you can
directly click that so this I have shown
you in the video number 13 but the
problem here is the time or the date
doesn't change dynamically this is the
time which is
printed when the program starts running
and it stays until the program and but I
want this time to change dynamically so
this second should change 34 35 36 like
that and when the minute changes it
should also show there so everything
should change according to the correct
date in time so how you can do that I
will show you today so let's get started
go to your source code and this is the
code I have shown you in the video
number 13 which I was talking about so
in this video
this was the code to write or display
static date and time so if you don't
don't know that just copy this code from
there and this is the method called
current date
so copy this method from there and we
will start from here and we will write
the code further from here
so what you need to do is in order to
change the time dynamically you need to
use a property called thread so we are
going to learn thread also today and
let's see how it's done
so below this code for date and time
just below go below that and right
thread and give the name so I will name
my thread as clock is equal to MU
we tried bracket and closed after that
you have to write here before semicolon
or I will delete the semicolon you need
to provide these troop and brackets and
then semicolon and just give a space in
those brackets and between these two
brackets I will write public wide run
and it will also have two brackets so
do this and in between your run you have
to provide a loop which will be infinite
loop so you can give why
and you can give here the condition one
or instead of wire using while I will
better use for four and just write two
blank spaces so this loop will run
forever until your program runs and in
between this four loop what you have to
do is first of all
you can print something here so I will
print first of all I will show you some
print values system dot out dot print
line and I will show some value for
example
P
and then we have to learn it
sleep and here you have to provide the
time so if I write here thousand then it
indicates that it is sleeping my thread
is will sleep 4000 millisecond but it
shows some error which is I haven't
surrounded my code in try and catch
block so I will do that so when I click
this my sleep function is surrounded
into a try and to catch block so I have
done that and now I will run the program
to see that my this word P changes per
second so it will when I run this
program it will change or it will print
P per second so let's run the program by
the way this method current date
I have called in my main program so this
is my main program which is same as my
form name so if you have some doubts
this is your name main program same as
your form name so I have called that
into my main program this function
current date so it will run continuously
from starting and when I run this
program
nothing happens here you have to see
here so it's not showing some print
values so let's see what is the problem
so in here when you started your thread
clock and after this brackets and this
and go here you can see this thread we
have started and after this thread at
the last you have to write or copy this
variable name clock and paste it here
dot star
so I haven't started the clock that's
why it was not showing anything so this
is the pull code and now I will run the
program
and you can see here the B is changing
per second now B is printing per second
so this is our thread in this way you
can write your thread and now I will
show how to change your time dynamically
so in this method what you have to do is
instead of this printing of P again and
again we will copy our code which we
have written in 13 video number 30 the
whole code I will cut that code which
which shows date and time cut and
instead of this P I will paste my whole
code so what it will do is after every
hundred thousand millisecond it will
change my time and it will show in my
label label which is text time and which
is this these labels so what I have done
is I have cut my program from my date
from video number thirteen and instead
of printing P I have pasted this code
and now when I run the program
you can see your time is changing
dynamically
right so the seconds are changing and
should I wait for what is more second to
show you your minute also change and
your are also changed I think it will
change so in 30 seconds I will tell you
some other things that if you have some
question you can paste our right into my
Facebook account also and I will try to
answer your questions there and now we
have 5 seconds so see our minute changes
or not yes it changes so in this way you
can show the time or you can change the
time dynamically and show in your Java
chip ring so I hope you have learned
something new today
please rate comment and subscribe and
bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
