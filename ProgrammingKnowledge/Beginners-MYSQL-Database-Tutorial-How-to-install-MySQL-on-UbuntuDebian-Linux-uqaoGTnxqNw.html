how to install MySQL server on your
Ubuntu operating system so first of all
and go to your terminal and open your
terminal and once your terminal is open
just type in this command sudo apt - get
install MySQL server and click enter and
it will ask for your password so I will
give my password first and it starts
installing MySQL on your system and then
if you want to download it just give yes
why and it starts downloading and in
between while installing it will ask for
the password and whatever password you
want to give to your MySQL server you
can give to your MySQL so now you can
see it's asking for the password the
default user name is a root and you just
need to give the password for example I
want to give the password here it's a
very simple password so you can remember
and I click OK and it asks for the
password again so repeat password oh my
SQL so once again I will give the
password
and click enter and now your MySQL
server will complete installing it will
also
install MySQL client so you can query
the database so when you install MySQL
server the client is installed with this
package right so you don't need to
install the client client
separately so once your MySQL server is
installed you can see here the process
not taking place and everything is
configured right now now once again I go
to my terminal and I will check if it's
really installed so just I will type my
sq SQL and press ENTER and you can see
the MySQL is installed and you can vary
your database from here right so first
of all we will see what I have what are
the databases present in the MySQL by
default so I will right here show
databases and I will close this by a
semicolon and I press ok
enter and by default I have information
schema and test kheema database is
present but these are only the databases
which you can see and you need to give
your password with this mysql command in
order to see the full list of databases
so if you want full access to the MySQL
server I will just quit my program once
again and with this MySQL command I will
give user root and password so just give
this command to have the privileges of
super user so write MySQL - you and then
your username which is by default route
the space - P and click enter and it
will ask for your password so I will
give my password for the MySQL right not
your computer password so I will write
my password and now it's open with the
superuser privileges
once again I give show databases and now
you will be able to see more list of
database right because you are now have
the privileges of super user so that's
it this is how you can install MySQL
server on your on your open to operating
system in the coming video I will also
show you how to install MySQL workbench
and how to use MySQL workbench so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
