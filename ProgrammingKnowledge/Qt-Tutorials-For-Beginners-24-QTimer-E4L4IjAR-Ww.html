cute tutorial for beginners in this
video you'll learn how we can use two
timer class in QT the queue timer class
provides repetitive and single sort
timer to use so let's see how we can use
them so what I have done is I've created
this sample queue timer demo project and
first of all what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to my main window dot H file
and first of all we will include this
had to our header file so just include
queue timer okay so this is our class
which we want to include and then we
will define an object of this timer
class in our private section here so
just write Q timer and then just use
this pointer and then define the name of
your timer for example timer itself the
object name okay now we are going to
define a public slot function which we
will use to connect to our timeout
function using queue timer so in here
just go here and then we will define a
special kind of access classifier which
is specially used in QT which is public
slots okay and then give this : and
under this we are going to define our
slot function for example we can just
define here void my function okay this
is the function name which I have
provided
okay so just define the object of your
queue timer class and public slot
function here now I'm going to give you
a little trick how you can you know
define the Declaration of this function
in your CPP file using this shortcut so
right click on your function and then go
to refactor
and then you will be able to see add
definition in main window dot CPP file
right so just choose this option which
will you know define this function in
your CPP file also right so you don't
need to write your code manually okay so
in this CPP file we are just giving some
code to our function for example we want
to just print something using this Q
timer so what we are going to do is we
are going to include class for printing
our output for example Q debug class
okay
and using this Q debug you can just use
Q debug here and then you can use it
like a output function for example
update okay so this is what I want to
print here right now in the constructor
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my timer object which I have
defined here which is this one in the
CPP file and then I'm going to
initialize this timer object so just
write new Q time' and then we are going
to give the parent to it so this
constructor takes the parent right you
can see so this is the parent just write
this here and then we will define the
connect function here so just write
connect and then in this case first of
all our sender for this connect is timer
object so just write this timer here as
a first argument and the second argument
is the signal right so just to write
signal and our signal will would be a
default function which
is timeout function okay the third
argument is the parent so just write
this and the fourth argument is the slot
so just right slot here and slot will be
the function which we have defined which
is this one so just copy this function
and then provide it here okay and then
just close your connect and now we can
just start this timer by using a
function called start so just choose a
timer and then call a function called
start here now this start function takes
one argument which is the time in
milliseconds so whatever interval of
time we want to provide here we can give
here in as an argument of this start
function for example we give here 1000
so it takes time in milliseconds so 1000
here means one second if you want to
give the timeout of two second you will
write two thousand or something like
this so for example I want to give the
timeout of 1000 right so let's compile
our code and let's see what it does when
we run our app so it's compiling and
building and once it's build we are
going to run this so let's run it and
you will be able to see here when it's
running
you see it's printing update every
second right so it's printing update
every second that means this update
function or my function is called every
second and this is called due to this
line of code which is the signal and
slot mechanism which we are using and
this function is called sequential e at
the interval of one second okay you can
for example provide here two second
in double or less provided five-second
interval and let's see what happens so
your output will be printed every five
seconds here right so you have to wait
for 5 seconds and then after 5 second
the second output right so this is how
you're a two-time of Vox now this timer
is not very precise but for your normal
time operations you can use it now in
the next video I'm going to show you how
you can create a digital clock using
this cue time a class so stay tuned and
