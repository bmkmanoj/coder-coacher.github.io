till now we have made our tape frame
like that and when in this different
when you click Jane table any row do not
having be displayed and employ in four
boxes but sometime you in addition to
taking you want that if you press arrow
button so data should change here also
wherever it is highlighted which
whatever row is highlighted a Tata
should come here sometimes you want that
also I'll show you what is what are
arrow buttons for example if you put
down arrow the data should change while
pressing down or when you press a button
the daughter should change also but till
now what happens is when we click
anything then only the data changes not
when we press up or down button today I
mean tell you how to do that from up and
down button so let's get started go to
your table
right-click your table go to event go to
event and click key pressed that is the
first of the three event we will go
directly to our key press event and in
this event you have to write one if
statement you will be done and the if
statement you have to it e V T dot get
key code
is equal to
tea
event dot whatever key you want they
will appear here so we want weekly
underscore down key so do W M
and then once again you know or we want
to function with up key or down key so
this is we make for donkey and similar
function we will make for up key so I
copied just this code and paste it after
or here and instead of down even right
we K underscore up here is that so one
time even not get key code is equal to K
even taught VK underscore down or EVT
dot get key code is equal to ki even dot
up and in between your if method a
condition you have to
pay something so what you have to paste
right click your J table go to mouse and
mouse click and this will give you to
the method we have created previously in
order to populate your J table sorry not
for J table but when you click any row
of the J table we have made this code
for that in our previous videos so same
video FA same code from try to catch you
have to copy and
you have to paste this all into your F
conditions so what have you done you
have written your f conditions this and
in between F condition you have tonight
try and cash blog and in try and crack
at block
you should write hint the row is equal
to your table name table variable name
not cat selected row then string table
whatever you want to name your table
table click is equal to table employee
table name dot get model not get value
at Row Row is this variable comma 0 dot
two string and then you have to write
your colleague query string SQL is equal
to select from whatever your table is
where employee ID is equal to this table
click which is our this variable okay
then we should write PS T is equal to
corn not prepared script eight node and
in bracket you should write SQL then RS
is equal to PS T dot execute query and
then in eight condition R star next you
should declare for string variable in
which you are going to pass the column
employee ID column name colon surname
and column age from database you store
the value in this variable and show all
the values of ad very me in this text
field which I have shown previous video
and I have teach to you how to get data
in the text field and click any row in
the J table
so now I think we are ready to run the
program
and we will try here first we will click
our table and see our daughter comes in
a 16 or not yes it comes and now my
cursor is here so I'm pressing up key
and our data changes by pressing up key
and also when I press down key then also
my daughter changes an employee field
when I press down see k see it here so
in this way you can change your data by
pressing the key also in the text field
I hope you enjoyed that we do and
learned something from that and I should
close with this video now so please rate
comment and subscribe and thanks for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
