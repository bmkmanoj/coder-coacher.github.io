combo box with your Windows C++
application so let's get started so
first grab combo box from your text or
toolbox here and I will show you how to
add some strings into the combo box how
to show combo box values into the text
field and how to delete the string from
combo box so for that I need a button
and I need text box
so
is it text box
I will copy and paste button so I have
two buttons I will name them as
first
and
and second button I would name it as
great okay
so let's get started first of all I want
to add data whenever I click this Add
button and whatever in I right into this
text box it should go and add into this
combo box so I will double click it and
it will lead me to the code area and
make some indent and once again I will
go to the form and I will copy the name
of my combo box so go to the property
and I will copy this name and once again
to the code I will paste my combo box
name here and then this arrow pointer
and I write item and then add and then
we make here bracket and bracket closed
and in between this bracket what I want
to add is the text from this textbox so
I will select this text box and I will
copy its name and then we go to my code
and I will place it here and then arrow
pointer and text
so this will add text to my combo box
let's try to run the program
so
let's see if it runs or not it shows me
some error okay so instead of item I
need to write items here so keep in mind
combo box
the arrow pointer items arrow pointer
add X from the text box so let's run the
program once again
yes it's once give my username and
password and it goes to the second page
so for example I will write here hi
people and add and here you can see it's
added now I want to add some more things
for example good I want to add good and
I reek lik this add button and I have
clicked two times this Add button to two
times good comes here so this from this
button we are able to add this data now
from clicking this button you want to
delete the data from this combo box so
how can we do that we will see ok break
stop debugging and once again go to your
design page and click this delete button
two times or double check it
so for removing this text and copy my
combo box name here and then once again
this arrow pointer item items arrow
pointer and instead of add I will write
remove from here and here whatever I
will write in or whatever I pass it will
be removed from my combo box so I want
to remove the selected item of my combo
box so I will copy this combo box and
provider
arrow pointer and then text and I think
it will delete data from combo box so
let's try and run the program yes
user name/password current so
it's empty right now and I will add
hello it's added
and downright world and it's also added
and now I want to delete this world so I
will select this and I will just click
delete button and it's dated you see now
I want to delete this hello also so I
will click this delete and it's deleted
so nothing is coming once again add this
world so world again so in this way you
can add and delete data into a combo box
so these are basic building blocks of
using combo box and in the next video I
will show you how to populate this combo
box with the database values so for
example I want to populate all the names
in my database in this combo box how can
I do it I will show you in the next
video so please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
