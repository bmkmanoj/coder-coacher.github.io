video I will show you how to write a
code for a text box so that it only can
accept the numbers or numerical values
and not the other characters so for
example I have been showing you this
code in my video series in which I enter
employee ID name and all the data of the
employee and when I press save the data
is saved into the database but right now
when for example I want to enter the age
and in this field I could be able to
type any string characters also like
this which I don't want that user should
be able to enter these characters where
it is supposed to enter the numerical
values only so I want to restrict the
user so that it can only or he and he or
she can only enter the numerical values
so let's see how can we do that so I
will just close the run project and just
go to the text in which you want to
restrict the user to enter only the
numerical values so this is the H
textbox and then I will go to the
properties of this textbox and I will go
to the event section so click press this
event in the properties and then I go to
the research for the key press event
here
okay just go here and this in this creep
keypress event just double-click it and
we will go to the key press event of the
textbox age right and in here you just
need to write the code so write this
code here so you need to write this code
which is care and give it a variable
name is equal to e dot key care which is
this e okay keypress event argument e so
e dot key cap and then give it a
condition if condition in the bracket
give first of all not equal to sign this
sign and then write cap dot is this
digit and in the bracket pass this
variable okay so what this will do is it
asks the textbox only to accept the
digit values calf dot is digit it's
checking if the entered value in the
text box is digit and otherwise if we
press the backspace key so this it
signifies the backspace key okay so I
will show you just swipe the code if in
the bracket not not equal to K dot is
digit and pass this care variable and
once again copy this care variable not
equal to 8 and if you go to the
Microsoft key enumeration
table so just Google for Microsoft key
enumeration for c-sharp and you will
come to this page here which is of
Microsoft and in here you will find the
key enumeration for different keys of
the keyboard so I'm searching for the
backspace key
so the backspace key has the enumeration
or the number 8 that's why I'm using the
8 number there okay if you want to be
able to press some other keys like for
example I want to use the Delete key
also so I will search for it and this is
del key which is 46 right so what I will
do is I will go to my code and I'll just
copy this thing and I will make a space
paste it here and here I will just enter
46 so my I can press backspace key or
delete key or any digit other than that
if I press any key it will not be
entered into the textbox so let's see
what I am talking about so just write
this code and then run your code
username and password and in here I
could be able to write anything he also
any text here also any text and in here
when I press any string I'm pressing so
many keys at a time for the string but
it's not accepting
but when I press any number for example
any numerical value it's taking or when
I press backspace it's taking the
backspace also okay so it's only taking
the numbers and backspace and it will
also take the delete also but that's not
true for this case because I cannot
delete without going back so here for
example I go here and I press Delete
it's taking the delete also okay so it's
taking delete back spaces and number
nothing else I keep on pressing some
other keys but it's not taking so that
that's how you can restrict your key or
text box to take only the numbers in
this way you can customize your text box
to take only number strings it's on your
imagination how to use this code okay
and for the key enumeration just go to
this just search for key enumeration for
c-sharp and you will come to this
Microsoft enumeration page and you can
see what key stands for what number okay
so I hope you have learned something new
