video I am going to show you how you can
pass values from one form to another so
suppose we have been developing the this
application of login username and
password and then the second form opens
and for example I want to give for
example login username and password and
when I login I want to show or I want to
greet the user by his name and some
message to him for example welcome
whatever the user name is so I'm going
to show you exactly that in this video
so they are many ways of transferring
values from one form to another but I
will show you basically two ways of
doing this so let's see the first way so
what you need to do is just go to the
code for the form 1 from which you want
to pass the values right so in here this
is form 1 right and this form 2 is where
you want to pass the value right so what
you can do here is just go to the
constructor of your form which is this
one so constructor of form is what it's
the same name as your class name so my
class name is form 2 and the constructor
here is form to the same name as your
class name so this is called the
constructor and you can pass the values
using this constructor of your form
class form to class for example by
passing some argument here so go to this
bracket in the constructor basically the
basic use of constructor is initializing
the values right so here we can for
example write the what we can write
right string and some value so I will
say this is username okay and so this I
have I will use to initialize this form
to object from form one so go to form
two where you want to pass the values
and go to the constructor here and just
add this line to the constructor and
then go to form one and I want to pass
the values on the basis of this login
successful right whenever this login is
successful on the basis of that I want
to pass the values so I will just click
this button because here I was checking
the username and password and if the
username and password is correct then I
where I was going to the second form if
you are following these videos and if
you can see here as soon as I change the
constructor here the initialization of
this form to constructor is showing the
error because now it's expecting some
value or string values inside this
bracket because we have initialized our
constructor by this okay so we are
expecting string value inside this
bracket from the form one right so if
you have seen my login form video I have
shown you how you can open the second
form by this form to object okay so in
form two is the and the object name is
equal to new form two and then I will
just show the form by F to show dialogue
okay but now this time what I need to do
I will need to pass some string value
here so what I can pass I can pass my
username in this initialization of form
to just go to the username here copy the
name of your textbox go here where we
were so this is the code I have shown
you in the login when I have shown you
how to login to the page create a login
page right if you remember okay and when
username and password is correct we are
redirecting to the second page right and
in here in this form to constructor
declaration you can pass this textbox a
name dot text because this textbox named
and dot txt text is also a string right
and we are initializing this form to by
this string and the form two is
expecting this string so then we can
access this string and we can use it in
the second form so how you can do it for
example I want to show this same value
of username to the to the second form I
will take a label from here let me see
where is the label here label and in
this label I want to show this so I will
just change the font size and then I
want to show the message in this label I
will not change the label and a name for
now but you can change it and in here in
the constructor here in the form too
what you can do is just to inside this
come to constructor and you can say
label dot text is equal to the username
okay so because you have initialized
this form to with the username
whatever user enters here it will be
passed to the form to here in this
constructor and then it will pass to the
label tool so let's see if it works or
not
so username and password remember
username is two right so username and
password is correct and it's showing
some error let's see what's the what is
this error so it says object reference
not set as an instance of object okay so
let's do it
so I see the problem here because we are
assigning the value to the label bit for
initialization of the component occur
this label label will throw an error
because it doesn't know before
initializing of the component what this
label is so just cut this code and paste
it below initialized component so once
you're in components are initialized
then you can assign this value to your
label
okay so just paste any code below this
initialize component function okay once
again username and password and we are
expecting this to in the second form X
you you see here two is coming here you
can do it in more interactive way like
this in here you can write in the form
one or form two you can just try it
label dot txt and you can say as a
string you can say welcome and whatever
the user name is right with a plus
concatenation operator okay now it will
treat your user by welcome so let's try
it once again
and you see welcome or whatever the
username is okay now I will show you the
second way of doing or passing the
values from one form to another so I
will remove this label assignment here
and in here also in the form -
declaration I will delete this and I
will make it as the way it was initially
write form - was like this and in the
form 1 we have changed this I make it
like this
like it was initially set right now we
can use properties see shop properties
to transfer the values from one form to
another so what you need to do is in the
form 1a class go at the top here in the
form 1 class you can declare a public
variable so you can write public and
this will be a strength it will return a
string so you can write
string and then you can give a name for
example use a name and you can use sket
and set properties so what you can do
you can just write get and then
semicolon and then private this will be
try with set and why I am doing private
setting the value is private because I
do not want that in the form to this
setting of the value has to be done okay
it should be done in the form 1 and I
want don't want to give the axis of this
user name in the second form otherwise
the second form will be able to change
the name and then this user name will
not be safe so the setting of this user
name should be private to form one and
getting should be you know public okay
so this get value can be exist in here
but the set value cannot be exist here
right if you don't know what are
properties I will paste a link below
this this video so you can see what are
property and how to use properties in
c-sharp so you might be wondering what
are properties or you are beginner to
the C shop then I will paste your link
so you can click it and watch it and
watch what properties are so this is a
property declaration and this user name
is our property for example and we are
getting and setting this property by get
and set method okay so we have declared
the string as a public variable in which
setting of the value is private
two for one right now once again go to
this login form and double click it and
on the successful checking of the
username and password if the username
and password is correct once again I
will open the second form but this time
what I am going to do I am going to pass
the form instance as an argument right
so I will go to first of all form in the
form two and in the form two constructor
as I have done I have passed here a
string I can pass a form one also from
one class form one write for one and I
can say this is F one instance so now it
will take form one class object okay so
this is form two and we are passing or
initializing in the constructor form two
as an argument right now once again go
to your form one and in here you will
see an error because now it expect a
form one class as an argument so you can
just give it like this you just need to
write this here and this keyword
indicates the class you are in this
indicates form one because we are in
form one right now so now whenever you
need to pass any values from form one
you will be able to access all the
values which are public and from one in
the form two as an instance of form one
right so what I can do is I will just
copy this username here and once again
go to the login button and just above
this form one declaration or
you can do it up just after this
username and password correct message
username is equal to the textbox name
which is this one and dot txt okay so we
have set this property to the username
which we are getting from the text box
and now because we are passing this F
one instance to the form 2 declaration
we can access this username variable
from from for form 1 to the form 2 by
using an instance of form 1 so just go
above this form to where you have
declared form or past this instance of
form 1 as an argument and you can just
copy it like this and make a public
variable of form 1 and this you can make
it like this this underscore before 1
okay so we know that this is an instance
of form 1 and now what you can do here
you can just write just below your
initial initialize component method or
function whatever you want to say but in
C shop we say it pump method right you
just need to get this F 1 field from
here so just write this dot F 1 is equal
to this F 1 which we are getting from
the initialization from here right and
now we have the instance of form 1 in
this F 1 variable so just copy this and
you can just
pass this variable or you can access
this F 1 variable anywhere in any method
here because it's a public public pH
right so whatever I want to do is I will
write label 5 I think it was is equal
dot txt first of all I need troit dot
dot text is equal to F 1 the instance of
form 1 dot the username so just write
dot and you will find username somewhere
so it just write you and you see it
automatically so shows username field so
you can access this username from this
form to and this username was the P here
if you remember so once again I will run
the program and username and password
and you can see this is shown here and
you can make it even better by giving
some initializing message so just give
high whatever the user name is but this
should be a string so just write high
and the username with this plus
concatenation operator and you can once
again give this plus concatenation
operator and you can say how are you
today ok run the program and username
and password and you see oh hi and the
username is 2 how are you today
ok so in this way you can pass the
values from one form to another using
these two methods there are other ways
of doing this
but I have shown you these two ways
which you can use so I hope you have
