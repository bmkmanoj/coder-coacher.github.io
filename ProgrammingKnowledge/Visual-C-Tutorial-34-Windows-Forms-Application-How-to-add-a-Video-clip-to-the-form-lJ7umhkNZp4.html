of Visual C++ windows form application
in this video I will show you how to
open a video in your form so this is a
window player which I am embedded in the
form and for example I choose a path of
a video and I press start video so video
will start and when I press stop video
video will stop so how do I do it I will
show you so first of all what I have
done is I have gone to my toolbox I
right clicked it and I click choose
items and then on the tabs I selected
calm components and then I went at the
bottom and I selected Windows Media
Player just shake it and press ok what
it will do is it will create a tool in
your toolbox called Windows Media Player
when you drag this Windows Media Player
in here it will look like the same so
this is a Windows Media Player just
resizes according to your use and then
what I have done is I have taken three
buttons one for starting the video
second for stopping the video and third
for choosing the path of the video and
in here this textbox I will use to show
the path of the video okay so one two
three four five things I have taken for
showing the video now what I will do
first of all you can change the name
start/stop of your buttons and then I
will select my choose video button and
double click it and I will reach to its
code and I have added these three lines
into my code so what I have done is I
have added open file dialog gab your
variable name you can give any variable
name DC new open file dialog once again
this form copy and paste it and then
copy this variable paste it here and
arrow pointer show dialog and then copy
the name of your text box which is this
text box sorry this text box my text box
name is text to a box one so once again
I will go to the code I will paste this
text box name here and arrow pointer
text is equal to once again copy this
variable and paste it here and 0.0 file
name so what this will do is it will
open a dialog box to choose the file
path
and then it will copy the file path into
your text box okay so just write these
three lines just pause the video if you
want and then copy and paste these these
lines then what I have done is every
once again go to my form so this is
choosing the file now how to start the
video I will click start video button
double click it and I need to add these
two lines so what are these two lines I
will just select my Windows Media Player
and copy the name of my Windows Media
Player from here just copy all the name
and paste it here arrow point the URL is
equal to text box which is your text box
named arrow pointer text so what this
line will do it will pass whatever is in
the text box in the form of URL in the
Windows Media Player and the second line
just same window media player variable
then arrow point of CTL controls arrow
point of claim so this line will play
the video so it will start the video so
just write these two lines
and then once again go to your form and
in here once again write or double-click
your stop button so I will W click the
stop button and here you just need to
add this one line which is the name of
your window media player which is a X
window media player one by default arrow
point the CTL controls arrow pointer
stop so this will stop your Windows
Media Player so I have done these three
button codes and now let's once again
run our code and how it's running so
this is my form and when I choose a file
I can choose any file I choose a file of
my video which I have made and I will
just mute the volume so it will not
distract the video and I just start
video and it started
okay and when I just press the stop
button it's stopped now I want to play
some other video so I once again click
Choose with you I choose other video and
then I press once again start with you
so it shows the other video and then
once again stop so in this way you can
choose any video which is present in
your PC or notebook and play in this
form within the form so this is very
useful application for your project if
you want and I hope you have learned
some new thing this time so please rate
