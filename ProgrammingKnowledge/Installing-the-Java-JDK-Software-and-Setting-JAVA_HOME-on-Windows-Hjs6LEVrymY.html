show you how you can install Java JDK on
your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 operating
system so just open your favorite
browser and search for Java JDK and
press enter and the first link most
probably which will appear here will be
from Oracle comm for Java just click
this link and then you just need to
agree and proceed and in here you can
see two options one is Java download and
second option is NetBeans IDE which we
do not want ok
so just click this option which says
Java and in here you can see many
options for installing Java on different
operating system so we want to install
Java on our windows operating system
which is 64-bit operating system so just
click this link which says Windows x64
if you have 32-bit windows operating
system you need to choose this x86
option ok so in my case I will choose 64
because I have 64-bit operating system
but first of all you need to agree with
this license and condition so you need
to check accept license agreement and
then you can install Java so once this
executable file is downloaded we can
start installing this java jdk on our
windows operating system so now our
executable file is downloaded so we are
going to start installing it by clicking
this executable file and it will start
the java setup for us and i will
minimize my browser and it will start
this java SE development kit update so
just click Next here and just leave
everything as default click Next
and now the Java installation will start
and in here to show you the destination
folder where this Java JRE and the Java
JDK will be installed
GRE stands for Java runtime environment
and JDK stands for Java development kit
ok so just leave them as default and
click Next and now this installation
will start and you can see this progress
bar once it reaches to the 100 or
completion our Java installation will be
completed so now we can see that Java is
successfully installed in here you will
also see if you want to you know use
this Java development kit for learning
Java or some document api's if you want
to read them then you can just click
next step and it will open these this
website for documentation in your
favorite browser whatever you choose
here otherwise you can close it and now
you can go to your folder Explorer go to
C folder and in here go to Program Files
and in here you will be able to see this
Java folder and where you will be able
to see this JDK folder and JRE folder ok
so now we want to set the environment
variables so that our Java will be
recognized whenever some program want to
execute some java application ok so what
we need to do is for simplicity I am
going to change the name of this folder
as so I will rename it as just jdk and
for JRE folder i will do the same i will
remain
it as GRE okay now what we need to do is
we need to go to the system so search
for system in your Windows 8 operating
system and in here go to advanced
settings and in here we need to click
this option called environment variables
ok and in the environment variable there
is a category called system variable and
system variable you just need to search
for this variable called path and click
Add it and in here so many paths you
will be able to see so you may not want
to you know disturb any path but you
just need to go at last and give a
semicolon here and then what you need to
do is you need to go inside this JDK
folder and inside this JDK folder go
inside bin folder and here all the Java
related the executable files are here so
just copy this path up to bin and go to
your environment variable which is path
and after the semicolon paste this path
here ok and once again give the
semicolon and same we will do for the
JRE folder so select JRE folder inside
the Java folder and then select your bin
folder and just copy the path and at the
last of this environment variable just
paste it ok and now you don't need to
give any semicolon I think ok you just
need to click OK and click OK ok so this
will set your environment variables now
in some cases you may also need to set
your Java home environment variable and
how we can set this Java home
environment variable is once again go to
the systems and go here in the
environment variable and in here we can
create a new environment variable so go
to a user variable for program
knowledge which is the computer name and
click here new and in here in the
variable name enter a name like this
Java underscore home and in the capital
letters you need to enter this ok so
Java underscore home and then what you
need to do is you need to give the path
of your JDK folder in here so just go to
a Java folder and in here go to your JDK
folder and you don't need to go more
inside in the binary you just need to go
to Java slash JDK and copy this path and
paste it here
so this path is C colon slash Program
Files slash Java / JDK ok and click OK I
will set this Java home as your
environment variable click OK and click
OK ok so once you have done all this you
can check whether Java is installed in
your system or not by just opening your
command prompt so right click on your
Start button here and start your own
prompt and in here just gave the command
called Java C and press Enter and if you
see all these output then it means that
Java is properly installed in your
system
and you can develop Java in your system
java c is the java compiler in command
so you need to give the java file name
along with it to compile Java programs
ok so in this way you can download and
install Java on your windows operating
system I hope you enjoyed this video
