last video I have shown you how to save
data into the database using your Visual
Basic windows form application and MySQL
database now in this video I will show
you how to edit or update your data in
the database using your Visual Basic
windows form application so for that I
will take a button and I will change its
text as update and I will change the
font size so we will be able to see it
properly so I will change the font size
of my button text bold 16 okay now in
the last video if you remember I have
shown you how to save your data to the
database using your visual basic.net
code so I'm going to copy the code from
my Save button click sub event so I will
copy all the code from there and in the
last video I have explained you in much
detail how this code works right so I'm
not going to take much time to write or
rewrite the code once again I will just
add it the code where you need to write
the code to update the data so I will
just click this button for update double
click it and I will paste the code for
the save data which I have written in
the last video and then I will just add
it this code to update the data so this
first two lines if you know is for
connecting the
a MySQL database and your visual basic
project this MySQL reader reads the data
from the database so this is the reader
declaration and in the try-catch block
so this dry and this catch here it
caches if any exception occurs while we
are executing the query and then it
shows the message if some exception
occurs now in the try block we are
opening the connection with the database
and we are declaring a string to write
the query in it so I have declared a
string which with the name query and
here the only part that will change here
to update the data is this query in the
last video this line we have written or
this query we have written to save data
tend to the database now in this video
we want to update the data in the
database so we will write instead of
insert into we will write update
database which is your database name
which is this database dot your table
name my table name is a data so I have
written update dot dot dot e Tata and
then I am going to delete this because I
don't need it and I will also delete
values and I will write set so once
again when I complete the query I will
repeat the query so don't worry and in
here I will I am going to write
name or post is Eid all right a ID is
equal to second column we want to update
is the name so we'll write name here
third column beam one to update is the
surname is equal to and the fourth
column we want to update is age so now I
will once again go through this query so
in the update query we write update
database name dot the table name which
is e dot I in my case then set and in
the bracket we write E ID which is the
name of my first column is equal to in
this single quote double quotation and
this enzyme just write text box dot text
and repeat this sequence once again
comma for name we are going to repeat
this code once again name is equal to
single quote double quote and this end
sign and the name of the text box of
name dot text and and just close this
with the same procedure comma surname is
equal to the text box name of the
surname dot txt and comma age is equal
to the text box name of the age dot text
so this is the query to update the data
and instead of showing data saved we
just change the message as data updated
okay so this is the code to update your
data in the database using your visual
basic windows form application let's
check our
code if it's working or not so I will
run my code and I will open my tables so
we can see if data is really changed or
not I will log in my form and here I
want to change for example but wait I
forgot some really fast so my query was
update data dot table name said the
column name is equal to the text name
and after this bracket where this
bracket for all the setting for the
column completes this course this
bracket starts from here and closes here
you need to write the reference of the
column on the basis of which you want to
update your data so just write where
your column name for example you want to
update the data on the basis of employee
ID so you can write e ID is equal to
once again single quotations in between
double quotations in between this and
sign and just give the name of the
employee ID text box which is this and
just copy the employee ID dot text from
here and paste it here
okay now this query will revoke properly
I will once again run my program and I
will log in to my login page and in here
I will just check whether I am able to
update the data in the database or not
so for example I have this employee ID
17 where I want to change the age
this employee so I will write here
bloody 17 name name of the employee and
surname also I want to change it for
example so I will change the surname for
example changed surname and the age is
66 for example and I will say update I
will click this button and in here it
says me or it returns me some error it
says so this query is giving me some
exception so it says the error says that
I have syntax error in the query so
let's see where my syntax error is in
the query so I will just cancel my
program and I believe in the where in
the update query this bracket doesn't
come so I will delete the bracket from
here and now the query is update
database dot e data set E I D without
the bracket right key ID is equal to
your text in the text box and name is
equal to name in the text box and
surname is equal to surname in the text
box and age is equal to 8 in the text
box where your Eid is equal to the
textbox name for Eid dot text so just
change the bracket just delete the
brackets in the query ok and now once
again we are going to run the program
and we will check me that if we are able
to update the data or not so
once again I want to change 17
employee-id 17 information which is
paul-henri right now I will say changed
name and change surname and age is 100
for example so this data for employee ID
17 should change to this data I will say
update data and I get data updated and
let's refresh the database and you see
here that data of the employee ID 17 is
changed changed name change her name and
ages 100 in the same way you can edit
the data for employee ID 16 some name
some surname and age is it is 6 for
example and update data is updated and
our refreshment data base and you see
here my data is updated according to my
form here so in this way you can write a
query and write the code to update your
database using your visual basic windows
form application I hope you have enjoyed
