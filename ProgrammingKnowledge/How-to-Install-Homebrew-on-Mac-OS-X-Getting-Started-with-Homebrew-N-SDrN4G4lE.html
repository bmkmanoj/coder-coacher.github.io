you how you can download and install
homebrew on our Mac operating system so
first of all what is homebrew home do is
a free and open source software which is
used as a package management system that
simplifies the installation of software
on Mac OS X so let's see how we can
download and install homebrew and then
we will see some example so first of all
open your favorite browser and search
for homebrew and the first link which
will appear here will be from blue dot
SH and we just need to click that link
and once this website is open space
simply just need to copy this line which
is on the main page of this website so
just copy this line and once you copy
this line just minimize your browser and
then open your terminal and then paste
this line so I am going to just paste
this line which I have copied and then
it is going to start installing the
homebrew on your a Mac operating system
so first of all you just need to give
your Mac's password in order to install
it so I am going to give my max password
and then press enter and now the
installation process will go on and
sometimes homebrew will be installed so
it said that simple process you just
need to copy this line and then paste it
into your terminal and then everything
will take care of itself
so now India is installed on our Mac
operating system so let's see some of
the command related to help you and
let's see how we can install or update
or update some packages using your mu so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just clear the terminal so let me clear
the destiny which I have used for
installing homebrew and let's say I want
to install node on my Mac operating
system using homegroup so no does
no just let's say I want to install a
lab kit or any other packages which were
supported by hope you for that I just
need to use a command called the new
install and then whatever package or the
installation we want to be on our system
so for example let's say I want to
install mode so I will just write mode
here ok and then press Enter which is
going to install node on our Mac
operating system so you can see the
installation process has begun first of
all it's going to install the
dependencies and then installing more
dependencies and then it's going to
install node itself so now load is
installed on my system using brew
similarly if you want to install git you
can just give brew install yet and it
will install get on your system now in
order to list or in order to list all
the versions of a particular package you
just need to give this cannot brew list
and then - - versions and then whatever
package you want to list so node
packages I want to list out right and
then I'm going to press ENTER it's going
to just show me whatever package which
are installed using brew on my Mac
operating system right now there is a
command called the brew info and the
package name for example node is going
to list out the versions caveats and all
the other information about this package
so I'm going to press ENTER and it gives
me this much amount of information about
this node package so you can see stable
9.4 bottled head and then it will also
show the caveats you can see here mash
completion has been installed to this
location right
let's say if you want to upgrade all the
packages which you have installed using
blue let me clear the terminal first of
all so let's say we want to install all
the packages let's say we want to
upgrade or update in node and gate and
whatever package we have installed using
through we can just write blue up date
okay and this is going to update all the
packages which are installed using blue
so right now I have recently installed
blue so it says already up to date right
now if you want to list out the install
packages we can just write blue and then
list and then press ENTER which is going
to list out all the packages which are
installed using groups so we have
recently installed node and this is
installed by default okay and then we
can use two outdated commands so I'm
going to just write out dated is going
to list out all the outdated packages
right so blue outdated and there are no
outdated packages or there are no
packages which require upgrades right
this is the brief introduction about
home glue how to install it and how to
use it briefly so I hope you've enjoyed
