have been showing you how to install a
Java JDK which is Java development
environment to build your java
application and how to install eclipse
to build your java programs and compile
them with this IDE and in the last video
I have shown you how you can add window
builder plug-in in Eclipse to to make
GUI application in java using eclipse
now in this video I'm going to show you
how you can write your first program
using a GUI plugin or Java builder and
we are going to make our first project
in which we are going to make the Java
GUI using window builder plugin so let's
get started just fire up your Eclipse
IDE and we already have installed will
window builder so when you go to file
here and choose new new option here
first of all what you need to do is you
need to create a new project for
building your application so what you
need to do while new and just say new
Java project
this one and in here you need to give
the name for your project ok
so for example I am going to give the
name job
cooee
demo for example okay and then all the
settings will remain same I will click
Next and everything is ok I will click
once again finish so it has created a
new project for me which is Java GUI
demo and there is nothing much in this
project folder instead of this subfolder
called sauce and there is no file inside
this subfolder so we are going to add a
project file or Java file in here to
make our GUI so go to your project which
you have created and go to this source
folder subfolder there and right click
this source folder and go to new and go
to others or other this is the last
option ok and in here we are searching
for Windows builder which we have
installed in the last video so just
search for this option called window
builder and then this with the window
builder we are searching for swing
designer and we want to select
application window from here ok so just
select in windowbuilder swing designer
application window this one click Next
and now you need to give the name to
your class for that new window so I will
name it as for example frame 1 ok and I
will click finish
and this will create me this frame one
dot Java class and in here it you can
see already some of the code which is
generated by Eclipse for you okay and
when you click this you have this design
view of your project so there is a
source view of your project and the
design you project and in this design
view you can design your frame whatever
application you are working on and in
the source view or your source code you
need to write the the code behind your
GUI okay so we will start with this
design view one thing you will notice
that it's a very small area you are
working on and to increase this area so
that you can easily see this whole frame
and other things you just need to go
here at the top where your a frame one
that Java tab is there just go there and
double click it so click this two times
double click it and we increase your
area and it will hide all the project
wizard here and class wizard here okay
and when you want to go to once again to
the last view view you just double click
it once again okay so double click it
will maximize and double click it will
come to its real state ok so double
click this and now we can see this frame
much easily okay now to add a component
in this frame there is this wizard or
this palette called tool palette or and
in here you have different tools to add
into your frame ok so you have some
button radio button and different panels
split panels and
different kind of tools which you can
use to make your GUI application right
so first of all we need to add a layout
to our frame so there are different type
of layout but for the first video
tutorial I'm going to use this absolute
layout which is really easy to work with
okay so I will just click this once you
just need to click this you don't need
to drag to your frame you just click it
and just move your mouse on your frame
okay so click and move your mouse on
your frame and just click it once again
and then this layout will be added to
your frame this is a layout so you will
not see any change because it's a layout
in your frame so it will not be directly
visible ok so just click this and add it
here right in the same way for example I
want to add a button to my layout which
I have just added which is absolute
layout I will click this J button from
here just click it and then move your
mouse to your frame ok and just click it
once again and I really leave it ok and
when you leave it here you can add it
your content or you can edit the text of
this button directly from here or you
can what you can do here you can right
click and you can do some of the things
from here also auto size and the things
like action perform this is very
important
yeah and otherwise what you can do is
you can select your tool or component
and you can go to the properties of that
component and these are the property you
can change for this component
so there are different properties for
this component and one of the property
is this text property and you can see in
front of text property the text is new
button and this is the text on your
button so you can change this text by
just going to this text property and you
can add your text there so I can add for
example
so
message okay so I want to show some
message when I click this button okay
and there are some other properties
which you can use for example you can
change the font for example if you want
just click the font button here there's
three dots button and you can make it
bold and you can make or increase the
size of this a text okay and you can
even use different font family with your
button and click OK and then you will be
able to see the change immediately on
your button okay you can also change the
background you can just click this and
there are different background for this
button and there are different color
spring colors named colors so you can do
many things with this background okay
and there is something called foreground
so background will change the background
of this button so for example I want to
have the green background light green or
this light green background and I will
click OK and this will change the
background right and I want to change
the foreground of this I can do it also
by going to the foreground property and
I can choose the foreground for example
a little bit dark okay
for example I choose this as a
foreground and when I do this this text
you will see the color of this text is
change okay so in this way you can play
with the properties there are many
properties you can play with and you
will be able to change the property of
your tool or your component okay now
then what you need to do is for example
you want to perform some action when you
click this button so you need to write
some code for that okay so for example I
want to show some message when I click
this button how can I do it I will just
right click my button and I will say add
event handler okay add here event
handler and the first event handler this
is a very basic event handler for every
component which is action performed and
this indicates to the basic action
performed by the component so you can
just go to action and just click action
perform when you click this action
perform you will reach to the
code-behind or source for this button
action performed here so you will see
this here public void actionperformed
right and in here in this method inside
this action perform of this button what
you can do you can write the code to
perform some action so for example I
want to show some message when I click
this button I will go to the design view
once again and you can what you need to
do in order to go to the source code for
this button button action in perform one
you can do this one action perform or
add handler and action perform from here
or otherwise you can directly double
click this button for action perform
just double-click it and you will reach
to the same code here for example I want
to show some message so I can write J
option pain dot show so you can see some
intelligence text come here so what ever
so this Eclipse IDE supports
intelligence and by the use of this
intelligence you will be presented some
of the possible options which you can
use it with your code okay so I will say
show message I want to show some message
so I will just write and double click it
and you will also see the menu when you
hover over this method you will be able
to see some help in here which you can
see and you can read about this what
this code do ok so I want to show some
message so the first argument for this
will be null and the second argument
will be with the message which you want
to show so in the double quotes I can
give my message so for example I can say
hi YouTube
or something something else or whatever
message you want to show so I want to
show hi YouTube okay
and once again I can go to the design
view or I can go to the source view from
here I'm here also and I just will run
this code from here so when I click this
green button here it will give me the
resource or save the changes so it will
ask me do you really want to save the
changes and then it will compile your
program so yes I want to save the chin
so I will say select this frame 1 dot
Java file and click OK I will save my
changes and will show me this message
here right and not the message but the
frame yes which is called jframe and you
can see the background of this button is
green and foreground is a little bit
dark okay when I click this button I
want to sheet see the message which I
have written hi YouTube so I will click
this button and you can see the message
here alright you do ok once again so you
will be able to see the messages like
this ok so background color I really
don't I mean I don't really use this
background color I like the inherent
color of these component which is this
this inherent color here so the second
thing for example I want to add a text
box so what you need to do take take a
text box from here and click this
jtextfield
and just move your mouse to the frame
and just click it once again and it says
some error so I will remove this text
box for now it was giving me some error
so let's remove this text box for now
okay once again I will reach to the
message box so for example I will take a
jlabel if I can find it is there any J
label here
J list editor so you need to find your
components from here
so here it is with jlabel so I can just
click this J label and drag and drop to
my J frame and I can change the text of
this J label from here also or from here
also okay so new label I can change the
text
message okay and it will show message
here right or I can change the variable
name for this so when you are using a
bunch of different labels here and you
want to know which label is performing
what you need to change this variable
name from here in order to you know know
what this label is doing so you can just
write label and this is the variable
name by which you will recognize your
label or any components you can change
the variable name from here so I will
say label message okay so - it has
changed the name of this label and then
I can just double click this and instead
of using or showing the message from
this j option pin what i can do i can
show the message in the label also so i
will say the name of the label is if you
can see here the name of the label is i
have changed it to l BL message this is
so just copy this and in this button
action perform just paste it and then
right dot so what was the name of my
label yes this was the name of my label
and I can say
and not showing anything let's see why
so I found out what the problem is when
I dragged and dropped this label in here
in my frame and when I have seen this
label its code is generated locally here
so you see a jape label and then the
declaration of my label name or variable
so what I need to do here is I need to
copy this J label and the name of the
label and at the top at the very top of
my class
just after wherever you see private
jframe frame just below that just write
the Declaration of the label also so
just check whether it's already there if
it's already there then it's okay
otherwise we have to do it manually okay
so just you need to just forward declare
your label name as a global variable
here and in here you just need to remove
this J label from here okay so wherever
your jail label declaration is there you
just need to remove it and then this
makes this label as a global variable
and it can be called from other
functions also okay so this is why we
have done this because whenever we have
dragged and dropped this label in here
its code was generated locally by
eclipse and we wanted to use this label
in other in other functions also okay
this this label name so what we have
done we have change the Declaration of
this label as private J label the name
of the label which you have given it and
we have removed the Declaration of this
J label here and just we use the name J
label is equal to nu
label and this makes your jailable
global and then you can go to design
once again double-click your show
message once again I will make it bigger
show message once again and in this
action perform of this public void
actionperformed you can use this label
message dot set text and I can set any
text to this label so for example I want
to just set the same text to the label
also I can do it like this
ok so label dot said text and I will
just save my program and I can run this
and when I click the show message now
this label is showing hello and we it's
not showing the full YouTube because we
need to resize our label from here so I
can resize my label like this okay
and now the size of label is bigger and
now when I run the program once again it
will show the whole message hi YouTube
yeah right
so this is how you can create your first
project using window builder in Eclipse
IDE and the further videos I will show
you how to use other components and how
to create some interactive project using
window builder in Eclipse using Java I
