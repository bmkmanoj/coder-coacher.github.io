Linux come online to troll for beginners
and in this video we will see how we can
use cal c'mon in Linux now Cal command
can be used to display conventionally
formatted calendar on your command line
so let's see how we can use Cal c'mon
so to use Cal c'mon you can just use Cal
see Al and then press Enter
it's going to show you the calendar kind
of you know output here right and the
date of making this video is for January
2017 for example right so this is the
Cal command which is going to show you
the current month and the date and the
year ok but there are some flags which
you can use with this Cal command
so the first flag I am going to show you
you can use with this command is
actually it's not a flag but it's just a
command you can just use an Cal and then
press enter and now you can see the
output in little bit different format so
earlier your weekdays are at the top but
right now the weekdays are on the left
hand side right so an Cal command can be
used to view the week days on the left
and the Cal command can be used to view
the V taste on the top ok so let me
clear this terminal now the next flag
which you can use with Cal command is
the year so whatever here you want to
see you can just enter the year number
for example I want to see 2016 and then
press enter is going to show all the
months in 2016 year right in the
formatted form so from January to the
December is going to show you all the
you know calendar month here ok let me
clear the
terminal again and now the next command
or next flag which you can use with this
Cal is for example you want to just view
some month in a particular year so for
example I want to see the February of
2014 for example so I can just give two
for February February is the second
month of the year if it's January you
can write one March you can write three
so for example for February I am writing
to okay and then the year in which I
want to see the month so 2014 for
example and press enter and then it's
just going to show that month which you
have entered here not the whole calendar
okay so this is also how you can use the
Cal command now for example you can you
know give the for example Cal minus
three is going to give you the current
month previous month and the next month
okay so just press enter and you can see
the current month is this one previous
month and then the next month and by
default the when you give Cal command by
default this number is minus one and
when you give this it's going to show
you the current current month so there
are many more flags which you can use
with Cal command so I hope you enjoyed
