you how you can download and install
PostgreSQL on your Windows 10 operating
system Foursquare SQL is a powerful open
source object relational database system
so let's see how we can download and
install it so first of all open your
favorite browser and search for
PostgreSQL the first link which will
appear here will be from post square SQL
thought Rajee so does just click this
link and on this website on the top you
will be able to see this download tab so
you just need to click the download tab
and then you just need to search for
Windows option right so because it's
open source and cross-platform database
management system it's available for
Linux Mac OS and other operating systems
also including Windows so we just need
to choose Windows here and then here you
just need to click this link which says
download the Installer and now we are
going to choose the version of the
PostgreSQL which we want to install so
from here you just need to select the
latest version which is at the top
in my case it's nine point six point two
at the time of making this video but it
can be a later on latest version in your
case right and now you need to choose
the Windows operating system x86 64 bit
ok so just choose this option now click
download now which is going to download
the PostgreSQL executable file so I can
see this option for downloading this
executables file it says PostgreSQL 9.6
at the time of making this video and
this executable is about 164 megabytes
so keep in mind that also so let's save
it and once this file is saved we are
going to
installing it so I will pause the video
while this executable file is downloaded
and then we will see how to install it
so now the download of this executable
file is complete so I'm going to double
click on this executable file and I'm
going to minimize my browser and in the
first step this PostgreSQL executable
will ask us to give the user account
control so just click yes at this time
and apparently this installation
requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2013
redistributable so it will download it
automatically you don't need to do
anything but I can see this step that
it's installing this Microsoft Visual
C++ 2013 so let it run and now the setup
wizard will start for PostgreSQL so the
first step is easy just click Next and
this is the location where post gray
will be installed on your Windows 10
operating system if you don't have the
good reason to change it just leave it
as default and click Next and this also
just leave it as default and click Next
and this is the important step here you
need to give a password which you can
remember because you are going to
require this password later when you
want to you know access your co square
database right so just give the password
which you can remember I'm going to give
a easy password which I can remember and
which is also secure right and then I
will click Next and this is the default
port which will be used by your post
Kwai database management system so just
leave it as default if you don't have
the good reason to change it right and
then just click Next and here it says
select the locale to be used by the new
database class
so if you are not sure about the locale
you just need to leave it as default
okay so I am going to leave it as
default and click Next
and in the next step it says setup is
now ready to begin installing PostgreSQL
on your computer so click Next and then
the installation will start for
PostgreSQL so now the installation of
PostgreSQL on my Windows 10 operating
system is complete and I can see this
method which is setup has finished
installing
PostgreSQL on your computer launched
stake builder at exit now what is stake
builder stake builder may be used to
download and install additional tools
drivers and application to complement
your PostgreSQL installation that means
drivers such as for example you if you
are developing C++ application using
PostgreSQL then drivers for that and
other language support and other drivers
also so I will leave it as check this
check box and I will click finish which
is going to start this stake builder
okay now let's see what's there so in
here I can see this PostgreSQL option
here which is my local database if you
have the remote server then you can
choose this one but right now I want to
connect to my local database so I will
choose this option which is the second
option and then click Next and in here I
can see all these options but for now I
don't want any of the add-ons or any of
the drivers right so I'm going to click
cancel if you will click Next
it's going to tell you that you need to
select any one of the packages from this
list right so for now I'm going to
cancel it because I don't want any
driver or any add-on so I will click
cancel and click yes now this take
builder is installed on your system with
the PostgreSQL installation so just go
to your Start button here and then go to
all apps and then we will go to the
letter P and you will see PostgreSQL 9.6
here right so when you expand this you
can see the stake builder is already
installed so whenever you need any
add-on or any you know package you can
open this stake builder and install it
right now in order to connect with your
database which is your local database
which you have installed you just need
to click this option which says PG admin
4 okay so just click this option PG
admin 4 which is going to start PG admin
and the PG admin is going to look like
this right now you just need to expand
this so category here and you will be
able to see this post square scale nine
point six in your case it can be nine
point seven or any latest version right
now you will also be able to see this
cross red cross symbol here that means
you are not connected to your database
right so just click on this PostgreSQL
which is going to ask you for the
password which you have given at the
time of installation right so I told you
to remember this password so you need to
give the same password which you have
given at the time of installation and
you can save this password and then
click OK and this is going to connect to
your database so you can see server
connected that means our connection is
successful with the database I can
maximize this PG admin and we can look
at in a better way now in here you have
the database category and then you have
table spaces so go to databases and by
default this post way has one database
whose name is post quest itself right
this is the sample database and then
menu
you will be able to see all these
sections here so in the Chema's you will
have this publish public section and
then you will be able to see the tables
here also so when you click the tables
right now there is no tables inside your
post quai SQL database but later when
you you know create some tables you will
be able to see those tables here right
and then you have the properties here
and the SQL here so you can execute your
xql queries from here also with this PG
admin now there is another tool which is
called P SQL which is a command line
tool which you can configure for your
Windows terminal and first of all let's
see where our PostgreSQL is installed so
just open your folder Explorer and go to
your C a directory and then in here I
think its installed in my Program Files
and then you can see PostgreSQL and then
you can just click 9.6 version and then
just click bin folder okay so here all
the DLL files and all the executable
files are there right and in here you
will be able to see this tool which is
called P SQL so you need to just set
this P SQL in your environment variable
and then you will be able to run your
queries from your terminal also so just
copy at this path which is up to bin
right and then open your system so just
search for system from here and then go
to system in the control panel and in
the advanced setting just click the
advanced setting here you will be able
to see environment variables and the
environment variables in the system
variables just select the path and
double click it or you can just click
add it also here so just double click on
it and in here we are going to
add the new paths so just click the new
option here and then paste whatever
parts you have copied for the PostgreSQL
bin folder right so just paste this path
here and then press Enter
and now once again go to the folder
where PostgreSQL is installed once again
go to 9.6 folder and now this time just
open the Lib folder from here so just
click Lib and then copy this path also
and then we will add this path also here
so add new and then paste this path and
press Enter
so we have added the bin folder path and
live folder path to our environment
variables for PostgreSQL click OK click
OK and then click ok once again now
PostgreSQL or psql environment is set on
your Windows operating system so now you
can open the command prompt so right
click on your Start menu and you can
open the command prompt from here you
can see the command prompt option or you
can search for command from probe prompt
here also so just search for CMD and you
will be able to see command prompt and
open it from there so here once the
command prompt is there you can give the
psql command so just give psql
and then give the for example - you for
the username and the default username is
poor squares ok so you can just give
posts graphs here and the database name
is also post case in our case you can
see on the PG admin here the default you
know database name is also post squares
ok so you can see the owner is Postgres
and the database name is also post great
so if you are confused you can see it in
the PG admin also right so just click
this day
and you will be able to see there is the
database name and this is the owner name
right so both are same by default so I'm
going to just give psql - you first is
the username here post grave and second
is the database name here so just give
post grace once again post grace and
post gives closes for username and
second is for the database name and then
+ enter and now give you a password
which you have given for the PG admin
also so whatever you have selected your
password at the time of installation you
need to give it here also so I'm going
to give my password and then press enter
and now I am in the Postgres command
shell right so for example there are
some default options here for example
when I give DT I think with the
backslash DT it's going to give me the
relations and for example I'm going when
I'm going to give D U it's going to give
me all the users which are there so
right now I only have one user which is
the post GRA user and it has the super
user privileges which can create roles
create DBS and replication so this is
how you can use post square SQL or psql
terminal also once you have installed
post screen so this is how you can
install post GRA on your Windows 10
operating system I hope you've enjoyed
