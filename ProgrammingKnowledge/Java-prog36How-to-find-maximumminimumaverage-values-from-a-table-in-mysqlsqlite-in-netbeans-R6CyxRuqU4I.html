we have successfully populated J table
which consists of pressure temperature
volume rotational speed and date today
I'm going to show you how to calculate
or how to show the maximum minimum and
average value of your given data these
for example in pressure minimum value is
15 maximum value is 40 and average is
the mean of these five values this is a
very small data set for example you have
been given a data of 365 days and you
want what you want to show it in your
jframe for example here is the program I
have already made and in this the
pressure and all the values of 365 days
is given here and I wanted to show the
minimum pressure one maximum pressure
one an average of pressure of my 365
days so I've made a program and I need a
code and you can see in here I show
that pressure one maximum value is 19
minimum is 0 and average of my pressure
is 5 point 4 3 so how do you do that in
your program I will show you today let's
get started
first of all make
these levels and these text field so
that they can show the parameter minimum
maximum and average values these are all
labels I have taken and take text field
to show the minimum and maximum and
average value and here is the parameter
name I will give it so we are showing
pressure one minimum value maximum value
an average value of the whole data set
okay
so how to do that for example
if you click some button it should show
you minimum maximum and average value so
just right click the button action X
event action action performed and you
will go to its method and always write a
try-catch block I've already written it
to save the time now in here write our
core we will write a query first string
this GM is equal to
new points select select
we have a data table here the doctor
base and our variable name is pressure
program select shell
and in the same way you have to write
max pressure
AVG so this is for minimum this will
give you the minimal pressure just mean
give you the maximum pressure and this
is you give you the average value of
pressure right from whatever you is your
table name so on my table name is user
info write it here select minimum
pressure max flesh and average pressure
then the next line right PST prepare
statement
is equal to
that statement and Indian this is a
string name
- by pointless dot PSD is equal to ast
node execute query
and
make a new string variable string or you
can also okay we will try to take it a
string because we can take the values
from the database in the form string so
right string yeah anybody be negative
and 1 is equal to RS got that string
yeah
right
this minimum pressure so you write this
to the same semicolon and same thing you
have to do three times for minimum
maximum and average values we'll add one
two three and I mean white max with AVG
and then I will copy my variable name
name is that
this is my minimum text clip variable
name so I mean you name it is er
okay for maximum Technol where you be
named EXPEED my name is in its maximum
PR and for average text we level which
then I will copy my minimum text field
variable name which is this and I will
paste it here and then dot set text and
in the text bracket you should write
this I had one so this string value
being an angle is welcome here same
things we do for maximum take the when
you name of maximum value of pressure
paste it here not set text then I will
copy this valuable for maximum
maximum pressure and same thing I redo
it for average value so copy here the
variable name of text field of beverage
and I will just paste it yeah change
this so this is my code and now let's
try to run the program and see if my
program gives me the maximum minimum and
average values or not this is my program
and when I click OK it should give me
the maximum value so you can see to see
that my minimum value is 15 and maximum
value is 40 and the average of these
five pressure value is 27 so in this way
you can also find of so the minimum
maximum temperature volume flow rate or
and rotational speed will show it here
like my last project so
that's all for this video please rate
comment and subscribe and thanks for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
