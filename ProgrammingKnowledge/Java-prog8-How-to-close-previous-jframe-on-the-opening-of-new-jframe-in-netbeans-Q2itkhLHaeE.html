we can see
after logging in new window employee
info window will open but sometimes we
want the login window to hide after this
window is open or at the same time when
this employee info window will open
you want the login window to eyes or
hide or dispose so how can we do that
today I am going to tell you how can
into this so
go to your login shape frame
we will make one new method called
closed public void nose
in this you should write
window.event
when
posing
event is equal to new
no event
and
box you should write this
not
we're going to do
right
endo
in this quote
promotes it
so you should write this after this
I should right
kicked butt
kept default toolkit
not get
sister Mary queue
don't
or statement
look like you should
right this thing
when closing rodent
these two lines we should
and
these two reports if you don't
and these two imports then error will
come into code block
so just and John okay the beauty not a
word but star and import java.awt is not
star
yeah I think I made a mistake instead of
dot we should write to the comma so this
is our small code block or the close we
paste it in the description also so we
can easily copy and paste in your
program then just copy the method name
and
click login
wherever you are opening your employee
info window just after that and this
load method for example and your
username and password is correct then
this window which is log in Jaffna
window will flows and this window will
open
employ info window will open you can do
it and that also you can paste it above
employee info so that when we press
login button first this window will
disappear organ window and then in this
window will open one more thing we need
to do is just click here and the
properties we have to change default
close operation from exit on close to
dispose
now try to run the program
I'm username and password is correct now
you can see only one window is open in
login window is disappeared so that
