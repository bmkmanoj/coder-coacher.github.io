last video I have shown you how to
create these forms in Access database
with these interactive buttons and this
chart
now in this video I'm going to show you
how you can use queries with Access
database
so what are queries queries you can say
is just a fancy name for searches but
queries become very important when you
try to connect your Access database with
some language or with some program you
are making for example in c-sharp or
which will basic or Java so when you
connect your database with a language
you need to pass queries from that
language to your Access database so that
your Access database can return on the
basis of queries so return the result on
the basis of queries so on that on that
point queries becomes very important now
let's see how we can create queries in
Access so we close this and I will open
my table you first so this is my table
and I have added one more field called
pay in this table view so what I have
done is you go to the design view I have
added this pay column and this is a
number and I formatted it with a
currency euro so it will always show
euro in front okay I'll say yes so now
let's start creating queries what you
need to do in order to create queries is
go to this create tab and search for
query wizard ok so just click this query
wizard and you will be presented with
query wizard
for now we are using simple queries just
click OK and now you can choose tables
in which you want to deal with queries
I have only one table so I will select
it and I will select all this data here
and I will click Next and I'll leave it
as default click Next and you can change
the name of this query from here right
now I will leave it as default and I
will say I will modify the query design
and I will click finish so this is the
design view in which you can pass the
queries ok so you have employee ID name
last name and whatever columns you or
table have your you can see them here
and you can see all the columns here
also now as I told you query is like a
search on the on some criteria right so
for example you want to search all the
names from your employee data table
which starts from M ok so what you can
do is you can go to employee ID column
and go to this row called criteria so
just select in front of row called
criteria and you can give criteria on
the basis of which you want to filter
your dotto you want to search your
daughter so we want to search the name
on the basis of for example which start
with the letter M so I will go to the
column name first name and I will write
M and this star symbol for s Tech symbol
whatever you want to say it just write M
stars this means we are searching for
the name which starts from
and Astrix is like a wild card so that
it's it doesn't bother what's after em
you you just bother the name which
starts from em and whatever comes later
after the first letter we don't bother
about it whatever is the name we don't
bother about it so it just like a wild
card now when you hit your tab button
here it will automatically modifies your
query like this like it will add like
before your query and how you can
execute this query you are in design mu
and you can see here a button called run
button so when you click this button
your query will be executed I'll run
this and now you can see I can see only
none only the name which start from the
letter M right and now in order to save
this query what you can do is you can go
to this little window button here and
you can say save as and just like save
object as and you can just give the name
to your query so I can say employee dot
name which starts from M ok and click OK
it will be saved here as your name right
so once again we go to the design view
here and now for example you want to
once again make a query for example for
the pay so we want to
a check whichever employee is having the
pay greater than 30 euros per hour we
want to list out those employees so I
will go to the pay column here and in
the criteria row what criteria I will
give I will give greater than or equal
to 30 and click tab button and then I
will perform this query once again so
just click this Run button here and you
can see the employees with pay greater
than 30 euro per hour okay so once again
I will go to the design view and so this
is a perfect time to show this design
view and this view section there is
there are different kind of views here
so we are in right now design view and
we are toggling around design view and
datasheet view this view and design view
but there are other views also pivot
chart you they would
table view but the important view here
also is when you create a query this is
a SQL view so when you click this SQL
view you can see this query here and
this query is important when you want
your database to communicate with other
languages right so when you want to
communicate with other language this
query or this line you need to transfer
it or you need to pass to your Access
database in order to fetch this same
data if you want that the you want the
list of employees who have the appear
greater than 30 euros per hour you need
to pass this query to your c-sharp
database or
Nazi sub database but the streets of
language or a java language or any other
language so this very is important from
that prospect so don't don't ignore this
query this is really important when you
are dealing with some languages like oh
right so you can create your query in
design view and whenever you want to
pass this query to other language just
go to the SQL view copy this query and
pass it to the language you are working
with right okay so once again to the
design view and what I can do is I can
once again create a new column using
these queries which is not there in the
your table so for example I want to
calculate the bonus pay for each employ
employee and the formula will be simple
I will take the pay of the employee and
I will multiply it by 50 for example and
that will be the bonus of the employee
so what I can do is I can go to this
blank column here and I can give the
name of the of the column here for the
bonus but the better option will be I
can right click here and I can say build
query and here I can say I want to
calculate the bonus for the employee so
first of all we will give a title to
this column as we have these titles pay
phone countries we will give the title
so for giving the title you just need to
give the name for example bonus and just
give a colon here so colon tells this
sub
access that this is our column name and
after that whatever you will write here
is the expression you want to execute so
for example we want to execute you want
the bonus which is calculated by the pay
so I want to have this pay here and I
will do it like this
so whenever you want to call some column
in your expression to call it with these
square brackets so in this square
bracket just pass the pay column so just
write P as it is whatever is the name of
your column just write exactly the same
here and you can say I want to multiply
it by 50 and this is my bonus column and
I will just enclose it in these
parentheses and now when I click OK if
she if you don't see this I can paste it
in here so you can see it better
it's bonus : and in the parenthesis the
pay column name in the square bracket
multiplied by 50 okay
and I will click OK and you can see here
it has created a new column called bonus
with the this formula and when I execute
this query once again executes tip you
can see a new column here and which is a
bonus column and whose result contains
the pay multiplied by 50 so 56
multiplied by 50 is 2800 oh and 54
multiplied by 50 is 2700 like these
so you can add this bonus here like this
now in order to show this euro I can
hear or Euro symbol here we are not
seeing Euro symbol here so in order to
add this Euro symbol before all these
calculated value I will go to the design
view once again go to the column right
click it go to the properties and I will
say format I will select format here
click this button get a little bit
bigger so you can see and I can form it
on the basis of currency or I will just
click here oh here
ok and when I go to my run view again
you can see here euro is added and my
bonus is formatted in Euros like this ok
now once again to the design view so you
you can not only search data using
queries but you can update your data you
can delete your data you can I mean do
anything with your data using queries
and for knowing more about this queries
there are some ribbon icons here for
example you want to update the data just
select this button and it will then use
or you it will then create a query to
update your data so now if this design
field is changed and you can see here
update too and on the basis of criteria
you can update your data ok and you can
delete your data also just select select
this delete button here and you can just
give the criteria on the basis of which
you want to delete your data for example
I want to delete the data on the basis
of
name for example or where the name is
equal to whatever right so I will say I
want to delete the data I'll go to this
view and I want to delete the data where
a name is equal to this so I will copy
this name I will go to the design view
once again which is this view and this
is my delete I mean this delete a design
you right so I am click this delete
design view and I will click the
criteria where name is equal to this and
when I hit this one button it will ask
you it doesn't it doesn't find this name
because in this query I have this
condition I have created earlier so I
will delete this query from here once
again I will run my query from here and
it says you are about to delete one row
from the specified table and when you
click yes here it will delete right now
what don't want to delete any data but
when you click yes here will delete this
row from your database forever so you
cannot whatever you delete you cannot
revert it back it's deleted from the
database right and because this employee
ID is a primary key you cannot generate
a key thirteen if it's deleted again
because it's a unique key and primary
key is a unique key and it can be
generated only once so if you delete
this data you cannot generate the
employee data with the employee ID 13
okay so in this way these very books you
can play with this query in the dress
design view you can see there are
different buttons here the main buttons
select update and delete buttons and
don't forget just take a look at these
select of you also SQL view also and
when you see this SQL view you can find
this query which you can pass to the
other language the query is independent
of the language the query is the same
for the Java if you passing it to Java
or if you are passing it to the C shop
it's the same query you need to pass to
the other languages okay so hope you
