video I will show you how to add a chart
control to your local database c-sharp
windows form application so let's get
started I will go to my tool box and I
will go to the data section here and in
here you will find a chart control just
drag-and-drop into your form and now you
have chart control in your form right so
let me just resize this chart control
okay so now I have resized my chart
control and now I want to link this
chart control with my database so I
already have made this employee info
database from the starting of this video
series so let's see what's there in my
database so I have two members in my
database and I have name surname and age
here so now for example I want to plot a
graph of name versus age so let's try
and build a graph for name versus age so
I will go to the form and I will select
my chart control and I will go to the
properties and in here I will go to the
property called
datasource so just search for this
property called datasource and in here
you will be able to see your database
which is employing for binding source
from here or if you are not able to so
see the database then you can just click
project data source and you will be able
to just select your data source from
here just click Next and select your
data source from here and click Next and
because I already have that this data
source so I do not need to do this so I
will just select my employee info
binding source from M which I have
generated earlier in the earlier videos
so if you don't know where from where
this data binding source come from just
see the last videos one of the initial
videos I have shown you and I have shown
you how to create a database and how to
link it with your C shop so in the data
source just select this employee in for
whatever binding source you have and now
go to the series property of this chart
control and click in this connection and
click this small button and in here we
will just decide the X and y-axis of our
chart so for example for on x-axis I
want the name and on the y axis I want
the age okay so on the x axis I want to
show a name and on the y axis I want to
show age and I will click OK and when I
run the program
to see two names which is mark and Julie
from here and it they the graph is
showing the ages so mark has age 23 so
you see here and you Lee has age 34 so
you can see it from here so in this way
you can connect your chart control with
your database what more you can do is
you can just select your chart and in
this in this series collection here you
can change the chart type also so you
can you have these options various
options for example I want to choose
this pie chart so I select in the chart
section chart type pie chart and I click
OK and now you see the pie chart and now
when you run the program you see the pie
chart here okay and there are some other
properties here which you can you can
choose from here and you will be able to
generate some of the very nice chart for
example this palette you can decide
which palette you want for example I
will choose this fire palette and you
see here all the colors have changed
right and this has all the other
properties just you need to play with
these properties and see what happens
here for example I want to change the
border color I haven't change the border
color as black and background secondary
color I can choose some light color
so in this way you can just change these
properties so I hope you have enjoyed
