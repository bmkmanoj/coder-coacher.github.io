last video I have shown you how to
connect MySQL database with your Visual
C++ windows form application now we will
develop our code further and we will try
to make a login page so that you will be
provided to text field and when you
click a login button it will verify your
username and password from the database
and it will show you show the message
that if your username and password you
have entered is correct or not so
without wasting any time let's get
started so first of all we will delete
this text box which we have made last
time we don't need it now okay and when
you click this OK button which we have
made last time double click it and
because we have deleted our text box we
don't need this line also in while loop
which we have created in the last video
so just take this line also now go to
your design once again and what I will
do is I will change this the text of
this button as login so I will go to the
properties here in the property tab and
I will search for the text so there is
text
so here it is instead of okay I will
right now login so I am presenter and
you can see here in your button login a
step displayed and now you go to my tool
box in here and I will grab two text
boxes
oh yeah this text box number one and
text box number two and I will also take
two labels label one and label two and
place it here so it will look nice and
now I will click label 1 and change its
text and name it as the game center and
I will click label 2 and change its text
in the properties as Oxford
okay
and if you want you can change the text
on the name of these labels for example
name it as a sport so it's good practice
to use this name field to name them so
you don't get confused in names so this
one and for username I will change the
name as user name LBL forelimbs same i
will do for this user name textbox so I
will name it first name it tennis in the
name field I'm changing
by the way user name underscore txt so I
know it's a textbox and in text field
where is it
ya hear this so in the text field I will
write no I just want to leave it blank
so I left it blank and the password feed
here I will name this syllable as
password text in the name okay
so what I have done is I have taken two
labels and named them as username and
password and I have taken two text boxes
and I have named them according to
accordingly
sorry username for username text box and
password for password me and what I want
to do is when I click this login button
it will verify the username and password
which I have created in my MySQL
database so I will show you my MySQL
database here
just open your MySQL database and in
here I have created a database named
database and I have created one table
here in this table I have employee ID e
ID name surname age username and
password and I have provided some data
in them so in order to remember these
username and password I provided them
username and password numbers so
username if the username is one password
is also one if the username is two
password is also two so is it's easy to
remember but you can give use an even
password according to your requirement
it's just for understanding so I have
one two three four five six six columns
with these names and this data so last
time we have seen how to connect your
database with this C++ application and
when you click this login button double
click double
we have created this code in the last
two videos when we have written the duck
or the connection with MySQL so if you
don't know this code just go to your
just go to previous two videos which I
have made and you can see how I
connected my database now in this line s
my SQL command I have provided a query
here you can see select star from
database dot so this is my doctor based
name this is my table name now I want to
verify whatever text I enter in these
two text boxes it the MySQL database
takes that text and verify that text
whether it's entered correctly or not
and verify the username and password and
give me a feedback Fitz correct or not
so last time I have written this money I
will change it a little so I have
written select star from database dot e
data which is this database and this e
dot or table and now I will write select
stuff
and I will write further where I will
see my username this is my username and
password so username and password so I
will use these two things here where
username is equal to what username is so
right two coats double quote in between
them's right two single quotes and in
between them right double plus and in
between two double plus science we will
write so what we will write we will
click this username text box and go to
the properties and copy the name of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
