cutie tutorial for beginners so what is
Duty now cutie which is also pronounced
as cubed is a cross-platform application
development framework which can be used
on multiple operating systems like
Windows or Mac OS or many Linux
operating systems right and it has a
same user experience across the hardware
platform for all operating systems right
now many of us think that Qt is a GUI
framework which is also true because QT
is majorly a GUI framework but it's not
only a GUI framework right it also comes
with many other modules or framework
something like database access modules
or XML parsers or web you know modules
or network or serial communication
modules and many other modules right so
it's not only GUI framework but it's a
you know combination of multiple
frameworks so primarily QT is written in
C++ right but it can also be written in
multiple languages like Python C sharp
or Ruby add a Pascal PHP Perl or Java
but we are going to learn the most basic
you know language of QT which is QT in
C++ right so we are going to learn how
to use QT using C++ okay now let's see
some of the history about Qt so QT was
initially developed by two Navon student
in 1995 so in 1995 QT was developed and
these two students make this company
called trawl tech in 90
95 now the major you know milestone in
the history of QT was QT 4 which was
published in summer 2005 and in 2008
this QT company was acquired by Nokia
which is a major mobile brand at that
time right and it was a Finnish company
and in 2012 it was acquired by a Finnish
company once again which was Digia now
QT has three licenses one is GPL second
is GNU GPL and third one is commercial
so QT is an open source
you know framework if you want to
develop open source so you know
application whose source is a free and
open source online right but it also has
the commercial version of QT so if you
want to you know make a private
application then you can use the
commercial version of QT and if you are
using commercial version you don't have
to share your code in open source now as
I said that QT was traditionally written
in C++ but in the version later than 4.7
QT quick and qml with JavaScript or was
also introduced which was ideal choice
for tablets or smartphones and QT
leverages itself from C++ so if you know
C++ then your learning curve for
learning QT is less right now it is a
high-quality mature free excellent
support for localization and it also
supports so 32-bit and 64-bit computing
okay
now presently QT version 5 is you know
in use and more precisely at the time of
making this video QT 5.6 is in use and
QW
the six point X is in use right now QT
as I said is a rich set of widgets which
is more than thousand widget it allows
you to use and qwt also has around 125
or more classes now in addition to the
QT IDE and QT framework it has a
wonderful and very good documentation
help and examples and you can find this
example on the IDE itself and on these
website which are w w QT project watch E
and Q T dot Digia comm so these are the
two website you can find the document of
QT and many other forums are also there
for the hell's right now moving on what
companies or who uses QT now European
Space Agency was one of the first major
customer of QT and then many major you
know customers like Google or Skype or
many other companies like VLC or other
company which you can see in the list
here are using QT so if you want to
learn QT you know it's not a alien
language it's used by many major
companies right now what are the tools
which you will get whenever you download
QT so QT comes with its ID which is QT
creator which is a cross-platform IDE if
you don't know what is IDE ID strength
for integrated development environment
okay so the first tool which you will
get when you install QT is the Qt
creator IDE then you will get with the
Qt creator ID the designer for designing
your QT GUI application then you have a
tool called QT linguist
which will allow you to you know
translate or local helps you to localize
your you know application so for example
you want to use multiple languages in
your QT application q2e linguist will
help you to do that now it also comes
with QT assist which is a customizable
documentation reader which is also part
of this QT creator IDE now that build
system which comes with QT is cue mink
which is also a cross-platform building
tool something like you know make file
if you heard about make file or see make
right now QT also have plug-ins for
other IDE s so it can be integrated with
Visual Studio for Windows or it can be
integrated with Eclipse IDE also now
there is a configuration tool also which
allows you to configure QT on any
specific platform and also at last it
comes with QT SDK which has rich C++
libraries to use okay so these are the
tools you will get whenever you install
QT
okay now QT SDK so let's talk about QT
SDK the QT class library encompasses all
the functions needed to build a robust
high-end application and they can be
separate into several modules so these
are what the modules which are a part of
QT SDK framework but these are not only
you know non exhaustive list of
frameworks there are many other
frameworks you know QT comes with so QT
comes with QT core framework you have
GUI framework than SQL and XML
networking OpenGL fare framework and the
framework for multimedia web
kid or any other framework cutie comes
with now let's talk about QT libraries
so there are two major QT libraries like
QD core and cutie GUI now in QT core you
will get file iOS or event and object
handling frameworks or multi threading
or concurrency frameworks plugins
setting management like slots and
signals and many other you know
frameworks or mechanism which are the
part of QT core in QT GUI the set of
customizable widgets are the parts or 2d
graphic canvas or OpenGL integration is
the part of QT GUI applications right so
this is a brief introduction about QT
framework in the next video we will
learn how we can download and install QT
on our Windows operating system I will
be teaching QT on Windows operating
system and then later we are going to
see how we can create our first app QT
application and how we can use these
frameworks in QT so I hope you've
enjoyed this video please welcome and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
