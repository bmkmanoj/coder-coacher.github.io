tutorial on PHP programming tutorial for
beginners and in this video I am going
to show you how to install XM webserver
to test your PHP programs so xampp is a
webserver switch xampp is a tool by
which you can make your computer as a
server for testing your your
applications so let's see how we can
install xampp so just open your browser
and search for XA MPP and the first link
you will find here is from
www.opensubtitles.org
for Windows so just click this X M for
Windows and then you will be able to
download this file on your computer so
download will start in few seconds and
download has started now you see here
and it will take some time for example
one minute to download because it's 100
or more than 100 MB file so I will pause
the video and once it will be downloaded
I will continue with the installation
okay so my download is complete now I
can run this executable file from here
and it will show you this little warning
you can just say yes and the
installation will start
when installation has started and in
between you will be able to see these
warnings it will ask you some questions
and it will in the last it will ask you
continue with the installation you just
want to say yes and once again this
warning you will be able to see just
click OK and click Next and these are
the tools you will be able to install
when ever you are installing XM so the
package will contain Apache MySQL
FileZilla and Mercury mail server tomcat
server PHP Perl PHP my admin and all
these things so I generally leave them
all checked because I want to install up
all of them and I will click Next
and this is the default location where
accept will be installed in your system
sequel and XM so just remember this you
are going to go to this folder to access
some files so just remember this
location and click Next and click next
and next and now the installation will
start it will take some times to the
installation to complete so just wait
for I think for five minutes in five
minutes this installation will be
completed so I will just pause the video
and let this installation to complete
and once this installation is complete
we will see how to go further ok so now
our installation is complete just leave
this checkbox checked to start the
control panel for X M so I will leave it
as checked and I will click finish and
as soon as you click finish button the
XM control panel will open now
and once you see this exempt control
panel you will be able to start MySQL
database server and your Apache from
this control panel so if it takes a time
you can always go to your Start button
and search for xam PB and you can start
this XMPP from here also you will be
able to see this axiom TP control panel
you just need to click this option to
start your control panel
okay so our control panel has started
and now you will be able to see this you
can start this Apache from here you can
start MySQL from here and FileZilla
Mercury of mail so and Tomcat from here
so how you can start these all the
servers and databases now once your
control panel is running and if you see
some error or red lines here and it's if
it says that your port 80 which is used
by Apache web server is used by some
other PID how you can close this that
PID and start Apache server on that port
80 I will show you first because most of
you may maybe you will have port 80
already in use and you will face some
problems right so it says port 80 in use
unable to open the process with PID for
okay so what you need to do is you can
search for the process which is using
your port 80 by going to the start
button and search for CMD which will
open the command prompt just open the
command prompt and in here type in net
stat -
a-and oh so give this command next ad
minus ano and press Enter
and now you will be able to see all the
ports which are in use and the first
port which is port 80 you will be able
to see the PID of this port 80 which is
this 4 so PID 4 is using this port
already so I will just kill this port by
the command task kill and then give the
slash then write PID and the number of
PID so my PID which is in use is 4 right
so you see here PID 4 is using port 80
so just right here taskkill /im get the
number of the PID which it's using and
press Enter and if it says access denied
then then probably some important
process is using this PID you can use
this exempt control panel also to see
whatever ports are in use so just click
this on this control panel there are
some button and there is a button called
netstat here and in here you will be
able to see all the processes which are
in use in which port 80 also is in use
right so just if port 80 is in use and
it's used by system then probably you
can change the port on which this Apache
will be able to listen so to change this
what you need to do is for example I
want to start my Apache web server on
port 8080 how can I do that so because
my port 80 is already busy and it's not
allowed to use this port 8080 I want to
change the port on which my Apache web
server will listen right so once again I
will go to my config button here in
front of this Apache you will be able to
see this start button and this config
button I will just click this config
button and the first option which is
Apache HTTP d.com
in here you need to go here and in here
search for the port listen 80 so you
will be able to see this option here
less than 80 here what you need to do is
you need to just change it to the port
whatever is free on your on your
computer so both 80 is in use right now
so I will change it to port 8080 8 0 8 0
ok and here also change it 8 0 8 0 so
that and I will save this file file and
save so that this port on which Apache
web server will listen will be changed
to port 8080 ok I will close this and
now I will try to start my Apache web
server and hopefully it will be started
and you will be able to see this here
port 8080 so it has started on port 8080
ok so if you see this error here then
this is the solution for that otherwise
if it's listening on port 80 you don't
need to do anything you just need to
just click this start button and you
will be good to go ok
but if this port 80 is used by some
other process then you can change the
port like this ok now I will start my
MySQL server and it started and show you
this message you just need to give the
private network and public network and
just like this allow access here
and now both servers are running now to
check whether it's really running off we
can go to our web browser and just right
on your web browser local host okay and
we'll say not found because I have
changed the port to 8080 so now you need
to give localhost colon 8080 okay and
now you will be able to see this
xampp okay now here you can choose your
language
I will choose English and in here I will
go to security to change my security
options because right now I have
provided the public access to my
computer so I will change this security
so go to this security tab here click
the security tab and in here you will be
able to see here every X these X M pages
are accessible by network for everyone
and the status is unsecure for these
right so to make them secure you need to
click this button or this link HTTP / /
localhost security just click this and
in here you will see the password
changing option for MySQL and htaccess
okay so you can change this password by
giving some password to your Maskull for
example I will give some password to my
MySQL and in here also I will repeat my
password and I will click Change
Password or password changing and this
will show me the result the root
password was successfully changed that
means my password has been changed same
I will do for this XM directory
protection which is HT access so I will
provide the user is equal to root and
some password
and I will click this make safe exempt
directory by this you will be able to
see this success the XM directory is
protected now all personal data was
saved in the file this business okay so
now you oh you have protected all your
file and one once you will go to this
language English here you will see all
the status has been changed to success
here secure here green with a green
highlight that means your MySQL root is
successful secured your XM pages are
secured and your PHP myadmin is secured
okay now for example to test whether
it's really running or not you can go to
your folder wherever you have installed
this XA MPP so I have installed this
XMPP in my C directory so I will go to
my C directory and this C director will
be able to see this folder XMPP P XMPP
sorry and in here I the important folder
for my use is this htdocs folder so go
inside this X T dot folder htdocs and
here are all pages you will be able to
see from the web server so this is your
main gateway to the you know web server
so this index dot PHP which you see here
is when you go to the browser and this
is the index the CP PHP you are seeing
here this index.php is the same file you
can see in this PHP this is favicon or
and all HTML and and images so this is
where you need to put your all files in
order to see them in the browser so for
example I will create a new file right
click new new text document
and I will name it the dystek stow test
document as test and I will open this
test document and I will write here this
is a test for 4x a and B be ok and I
will save this save it close this and
once again you go to your browser and in
your localhost colon 8080 s just instead
of this security and in slash index dot
PHP you can just check for test dot txt
file test dot txt file right press enter
and you will be able to see the same
means message you have saved in your
test file
this is our test for exempt right so
whatever you put in your htdocs file you
will be able to see it on your browser
so that's it for this video hopefully
you have understood how to install and
how to use this exam on your Windows
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
