video I'm going to show you how to use
loops in Python and I'm going to show
you how you can use a while loop and for
loop in Python so these are two kinds of
loop in Python you can use to iterate
some values so first of all let's see
what is a loop a loop is a piece of code
which help you to iterate or to you know
repeat a piece of code again and again
without rewriting at the same piece of
code again and again so loop as the name
suggests is a piece of code which will
help you to you know write or implement
some piece of code again and again
unless and until some condition is true
so let's see how a while loop work in
Python first so for example I have a
variable called a which is equal to zero
and so let's see how while loop
declaration works so for declaring a
while loop you just need to write while
and then the condition comes which needs
to be true if you want to go out of the
loop so for example I want that if a is
less than five then I want to implement
this okay so once again I forgot the
colon
yeah my look has this colon okay so I
want that if is less than five I want to
know the value of a okay so I want to
print a okay and because this condition
is on you know never be true if I don't
increment the value of a so I am going
to increment the value of a like this so
a plus
equal to one this is same as writing for
example a is equal to a plus one this
same as this one but you can write this
in short like this right and I will just
execute this while loop and the result
is 0 1 2 3 4 5 ok so you have you
haven't printed this 0 to 4 integers you
know you just have written this one line
of code to print all these numbers so
while loop or loop help you to you know
implement a piece of food or again and
again right so what happens here you
have we have already declared a is equal
to 0 and then your code goes here and it
sees it's a while loop and it checks
this condition a is less than 5
because a is 0 and 0 is less than 5 so
it will print this 0 value here once
again it goes to a while loop once again
and because I was increasing it by 1 now
value of a becomes 1 so a is 1 which is
less than 5 so it will print 1 here with
this code and it will increment a once
again and now a is 2 and 2 is less than
5 so once again it will print 2 and same
is for 3 but as soon as 5 comes here and
5 is not less than 5 then it will not
print 5 because this condition is false
now so it will go out of the loop so
this in this way this while loop or box
now let's see some real life example or
some practical example of while loop so
for example I have this example where I
have a is equal to 0 and s is
- or a is equal to one and as his s is
equal to zero and I am telling the user
to enter some value okay so enter number
to add to the sum okay and enter 0 to n
quit okay so I'm telling user to enter
some values so that I can make the sum
or otherwise if you want to quit just
enter zero and then I am checking
whether a is equal to zero if a is not
equal to zero then I am going to take
this value of s and then I'm asking the
user to enter a number and then I will
add this number to my sum S stand for
some and E stands for a number and then
I will print the sum like this ok this
is a little example which is more
practical in real-life situations and I
will run this and now it will run so I'm
asking
enter the number to add to the sum if
you enter zero you will be quit or you
will quit the if you will quit the
program and current sum is zero so for
example I enter 300 ok
and now current sum becomes 300 okay and
for example I enter -
2 or 3 40 then current sum becomes 40
okay so it will go up on keeping the sum
or making the sum plus 80 so it will add
to this 80 once again and then for exam
120 it will add 120 to the sum so this
code will help us to make a sum of
numbers which user will enter
but as soon as I enter zero you see here
then the while loop is no more valid
because this condition becomes false and
then a user will exit so when I press
zero the sum is 160 which is true and
while loop is ended and condition is
false and I am out of the loop okay so
in this way you can use while loops now
there is one more kind of loop in Python
which are called for loop and for
example I have a list called B is equal
to in the list I have 2 comma 4 5 some
numbers okay I'm just taking some random
numbers here and for example I want to
print all these numbers in the list but
one by one okay so what I can do I can
use a for loop and for loop how it can
be clear with just this 4 and then I
will declare a variable which will hold
the value of these elements one by one
okay so for example and um this is
defined by me okay and what this does is
this will hold the value of elements in
the list one by one and then write in
this in operator I have shown you how it
works in the last video if you don't
know and then just write B which is our
list which contains these values okay
and then what I am going to do once
again I forgot this : I somehow I keep
on forgetting this column and then I
will print number because this num holds
the value
holds the list value one by one okay and
I will just execute it and you see my
print function prints the values in the
list one by one by one right so in this
way you can use for loop and while loop
and both of the loop you can use
interchangeably so it's you know the
both loop works in the same way but the
while loop the difference is in between
while loop and for loop is by when you
are using while loop it you know it
waits for the condition to be true and
it will keep on executing your code
while your condition is true right and
if condition is false it will go out of
the loop and for loop there is no you
know condition it will just list out the
you know values you give here okay so I
hope you have understood the concept of
for loops in Python and I hope you
