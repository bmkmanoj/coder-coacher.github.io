video I will show you how you can read a
zip file from your Java code so for
example if you have some zip folder or
file dot zip and you want to read the
content of that zip file so name of the
files and what folder it contains and
all the information about the zip file
if you want to know then how you can
read its content I will show you so what
you first need is take about me through
which we will when we press it it will
read the file and we will take a text
area so in that me in this text area we
will list out the content of the zip
file
so I will name it 'first lead change its
text also fix the pipe and here also is
today's date set by area okay
so
when I press this button it will tweet
the zip file here okay so now let's go
to the button even into action and
actually perform and we will come here
to the Code section so section
I mean here first of all make
yeah we will make a try-catch block
okay
and in that try catch block me the right
are old so first right highly important
stream I will name this variable as f is
for spying it's been put to supreme you
copy this paste here I put stream right
bracket closed and in here make double
quotes and in between the court you have
to define part of the zip file so for
example I have this zip file I will copy
it spot
this is a fine I have copied the
bathroom zip file and I will placed it
here and you know these slashes you have
to
make them like this double slashes so
there's the first time that we write
stream this variable I will name it as
the yes - okay okay I guess except input
stream is that input stream and bracket
close and copy this file input stream
variable and paste it there okay
and
take variable name that befalls zip
entry and then we will make you why this
one loose in here between the very white
just fall take one more at the bracket
and write as ID or zip entry is equal to
that is-4 zip in truthstream
dot get mixed entry so it will read the
entry one by one and after that so while
your zip entry is not equal to null so
it is going to read one by one your own
file so until you're safe country is it
going to null repeat you are values and
in here you will write first of all we
will see in output panel the zipper just
zip file content so our system dot
in this trendline what we will do is
maybe dot get me
okay so if we list out the needs of your
visit file and then write said I yes dot
close so we close your entries when you
have read all of your files and after
the while loop this is why you complete
it and after a while loop you're right
that is is it input stream dot okay so
this is your code or reading the name or
reading your content so what am I doing
here
I will run the program first of all and
so you
is sceptile content here so when we make
it a bit smaller
why so you can read it
okay that's fine and yeah but it's
so when I press this button in my output
of I should see all my value all my
files of the zip so I press the button
and you can see all the contents of my
zip file is listed here now I want to
list out all the contents of my zip file
in this text area so how do I do that
I'll show you instead of this system out
we copy the name where in the name of my
file and before your z za s dot close
entry is this is my variance fi the area
opened
and yeah you will taste what you have
pasted in system out so this is my
variable name of my text area dot append
said e dot get name so I think this will
list out all the values of your zip file
in the text bit here so we will run the
program once again check ok so when I
press yeah should list out although I
use oh there's a point here so press it
and yes it has listed out all the values
here but you can see one thing that it
lists out the values only in one line so
I don't want that I want I want to list
out my files in this vertical line by
line so how can I do that I will show
you after that read zip file dot dot
append is ID dot name right + +
double quote and yeah finish I think
that we solve a problem once again and
the program
and I replace this so when I place this
it lists out all the values of all the
files in one by one line by line so in
this way you can read the content of
your zip file by pressing the single
button so I hope you learned something
new this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
