video I will show you how to add window
media player to your visual basic
windows form application and I will also
show you how to load a video file in
this video window media player and star
stop and play that file so let's get
started first of all go to your toolbox
and right click anywhere in the toolbox
and just click this choose item options
here and it will open a dialog and just
here in here go to common components tab
and this will open some of the tools and
just search for the tool called window
media player so by default this checkbox
is unchecked like this just check this
checkbox which says Windows Media Player
and click OK once you do this you will
be able to see a window Media Player
tool inside your tool box so it will
look like this window Media Player just
drag and drop inside your form and
resize it according to your needs
and now I will show you how to load and
play the files so I will take four
buttons here 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and I will change
the text of these buttons first is load
which will load the file second is start
button which will start the video
third is stop button which will stop the
video and fourth is
pause button which will pause the video
I will show also take open file dialog
tool from here to open the path of this
video file so just search for the Open
File dialog and drag and drop into your
form it will go down here so just see
its name is open file dialog 1 okay now
what I will do is I will select load
button and double click it and in here I
will write the code to open the video
file so i will write if opens file
dialogue 1 dot show dialogue is equal to
dialogue result dot okay then what I
will do is inside this if condition what
I will do is I will select this window
media player tool and copy the name of
this window Media Player tool and in
here will paste this name of tool and
then I will write dot URL is equal to
the Open File dialog name dot file name
so what this code will do is it will
load the selected file in this window
media player now select your Start
button double click it and in here once
again copy or window media player to be
named dot CTL controls dot play
okay now go to your forum once again
and just select this stop button and
double click it and once again paste
your name of the window media player dot
CTL controls dot stop and in the same
way for pausing the video just select
this button and dot CTL controls dot
pause okay so now this is done we are
ready to run our replication let's try
to run the application first and now
first of all I will load the video in
the window media player so I will click
this button and I will select a video
file let me search for it and in the
videos I must have some videos okay so I
will open the last video I which I have
made so click this and open it and load
the video in the Windows Media Player
now let me move this and now when I
click start it will start the video and
when I click stop it will stop the video
once again start to start the video and
when I want to pause it will pause the
video and you can able you will be able
to see the messages here that the video
is paused or video is stopped or video
is started right so in this way you can
use window media player inside your
visual basic windows so I hope you have
