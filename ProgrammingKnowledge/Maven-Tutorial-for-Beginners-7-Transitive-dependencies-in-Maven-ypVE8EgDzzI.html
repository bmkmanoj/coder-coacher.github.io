maven to roll for beginners in this
video we will learn what are transitive
dependencies in maven so in the previous
video we have seen how we can add
dependencies in our pom dot XML file
right and in the last video I have added
this dependency for J unit and when we
add this dependency you have observed
that this jar file is added to your
maven dependencies here but if you have
observed this maven dependencies
directory crear carefully you may also
observe that this jar file which is
called hamcrest underscore or - cor -
1.3 bond jar is also added to your
project and this is due to the addition
of this J unit dependency so for example
I am going to once again remove this
dependency and I will save my files and
see what happens here both will go at
the same time right so I will just save
it and when I save it then these
dependencies will disappear okay so you
can see all the maven dependencies are
disappearing right and once again when I
add this dependency here and save the
file then these dependencies are
downloaded and these dependency come at
the same time but this is strange for us
because we haven't added any dependency
for this hamcrest core jar file so how
this dependency is coming this
dependency is the dependency of j-unit
right so whenever you add the Ju
dependency the J unit also dependent on
this
hamcrest dot jar file and this you can
verify from this dependency hierarchy
you can see here so just click this
option here which says dependency
hierarchy and in here you can see the
hierarchy of dependencies right so you
can see when we added a J unit the
dependency for a J unit is this hamcrest
core jar file right and this dependency
of dependency is called transitive
dependencies okay now once again there
is one more way of seeing the dependency
of this J unit and we can see or that
hand rest is the dependency of this J
unit so once again go to your palm dot
XML file and press your ctrl button so
press ctrl and then hover over your J
unit dependency you will see that you
can click this dependency here and when
you click this dependency is going to
open the palm dot XML file for your J
unit jar file and you can see the
packaging format is jar version is 4.12
and the group ID is J unit and artifact
ID is J unit right and when we go to the
pom dot XML for the J unit jar file you
can see all the group ID and artifact ID
and when you go a little down you will
see the dependency list of this J unit
ok so you can see the dependency of this
J unit jar is this org dot hamcrest
version 1.3 and that's why it's added
here ok and this is what is called the
transitive dependency okay so once again
we will go to our pom dot xml file and
we will try to add one more
Nancy let's say we want to add a high
Burnett
you know project or hibernate jar file
to our pom dot XML so as you already
know if you want to add hibernate jar
file you may search hibernate maven
dependency and then search for it
and the first result which will appear
here will be from maven repository comm
slash artifact slash or G hibernate
so just click this link and here you can
find you know many artifacts here but
the one we want right now is for example
this first one core a high abundant URM
functionality right so I will click this
and I will click the latest release
version so I will click the top one
right and in here I can just copy this
dependency from here and I will go to my
Eclipse IDE and paste this dependency
here just below the j-unit dependency
right and when I save this see what
happens here so in some time it's going
to download this hibernate file and it's
going to add it in our maven
dependencies but at the same time it's
also going to add some transitive
dependency as we are going to see in
some time so you can see here hibernate
core 5.1 dot final dot jar file is added
here but at the same time there are some
other jar files are also added and these
jar files are added to our maven
dependencies because they are the
dependencies for this hibernate core
jar file ok so you can see JBoss logging
is added hibernate JPA is added and then
Java assist is added and other jar files
are added when we add this dependency
here so once again we will go to the
dependency hierarchy tab here so just
like this dependency hierarchy gap tab
and you can see here once again the
hierarchy so we can see j-unit and the
dependency for it is this hamcrest
and then hibernate core and dependency
of it is JBoss hybrid and JPA
java assist and other jar file for
example dom4j and this dom4j also have
its own dependency which is xml api's
okay so this dependency hierarchy tab
will show you all the dependencies and
the dependencies of the dependencies and
these are called the transitive
dependencies once again we can also
verify this by just pressing ctrl and
then pressing this hibernate group ID
and artifact ID here ok so just click it
and it's going to open the palm for
hodgiedot hibernate and you can see
packaging type is jar and when I go to
palm dot XML file of it you can see
these dependencies of this hibernate
right so you can see JBoss is the
dependency and you can see hibernate
Java X is dependency you can see Java
assistance the dependencies and all the
other dependencies which are here are
also listed here ok so these are the
dependencies and this is how the
transitive dependency works so always
remember the dependency of the
dependency is your transitive dependency
