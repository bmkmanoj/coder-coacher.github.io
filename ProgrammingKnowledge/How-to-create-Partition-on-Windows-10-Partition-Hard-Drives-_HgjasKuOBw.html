show you how you can create a partition
on your Windows 10 operating system on
your hard drive so let's get started
first of all go to your Start menu and
then click File Explorer which is going
to open the file explorer and then in
here on the left hand side you just need
to right-click on this PC so just
right-click on this PC and then choose
manage ok so just choose this option
which says manage and I'm going to
minimize this file explorer and now it's
going to open this kind of computer
management window so in here what you
need to do is you need to go to the
storage section and then go to the
section which says Disk Management
so this disk management section is going
to look like this and it's going to show
you your disk and this disk this vo you
will be able to see a system reserved
memory and then you will be able to see
your C Drive which is the main drive in
your case it can be another drive name
but it's the biggest you know memory
drive in your system right so in my case
it's C Drive so for example I want to
partition this C Drive so I will right
click on this C Drive so right click on
this C Drive and then choose shrink
volume ok which is going to take some
time so it says query volume for
available shrink space please wait
so you just need to wait your computer
is not frozen or anything you just need
to wait until it this disk manager is
querying volume for available shrink
space ok so just wait for this and now
you will be able to see this kind of
window right so on the top it says
shrink C and then it says total sizes
before shrink in mb/s so everything
which is shown here is in megabytes
right so I have around 60 GB of memory
size of available shrink space is this
one so
so here in this third section which is
enter the amount of space to shrink in
megabytes right and this much amount of
space I can shrink so what I want is out
of my you know 60 GB and out of my 42 GB
which I can shrink I just want for
example 5 GB of space so I will just
write 5,000 here which is equal to 5 GB
because it's showing memory in megabytes
right so 5,000 MB is 5 GB right and then
just click shrink here which is also
going to take some time so just please
wait and now I will be able to see this
kind of unallocated space here right so
this much amount of you know memory I
have allocated to the new you know
partition right 5 GB I have defined ok
so it says unallocated so now just click
on this unallocated space here and right
click on it and just click new simple
volume and then this is going to open
this kind of volume wizard just click
Next and in here we will leave
everything as default because we wanted
this much amount of space to be
allocated to the partition I will just
click Next and in here you can choose
which Drive letter you want for your you
know partition so by default its efore
me but you can you know freely choose
any letter for your partition so I am
going to leave it as default which is e
and then I am going to click Next and in
here you will be able to see format
partition so just select this option
which says the format this volume with
the following settings so NTFS is good
for me and you can even give the labels
to your partitions for example I want to
give the label data to my partition
right or any other name which you want
music videos or any other
data right and then click Next and this
is going to show you these this kind of
interface which says completing the new
simple volume wizard and in here you
just need to click finish and again it's
going to take some time and then after
some time you will be able to see this
space or partition will be given a new
name whichever you have given as a label
and now after some time I can see this
partition is created and the name on
label I have given is also I'm seeing
here right and it's around 5 GB of space
so now let's check whether it's really
there or not so just open your folder
Explorer now in my folder or Explorer
also I can see this e Drive created
right so in here you can you know save
any data any kind of data whatever you
have and now what I'm going to show you
is I'm going to show you how you can
reverse your partition so for example
you are not happy with this space and
you want to allocate more or you want to
allocate less or you want to you know
delete this partition how you can do it
let's see so once again go to your
computer management and go to Disk
Management and in here whatever
partition you have created if you want
to delete it you can just right click on
it and you can see there is an option
called delete volume so just click
delete volume and of course you need to
have a backup of your data and then you
just need to delete your you know volume
ok so it says deleting this volume will
erase all the data on it so backup any
data you want so you just need to backup
whatever data is there in your volume
and then just click yes here ok this is
going to delete this space ok now you
can see it says 5 GB space is
unallocated ok so now when you see the
space as unallocated
you can right-click on your main
partition right click and then you can
just select this option which says
extend volume so just select extend
volume and then click Next and you will
be able to see 5gv is available to just
click Next and then click finish which
is going to extend your main partition
you can see here right so you have
successfully reverted your partition
also ok so in this way you can create
partition on your Windows 10 operating
system I hope you have enjoyed this
