show you how you can download and
install genymotion on your opened
operating system to install genymotion
first of all you need to install
VirtualBox because genymotion uses
VirtualBox to run its emulator so let's
first install VirtualBox and then we
will install genymotion so open your
favorite browser and search for
VirtualBox virtual box is a virtual
machine on which you can run different
operating systems so here when you
search for VirtualBox the first link
most probably will be www.virtualbox.org
II just click this link here and in this
link you will be able to find the
download section so just click this
download section or download button here
and what we want is the Linux host
version so just choose VirtualBox 4.3.2
4 which is the latest version at the
time of this making this video for linux
host and here you will be able to see
different options I am going to choose
the first option which is for the latest
version of Ubuntu and I'm going to
choose AMD 64 which is recommended for
64-bit kernel so I am going to click
this AMD 64 and I am going to save this
and it's going to download this dot de
Bie file or dot dev file which we can
run using you know as a executable file
using our open to Software Center
so once you're down if your download
completes you can go to your downloads
folder here and you can see this
VirtualBox dot there file in order to
install this you just need to
right-click and just open with Ubuntu
Software Center
so right-click and open with open to our
Software Center it's going to open your
dot dev file in Ubuntu Software Center
now in here you can just click this
install button to install this virtual
boss 4.3 just click install I'm just
going to install VirtualBox on your
system while this is installing what we
can do is we can also download
genymotion from its website so let's
leave this process right now and let it
run and let's install genymotion also so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to my web browser once again and search
for genymotion and the first link will
be from genymotion com just click this
link and to get genymotion here it's
asking me for my password while
installing VirtualBox so I will just
authenticate and in here I will go down
and I will search for get genymotion ok
and you can see there are two variants
available one is free one for business
right now we will install the free
version of genymotion so just click this
download button here and we are on a
linux operating system and the website
recognizes that we are on linux
operating system so it automatically
selects linux for us and now depending
upon the version or the type of you know
you're open to operating system i if
it's 64-bit or it's 30 booked 2 bits
depending upon that you can install
these files which are binary files so in
my case my
operating system type a 64-bit operating
system so I'm going to just click 64-bit
if you have 32-bit just likes 32-bit so
just click this and to download
genymotion you need to create or you
need to have genymotion account if you
don't have you can just create one it's
really easy and if you have already a
genymotion account you just need to give
your username and password and just sign
in and now the you know download will
start so just save this file this is AB
dot bin file binary file and it's not
not a big file it's relatively small so
it will be downloaded in few seconds
let's see what's happening with our
VirtualBox
so now VirtualBox is installed in my
system you can see it's showing
installed and whenever you want you can
re install or uninstall VirtualBox also
you will be able to see some button here
to reinstall or uninstalled so
VirtualBox is installed so we will just
minimize this and now in order to
install genymotion what we need to do is
we need to open terminal and using this
terminal we will browse this downloads
folder where our genymotion two point
four point zero dot bin file is ok so in
the terminal i will search for this
folder download so see the genymotion
first of all CD download and in here we
can see genymotion
binary file is there so we will just
first of all make it executable so we
will provide some permissions so just
right CH mod + X which is for executable
and just copy and paste this genymotion
- two point four point zero underscore
x64 dot bin okay so what this will do is
this is going to make your genymotion
dot bin file to the executable file and
now we can run this file as a normal
executable file so what you need to do
is just write dot slash and then G and
press tab which is the option for
autocomplete in Ubuntu so we are going
to run this executable file now
okay so just give dot slash and the name
of your genymotion binary file and press
press ENTER and going to ask for the
permission where it's going to be
installed and this is in the same folder
download folder itself so I'm going to
say yes and in some seconds these files
will be extracted and then genymotion
will be installed once this process is
complete so now the process is complete
it's not a lengthy process so you can
see installation done successfully you
can now use these tools from this
Downloads slash genymotion folder one is
the genymotion
and second is this Jenny motions shell
so we are going to go to our download
folder and here we can see
it has created a new folder for us
genymotion we will go inside this and in
here you will be able to see this
executable file which is genymotion
executable file okay
so what I'm going to do is that we make
this folder little bit bigger and what
I'm going to do is I will select this
genymotion executable file and double
click it ok so just select this
genymotion and double click it and it's
going to start genymotion
I will minimize everything else and for
the first time whenever you start
genymotion on ubuntu it will ask do you
have any virtual device yet so right now
we don't have any virtual device so do
you want to add a new one yes we want to
add a new virtual device so we will just
click yes and in order to add a virtual
device you need to sign in with your
credentials once again and genymotion so
just sign it once again
and now you can see all the you know
device's virtual devices which you can
run in genymotion so select one of them
for example I'm going to select this
moto Motorola MOTO or some other other
you know virtual device you can select
whatever you want for example I can
install this Google Nexus 7 4.4.4 API
with 19 here
okay so select I'm going to select this
and I'm going to click Next and it's
going to give all the specification of
your virtual device click Next and now
it's going to install this virtual
device on Ubuntu so I will let this
process to go on and reach this progress
bar 200 and once this is done we are
going to run our virtual device so now
the installation of this virtual device
on genymotion is complete so we can just
click finish and now we can run this
virtual device on Jenny motions so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
select my virtual device and I'm going
to run or start this but before that
let's check the configuration so just
click this tool here small tool and in
here you can change the configuration of
your virtual device for example right
now
it's using 4 processors and 1gb of
memory for example if you want to change
it to use 1 processor and some different
amount of memory you can change it from
here
and for now I'm going to run it with
only one processor and I will click OK
and now I'm going to run this
so I will just click start and it is
going to initialize this virtual device
and run it
so now my virtual device is running and
I can just click okay and I can set up
this virtual device according to myself
as an Android device and you can see I
can navigate different menus as I can
navigate in androids
like this okay so just touch and you can
just select any item from here so in
this way you can install genymotion on
your opened operating system I hope you
