last video I have shown you how to use
if statement in C programming now in
this video I am going to show you how
you can use F as statement in C and how
even you can use nested if-else
statement in C programming so in the
last video I have given you an example
that how you can check the age of the
person whether it's greater than 18 or
equal to 18 or it's less than 18 right
now I am going to take the same example
to demonstrate if-else statement so what
I am going to do is I am going to delete
this stuff and now for example we just
want to check whether the age is greater
than 18 or it's not greater than 18 so
we want to print if the great age is
greater than 18 then we want to print
the ages greater than 18 otherwise we
want to print that the age is not
greater than 18 or ages less than 18
right so how we can do this
we can do this either you can write some
condition that the age is for example F
condition and something like this from
our last video but there is a condition
called else which catches all the all
the condition which is not true right
so if age is not greater than 18 then
the program goes to this else condition
and this else
as the name suggests that it indicates
every other condition which is not
satisfied by or F condition so if the
age is not greater than 18 then it goes
here in the else statement so else after
this bracket and
then your curly brackets so else doesn't
take any condition because it does need
to check any condition because it's whoa
everything other than this F condition
right so in here we want to just write
that the age is not greater than not
greater than 18 right and I am going to
compile and run my program and this will
give me the answer so please enter the
age I will write for example age which
is greater than 18 which is 21 and I
will press ENTER and it saves me the age
is greater than 18 now I am going to
rerun the program and this time I am
going to give 15 which is less than 18
right and I will just press ENTER and it
says the age is not greater than 18 that
means this condition is checked and if
this condition is not true your program
goes to this else condition or the else
condition of this if statement and this
line will be printed right so this is
how you can use as statement whatever
which is not true in this condition or
which is not satisfied by F condition
will be cashed by this else condition
right now there are are situations where
you need to check multiple situations so
for example you can just check multiple
conditions by FL statement so for
example you want to check if the age is
greater than 18 or if the age is equal
to 18 then you want to print age is
equal to 18 otherwise you want to print
that age is not greater than or equal to
18 so you can just give the else here
and then if
and after as the name suggests you can
check the second condition using this L
sub statement right and it also takes
this curly braces just provide these
curly braces here and here this F
because if it we are picking F condition
here so we need to check other condition
for example age is equal to 18
edge is equal to 18 we are checking
whether the age is equal to 18 if the
age is equal to 18 we can just print age
is equal to equal to 18 otherwise we
will print print edges not greater than
18 or edge is not greater than or equal
to 18 so age is not greater than or
equal to 18 right so we can check these
conditions and this is called else if so
we can check multiple conditions by
using elsif statement if else if and
then otherwise if the condition is not
true then this will be executed so what
will be the program flow here the
program will ask the age first to the
user and it goes here and if this age
entered by the user is greater than 18
then this will be printed and every
other you know if condition will be
ignored and this will not be executed
this code and this code will not be
executed otherwise if the age is not
greater than 18 then it will go to this
condition checking else if condition
checking and your age if the age is
equal to 18 then this will be printed
and everything other
then this will be skipped and all the
other code will not be executed right
otherwise if the ADA is not equal to 18
and if the edge is not greater than 18
this code will be executed and in the
same way you can use multiple afl's
conditions like this okay so it is not
restricted that you only need to use one
FL statement or else if statement you
can use multiple you know condition and
you can check multiple conditions using
FL statement now for example you want to
check whether you know this age is
greater than 18 but it's less than 21
also how you can check it so if the age
is greater than 18 we want to print this
condition and inside this code we also
want to check if the age is you know
less than 21 so you can use nested if
conditions like this so here inside your
if condition which is this curly braces
you can use if once again you can check
the age is less than less than 21 you
can print ages less than 21 okay so you
can just print age is greater than 18
but less than 21 okay
and in the you know other case you can
just write else here else and you can
just provide other statement that if the
age is greater than 18 but it is not
less than 21 so but not less than 21
I will compile and run this program and
this is called nested if-else condition
okay so because you are using F
condition inside I have condition it is
called nested if-else statements okay
so it is not necessary that you cannot
use if condition inside if condition you
can use multiple F condition to check
multiple conditions in C right run the
program and for example I give the age
26 which is greater than 18 but it is
not less than 21 so ideally we will see
this message the age is greater than 18
but not less than 21 press enter and it
says the age is greater than 18 which is
this statement which is due to this
statement the age is greater than 18 now
it goes here and it sees that 26 is not
less than 21 so it goes to the else
condition I will print test the age is
greater than 18 but not less than 21 and
it is printing it here if the age is
greater than 18 but not less than 21
otherwise I will rerun thus this program
and let's delete or not delete but let's
provide this line break here so that
this will be the change in the line and
this time we provide 20 as the age and
it says that the age is greater than 18
but the age is also less than 21 right
so in this way you can just check
whether this age is you know multiple
condition you can check it from here
right so this is how you can use FL
statement and nested if-else statement
in C this is called nested-if inside
your FL statement and this is called
else if statement and this is called as
statement in if statements so I hope you
have enjoyed this
