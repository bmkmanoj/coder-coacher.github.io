video I will show you how to read a text
file from your Java NetBeans application
so I made a jframe using NetBeans and
when I click this button it will ask me
to choose a text file so I will choose a
text file this one for example and I
will open it and it will read a text
whatever text which is present in the
text file it will read and display into
the text area so how I have done this I
will show you today so let's see first
of all what I have done I have taken a J
area from here J text area this one and
I have taken a button so and I an edited
the name of the button as read file and
the text area variable name is same J
text area so now the button press event
so right click event action and action
perform and this is the code for reading
the text file from your java application
so first four line is for choosing the
path and opening the dialogue from your
application so right jfilechooser choose
is equal to new jfilechooser bracket and
bracket closed
and then copy this choose a variable dot
show option or show open dialog and in
the bracket null and then declare a file
variable whose name is f is equal to
chooser which is this variable dot get
selected fine and then declare a string
whose name I have given file name this
we contain your file path path for the
file so swing file name is equal to F
dot get absolute path so these four line
open a J file chooser and copy the path
into this file name variable which is a
string now to read a text file
first of all make a try-catch block like
this and in here write file reader
variable name reader is equal to new
file reader file name which is this file
name which is a path of your file so
just copy this and paste it here and in
the next line write buffer reader BR
this is the variable name is equal to
new buffer reader read oh so this
variable is this one and then we read
that buffer into the text area so write
text area dot read be our common null
and in the bracket and make it closed
then right BR dot closed packet then
break it closed and then write your text
area name which is this once again so
this is your text area name dot request
focus break it and break it to oh stop
so this whole is the code for opening
file and read it into the text area so
if you want you can pause the video and
write the program and when you are done
with this just run the program once
again choose o press this button to
choose a file and we go to my home and I
will choose a file once again and it
opens the text file ok it can open some
other files also for example I have this
XML file simple dot XML and when I click
this it opens this XML file also in the
text area but keep in mind it should not
come contain any special characters or
some picture or something else so the
simple text it can read from this
program so whatever file contains the
simple text it can read it
so I think you have learned something
new this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
