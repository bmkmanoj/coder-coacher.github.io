how to open a text file inside a rich
text box or a text box using your visual
basic windows form application so let's
get started for this example I will use
our each text box you can also use a
text box in place of rich text box so
just drag and drop out rich text box
tool inside your form and I will also
take a button okay and I will anchor
this rich text box to the sides so go to
the property called anchor and anchor to
all the side except the top and I will
change the text of this button as open
text files okay and I'm also going to
take a open file dialog to open the path
of the file so go to your toolbox and
take a open file dialog from here and
drag and drop inside your form once
again yes and it will go below your form
it will not directly go into the form so
now just select your button and double
click it and in here first of all write
the code for opening the Open File
dialog so right if open file dialog one
dot show dialog is equal to dialogue pro
result
dot okay then so this will create a if
condition if this is true then just
write the name of our rich text box so i
will write rich text box 1 which is the
name of my rich text box dot text is
equal to my dot computer dot file system
dot read all text and in the bracket
just give the path of the file so how to
give the path of the file just copy your
Open File dialog name and then write dot
file name okay and press Enter
this is the code for opening the file
dialog and transferring this form file a
text file content to the rich text box
so if you want you can copy this code
and now we are going to run the program
and from this button I am going to open
a open file dialog to select any file
and then I will search for a file text
file so let's see where it is yeah so I
have a test text file so I will select
this file and click open and you can see
the text file is opened inside my rich
text box so in this way you can open any
text file using your visual basic
windows form application and rich text
box so I hope you have enjoyed this
