teach you about difference between
method hiding which we have seen in the
last last video and method overriding
which we have seen in the last video
when we have learned polymorphism so
suppose I have a base class called
drawing so it's just a simple base class
which is like this public class drawing
and it has one method called a draw and
what what this method is doing it it's
printing just a message and this message
says this is just a generic drawing
class for example okay now I want to
derive a child class from this base
class so what I will do is I will just
divide a child class called line for
example and I will derive from this
taste class drawing and this also has
this draw method and this time I will
say the message that this is a line okay
so this we have seen in the last video
when we want to override this base class
draw method from a derived class method
we add a keyword virtual in the base
class and
override in the derived class so what
this will do is this virtual keyword
says the base class that a whenever we
are going to declare a derived class and
we want to have its own draw method we
can override this same method by using
this virtual and using this override
keyword and now let's go to the main
method and let's call and let's create
the instance of this drawing class so I
will just copy this drawing class and I
will just create the instance OB j is
equal to new and let's create the
instance of this line class so line ok
so what this is going to do is let's
call the draw method from here obj dot
draw ok so what this will do is let's
try and run the program and what sit
spoon to do is it will print this is a
line because we have overridden our base
class method draw by a derived class
method right so it will whenever you
declare a base class reference which
points to the derived class object then
it will call the derived class method
okay now let's try to change or make it
method hiding so instead of this
override keyword we will write new so
this we have seen in the last last video
that whenever we use this new keyword
with our derived class your
the right class method will hide your
base class method right but when ever we
run the program you see the messages
this is just a generic drawing class so
whenever you use this method hiding
using this new keyword and you will
declare the reference variable pointing
to the derived class it will it will
indicate to the base class okay and
whenever you use method overriding using
override keyword it will override your
base class method and it will point to
this method derived class method so this
is the difference between overriding and
method hiding method hiding always point
to the base class if you have a base
class object point and method overriding
always fetch you the overridden method
which is this is a line so I hope you
have understood the basic difference
between method hiding and method
overriding and I hope you have enjoyed
