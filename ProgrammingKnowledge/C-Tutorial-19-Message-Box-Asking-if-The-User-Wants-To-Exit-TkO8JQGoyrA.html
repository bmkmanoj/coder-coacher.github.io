last video I have shown you how to
gracefully exit your c-sharp application
so for example I when I click this
button my application is exited fully
and it does not go into the debug mode
so it fully exits the application but
sometimes we need to make sure that we
are really exiting the application or do
we really want to exit the application
so right now what happens is when I
click this my application is exited
without asking us that do we really want
to exit or not so in this video I will
show you how to make this kind of exit
when the program ask us that do we
really want to exit and when we press
yes then it exits so let's get started
just select your form as you have done
in the last video so just click anywhere
here so you will select the whole form
and go to the event and then go to form
closing event ok and then just
double-click this event and we will
reach to the form closing event of our
code and this one line code we have seen
in the last video but now we want to
show a message box asking that do we
really want to exit so I will delete
this code and I will write on your code
which is this so here write dialogue
result your variable name is equal to
message box dot show and in here you
will pass your message whatever message
you want to show okay so in the first
space you will pass your message I'm
passing do you really want to close the
program and in then right coma this coma
and after this comma write your title of
your message box so the message box or
title in my case is exit you can give
your own custom title for the message
box and write comma message box buttons
dot yes/no so it will create a message
box with a button yes and note so you
can select yes or no and then give a
condition if dialog which is this
variable is equal to dialog result this
one dot yes so this condition states
that you press the yes button when the
message box pops up then it will exit
the application so right application dot
exit bracket and bracket close else if
dialog is equal to dialog result dot no
so in this case when you click no in the
message box you will just close your
message box so write a dot cancel is
equal to true
this e is this variable which is
generated automatically so
this is e so e dot cancel so this is the
code for exiting your application and
your form will ask you that do you
really want to exit the application so
if you want just pause the video and
please copy the code and then we will
run our program and check whether it
does what we want or not
so login password yes and see here when
I click this cancel button it asked me
and my title is exit and it asked me do
you really want to close the program I
say no then nothing happens just it code
closes the message box and in the second
case if I say yes it exits the
application okay so this is the code for
that
I think this code only has one problem
that I will show you the problem that
when you click yes here it will ask once
again that you really want to exit the
application so you need to click yes two
times so this is the catch in this code
so if you have the better code then just
write in the comments and I will also
get to know the code so I hope you have
learned something new this time please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
