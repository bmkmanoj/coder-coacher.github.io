node.js tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how we can download
and install node.js on our Ubuntu
operating system and we will also see
how we can create a first simple server
using node.js so first of all open your
favorite browser and just search for
node GS from here and the first link
which will appear here will be from
node.js dot o-r-g so just go inside it
and in here you will be able to see the
versions of node available so we have
the LTS version which is the long term
service version which is four point zero
point zero and at the time of making
this video we have the current version
also which is the latest version which
is six point five point zero so we will
try to install this one current version
now in order to download this current
version what we can do here is we can go
to download so just click downloads here
and just scroll down a little bit at the
bottom and here you will be able to see
installing node gsy up package manager
so just click this link which says
installing node.js via package manager
and because we are installing node.js on
our open to operating system here is the
heading which says Debian and Ubuntu
based Linux distribution right and then
there are some commands which will allow
you to download and install node.js on
your system which are these two commands
which is curl first of all you need to
add the PPA and then you can install the
node.js so one first version is 44.5
which is our LTS version so we don't
want this for now we want this one which
is version 6.5 right so we will use
these two come on first if you can
observe here this command is using curl
so first
all we need to ensure that curl is
installed on our system so what we will
do we will just open our terminal first
of all and in here we will check if curl
is there so just write curl simply and
press enter and you can see on my system
curl is not install so this says the
program curl is currently not installed
but maybe in your system its installed
so you don't need to follow this command
so for me I will just give this command
which is given by this message to me
which is sudo apt - get installed curl
right so I will just copy this command
and then paste it here to install it
curl right and I will give my password
here and then curl will be installed on
my system now the next thing before we
can use this command for you know
installing the PPA
we just need to install one more thing
which is Python software properties okay
so let's install python software
properties i will just clear the screen
for now and then i will just paste the
command for installing PI python
software properties which is this
command sudo apt - get installed Python
- software - properties so I will paste
this command in the description so you
don't need to remember them or retype
them you can just copy and paste on your
system to install node.js on your system
okay so second command is this one sudo
apt-get install python software
properties ok now once this is done we
will be ready to install the node.js
itself so first of all we will just copy
this command which will add the PPA and
just clear it once again the terminal
and once again I will paste this which I
have copied from here this command ok
and I will just press ENTER and then
this will download all the PPA files
and once this download is complete we
can just use this command to install
node.js which is sudo app - get
installed - why no GS okay so I will
just copy this command by the name
meantime and we will wait for this to
complete and now it says you just need
to run apt-get install node.js this is
what we are going to do so we will just
paste the command which we have copied
which is sudo apt - get install - why
node.js and press Enter
which will install node.js on our Ubuntu
operating system or any other Debian
system if you are using other Debian
system it will install on that system
also okay
so just wait for this installation to
complete and then we will check whether
node.js is really installed on our
system or not right
so now node.js is installed on our
system now we just need to check whether
it's really installed or not so I will
once again clear the terminal and in
here first of all I will just give the
command node - V - check the version of
node installed and it gives version 6.5
point 0 so this is the version which we
have installed and you can see on the
home page this is the version which is
currently available which is version 6.5
point 0 so node is properly installed
and node also installs NPM which is node
package manager with it - you know
install different kind of node modules
so which are publicly available so with
this command node NP NPM is also
installed so you will we can check
whether it's really installed or not so
you can just give NPM - V and if it
gives the version then NPM is also
installed so now we know that node is
properly installed so - check node you
can just give command node and it will
give you this kind of interface
and here you can just write console dot
log and you can print for example hello
node here so I will just say hello node
and give the semicolon here and press
ENTER and it's going to print whatever
you have written in between these code
in the node log right and after this it
will give this undefined which is our
correct behavior so now we know that
node is properly installed on our system
and when we press dot exit we can come
out of this node so just write dot
exists and we are out of the node
terminal right now let's create a small
server so we will once again go to the
node.js dot o-r-g website and in here go
to about and in about section you can
see this is the barebone code to create
a simple node.js server so this is what
we are going to do so first of all for
example I will CD to the desktop and
here we will create a file so I'm going
to create a file for example I will just
say get it which is our editor and for
example I am going to create a file
called app dot GS ok and press Enter
which is going to create a app dot J's
file on the desktop so whenever we will
copy so we will copy all this code from
here which is there on the website and
we will paste it here and save it so
once you save it you can see this app
dot J's is created here right this
episode J's file ok so now what we want
to do is we want to run this app dot J's
file so you can just write node and the
file name which is AB dot J's right and
then press ENTER which is going to run
your server now if you can see here
there is
message server running at this port so
this is the localhost 127.0.0.1 is the
localhost and this is the port 3000 is
the port on which node.js is running
right now so if you want you can just
copy this address or you can type it on
your you know on your browser also so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
just paste this which is 127.0.0.1 colon
3000 which is the port and press enter
and it prints hello world right and this
was the purpose of this barebone you
know code which is to print hello world
you can see it's prints hello world here
okay so this is how we know that node is
running successfully on our window
operating system and we have installed
node.js correctly on our system so I
hope you enjoyed this video please
