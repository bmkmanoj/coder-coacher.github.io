so input is equal to text dot guitar
text dot get bytes so what it will do is
it will take the data from the text and
transfer into the input variable then
write secret key spec key is equal to
new secret keys back key byte which we
have declared above and des this is a
kind of VAS message if you go into the
theory you will know what is des so
write as it is this is our VIP ammeter
spec VI spec new IV parameters back in
the bracket IV bytes this also we have
declared at the top of our program then
write cipher which we have declared on
the top is equal to capital super dot
get instance and just copy this data as
it is des and we are using CTR of type
of encryption with no padding you can
provide the padding and if you have data
which is not a multiple of 4 and it will
provide your data some padding or some
garbage fields so you can also learn
about what is a padding in it encryption
and this is also a type of encryption we
are using then write safer in it safer
dot encrypt mode comma key comma IV spec
then right safer text which you have
declared above is equal to new bite
cipher which is this variable which is
also we have declared above dot get
output size input which is our input
which we are taking from the text box
dot length so it takes the length of the
text and then right sip CT length is
equal to Sigma dot update in the bracket
input comma 0 comma input dot length
comma cipher text comma 0 and then we
write CT length plus is equal to so it
will work it will not overwrite but it
will add in this variable these things
safer god do final safer text dot CT
length and then write this encrypt text
which is this text box variable name so
copy this and paste it there not set
text in the bracket new string safe our
text which we have declared and which is
also used here you can also provide
system dot out dot print line to see the
message on the output here terminal but
if you don't want you just make it
disappear and in the catch block you
know what to write so this code is for
the encryption
but ok so if you just want to copy this
for just pause the video and just write
the code as it is okay and then once
again go to your design panel and just
select your decrypt button and double
click it and you will reach to the
decrypt method in this method also just
make a try-catch block and in that
try-catch block you will write your code
this is a code for decryption so just
write when the first lines zipper which
we have declared above dot in it
initialize for initialization Schaefer
dot decrypt mode so this will decrypt
your text which is input and comma key
which is your specialty which will you
provide in the above parameter in the
top declaration and IV spec also you
have already provide then write bite
this is a variable of type byte plain
text new bite safer dot output size C T
length and then declare int PT length is
equal to zipper dot update say for text
which we have used in the encryption
comma 0 comma lack Ct length comma plain
text which is this variable comma 0 and
then once again take this variable plus
is equal to
safer dot do final comma plaintext comma
P tea-length
and then if you want you can give this
system out to see the message in the
auto box
I don't want an that so I just make it
disappear and this is your text field
name this one third text field name
decrypt text dot set text in the back
bracket string lane text and semicolon
semicolon closed so and this is your
catch block which I think you know so
this is the code if you want to write it
just pause the video and just copy the
code this is for the decryption and this
above code is for the encryption so I
will wait for two seconds for you to
pause the video and why copy it for the
decryption method and I think you copied
it and now let's try and run the program
so right click and run
and here is your program and I will
write single text and when I have
clicked this enter button it will
convert my indata into a safer which is
an encrypted language and when I press
this t3 button it will take this data
and decrypt it once again into the
original form so I press this and this
is my original data so in this way you
can use encryption and decryption you
can convert this encrypted art into hex
and save it as a password and you can
use it for verification of the password
so in your database you don't have to
worry about the password for example if
I have the database and if you see I
provided only some simple password if
somebody can see my database here
but easily recognize my password but if
you provide some encrypted form like
this or if you provide some hexadecimal
form so if you really want to provide
this encrypted script as a password just
convert it into hex and just save it as
a password so even if somebody sees
Hiyori password here he will not be able
to recognize what it is unless and until
he has the key of that which is
these keys so these keys are also
important this key and this VI bit so in
this way you can use this encryption in
description I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
