I have shown you how to use charts with
your visual C++ windows form application
in this video I will show you how to
link the database values with this this
chart so what I'm going to do is when I
press this load chart button which I
have used in the last video it should
take the values from the database which
are these values name column and age
column and it will prop lot the name
versus age graph in to your chart panel
so how can we do it let's see first of
all just double click this node chart
button which we have created love in the
last video and we have written this code
last time so I will just remove this
quote because we don't require this code
now and if you remember in the video
number 12 and billion number 14 I have
shown you how to link your database with
the combo box and how to link your
database with the list box so just go
there and just copy the same code from
there for which I am used for the combo
box or the list box you can use either
of them so this is the full combo method
which I have created in the video number
12 where I have linked the combo box
with the database so if you don't know
this code just go and watch that video
and you know how to create this port so
I will just copy this code from string
to the end of the catch block and I will
go to the method of my load chart event
and I will paste this code I will just
run through the code very quickly here
we are linking the code with the
database and at what port and what are
the username and password of the
database here we are making the
connection and here we have passing the
queries select star from database dot
table so my database name is database
itself and table name is data which is
here and connection database which is
this variable and
if you want you can just pause this
video and copy the code okay
just copy the same code and then just
delete this to things list box and combo
box I don't need them I just need the
values which we are retrieving from the
doctor base and go there in between the
while loop this is the while loop and
here we are taking these values and in
here write this code this arrow point
the chart one arrow point of series and
your CDs name which was age we have set
age earlier in the last video so in this
video also name of syriza's age and
don't remember to change this series
name in the above declaration also here
if you haven't seen the last video you
can just change it here
chart this one seam is one name is equal
to age by default it's series by one but
you need to change it with a your series
name so in my case this is age it's on
the top it's created automatically so
default value is series one for that
just return to a code and in here we
have written this line this chart arrow
point a series series named arrow point
appoints add XY and in this bracket I
want to show the name versus age graph
so you see I have name and ages in the
database and I am retrieving this name
and age from my database in these
variables that I don't want to use this
variable so I will copy this whole goal
my reader arrow pointing at string name
and I will click paste in this bracket
so this is this will take the names from
the database and put it into the chart
and I we take this my reader get int 32
age you don't need dot to string because
this we are using for taking the value
in this string form so we just need my
reader and get int 32
so copy and paste it here so this is the
x-axis and this is the y-axis okay
main versus age so this line will take
the name and age from the database and
load into chart one and let's try and
run the program it was if it works or
not
so my username and password and when I
press this load but my daughter should
appear here so the old chart and you see
from the database it takes all the
values and show it into my chart I can
verify this by seeing my daughter base
john-john two times Patrick Jill person
knee mark and all the same names are
here and their ages are here okay so in
this way you can link your chart with
the database and if you want to know
more about chart please watch my last
video I am shown how to use the
properties of chart with this charts so
I hope you have learned something new
this time please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
