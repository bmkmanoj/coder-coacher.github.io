tutorial on C++ programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what are vectors in C++ and how we can
use vectors in C++ so what is a vector a
vector is a sequential container same as
an array so array can contain more than
one element of same data-type at the
same time similarly you can use vector
to contain collection of data which is
of same data-type
but there is a difference between the
simple array and the vector and the
difference is whenever you declare a
simple array like this you need to
define the size of the array or
initialize with some size and it's
really hard to change the size of the
array or simple array dynamically but
vectors whenever you use vectors you can
change the size of these vector
dynamically okay so that's the main
difference between simple array and
vectors but in addition vectors comes
with their own functionality or
functions which can be used in much
broader way than a simple array so let's
see how we can declare a vector so to
declare a vector you need to include a
vector library so include vector and
then to declare a vector you just need
to call STD vector and then in these
angular bracket you need to give the
datatype so I if I want to have the
collection of integer value I will give
the data type int or STD string
I need to give the string library add
the same string library here but you
understood the concept right or float
values or something like this so for
example I want to have the a vector of
integer values then comes the name back
and just you can end it with semicolon
otherwise you can initialize it with
some value so if you initialize this
vector by then it means that it has the
initial size of 10 so you can store 10
values or you can give or you can
initialize vector with no value and we
can add these values dynamically so to
add values to a vector you just need to
have the name of the vector dot push
back and this is the method which we use
to add the element to the vector from
the back so from the end of the vector
right so now what we are going to do is
we are going to add some element to it
for example we want to add a value of 10
here so the first value of this vector
is 10 and we can add in a similar way
different values for example 20 30 and
40 so similar to arrays the index of the
vector start from 0 1 2 3 ok now in
order to get the size of the vector so I
told you their size can be changed
dynamically so now that the vector size
becomes 4 right so let's print the size
of the vector now in
and then we can write vector size is
equal to and then we can use this vector
name dot there is a function called size
which we can use to print the size of
the vector so now whenever you run the
program you see the vector size is equal
to four and let's see we will place this
vector size here and let's see whenever
we add two values what is the size of
the vector and then whenever you have
four values so the vector size whenever
we add two values the vector size is two
and after adding two other other values
the vector size is four so it's size is
changing dynamically right now to
iterate or to access the values in the
vector you can use simple for loop for
example for int I is equal to zero
I should be less than the size of the
vector which is this one right so size
of the vector we can get it from here
and I plus plus right and you can
iterate over this vector like this so we
will just write vector and then the
index I told you index start from zero
and then in here we will give some space
and then we can access the value using
these square brackets and then the index
okay similar to arrays and here I forgot
these and run the program and it prints
the index so index zero value is ten
index one value is 20 index two values
30 index three values for
right the same for you no result you can
get using the function called vector so
the name of the vector dot at and this
is also a this takes the index of the
element and then using this also you get
the same result so run the program and
you get the same result now to erase any
value from a vector you can use a
function or you can use the function
called arrays so my back dot arrays and
this arrays you can see when you hover
over this it takes the position of the
element you want to delete now there is
a trick to erase the element so there is
something called iterators which i will
teach you in some other video but
whenever you do something like back dot
begin it means that you want to give the
iterator from the starting so this is
the like indicating the start position
of the vector so for example i want to
delete this ten which is at index 0
which is the first value of the vector
this will indicate the first value of
the vector right so let's try to erase
the first value and then we will iterate
over the vector once again right so now
let me give some space also so that we
know that this is
okay so we have given some space here
and now we will run the program and now
you can see the initial size of vector
was four and the values were 10 20 30 40
but after erasing the first value using
vector dot arrays and in argument my
back dot begin it has deleted or erased
the first value which was 10 from the
vector in a similar way you can use my
back dot and to delete the last value
for example you want to delete this 40
which was the last value we have
inserted and run the program and now I
think it has deleted it will delete the
last value but there is some problem
here and the problem is you can't use
and directly but what you need to do is
you just need to write my back dot begin
and then give the or add the index which
you want to delete so for example I
write begin dot two and now when I run
the program you see it has deleted the
second index value right so the set X
the value at second index is 0 1 2 so
the value at index 2 is 30 so if you
want to delete the value at index 2 then
you just need to write begin plus 2
similarly whenever we write begin plus 3
so the value at the starting plus the
value you
to delete so index of the value you want
to delete so if you want to delete the
value at index 3 then you just write big
n plus 3 ok run the program and it
deletes the last value like this ok now
for example you want to delete the value
on the basis of the value for example
you want to delete the value 30 from the
vector how you can do it what you can do
is we will add other another library to
remove which includes this include
algorithm which has the method called
STD remove and then we are going to copy
this erase function once again and in
here in the arrays we will write some
arguments so this argument will be STD
remove and so this is a function which
we can use to remove some value from a
vector right and in here it takes three
arguments the first value the last value
and the value itself right so inside
this STD remove just you just give my
back begging begin comma and then just
copy the vector name dot and and the
value you want to delete right so we
want to delete the value 30 so next
argument will be 30 because we want to
delete based on the value of the vector
right and then just after the ending of
the remove you just need to write comma
and then once again my vector dot and
and I'm going to comment this and run
the program and this has removed the
value 30 from our vector right so we
have no value 30 okay so we have seen
how to erase value how to it is a value
based on the value so we have to erase
on the basis of index how to erase on
the basis of value like this now if you
want to erase all the values from the
vector or if you want to clear the
vector so you want to delete all the
values from the vector what you can do
is I will just I'm going to comment this
out and what I'm going to do is to
remove all the values from the vector I
can just use the vector name dot clear
okay and what this basically do is it
will clear all the values from the
vector and that means there will be no
values whenever you call this method on
the vector vector will be empty okay so
run the program and for the first time
it has the four value but after deleting
or clearing this vector we have nothing
inside of a vector so it hasn't printed
anything so for example if all if we
call this size of the vector after
clearing this data after this my back
dot clear it will show that the vector
size is equal to zero now right so this
you can call whenever you want delete
everything terms from the vector vector
now there is a function to check if your
vector is totally empty or not
and this method is called back dot empty
it returns the boolean value so you can
just write my wax dot dot empty my back
dot empty and this returns a boolean
value true or false so to check whether
your vector is empty or not we can just
write is vector empty we are checking if
the egg vector is empty and run the
program and it returns zero right so
whenever your of it returns zero it
means your vector is not empty right now
whenever we uncomment this clear or
clear function on the vector now see the
result is vector empty its returns 1 1
means yes and 0 means no right 1 means
true and zero means false so now after
clearing all the values from the vector
vector becomes empty so it will give 1
and whenever we comment this so we are
not clearing the values all the values
and run the program it says is vector
empty it returns 0 so it says no vector
is not empty it has some value because
we haven't cleared all the values from
the vectors so there are many functions
in this vector class which you can use
so you can just write your vector name
and dot and you can you know see there
are so many method to arrays and
empty data you can see at back pop back
so there are so many function which you
can use from this vector class so just
just you know choose a function and try
to use it in your you know in your
program and you will be good to go
because practice is the thing which will
make you perfect so I hope you enjoyed
