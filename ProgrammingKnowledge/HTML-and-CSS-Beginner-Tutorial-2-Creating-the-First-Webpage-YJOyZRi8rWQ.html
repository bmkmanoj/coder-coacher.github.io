last video I have given you a brief
introduction of HTML and CSS and I have
also shown you how to install this
notepad plus plus editor for writing
your HTML code in this video I will show
you how to write your first HTML code in
this notepad plus plus so the first
thing you need to do is to create a HTML
file so how you can do it you can do it
by clicking this new button from here or
by going to the file and clicking this
new from here and then what you need to
do is just go to file once again just
select this tab for the new file and go
to file once again and save as click
this save as and it will open a new file
saving wizard so for making your HTML
file it's better to make a separate
folder for saving these HTML files
because this web pages have to show the
the pictures and other stuff so it's
better to save all the HTML document
files in a same folder so I made a
folder called web and in that I'm going
to save my file so I will name my file
as index so this index it's a common
convention to write your main HTML file
as index file so it's better to give the
name of this file as index and then you
don't want to save it as text file so
you just click this save as type and
select this hypertext markup language so
it will save your file as a HTML page
and now just click Save
so it will be saved in the folder when
you go to the folder in which you have
saved your file it looks like this so it
already has taken the symbol of the
default browser file okay now we will
write our first program so for writing
the first program you need to write this
line this first line shows the browser
that it's a HTML file so doctype means
document type and HTML shows that it's a
HTML file so every HTML file start with
this declaration now what you do next is
you make this less than and greater than
sign and inside this you write HTML ok
so this and once again HTML and this
time with up slash okay so this shows
that this is a web page this is a these
and this is called tags so this one is
called starting tag and this slash HTML
is called ending tag and inside this tag
you write your webpage information now
your web page is made up of basically
two areas one is called once again head
and when you open any tag you need to
close that tag too like we have done in
HTML so opening is like simple name and
when you close this tag you just add
this slash to close that tag so your
HTML page is basically made of this head
in
which you're heading comes and the
second thing is the body body tag okay
not Bobby but body yeah so you need to
close this tag also by this slash so
this comprises of a web page this
heading takes your title your search
information and basically what you can
see in the head of your web browser and
this is the main page of your website so
for example let us give some title to
your website or web page so right this
greater-than less-than and give title
and when you open this title you need to
close it also so just give slash single
and these tags you can write in a same
line also like this or on different line
it it doesn't matter if you write on the
same line or different line okay and in
here whatever you write will be the
write the title of your webpage so for
example my title web and now what you
need to do is you need every time you
make addiction or in your code you need
to save this file okay and now you want
to run this file so go here in run in
the menu bar this run and it will show
you your default running option it can
open your web page in Firefox Internet
Explorer Chrome or Safari or whatever
browser you have so for example I want
to open my web page from Firefox so I
click this launching pie
Fox and it opens my webpage you see as I
already told you this is the body of
your HTML files which doesn't contain
anything but you can see the title now
here my title web so this is the title
information which you have already
created right now we will add the body
to our web web page so go inside this
body start and end and in here where you
will write the body of the web page so
for example you want to show some
heading in your body so right
once again greater than less than and
right h1 h H stand for heading and if
you open the heading then you need to
close it so you can give heading up to
six sizes and h1 is the biggest size of
the heading and inside this I write hi
YouTube for example and once again I
save the file so h1 is the biggest you
will see the biggest heading so write
save this file and go to the browser and
just refresh this page once again and
you can see this heading on your web
page so this is the first body part of
body writing on the web page you can
change the size of this head heading by
just changing instead of this H to H 1
you can write h2 or h3 so we have seen
h1 is the biggest and h6 is the some
small it so let's see what how this
small
sighs we'll look so right at six and H
sticks just save your file and go to run
and launch in Firefox once again and you
see this is the smallest heading size so
it's very small so you can choose your
heading size from one to six now let's
add some more data to our page so now
for example I want to add the paragraph
to my web page so adding the paragraphs
right greater than and less than sign
and you give this P tag to write the
paragraph and you start and end once
again here like this and inside whatever
you write will be the paragraph so for
example you write this is the paragraph
and just save your file once again
whenever you add it you need to save and
just run your webpage and you see a
paragraph is here okay so this is the
basic body of your HTML page it has the
initialization if the page always starts
from this HTML start and end tag it has
heading which can contain your title and
other information and it has body which
contains your main web page information
so in the next video I will show some
more code how to add some more
functionality to this web page so stay
tuned and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
