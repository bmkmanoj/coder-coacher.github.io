knowledge for YouTube video channel in
this video I will describe you what this
channel is all about so I have started
that this channel a 1 year ago when I
have completed with my Java project and
I decided to give my programming
knowledge which I have gained during the
making of this net means Java project
and I decided to make the video on it
because at that time when I was making
those projects
ah there is no videos on the YouTube
which can describe how can I make a full
project on Java so I decided to make the
videos and Here I am it's been I hear of
making those videos and first of all I
have made the videos on NetBeans Java
with MySQL and SQLite databases and till
now I have made around 142 videos on
that so started with making these
NetBeans Java with use and slowly and
gradually you people are liking those
videos and so I also decided to make the
videos on other language whatever I know
I want to show you and describe you so I
have made the videos on MySQL C++
windows form application and right now
I'm working on c-sharp videos so till
now I have made around more than
hundred videos in one year and with your
support and your blessings I will make
more videos if you want so let's see
what this channel contains this channel
has this playlist so you can choose
whatever video you want to see and here
it has some links so lot of you have
been asking me to give the code of my
videos which I have used in my videos so
I decided to make this blog called
programming knowledge block dot blogspot
dot
the country-specific extension so this
can change so here I have provided the
code which I have used in my Java
NetBeans video so it has the title of
the video and the code which I have used
so it's under this page Java codes in
this blog I have also provided C++
example when I was learning C++ the
example I have solved so this also I
have given in this page so all the C++
code if you want you can just see them
and if you require some of the code you
can just copy them and use them in your
projects and also here is the videos and
tutorial page and I have provided all
the links of my videos here so it has
all the links of java spring videos
which are NetBeans based videos it has
all the links of MySQL database with UC
Plus pass videos and Weebly and what I
have made on VirtualBox
Ubuntu also I have given the link in
this blog so you can find many
interesting codes here I have pasted all
the codes which I find interesting and
which I feel that it's helpful for you
so you can find all the videos linked
directly from here also and here you can
find the labels so according to labels
also I have tried to divide all the
codes so in here so you can also see
here whatever you like you can also
subscribe me here on this blog and you
can ask me the question here also so
take a look on this blog also there is a
small forum also I started with which
you can ask me a question and give
answers to other people questions also
so if you want you can see this also so
this is about my blog and I also have my
facebook account and page which is
called NetBeans Java you can send me a
friend request here and you will be
updated what I'm doing on YouTube and
what I
doing related to the coding so it's
called net means Java and I have made
other two things also the NetBeans page
for these videos and all the codes
related to the NetBeans so just click
this NetBeans Page FB and you will go to
the page which I have made for NetBeans
code so here people can share their
fully developed
NetBeans Java project and they share the
picture they share the video they share
the codes so you can look at them you
can share your stuff so others can also
see what you have done and take the
inspiration from it and they also will
make awesome projects on NetBeans Java
and I have also made a group on visual
C++ and C sharp so here also if you want
to learn with visual c++ windows form
application or c sub shop windows form
application you can join this group you
can ask question you can discuss topics
you can do whatever you want you can
share your code so this also I have made
this group for C sharp and C++ so this
is all about this channel and the things
related to the programming knowledge
channel so keep watching the videos keep
supporting me and I will make whatever I
know and whatever I can to help you so
