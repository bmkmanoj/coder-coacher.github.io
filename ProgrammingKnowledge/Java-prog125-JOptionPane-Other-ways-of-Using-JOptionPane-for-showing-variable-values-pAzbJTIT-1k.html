video we will look how to use J option
pain in different ways so till now we
have seen the use of J option fee pain
for example I will show you for saving
the new value and I press this button it
shows the message saved so this message
saved and this frame is called J option
pain so we have seen a simple use of J
option pain till now and when I press ok
it saved but for example you want to use
this J option pain in a more interesting
way I will show you how to do it so for
example you want to use this J option
pain for showing different line values
in different line this is just an
example jump
generally previously what code we have
written in that code we can only show
only one line but for example I want to
show this so many lines in my J option
pain or message and how can I do this I
will show you today okay so let's see
how we can do this I will close this
thing
and we start writing like old
so yeah I will take a case study of
example so for example when I want to
save some employee data it must show me
the confirmation message that employee
ID has been entered this name has been
entered whatever name you have enter
also name it you have entered in a
message box so how you can do it I will
show you right now so what I will do is
I will go to my save actionperformed
method and in here I have written this
code J option being dots show message
dialog not saved for showing the message
saved instead of this message I want to
show the message that you have saved
this name this surname and this value or
ID so how can I do this I will show you
now right now so what you have to do is
whenever you have written this code go
above their dad and write
string message whatever variable name
you want to give and then the world
quotes and semi-cool and in this we will
write our message so this message if you
will pass into rj option pain is we will
pass it in the form of HTML code so you
have to write this this and inside this
HTML and just copy it and paste it once
again and then here you just have to
give this slash sign and in between we
will write our message so for example I
have already told you that I want to
show employee ID name and surname when I
saved my daughter it will confirm me
that I have saved this name and this
employee ID n this surname so alright
first of all what employee ID
ID is equal to and now I have to show
the value of that employee ID so how can
I do this I will give two double quotes
and in between double plus and in
between I have to give my employee ID
string which I am taking from this
textbox so I will copy its variable name
what's called text employee ID and we
paste it here and after that I will
write dot get text
so it will take my employer ID number in
the form of string and it will show
employee ID is equal to whatever your
string is okay
and in the next line I want to show the
name so what I do is generally in HTML
code we gave this BR it means change the
line and then I will after this PR I
will give it a Enter key and in here I
will write once again my name name is
equal to double quotes between plus us
and been in between the variable name of
my name text field so text field
and once again copy this BR and paste it
here okay and press ENTER once again and
once again if you want to print surname
I will just copy to ease the things name
and copy the variable name surname and
paste it here
so this is my message which I want to
show and how can I show this message
after this you have to write J optional
pain and write option pain as variable
name I you can take it anything this
variable is equal to nu J optional pain
copy this and give brackets and close it
in the next line copy this variable name
J option pain and dot set
you should be not set
message
and in this bracket copy this message
variable name or the message and paste
it here okay in the next line you will
write once again this joptionpane dot
set message type and in here you will
write
copy this year option paint and paste it
here dot
information message we are showing the
information that our employee name and
ID is this so this is information
message and once again right J dialogue
this one jail dialogue and give it a
name
dialogue is equal to your option pain
variable name dot create dialogue
and close this here and in here we will
bite null and you can give any message
so you write entered this message on the
top of the dialog box and at last what
we do is he will copy this dialog
variable of the dialogue dot said
visible so this is the code I need to
show the message in different lines and
now we will check our code whether it
works or not so I will run it and it's
funny yes
and now I will give some other I will
save some other information of employ
and I will press say button and it shows
me the employee ID you can see it here
and in the next well use name and
surname and it's not taking name and
surname very you know very good manner
it's not taking so I will see what is
the mistake but employee ID it straight
taking exactly the same 7
Dean you can see what it's not taking
the name so I will see what is the
problem okay
it's too big
so let me see the problem so I think I
found the problem here I only have taken
this variable name text name of my name
I have to write text name dot get text
and here also dot get text now I think
hopefully it will work I will run my
program
and once again I will try to enter some
new employee username and when I press
save see it shows my employee ID then my
name is equal to this and then the
surname is equal to this which I have
entered here so in this way you can show
the messages in your way or you can
custom your messages in your je option
pane
okay and my employee is saved so I hope
you have learned something new this time

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
