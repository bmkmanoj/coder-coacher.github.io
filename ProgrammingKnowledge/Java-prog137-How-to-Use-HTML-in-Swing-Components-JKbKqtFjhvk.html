video I will show you how to use HTML
with your swing component so if you see
here in your palette you have many swing
components
yeah so for example I take a label and
in here I can change its text and also I
can resize it but if I want to show
multi-line in my label I would have to
think twice right or simple it's simple
to change the font from here just go to
the properties and click font and you
could be able to change the font so font
is change and in the same way you can
also change the background color or
something you can set up the icon from
here but for example if you want to show
text in multi-line so you want to show a
label with multi-line it in it so text
and in the second line you want to write
something else text sample text line and
in the first line you want to show first
word and in the second line you want to
show the second word it's really
difficult to show it with simple swing
component code or the other example is
if you want to show multi line or a
single line with different font size and
different color so for example I will
just change texture sample for example
and I can resize it goes and I want to
show this text in different form and I
want to
show this sample in in different font
and different color also so it's a
little bit difficult with only Java code
or only Java swing component code so for
that we can use HTML tags with Swing
component and it will be very helpful so
for example I will show you the first
example if you have any HTML editor like
notepad plus plus and I have I'm using
notepad plus plus to demonstrate the
HTML text and I have changed my HTML
file as first got HTML file and in here
I have written a simple HTML code just
HTML start and end and in this I have
written this simple HTML line which will
give me this is some text in the form of
red colors so if you know a little bit
of HTML then you know what this code is
and when I run this code in a browser
you know it looks like this so this is
assume some text in red color so this
text when we copy from here and when we
go to our net beans code and just
right-click it add it text and in the
edit text just paste that code and you
will be able to see the same code like
this okay and when you resize it you
would be able to see that you can show
this in multi-line right
so this is the one use of this HTML what
you have done is just write a simple
color for the text and you just checked
it in your browser if it's running or
not and it's showing red color so I just
copied same HTML code from here and I
just go to my label and I just double
click it and I just change the text of
this label and it's showing me my
desired font and in multi-line also okay
for example I want to show this in
different font so this text first word
will be different font and second word
will be different font then also we can
change it so I will just go to my HTML
editor once again I will just change
this code for font so I have written
this HTML start and end and in here I am
just providing a basic code for
demonstrating this HTML in two lines so
this is a B and this is for underline
you tag for underline so and this is a
break so this will break the text so
when I run the HTML in my browser sorry
because I haven't saved it I need to
save it first and then I run it and it
shows two lines with different font okay
this is bold and this is normal so I
will just copy the same HTML code
from here and I will go to my label and
I will just change its text so I will
copy and paste it and if you can see
it's showing me different font here
because I haven't changed it so I will
just change it here so now if you see
it's showing me different font in
different line if you have to write this
code in Java it will be very difficult
to show your label in two different line
label text in two different line so this
is the use of this HTML code with your
swing component the same thing you can
do it with your button also so just drag
and drop or J button and just
right-click it and edit its text and I
will just paste the whole code same as
here and it shows me multi-line
different font in my button also so this
is very useful when you want to show
multi line or multi color in your button
so everything which works in HTML
generally I'm not talking about
exceptions but in generally whatever
will work in HTML it will work with
these swing components also so for
example now I want to show a table so
this is a label and I want to show a
table inside a label by using HTML code
so I will just go to my editor once
again and I will write the code for the
table so
just if you know basic.html
also you know how to create a table in
HTML right so this is the code for
making a simple table in HTML I will
save it and when I run in my browser it
shows me this kind of a table I just
copy my code from here and I will just
go to my label I right-click it I go to
edit text and I paste the whole code
there and you can see a simple table
inside my label so this also if you want
to show some some text or some design in
your label or or any component like the
panel or anywhere it will work so this
is the basic use for this HTML now if
you are following the my videos I have
been showing you this code for a long
time so I am shown say delete clear data
so this all I have shown you till now so
when I run this program
and you see here if you want to show
multi line in table also you will face
difficulty by using simple Java code
because if you want to give multi-line
how would you give give a slash or
something but it will not work so in
this table also if I want to show for
example name or surname have two lines
in it how can I change this or how can I
show multi line in this table row this
can also be done with HTML so right now
I have a 22 employee data in my table I
will add 23rd some name some age and he
is a male for example so when I press
the Save button it will be saved but
this time I want to show multi-line so
instead of this Jill I can add I will
just go to my previous code for my HTML
code here and I will just copy this I
don't want to show the table but I want
to show this to line of data in my table
so I will just copy this HTML code and
instead of writing the direct name which
is also name which is any surname I will
just enter the HTML code for that like
this whole HTML code and when I press
save here data will be saved and
if you see here you can see multi-line
row right so this is the benefit of
using the HTML in your table also it's
impossible almost to show multi line in
a row but with the help of HTML code you
can do this easily right so this is the
basic use of this HTML and I hope you
can find the obvious of using HTML in
your code and make a good project with
it so I think that's it for this video I
hope you have learned something new this
