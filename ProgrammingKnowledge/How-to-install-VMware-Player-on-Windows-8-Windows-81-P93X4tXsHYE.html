show you how you can download and
install VMware Player on your Windows
operating system VMware Player is a
virtual machine using which you can run
a different operating system on your
host operating system for example I have
Windows as my host operating system
I can run different operating system
like Linux or Mac OS or other operating
system on my Windows operating system or
I can even run Windows 7 if I have a
Windows 8 as a host operating system so
basically you use VMware Player as a
virtual machine which runs different
operating system as a virtual operating
system on your host operating system so
that you can use both operating system
as at the same time without you know
uninstalling anything so to install a
VMware Player you just need to search
for VMware Player and the first link
hopefully will be from VMware comso www
dot VM where calm just click this link
from here and in here what you need to
do is you need to go to downloads tab
and in downloads tab you will be able to
see different options here but VMware
Player is at the very bottom so just go
at the bottom and just search for this
VMware Player and in front of this you
will be able to see this link download
product just click this link from here
and in here you will be able to see
different versions so VMware Player for
Windows 64 VMware Player for Linux 64
but right now I am running Windows 8 as
my operating system so I will choose
this which is VMware Player for Windows
64
this link and then it will download
VMware Player executable file
so using this VMware Player if you have
the ISO file of any operating system you
will be able to install it in this
VMware Player and you can run it from
your you know without closing your host
operating system you can run on your
host operating system this guest
operating system for example Ubuntu or
if you want to install it on VMware
Player and this open - or Linux Mint
which is which are the flavors of Linux
you can run on your windows without you
know closing it or without you parallely
booting this on your machine so now this
download is almost complete once this
VMware download is complete you just
need to click this executable file and
click yes and I will minimize everything
in the meantime and then just click Next
and if you agree with license and
conditions just click I accept terms and
condition click Next and then here is
the directory where VMware Player will
be installed so I will leave it as
default and I will click Next
and it says check for the product update
I will generally leave it as checked and
click Next and help improve you can
leave it as default and click Next and
if you want to create a desktop menu and
Start menu you can leave these as
checked so I want them as the desktop
menu and start menu program folder so I
will leave them else checked and click
Next
and click Next in you and in some moment
this VMware setup will complete so they
saying that this may take several
minutes so be patient and wait for this
process to complete
and now the VMware Player setup is
complete and just click finish and
VMware Player is installed on your
system
and I can see this desktop icon here I
can just double-click this desktop icon
and it will open VMware Player and for
the first time it says use VMware 7 for
free for non-commercial use and you just
need to give your email address for
their promotional something promotional
ads or something if you want to use this
as a free tool so I will give my email
address and then I will just click
continue and click finish and now VMware
Player is ready to use
so in this VMware Player you can install
for example different operating system
for example whenever I want to create a
new virtual machine I can click this
button create a new virtual machine and
in here I can select an ISO file which I
want to install in my system for example
Ubuntu ISO or Windows 7 is or whatever
and this operating system will run on
this virtual machine so I hope you
enjoyed this video and I hope you will
install VMware Player on your Windows 8
and Windows 8.1 operating system for
using different operating systems on
your native computer so that's it for
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
