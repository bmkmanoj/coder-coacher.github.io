show you how you can get back your start
menu button in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
so first thing when you have installed
Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 you will
observe that when you see this on the
left corner of your windows you are used
to the start button but when you click
this start button in Windows 8.1 you
will see this tile menu but not the
Start menu right or if you have Windows
8 you don't even have this Start menu
you need to go to the corner and then
click here ok so I will show you how you
can get back your Start menu as you have
in Windows 7 in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
so first thing you need to do is just
open your browser and search for the
site called www.glastrube.com this
website which is www.seannal.com here
this this is a classic classic shell so
I will just click this download button
here and this classic shell executable
will be downloaded in my windows 8 once
it's downloaded what I need to do is I
will need to just click this executable
file and run it so I will click Next and
I want to accept the terms and license
if you want you can read the license
conditions and if you accept these
license condition just click this and
click
next and once again click Next and click
install
and we'll take some seconds to install
and now you see here it's prompting me
to accept this class section so I will
say yes and now the installation is
finished as soon as you finish your
installation and whenever you now go to
the start button you will see or
whenever you click the start button you
will see some menus here and by these
menus you can decide what menu you want
for your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 you
can select classic style you can select
classic with two columns or you can
select Windows seven style you can even
select your Start button like this or
this or this but I would like to have
Windows seven style Start menu so I will
click this and I will click OK and once
you have clicked ok and when you click
this start button once again you will
see a Windows 7 like Start menu here ok
and if you want to go to Start screen
you can go to that star screen from here
and just click this and your tiles are
here once again but when you go to
desktop you will see this Windows 7 type
menu here and this is what you are used
to right so now you can enjoy Windows 7
Start menu in your Windows 8 or Windows
8.1 I hope you have enjoyed this video
