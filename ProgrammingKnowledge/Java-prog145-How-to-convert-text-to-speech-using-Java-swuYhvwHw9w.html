video I will show you how to convert
text to speech with your Java swing
NetBeans application so I have this
blank form and I want to convert our
text to speech with my java application
so for that I need to download our
open-source speech synthesizer library
so first of all I will show you how to
download that library so go to your
search engine and just write free TTS
dot jar and free TTS dot jar is a speech
synthesizer which is written entirely in
Java so just click this free TTS dot
sourceforge.net link and in here you can
find all the necessary information about
three TDs so what we are going to do is
we are going to download the Java file
so on the left hand side you will see
here free TTS links here go to download
and go to free TTS link and just
download this free TTS one point two
point two version so when you download
this free TTS zip file it will look like
this so I have already downloaded this
file so I let's open it and it has two
folders one is free TTS - 1.2 and second
SR the folder I go into this pre T test
folder and it has some folder also so I
go into this library folder and now it
contains some jar file so I will extract
all these jar file in a separate folder
so just do that just extract all these
jar file in a separate folder I have
already done that so I have this jar
folder and I have extracted all these
jar file in a folder in my computer now
go to your NetBeans project and in the
project go to libraries and right click
go to properties and go here in this
section and click this Add jar or folder
and select your folder in which your jar
files are there free TTS and all these
jar file for free TTS just select all
these files and click open this will add
all these jar file into your project now
what I will do is I will take our text
area in which I will type my string and
I will take a button so when I press
this button it will convert my speech to
deaf text-to-speech I will add it it's
content so I will write speak button and
I will just double click this button and
in here I will write my code for this
peak but next perform but first of all I
need to import some libraries for free
TTS and i/o buffers so just import these
two libraries first is import Java dot
IO dot star and second is import comm
dot Sun dot speech dot pre TTS dot star
or Strix and you are done now in this
button action perform function just
above that I will declare a voice so
free TTS has different voice you can
give so just read this free TTS website
document and you will be able to find
those voice
types so it can have this cabin ll
generated data used by three TTS so I am
going to use the voice of cabin for 16 K
so just like this okay so go to our
project once again and just above your
function right five-eight static
final
string is equal to string voice name is
equal to Kevin and give 16 K okay so
this is the voice of Kevin which will
convert our text to speech now in this
button action perform for speak I will
declare a variable called voice with
capital B and right voice and then I
will declare a voice manager so right
boys
manager VM is equal to
wise manager dot get instance and in the
next line I will write voice is equal to
VM which is my voice Manager variable
dot get voice and this voice is off
Kevin so I copy this variable voice name
and paste it here okay now I will
allocate my voice so right voice dot I
locate and then we will make a try-catch
block very quick try
catch
and we will catch some exceptions
exceptionally and I am not writing
anything here in the catch block because
I think you know how to catch an error
so in here in this try block what I will
do is I will say voice dot speak and in
this peek argument instead of null I
will go to my design I will just click
my J text area right click it copy the
variable name of my J text area go to my
code once again and in here
voice not speak I will paste my chest
exterior name dot get text okay so write
this code this amount of code you need
to write and if you want you can pause
the video and copy the code and now I am
going to run my code so I have this J
text area and this speak button
so I will write hi YouTube and I will
press this speak button so let us see if
it works or not - yes so it works so in
this way you can convert your text to
speech you can add multiple lines if you
want I am
what is new okay and now I will click
this speak button LAN listen for the
voice so it converts my text-to-speech
so in this way you can convert your text
to speech using this three TTS jar files
this three TTS jar or free TTS library
has many features this is this beginning
I have shown you how to convert this
text to speech but just go through this
document which is provided online for
free TTS and you will be able to find
many new features in this library so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
