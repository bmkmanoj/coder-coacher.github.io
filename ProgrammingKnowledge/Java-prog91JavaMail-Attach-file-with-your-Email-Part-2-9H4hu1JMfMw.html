last video I have shown you how to add
this attach button into your java mail
code and in this you will you can show
the path of your attach pilant through
this text field you can give the name to
your take email which file you are
attaching to so now I will write the
attachment code so that this button can
attach a file to our email so what you
have to do is go to your mail action
perform event and this is the code we
have written in last few tutorials so go
to here in the try catch block and now
what I have to do is
in the try catch block we have written
in last pure tutorial I will delete the
text from here I mean I will include the
text ahead in for the code so I will
delete this text set text here and after
this message dot set subject I will
write a new code for attachment so right
mind
body part
and I will give some variable name which
is message body part is equal to you
copy this my body part and paste it here
and throw the packet and now I will
write some text so I will copy this
variable name and I will write it here
dot set text so that is why I have
deleted my set text from the above code
so that I could be able to add or
provide my text here through my body
part variable and I will go up and I
will take the text content from this
string which I have shown in the last
video and I will paste it here okay now
in legs next line I will once again copy
this variable and I will paste it here
no I will not do that I will write
by the part and I will give the variable
name by the part is equal to mu this
once again in multi-part and closed
and is there any mistake see ya
so what is the mistake is I am fixed my
boat so I will fix my import and this is
gone and here you have to write mine
it's better to write the whole thing
once again and my multi-part this thing
so write this after that what you to
write is you will copy this multi-part
and paste it here dot add bottom part
and in here this message body part
automatically comes here so you will
write this and now you will attach your
file so this is the code for attaching
file so what you do is copy this message
body part and paste it here
then you will write a is equal to new
mine
multi-part you have to write this
so then some mistake I should write body
part not multi-part so once again I
write my body part instead of multipath
so my error is gone now and now I will
write the dot off so gotta
data source of variable name data source
source is equal to Nu pi
daata source and filename and instead of
this file you will copy the variable
name you are provided go to your attach
action action performed and in here you
have declared your group global
attachment path variable
so copy this attachment path and paste
inside this data source source dot new
data source file here so this attachment
is showing some error so we have to add
JAV a X dot activation so this error
will go what you have done is whatever
path you will copy from your attachment
button here you have taken in to the
form of attachment variable in this
string and you have just added this
string here so this will take the path
of that judgment for Mia and then place
it into the source variable now you have
to write once again copy this and
message bottle body-part dot
what you have to do is set dot handler
and in data handler you will write new
data and look and you add the source and
this source is this one so this and this
are same so you will do this and now you
will give the name to your attachment so
I will once again copy and paste this
message body part and then set by name
and hear what you have to do is go to
your design this is your set file name
text field and this is its variable name
attached copy this and paste it here dot
get text do like that and then you will
write
we will copy this multi-part
in which you have declared in multiple
part variable dot add body part and this
body part message body part will come
here so this is the code for sending the
attachment with your email and I think
one more length we have to add is
message dot set content and this is this
multi-part will come here so this code
you have to write in order to attach
some attachments and now I will run this
code actually I will replace this email
ID by my email id and I mean actually
run the program in front of you so so I
change my email ID and password in my
program I have given my email ID and
password and the code and so these two
feed I don't need because I already
pasted my email ID and password in the
code directly so I will write the
subject
and some content whatever you want to
write and we will now attach the pile so
I will name or I will choose one pile
which is a PDF file and this file path
is copied here and I will now name my
file so my file dot PDF because my file
is a PDF file so I write file dot PDF I
and now I will click the mail button and
it will take to attach the file sometime
so you can see messages sent so I know
that my message is sent now so this
program is successful so in this way you
can attach some file with your mail and
sent to the recipient so please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
