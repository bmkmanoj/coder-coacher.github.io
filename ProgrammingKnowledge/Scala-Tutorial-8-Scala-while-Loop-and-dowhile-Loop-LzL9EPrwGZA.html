Scala tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use while loops and do-while loops in
Scala so first of all what are loops in
general so loops allows us to execute
certain code repeatedly as long as a
condition is true so let's see an
example of while loop first so I'm going
to just declare our variable which is X
is equal to zero and then we will write
the syntax of while loop just write a
keyword while and then we use these
parentheses and then these curly
brackets and in these parentheses we
give some condition for example we want
to check whether X is less than 10 then
we want to print something so let's
print line x is equal to and then plus
the value of X and then I'm going to
increment the value of x by 1 so I will
just write X plus equals 1 which just
means that we just want to add 1 to the
existing value of X right you cannot
write X plus plus as you can write in
other languages because it's not allowed
in Scala so you cannot write X plus plus
or X minus minus or minus minus X or
plus plus X those prefix and suffix are
not allowed in Scala so this statement
is not valid okay so I'm going to just
remove it and this is just like saying
you just want to increment X is equal to
X plus 1 right and I'm going to just run
this code and see what's the results so
you can see it prints the value of x
from 0 to 9 so what's happening here so
we have declared a variable X is equal
to 0 so initial value of x is 0 and then
we just reach the while loop condition
and in this condition we check whether
the value of x is less than 10 or not so
here we
evaluate some boolean condition and
until this condition is true this code
inside this while loop will be executed
so at first the value of x is zero which
is less than ten so that's why this code
is going to execute and then the value
of x will increment by one and now the
value of x will become one and then we
will loop over this statement once again
until this condition is true so then the
value of x is one which is less than ten
once again so then this statement will
once again execute until the value
reaches nine right so value reaches nine
x is equal to nine which is also true
which is less than ten this statement
will be executed and then once X becomes
ten then this condition is not true so
we come out of the loop so the basic
need for the while loop here is this
condition must match until and unless
this condition will match these
statement will execute otherwise if this
condition is false the execution will
not go inside the while loop now let's
talk about do-while loop so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just write
do the syntax of do-while loop you just
write a keyword do and then give these
curly brackets here and at last you just
write while and then you give your
condition as you have given in the while
loop okay so let me declare our variable
first of all so VAR y equals zero and
then here I will just check the same
condition as I have done with the X so X
is less than 10 so I want to just print
line so print line y is equal to and
then concatenate the value of y here
okay and then I will increment the value
of y by one like this and let's run the
code once again
so now let's see the result so the
result is almost same you can see here
the Y starts from 0 to 9 right and until
this while loop condition is met this
code in do-while will execute but the
difference between while loop and
do-while loop is that in do-while loop
this code will execute at least once
even if the condition is false so let's
say we just say that we are checking
whether Y is less than 0 right and in
our case Y is equal to 0 so this
condition is not matte so we will hope
that this will not execute but in
do-while loop
this will execute at least once so in
do-while the code execution first of all
goes here so it executes this code
inside the do-while loop and then checks
the condition and in while loop this
while loop will first check this
condition and if the condition is true
then only it will go inside the while
loop so let me just run the code once
again and you can see it prints the
value of Y is equal to 0 even if this Y
loop condition is false so this is the
simple way of using while loops and
do-while loops in scala it's very
similar to Java if you're familiar with
Java so that's it for this video please
