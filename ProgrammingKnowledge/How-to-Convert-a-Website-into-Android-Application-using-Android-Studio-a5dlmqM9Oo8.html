you can convert your responsive website
into an Android app it's not really
complicated I'm going to use Android
studio for that and let's see how we can
do it so first of all the prerequisite
is you need to have a website of course
and it should be a responsive website
and what do I mean by responsive website
is like this so whenever it's opened in
the mobile view like this it's kind of a
mobile view it should you know be mobile
friendly right so you can see the menu
you know contracts according to the
mobile view and then you can browse to
the menu like this okay and when I click
something you can see this okay so this
is my website which I want to convert to
an android app which is easy online
converter if you want you can visit this
website for converting many values to
another values and now let's see how we
can convert this website into an android
app so first of all open your Android
studio if you don't know how you can
download and install Android studio I
will paste a link of a video in which I
have shown you how you can download and
install android studio on your Windows
operating system so open your Android
studio and create a new Android project
and in here give the name to your
project I am going to name it as easy
online converter and I'm going to click
Next and right now leave everything as
default you can choose the last one or
latest version but it may be not
compatible with all the you know devices
so I prefer to use for now 4.1 jelly
bean which covers a 73% or 78% of
devices ok now click Next and choose
the blank activity click Next and
believe everything is default if you
want you can change the name of your
main activity but I don't want this so I
will click finish now so now our project
is created and the first thing we are
going to do is we are going to remove
this hello world the component from here
and then what we are going to do is in
the pallet section here we will search
for the webview so search for webview
and drag and drop into your activity
here ok and now what we are going to do
next is we will just select our webview
and go to the properties here and we
will just choose fill parent and the
height also layout height also fill
parent ok and you can just resize it
like this the next step is to go to your
Java folder here and open your main
activity dot Java and in here first of
all we are going to declare a webview
variable so just write private web view
so just search for webview and give a
name to its for example web view ok and
now once you have created your variable
just copy your variable and go to your
oncreate method here and just here just
paste your webview and then we are going
to call this webview by you know casting
it so what we need to do just give a
bracket here and then just write webview
and then after outside the bracket just
write find view by ID so it will find
your component using your ID and then
just write r dot ID dot your webview ID
which is webview in our case now here
you may be confused because your
component ID is also webview and your
private variable is also web
you with the same spelling so for
example I can change it to my webview so
that it will be clear which is what okay
so just do it here now the second step
is just create a variable one more
variable which is webview settings and
just name it as webview settings is
equal to then just take your my webview
and then call a method called get
settings here the next step is to take
your web settings from here and then
call a method called set JavaScript
enabled is equal to true and what it's
going to do is it's going to enable the
JavaScript in your you know webview so
whenever you use a website which is
using javascript it's going to you know
support this okay now next step is to
take your webview variable which is my
webview in my case and then call a
method called load URL and in the double
quotes give the URL for your website so
I will just copy the URL of my website
from here and paste it in these double
quotes okay
now whenever you are using webview in
order to give your device the permission
to use internet you need to change the
manifest file from here so go to the
manifest folder and open Android
manifest dot XML file from here and in
here at the top you can create one more
element here and you can use this user's
permission attribute here and then you
just need to choose the permission which
we want to allow so in our case we want
to choose a Android permission for
internet so just search for this which
is this one Android permission internet
and then close your element
like this now once everything is done we
are going to test our app so just click
this green button here and then it's
going to run our app in the emulator
provided by Android studio to us so now
our app is running on the emulator and
you can see this website it's looking
same as we have seen on the browser
right now for example I will click one
button here what happens let's see so
I'm going to just click this checks and
calculator for example and let's see
what happens when we do this so what
happened is it's going to open this URL
in the browser and this we don't want we
want that whenever we you know click
some you know option here it should be
opened in your app itself right so we
are going to correct this thing in a
moment the second thing we want to add
the functionality for the back button
right so whenever we want to browse the
pacer pages forward and backward then we
want to you know add the functionality
for that and the last thing you may
observe here is the padding around your
app so you can see little bit of margin
is left here around your app which also
we are going to remove let's see how we
can do these things so to solve the
first problem we are going to go to once
again to a main activity dot Java file
and in here we will take over my webview
variable and then we will call a method
called set webview client and then we
will just call new webview client ok and
what this line of code will do is it's
going to prevent your you know URLs to
open in the browser so whenever
or you know app is open and when you
click some link it's not going to open
this link in the web browser okay so
this line is for that I'm going to
minimize this thing so you can see
better now to add the back button
functionality there is a predefined
method here which we can call which is
called on back press so just right on
and it's going to show you this
intellisense just press and select on
back press and this is going to add this
method here now whenever the back button
is pressed and we are browsing a website
we want that we will you know go to the
last page we have browsed so we will add
a condition here and this condition is
just take your my web view first of all
and then we will first of all check if
we can go back so there is a method
called can go back and it replies a
boolean value so if in the app you can
go back then it's going to return true
and in this case what we will do we will
go back so just take your my web view
object and then call a method called go
back so if you can go back you will go
back else you will exit the app so just
write else and this line will be inside
this else condition if you want you can
add these a bracket but for one line you
don't require but let's add it for the
sanity so this is for the back button
functionality now the third thing was
the padding extra padding if you want to
remove this extra padding from here then
go to your activity underscore main dot
XML file and in here in the top there
are some properties related to these
padding you can see here this padding
left padding right padding top and
padding
so these are the attribute which are
responsible for adding the padding
around your app but in our case we don't
want dis padding so we can remove these
four attributes padding bottom padding
top padding right and padding left and
don't remove anything else so just
remove these things and then save your
code and then we are going to once again
run our app okay so let's see what
happens when we run our app so app is
once again running and let's click on
some of the button or some of the links
here for example this case converter and
when I click on this case converter this
time it's going to open inside the app
this link you can see it has opened this
link inside your app it doesn't go to
the browser to open this link here and
let's browse some more lengths here and
we will check the back button
functionality after that so I'm going to
click this checksum link and it opens
this checksum and once again I'm going
to open for example this decimal binary
hex converter from here and we'll put
its opening this URL right inside your
app and when I press this back button
from here it will go back to the last
browsed page and once again go back and
once again go back and then we are in
the main home page of our app and now
this time when you click this back
button it's going to you know close this
app right so in this way you can you
know convert your website into Android
app now the thing which is remaining is
you need to just create a APK file of
this app and then upload it on Google
Play or any other
AppStore so I hope you've enjoyed this
