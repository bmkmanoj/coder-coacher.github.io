bootstrap tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use badges and
labels in bootstrap so first of all we
will look how to use badges in bootstrap
now first of all what is a badge a badge
is an indicator which is associated with
some component for example you want to
add a likes button then you want to
associate a numerical indicator some for
example 5 or 10 how many likes with it
is associated with and this is called a
badge so let's see how we can add a
badge
what example we want to add a link and I
will reference it by hash and then I
will close it and here I will say likes
ok and to add a badge you can just add a
span here so span and close the span and
include a class called badge so plus is
equal to badge and then you will just
add the number associated with it for
example 10 ok so the button is
associated with 10 likes or this link is
associated with 10 likes and refresh it
and you will see this link and this is
the badge which says 10 right in a same
way you can add more badges something
like this for example comments and
comments is equal to 20 ok I save it and
refresh my page and shows here ok now
you can use other component to add
badges for example button component so
we will add a button and in here we will
add a type first which is button itself
and then we will add a class for it
which is BTN
and BTN success for example okay so BTN
success and then you can add for example
same button for likes and then you can
add a same span and close the span and
add at loss called badge and then add
the number associated with it for
example 100 save it and refresh your
page and look like this button and the
badge associated with it okay so in this
way you can add badges in bootstrap now
we will see how to use labels in
bootstrap now labels can be of two type
a label which can be associated with
some component and the standalone label
itself so first of all we will see a
label which can be associated with some
component for example this h1 tag and
this h1 tag says once again likes and
then I will add a span here and in the
span I will add a class called label
label and then label any label you can
associate for example danger default or
primary success as its same as button
right so for example I will add default
label and then you can add the indicator
associated with it so it can be a text
value or it can be a numerical value ok
so just save it and refresh it and this
is your label and this is your h1 text
ok so label looks like this ok and in
the same way you can add labels for
other H tags for example this can be h2
okay save it and refresh your page and
you can see the size reducing for the
labels as our h1 h2 h3 tag changes now
second way of adding labels I will just
remove this because we don't want it so
the second way of adding labels to your
bootstrap webpage is adding them
directly and how to add them directly
you can just add a span here so just add
span and then add a class which is
associated with label so plus is equal
to label label for example default for
now and your text for example example
text okay and we will save it and
refresh our page and this label default
will look like this example text we can
see here okay or we can add different
kind of labels as we can do with buttons
for example success
so you can associate this label with
these type of labels so just save it and
refresh your page and these labels will
look like this
I think link is not a label so you can
remove it and save once again and
refresh it and these labels looks like
this okay
so in this way you can add labels and
badges to your bootstrap page I hope you
