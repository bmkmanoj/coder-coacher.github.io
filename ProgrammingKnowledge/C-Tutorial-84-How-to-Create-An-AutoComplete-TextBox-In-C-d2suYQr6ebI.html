video I will show you how to implement
autocomplete with your text box using
windows from application in c-sharp so
what is autocomplete it's just like a
Google search when you enter some
keywords it will suggest you some
suggestions to autocomplete so that I
will show you today how can you do that
it's a very simple autosuggest
method not really complex so what I will
do is I will take a text box and let me
select this and go to the properties
here and I first want to change its font
so you can see it better
bold and 12 okay and once again select
your text box and see sharp
windows form application allows you to
set the properties for autocomplete so
just select this text box go to the
properties here and you see at the top
three pop properties autocomplete custom
source or to complete mode and auto
complete source so first what we do is
we set the source for autocomplete so
there are different options in the
properties like custom source file
system directories all system source all
URL recently used your URL history and
file system so you can play with them
right now I am taking the example of
custom source so I select this custom
source and now here
autocomplete mode I can say
what mode I want to use in autocomplete
so let's see what are the suggestions
here we have suggest so it will suggest
us then it will append us or suggest an
append so let's select first so this one
suggests and let's see what happens and
because we are using the custom source
then we need to set our custom source
data so just select this autocomplete
custom source from here and select this
and click this small button here and
here you can give the list of the
suggestions you want to appear when I
enter some text in the text box so for
example I want to end the country list
in my text box and I want the
suggestions of the country according to
my typed options so what I have is the
list of countries all lists of countries
you can find it on internet easily just
I copied all the lists of the countries
in this sequence one by one and once
again I go to my application here and
not this one but this one yes so
selection string collection editor so
once again what I have done is I have
selected this autocomplete custom source
and I click this button and here I can
provide my custom list so I'm providing
the list of the countries like this so I
have provided all the list of the
countries so I want the suggestions on
the country list and I click OK here ok
okay so my control list is set and now
when I run the program let me make it it
will be smaller so you can see it and
now when I enter some words here for
example GE it suggests me two countries
I can select Georgia or Germany or for
example you Uganda Ukraine or UAE UK US
Uruguay or so it will give you the
suggestion according to your custom list
okay so you see that so right now it's
giving you the suggestions right because
we have set our autocompletes
mode as suggested when you select
autocomplete mode as append and now when
you run the program see what happens so
for example you it gives you all the
names it appends the names okay or
otherwise for example United and when I
press K then it appends UK otherwise
when I delete it it gives me first
suggestion or it appends sub post
suggestion so this is what append means
and the third suggestion for
autocomplete mode you can use it suggest
and append both okay so generally I
suggested to use this because it will
append and suggest both and when you run
the program once again and now you enter
some word
it appends the first word in the list
and it gives you the suggestions so it
it's doing the both the things so in
this way we can use this autocomplete
properties of the text box to get the
suggestions you can play with all these
different options and let just see what
they are all about maybe in the next
video I will show you how to set your
database value in your auto complete
custom source okay right now these
values which we have given are some
static values but maybe in the next
video probably I will show you how to
fetch the values from the database and
set in this autocomplete custom source
so stay tuned and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
