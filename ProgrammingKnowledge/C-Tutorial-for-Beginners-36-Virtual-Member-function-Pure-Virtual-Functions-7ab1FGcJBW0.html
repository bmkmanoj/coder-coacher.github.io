video I'm going to teach you what is a
virtual member function and what is a
pure virtual member function but before
showing you how this virtual member
function and how to declare this virtual
member function
I must recommend you that you must know
the basic concept of polymorphism in
order to understand this virtual
function because this virtual member
functions are generally used whenever
you are using polymorphism so I am
showing you how to use polymorphism in
the last video if you don't know what is
polymorphism I have shown that in the
last video so please watch that and I'm
going to take the same example from the
last video in order to demonstrate this
virtual member function so in the last
video I have defined a base class which
was which I call it as a shaped glass
and what my purpose was is I wanted to
calculate the area of different shapes
so I have this base class called shape
and this was this shape class which is
my blade base class have these member
variable height and width and have these
this member function called set values
and what this is doing this is just to
doing this this is just setting the
values of width and height here right
and I will also define a derived class
or which I called rectangle land which
is inheriting from the shape class and
this has only one function called area
and this what this was doing this was
just calculating the area of draw
rectangle by multiplication of height
and width and if you know and you are
inheriting from a class its member
functions are available in the derived
class if they are private or if the
a public or protected members right in a
similar way I have defined this triangle
class to calculate the area of triangle
and I was inheriting from my shapes last
and this triangle class also had a
function member function called area and
I was calculating the area by
multiplication of height and width
divided by two and let's see how virtual
function work so first of all what is a
virtual member function a virtual member
function is a member function that can
be redefined in the derived class
okay so let's see how we can define a
virtual member function one more
important thing is you can define a
virtual function or virtual member in
your base class only okay so my shape
class is the base class so I can define
the virtual member function here so how
you can define you just need to use the
keyword virtual and then the normal
definition of a member function for
example I want to call my function as
area so I will just define the function
called area which takes no argument and
it returns returns zero for example okay
so this is how you can declare a virtual
function and what is the use of defining
this virtual function so if you define
your member function as a virtual
function in your base class you can
provide the redefinition of this
function in your derived classes so I
have this virtual function called area I
can provide the redefinition of this
virtual function in my rectangle class
by the names same name area like this
and I can even define the same or read
nation of dysfunction in my triangle age
class by a redefinition I mean the name
of the function is same or the prototype
of the function is same but the
implementation is different for
different classes or the implementation
is depending upon the class in which its
defined ok so the prototype is same
which is int area and the definition is
different so in the case of rectangle I
was calculating just height into width
and the case of triangle I am
calculating the triangle area by height
into width divided by 2 so the basic use
of virtual function in the base class is
just to tell C++ that we have defined
this function as a virtual function
because we want to redefine this
function in my class and I want to read
redefine the definition of this virtual
function in my derived class according
to the requirement of the derived
classes and this virtual member function
you can use as a normal virtual function
whenever you want to use it in the main
class so G for example I declare
instance of this poly by the way this
code I have written in the last video
right if you remember and I have defined
the instances of my derived classes
rectangle and triangle like this rack
and try and this I have also defined the
instance of my base class which I call
it poly right and according to the
polymorphism concept I can point to this
derived class using my base class like
this so I can define a pointer which has
the reference of my derived class object
ok in a similar way I have done the
definition of this triangle bleep they
would derive class also and in a similar
way I can point to my base class also so
this is the instance of a base class
which is pointing to the base class
itself and I can set these values set
values which I have defined in my base
class you can see which set the value of
width and height here and then I can
calculate the area of the specific
member or specific class for the
specific class so rectangle gives the
area of rectangle triangle gives the
area of triangle and Paul Polly gives
the area of polygon which I have defined
and I can compile it and I can run it it
gives the area like this so the area of
rectangle is 200 which is 10 into 20
right thing Aria of triangle is 100
which is 10 into 20 divided by 2 and a
Polly is 0 because we have defined a
virtual member function which was
returning zero here right now this is
about virtual member function now what
is a pure virtual member so a pure
virtual member is a member which have no
definition so right now I have defined a
virtual member function like this and
this is returning zero here that means I
have provided some definition to my
function but if you want to tell that
this is a pure virtual function you
don't even provide any definition here
and how you can say that this is of a
pure virtual function you just need to
assign zero to this function and then
this tells this type of declaration
tells C++ that this is a pure virtual
member function and what is the
speciality of this pure
remember function the speciality is you
don't even have to give the definition
to this pure virtual member function in
your base class you can redefine this
virtual member function in your derived
classes like this okay so this is a
short way of telling a c++ that you have
this function in the base class which
you want to redefine in your derived
classes according to the requirement of
the derived classes so you can do it
like this this is how you can define a
pure virtual member functions okay now
suppose for example I don't give the
definition here of this pure virtual
member function okay and I don't
calculate the area of this rectangle
also for example and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to compile my program so
I compile it and it gives me the error
okay and why it's giving me the error
because it says cannot declare variable
poly to be the X abstract type shape so
this error is coming because I haven't
defined or I haven't given the
definition of member function or pure
virtual function area in my rectangle
class so this is the restriction of pure
virtual function if you define a pure
virtual function in your base class you
need to redefine the definition of this
member function in your derived class
otherwise it will give the error okay so
I haven't redefined this area member
function in my rectangle class which is
deriving from the my shaped loss so this
is throwing an error of this week
the compilation error right so I have to
give the definition of this number
function virtual member function area in
my derive class otherwise it will throw
an error so once again I will define the
definition here and once again I compile
it and we'll run fine I think
let me see and once again it's cannot
declare variable poly because it's AB
sprite type let's see yeah so once you
have this you you know once you define
your function as a virtue pure virtual
member function
it makes your class as an abstract class
and what is the abstract class abstract
class is a normal class but the
speciality of the abstract class is it's
just the definition of the class so
abstract class or something very similar
to our shaped glass and abstract classes
are just the definition of the member
function and no implementation is given
here okay so we haven't given any
implementation of the area function so
we cannot define this object here this
is true and once again compile it yeah
yeah I need to remove this also and this
will not give me an error okay so always
remember that if you define your member
function as a pure mem fewer virtual
function this makes your class base
class as an abstract class and abstract
class is a class
have only the definition okay
so not the definition but the
prototyping definition you provide in
the derived classes okay so notice that
our area here have no definition okay
okay so I hope you have understood the
concept of pure virtual function and
virtual member function and I hope you
