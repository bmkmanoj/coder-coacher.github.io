video I will show you how to use a radio
button and check boxes with your are we
should C++ windows form application so
what I'm going to do is first I will
take for example a radio button so
search for my ready button here okay and
as you know we are developing our
application so previously we have made a
application to enter the basic
information of an employee for example
his employee ID his first name age the
last name and age now suppose I want to
enter his gender whether he is a male or
a female and because I only have two
option male or female I will add a radio
button to select the gender of the
employee so I will take one radio button
and second radio button
and I will change the name of these two
radio buttons not name just the text so
mail and second is
email
okay
so
I will enter employee name last name age
and gender and one thing you also can do
is you can enclose your fields this data
in one group box which looks like this
I will show you here box
this is the group box just drag it into
your application and just move it like
that and all the information which you
want to separate from your form you can
just drag and drop into this group box
so it looks a little bit nicer
okay
I will add my
Martin's also in a quote and I will name
my group box I will change that this
text also which is group box one we go
to the properties and I will change it
as employee info group box so it looks
nicer when you look at it right and drop
box I have taken for a special purpose
that group box groups the fields
together
so whatever element is enclosed in the
group it's one unit together so this
group box is one unit and your J your
form is also one group box so this all
the other stuff is one unit so what is
the use of taking the group box is for
example now I may take the check boxes
to show the difference and when I run
the program
so
you can see they are in one group box so
I select this and when I select this
this goes off and because our frame is
also a group so it will not affect this
probe so when I select this this is not
affected but when I select this
these two are selected so suppose I
enclose these two are in one group box
also then they will behave like this
only one will be selected at a time so
this means that when you enclose these
check boxes or radio buttons in a row
box only one can be selected at a time
otherwise you can select both of them
okay so this is the basic use of aprox
so I will exit my application once again
and now I want to enter the gender of
the employee so what I have done in my
database I have made one more column for
gender which is not filled yet because I
won't enter any data so what I want to
do is when I have press Save button my
data
plus the gender of the employee should
be saved in the database which is this
so how can I do this let's see so first
of all you go to your source code of
your pump and go at the top yeah and
just
below the destructor of your form you
can recognize it with the still design
just below that this is the whole
function so here you will declare one
more variable and variable name is
gender for example which is a string
type click OK and once again come to
your home and just double click this
first male radio button and I come to
the event of that radio button and what
I will do here is a we rewrite my gender
variable gender is equal to
me okay so when you press or when you
select the gender radio button for the
male then in my gender variable I will
place male strain same I will do for
female so when I just double-click it
and in its event just about being based
and instead of mail now you write
females okay and now I will come to my
page design once again and now I want to
save this gender so I will go to the
save but button and double click it and
this is the code I have written for
saving the data so if you don't know
this code just go to the 9th and 10th
video in that I have shown you how to
save data using that Save button and I
will go to these queries and we run
through the twenty first insert into
your database dot your table name and in
here are the columns of the database so
now previously I was entering a ID names
on a manage now I want to enter gender
also so I we just add this
one more field gender
and values and in the bracket I'm
entering the values so I want to enter
one morning here so single coat and then
double port plus plus and in here I'll
pass my gender variable which I have
declared above this one if you don't
remember this gender variable and
once again to the query and in between
this which I have made I will pass my
gender variable okay
so I think this is it I want to check
whether it's working or not so I will
check it
silento my leman password for example
and now right now I have nine employees
and now I will add the tent and point so
then
more gun
prey age is 34 not here here for and he
is amazed okay and I want to save this
data so I will press save and data is
saved okay but I want to check whether
the data is really there or not so you
go to the database and just refresh your
database once again and you see no
gender field is filled which we are
filling with the help of radio buttons
one more time this time I want to enter
some we mean an 11th employee Julie and
surname is same ages 25 and he/she is a
female so we click this female and click
the Save button that I saved okay once
again I will go to the database to check
I will trust afresh and you can see now
the gender is female and whole data is
saved so in this way you can use the
check boxes also radio button and checks
boxes work likes same so instead of your
radio buttons you can also use the
checkboxes whichever you find good or
better for your application you can
exactly use in the same way as sprained
your buttons
so I think that's it for this video
