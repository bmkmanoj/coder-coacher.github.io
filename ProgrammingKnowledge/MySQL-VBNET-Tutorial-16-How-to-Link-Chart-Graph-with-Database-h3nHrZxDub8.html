video I am going to show you how to add
charts or graph with your visual basic
windows form application in connection
with MySQL database basically in this
video I am going to show you how to
connect your chart controls in visual
basics to your MySQL database so let's
get started first of all I will go to my
toolbox and I will search for the
control called chart so it's in this
data tab and I will drag and drop this
chart control to my form here I have
already made a basic tutorial on chart
control in my visual basic windows form
application tutorial so if you want to
know how to use chart control you can
watch them in the another playlist
called visual basic tutorial so search
in my channel and you will find our
tutorial on how to use charge with
visual basic so now I have this chart
and what next I'm going to take is I am
going to take a button and I will let
name it's as load chart okay and I'm
also going to change the text of this
button as load chart and I'm also going
to change the font size of this button
so that we can see that we want to load
the chart so we can see clearly okay now
what I'm going to do is I will select my
chart and the for example
I want to plot a chart on name versus
age chart which is there in my database
table so I have names column in my data
table called II data and I have age
column and what I want to do is I want
to see the plot or the chart for name
versus age so how can I plot a bar chart
of name versus age I will show you in
this video okay so let's get started I
will just double click this button first
of all I will select this chart and
first of all I need to give some name to
my chart series right now by default you
see here my series name is series one
right so I will select my chart and I
will go to the properties and I will
select the property called series and I
will click this and I will change the
name of the series by going here and I
can change the name of the series as
name versus age so I will say name we
have age for example and I can change
other properties like what kind of chart
I want I want column chart or I want
line chart or other kind of charts so
right now I want column chart so I will
still keep it as default you can change
other properties like background color
foreground color and other properties
like border and you can also set
background picture to the graph also so
you can just play with these properties
and see how this chart can be customized
okay so
click okay and you see here my series
name is changed now okay
now what I need to do is I keep I want
to remember what series name I have
given to my chart and this I'm going to
use it and I also keep in mind that my
chart name is charge 1 now in here I
will just double click this button and
in here what I will do is first of all I
need to make connection with the
database right so what I will do here is
I will pay copy and paste the skeleton
which I have been showing you in many of
the last videos in which I make the
connection with the database and I write
the basic query and all so I have copied
and pasted this code here and I will
explain this code once again to you so
this is the connection instance of my
skill connection which I have declared
above and if you are following this
video you already know what is them my
SQL connection as my skill connection is
and what is this command instance of
command variable is which is an instant
of my SQL command right so in this
button click event of chart I have my
skill corn is equal to new MySQL
connection and then I have given the
connection string which will help me to
connect to my MySQL server so I will
write my silken con god connection
string is equal to whatever my server
credentials are which is so is equal to
localhost and my user ID for my server
and password for my server and the
database name of the database right and
then I have declared a MySQL dot
we do variable which is dim Reda as my
skin dr. wieder and then I have declared
a try-catch log here right so this
try/catch block I'm using to catch any
exception while executing the query ok
so here I am catching the exception
which is a MySQL exception right
and finally when my query is executed
perfectly or it throws any exception
finally what I'm doing is I'm disposing
my connection so I my SQL can be ready
for the next connection and finally I am
ending my trial so just add this try
catch block and in this try catch block
my code start from opening the
connection to the database and ends with
closing the connection to the database
right so just write my con dot open
which opens the connection with the
database and my con closed which closes
the connection with the database and in
between just write the code which
executes sub-query and fetches the data
and all stop it does so next I have
declared a query string so this query
variable which is a string he contain my
query which I sent to the MySQL database
so I will write query is equal to the
query select star from database dot e
data so database is my database name you
can see here and E data is the table
name ok so this is the table name and in
the next line
what I am doing is I'm taking my command
variable which I have already declared
above this command valuable dim command
as my SQL command right and then I am
writing command is equal to
new my skill command and I'm passing my
query here as a first argument and as a
second argument I'm passing my skill
connection variable which is this one
right and then I say a reader which is
which will read my data which is coming
from the database so I will say reader
is equal to command dot execute reader
and then I will fetch my daughter using
value one by one so it will fetch row by
row data and this while loop in this
while loop I will fetch my data and I
will write some code which will load my
daughter to the chart control right so
just write while reader dot read and and
the while loop and in between this while
loop we will write a code to load age
and name to the chart so in between this
while loop just write just write
chart so write chart one which is the
name of my chart dot series and then I'm
going to write the name of my series
right remember I have given the name to
my series as name versus age chart so I
will just copy the name of my series
from here which is name versus age and I
will paste it here in between double
quotes and then I will write dot
points dot add XY and in the bracket I
will pass to argument first will be the
x-axis data of the chart and second
argument will be the y-axis daughter so
I wanted to plot name versus age chart
so in the x-axis I want to assign name
data and on the y-axis I want to assign
the age daughter right so how can I
fetch that data base or data from this
column which is name on the excesses and
the data which is from age column on the
y-axis right so in here I will write
reader just copy this reader variable
and paste it here dot not here but right
dot here dot get string and in the
bracket I will write the name of my name
gold right so the column I want to show
on the x-axis which is named the column
of my name is name itself so just copy
the title of the column and just paste
it here and as a second argument I want
to add the age right
so I will write reader dot get in 32
because age is the integer data type
right so if you can see my Declaration
of the column age age is my integer data
type that's why I am writing here reader
dot get in
okay and then I will give the name of my
column age which is the column name age
right so if you can see here the column
name for the age column is age itself
right so that's why I am writing age
here and that's basically all so you
just need to write one extra line in
your MySQL code skeleton to load the
data for bar chart which is a X versus Y
chart you can say now I am going to run
my program and I will give username and
password which is correct and when I
click this load chart button my name
versus age chart must be plotted in this
chart control so let's press this load
chart button and you can see the name
versus eight chart is here so let's
verify so you can see here the ages are
here and the names are but the problem
is my chart is too big as compared to
the size I have assigned to my chart
right so what can I do is for now I am
going to make my form bigger so that it
can show all the data in the chart so I
have made this chart little bit wider
okay okay so now when I run the program
hopefully it shows all the data because
my data is bigger so you can see here
it's showing data but still you are
seeing that it's only picking some of
the names and all the ages as the bars
and for example I want to show all the
names versus these bars what can I do is
I can go to my chart once again and I
will go to the property called chart
area so I will go to the property called
chart area and just click this
collection button here and I will go to
the property in here which is for let me
see the interval property I am searching
for the interval property so first what
I'm going to do is I will go to the
property called axis so just select this
axis collection here and once again
click this button and in here I will
search for the property called interval
by default this property is auto instead
of Auto just make this as 1 this one
means for every XY x value you will have
the y value so you will see what I mean
by giving one here and what next you may
want to do is the label style so just
select this label style and select this
triangle
button here and just set this angle as
minus 90 degree what this minus 90
degree will do is it will rotate your
x-axis label to minus 90 degree now I
will click OK and click OK once again
and when I run the program once again
now and when I reload my X
bustled y-axis chart you can see all the
names versus H correctly now so your
labels are vertically aligned now and
you can see all the labels one by one
you can also verify this name versus age
chart with the database so first name is
John you can see here and the age is 27
you can see here it's on 27 second name
is Mark which is this one and the age is
around 55 which you can see here 3rd is
e I and the age is around 34 which is
correct so you can match the values and
you can see here all the values are
correct here so in this way you can load
your chart with the database value using
your visual basic windows form
application I hope you have enjoyed this
