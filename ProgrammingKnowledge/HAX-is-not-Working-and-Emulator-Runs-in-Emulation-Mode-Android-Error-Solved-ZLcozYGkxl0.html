show you how you can solve taxes not
working and emulator runs in emulation
mode while running your android
application so you made your cool
application and while running this
application you encounter this error
which says hex is not working and
emulator runs in emulation mode and then
there will be some more detailed error
which in my case says emulator the
memory needed by this virtual machine
exceeds the driver so this is important
information for solving the problem but
I will show you the broader way to check
what can be the problem and how we can
solve it so first of all what you need
to check is while you encounter this
problem that in your SDK manager so just
open your SDK manager by clicking this
button here and in your SDK manager make
sure in the extras category this option
which says Intel x86 emulator
accelerator ha a XM installer is
installed so the status of this should
be installed so make sure this Intel x86
emulator accelerator is installed which
is in extras category right so if it's
not installed just install it ok the
second thing you need to do is you need
to you know you in the first line in
this screen line shows the path of the
SDK where what is the location of SDK in
your computer so just copy this part not
the full part part but the part till SDK
so till here just copy all the path
till SDK after tools you know not need
to copy it so til STK just copy this
path and then just open your file
browser and paste this path there and
press Enter
and this will open your SDK folder in
your computer in this XDK folder there
will be a folder called extras and in
this extras there will be a folder
called Intel and in this Intel there
will be a folder called hardware
accelerated execution manager which
stands for ha a or H a II M or heh a X M
ok go inside this folder and there will
be a executable file here which is intel
haxm - android you need to run this
program if you haven't already done just
do it once and if you have already done
that also you need to run it and after
running it just click Next and I have
already installed this so it says a
change or remove but if you are running
it for the first time it will just
install this ha a or hae X M setup ok so
if you have already installed it just go
to change and in here may make sure that
this and this are same so just keep a
note of this default value of the RAM
okay so in my case it's 1 GB or 1 0 to 4
MB this is important so you just need to
note this value somewhere and remember
this value because we are going to need
this value further ok and make sure
everything is ok it's not installed just
click Next
and click finish right so if its
installed
then just click finish ok so make sure
this is installed and once its installed
now we are ready to you know run our
program but there is one little thing we
still need to do and that is we need to
go to our AVD manager so just click AVD
manager and here is the default emulator
provided by android studio for us and in
here we need to check the settings so
you just need to click this small added
button or this pencil button here click
this button and in here go to show
advanced settings and in here check for
the RAM so memory and storage check for
the RAM here and this right now in my
case is 1 5 2 3 and what we have seen
while running this setup that the memory
it requires is 1 0 to 4 MB or 1 GB right
so we need to make this same as this
value which we got while running so once
again I will run this and once again we
are going to check so this value 1 0 to
4 and this value should match so I'm
going to change it to 1 0 to 4 ok
it may you know vary in your computer
depending upon the speed so make sure
this one while you run this intel haxm
Android executable and this while you
run your AVD configuration and add it
this to 1 0 to 4 so this should match in
both the cases right once you change
this just click finish
and once this creating or updating a VD
is complete we are going to run our
application once again so now when we
run our program once again see the
message was hacks is not working
previously and now we are going to run
this program once again it will take
some time to run and when it runs this
message is going to change I think so
this executing this is executing my task
you
and now I will choose my default launch
emulator and click OK and now see the
message here so hopefully this message
will not appear once again and we will
see the success message
so now my program has been started and
my sample application will run now so in
this way you can solve this problem
related to H a X emulator and I hope you
will solve this problem by the procedure
I have shown you so that's it for now
please rate comment and subscribe and
