tutorial on android app development for
beginners in this video and the next few
coming videos we will see what are
services in Android and how we can use
services in Android so first of all what
is a service in Android a service is an
application component that can perform
long-running operation in the background
and does not provide a user interface so
a service you can say it always run in
the background and it has nothing to do
with user interface for example a
service can be downloading something in
the background or long-running database
operation in the background or you can
say if you want to you know provide some
music in the background then you can use
service for that now a service can
essentially take two forms so service
can be started service or service can be
bound service and in this video we will
see what is a started service and how we
can create the started service so a
service is started when an application
components such as an activity starts it
by calling a method called start service
method ok and once this service is
started it can run in background
indefinitely unless and until it's
destroyed by some component ok and what
is a bound service a service is called
bound when an application component
binds to it by calling bind service
method so this we will see in the later
video but in this video we will see what
is a started service and how we can
create it now to create a service in
Android we need to subclass from a class
called service ok and once you supplies
from the service class the most
important callmax method you should
overwrite are
on start command on bind on create
method and on destroy method okay so
this on start command we'll start your
service and on destroy method will
destroy your service on create method if
you want to do some initialization for
your service you can do it here and on
bind service you are used to create bind
services but you must implement this
even if you are creating started
services so now let's create a status
service in our Android application so I
have this blank project and in here I
will drag and drop two buttons first
button 1 + button 2 and I will change
the text of this button as start service
and the second button text I will name
it as top service ok so we have 2 button
start service and stop service ok
and then I will go to the design of this
activity and in here I will add one more
attribute here and this attribute while
we will call on click attribute so on
click and what method we want to you
know perform when this button is clicked
let's say it's thought service method
and same we want to do with the button
which is top service so we will call a
method on click which will be a stop
service okay so stop service ok now we
want to go to our java mainactivity.java
class so go to main activity dot java
class and in here we will create these
two methods so first was start service
methods so public void thought service
and we will call this view and our
second method was stop service ok so i
will just copy this method and paste it
just below it and this method
we'll be stopped service so once we have
created these two methods start service
and stop service now we can create a
class which will subclass from service
class okay so I will go to here in this
package and I will right click here and
I will create a new Java class where my
main activity dot Java class is and I
will name it as for example the service
ok and I will create it and it will
create this class called the service and
we want to extend from this service
class right so extend and we want to
extend from service class so extend from
service and once you extend from it you
will see it will show this little error
with this little bulb because there is a
method we must implement so just click
this bulb and just click implement
method and this method we must implement
which is on bind even if we are creating
a started service we must implement this
or overwrite this ok so now this error
is gone now we will just add our three
more method which we should implement
first was on create right so on create
second was on destroy or first let's
create on start so on start command and
the third was on destroy so on destroy
ok so once you created or once you
implement these methods what we can do
is I told you you can start a service
using this on start command and you can
destroy a service using this on destroy
command ok so we will do just the same I
will delete this line and what we can do
is we can
create a toast so we know that the
service is started so toast dot make
text and in here we will pass the
context of this class which is this
class itself and the second is our
message so we can say service started
and the third argument will be toast
dot length long for example okay dot
show and next what we can do here is we
will return a constant here so return
and we will return a constant call start
sticky now what is this constant so when
you press your control button and click
this constant we will go to the
definition of this constant and here you
will see this mode makes sense for the
things that will be explicitly started
and stopped to run for arbitrary period
of time and that's what we are exactly
doing okay so that's why we are
returning this constant called
start sticky here okay and inside this
ondestroy method what we want to do is
we want to display this toast message
once again but this time we will say
that the service is destroyed okay
so we know when service started and when
service is destroyed now once we have
these methods implemented we will go to
main activity dot Java file where we
have defined our start service and stop
service methods and in here we can call
this service or we can start this
service using our intent objects so we
will create an object of intent so
intent intent is equal to new intent and
it takes first of all the context so
first of all they
and the second argument will be the
service class okay so the service with
capital T the service dot plus okay and
once you create an object of this intent
you can start service by using this
intent so you can just pass this intent
object here and you will be good to go
same we want to do in the stop service
method and this time instead of starting
this service we you just want to stop it
so just do stop service okay so this
will start your service and this will
stop your service and make sure this
name matches the name you have declared
here okay so stop service and start
service should match these method names
once everything is done we just need to
do one more thing
we just need to go to manifest dot XML
file and in here inside our application
we need to create a tag called
service or we need to add our element
called service so just add service and
the service name is the service because
our class name is the service here okay
and we will close this service and one
more thing you can do here is you can
add a attribute called Android export
so Android exported and make it false
and what this will do is it will prevent
the other apps or other activities to
use this service okay so once you have
done that now let's run our app so now
our app is running so when I click this
start service button I click the start
service button it shows service started
but it's running in the background so
how we can check that the service
is running what you can do is you can go
to the settings of your phone so so go
to settings and inside settings just
click this option called apps and inside
the apps there are downloaded apps and
there are running apps so just click
running apps here and these are the apps
which are running so you can see service
demo here one process and one service is
running ok now for example I close this
service demo app so I'm going to close
this service demo app and now I will go
to the setting and still this service is
running now to destroy this service I
will start my service demo once again so
I will start my service demo app from
here and I will click stop service
button and you can see service destroyed
and once again I will go to the settings
and now you can see this service is
destroyed and we cannot see this service
once again start the service by using
this service demo and go to the setting
and you can see the service is started
and once you go to the demo and stop the
service this will be destroyed ok and do
remember if you don't stop this service
it will keep on running for indefinite
time ok
so in this way you can use started
service in Android I hope you have
