setup for the IntelliJ IDEA will start
so any here we just need to click Next
and the location where it will be

you want to change it you can browse for
the folder where you want to install but
I will leave it as default and click

to ask whether you want to create the
shortcut for it so I will say yes and
once again also it's going to ask me for

and it's going to launch the IntelliJ
IDEA for us now for the first time when
you you know start this IDE it's going
to ask you whether you want to import
your settings from the previous version
of IntelliJ IDEA so I don't have any
previous version of IntelliJ IDEA so I'm
going to just choose I do not have
previous version right and then I will
click OK and now it's going to start the
IntelliJ IDEA IDE now in here you just
need to read these terms conditions and
then if you have accept these condition
just click accept and then wait for the
IDE to you know start now in here you
have two options one is IntelliJ theme
which is this light version of theme and
other is dark EULA theme which is the
darker version of you know IntelliJ IDEA
so what I like generally is this
IntelliJ theme but if you like dark
themes something like this you can
choose this option also okay so I'm
going to choose this default one and
then I'm going to click Next and in here
you have this tune idea to your tasks so
I'm going to just leave it as default
for now and I'm going to just click Next
here and once again I'm going to just
click Next here ok so now it's going to
start IntelliJ IDEA 2000
sixteen at the time of making this video
this edition is the latest version right
so let's wait for the IDE to start so
now our IDE has been started and it's
going to ask us to create a project or
import a project or open some project so
let's create a Java project so I'm going
to just click create new project and in
here you will be able to see on the
left-hand side there are many categories
like Java Java FX Android and maven
groovy and other you know type of
project you can create from here but the
one we want is the Java project so just
to the first option here and in here it
will ask you for the project SDK so by
default there is no SDK selected so we
need to you know give the part of our
JDK folder ok so just click new button
here so click new and then click JDK
here and then you need to just browse
wherever you're you know Java JDK folder
is located so I will browse for my Java
JDK folder which is in my Program Files
and the program files I have this Java
folder and the Java folder I have this
JDK folder ok so remember I had told you
you need to have Java JDK installed
before you know installing this so just
browse for this JDK folder and click OK
and once you click ok now you can click
Next and then click Next and here you
just need to give the name to your
project for example my first project and
then click finish and it's going to
create a new Java project for you and
then we will be able to create our you
know source files inside the project for
the first time it's going to ask you tip
of the day so it's going to give you tip
of the day every day whenever you
start intelligence so just click close
and then it's going to you know start
your project now in here you can see my
project is created my first project and
then you just need to double click here
in order to see this project on the left
side bar here right so double click on
it and you will be able to see this kind
of project Explorer here right so we
will expand this and in here you can see
this source folder right now there is no
file inside this source folder but we
can you know create one file inside the
source folder so let's create a Java
file so right click on it and then we
are going to create a new Java class
here and we will name our Java class as
for example app and then click OK so
this is going to create a new Java class
for you which is app now you can see the
font here looks a little bit smaller so
to change the font size what you can do
here is you can go to files here and
then go to settings and in the settings
just search for font here ok so just
search for font and now you can see here
the font here is this one so just choose
this option which says font and in here
we can make our you know own font and
style so we can just copy the default
fonts and we are going to save it as our
own fonts so just click the save as
button and we are going to just rename
it for example my font ok so it is going
to create a copy for you for this font
and then we can play with the font right
so you can see there is a default font
and now you have your
my phone which you have created right so
now you can increase the font for
example I want 20 size font and I will
apply and I will click OK and once you
click OK then your font size will be
bigger right now in here I want to
create a main method so how do I do it
so to create a main method I just need
to just write P as V M which is the
short-form of public static void main
and then click tab button and it's going
to create the main method for you right
similarly to print something you just
need to write s out and just press tab
button and it's going to create this
system out dot print line you know code
for you and in here you can just you
know write hello world for example so I
will just write hello world and then
save your program and let's run it so
first of all I'm going to right-click it
and then I'm going to just click run app
dot main ok so just click the screen
button which says run am dot mean and
then it's going to build your you know
program and once it's build it's going
to show the output which is hello world
so for the first time it's going to show
you this kind of security alert you just
need to click allow access and you can
see the output is printed here hello
world right now after compiling it for
the first time you will be able to see
this Run button here on the top left
corner so now you can run it from here
so for example you can just add it your
hello world message something like this
and then save it and then click this
green button and it's going to compile
it again it's going to print this output
again
