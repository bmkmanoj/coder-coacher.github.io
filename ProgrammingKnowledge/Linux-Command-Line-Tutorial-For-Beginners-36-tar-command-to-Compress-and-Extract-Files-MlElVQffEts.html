Linux come online to total for beginners
and in this video I'm going to show you
how we can use Star Command in Linux tar
command is used to create maintain
modify and extract files which are
archived in the tar format now tar
stands for tape archive and is it's an
archiving file format just like zip file
ok so let's see how we can use tar file
so for using tar file you just need to
type T AR for the tar format and then
you use some flags with the tar file so
for example you just use C for creating
an archive then you can use V V stands
for verbose which is used to display the
progress in the terminal while creating
the archive file okay and then you use F
flag to allow you to specify the file
name if you do not specify this F flag
then you know your Linux system is going
to create a zip file which is going to
be system dependent and its name is not
defined by you right so let's see how we
can use this so you can see on my
desktop there is a folder called test
right so to make it a tar file or to
compress it first of all I will go to
the desktop folder and then you can see
I have this test folder right now for
compressing this test folder using tar I
can use tar as I told you then C V F
Flags
and then the name of your tar file
whichever you want to give so for
example test dot da R and then the name
of your folder which you want to
compress which is test right and then
when you press enter you can see it has
first showed the progress of compressing
and then once this command is done
at our file is created which is shown
here right on Ubuntu if you are you will
using Ubuntu you can just double click
on the start for the file and it's going
to show you this kind of you know folder
extractor this is a GUI program which
you also can use but most of time we
must use or we I recommend you to use
the star command to compress the file
right now once again if I want to
uncompress this folder once again what I
can do I can once again write the our
command and then for uncompressing or
extracting we use a different flag than
this see right see is for creating the
tar file and then for extracting the tar
file we can use minus X for extracting
ok and then V and F flag will be the
same and then the name of your tar file
ok and what I am going to do is I'm
going to remove this test folder so that
once this tar file will be extracted is
going to you know create or it's going
to extract this folder again okay so tar
and then xvf and the name of your tar
file which is test are in my case and
then press enter and then you will see
this test folder is extracted from this
tar file right
now sometimes you also use the jay-z
format which is Tom
dot G Z and this GZ stands for gzip
format okay and for this we use a flag
called Z so let me clear the dummy here
and once again I want to you know
compress this test folder or directory
to our tar.gz file so what I am going to
do is once again I am going to you star
and then
- see for creating VF for robo's and for
allowing the file name and then you use
Z flag to you know create the GZ format
for you okay and then the name of for
your tar file sitar dot GZ and then your
holder name whatever is the folder okay
but you need to remember one thing here
that just this Z flag must come after
your C flag okay so C z VF okay and then
press enter and it's going to create
your Tod G's add file right and
similarly to extract this folder I'm
going to delete this folder or directory
once again and then I'm going to just
use star and then instead of for this C
flag I am going to use X for extracting
and then I am going to just give this
command which is gzip file name okay and
press enter and it's going to extract
the file and show it here right so in
this way you can use tar command to a
compress and uncompress folders or
directories in Linux I hope you've
