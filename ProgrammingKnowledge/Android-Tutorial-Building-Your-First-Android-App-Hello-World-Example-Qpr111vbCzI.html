Android application so first we are
going to create this application so I
will just click the start on new Android
studio project or it's a better idea to
close it if it doesn't start and by
default it gives a name to your
application which is my application but
you can change this name so for example
my first app okay so first letter of
this app when you you know right it has
small letter here you will be able to
see some warning that the application
name for most app begins with uppercase
so always try to start your project name
with uppercase okay and this is the
domain name which we can discuss later
but leave it as default and then click
Next and we are going to develop our
application for phones and tablets so
click Next
and in here this this is the activity
you can choose from so these are all the
activities so at activities are nothing
but the individual pages which you want
to have on your Android application for
now
we will start with the blank activity
and click Next and leave all the things
as default because this is our first
program and click finish and now Android
will do some settings inside and it will
start the new project in some moments
so it's a building my first cradle
project info and now the Android studio
ide has been started right so we can
just close this tip for now it's being
started so for the first time when you
are you know configure this Android
project it can take some time to you
know configure everything properly but
from the next time whenever you use it
everything will be configured and then
everything will be much faster than the
first time right so now application in
thing up and now we are going to run our
applications so this is our sample
application I will explain everything
what is what and what everything means
in the next videos but this in this
video I just wanted to just configure
our first project and run it so that
everything is okay so I will just click
this green button here and what it's
going to do is it's going to ask me
which a device I'm going to run this
Android app on and by default as a
minute so now this pop-up tells us that
we need to choose the device just choose
the default device at the time of making
this video the Nexus 5 API 21 cross or
21 x86 is the default device you can
choose your default device or you can
create your own device this I will also
talk in the further video but right
now just choose the default one and
click OK and now it says emulator this
is the common error so it says emulator
error x86 emulator currently requires
hardware acceleration and further it
says please and sure and intel haxm is
properly installed and usable so to
solve this problem I already made a
video how to solve this problem but what
you need to do is now it's important
right so what you need to do is just
copy this path which is C colon slash
user slash whatever your username is
slash AB data until SDK so just copy
this parts from here and just open your
file explorer and paste your path in the
file explorer so the path is C colon
slash user slash whatever your username
is slash app data slash local slash
Android slash SDK just copy until as DK
and paste it here right and press Enter
and it will open your SDK folder right
in this SDK folder you will be able to
see a folder called extras and in this
folder you will see a folder called
intel inside this folder you will see a
folder called hardware underscore
accelerated answer underscore execution
manager okay so just go inside this and
there will be our executable file and
for the first time you need to run this
file so this file name is intel haxm -
Android file so you just double-click it
and run it so the installation will
start and just click Next
and just see here what is the memory
default memory this memory can be
different in your case depending upon
the you know hardware of your computer
in my case right now it's 2gb but it can
be 1gb in your case and other devices
also just so just note that the memory
used here or the RAM you are running
here you just need to keep a note of
this we are going to use this value
which is 2gb if we require further so
just click Next and click install and
the installation will complete in few
seconds so now the installation is
complete you just need to uncheck this
launch intel haxm documentation and just
click finish and now we are going to
rerun our application and let's see this
time it works or not so I'm going to
just click the screen button once again
and once again I will choose my default
device for now and let's see what
happens so these are the common you know
error which may occur when you first run
your application so don't worry if you
face these kind of errors I will show
you how to solve them one by one and now
our Android emulator has been started
and in few second we will see our hello
world message which you can see here for
your sample application this is the holo
world message you can see here and the
same message will appear in some second
here in our emulator also so this
emulator will exactly work like your
Android mobile
on Android mobile and you just need to
unlock this so just drag it up and now
you can see hello world so you have
successfully compiled your first Android
application and you have successfully
able to run it on this emulator so I
hope you have enjoyed this video I will
stop this video here itself
and in the next video we will see what
everything means in this IDE and we will
create some cool applications so let so
stay tuned and please recommend
subscribe and bye for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
