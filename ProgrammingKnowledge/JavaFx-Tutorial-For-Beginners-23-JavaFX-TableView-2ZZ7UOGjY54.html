Java fix tutorial for beginners in this
video we will see how to use tables
using table view in Java effects and for
this we are going to use a properties
which we have learned in the previous
videos to populate our table view so if
you don't know how to use properties
just watch that video first on
properties and then watch this video so
let's get started I have created a
project called table view and in the
application package I have this main dot
Java class where I have added this code
to you know call our main dot F XML file
I have this main dot controller class
which is blank right now and I have this
main dot F XML file which is also blank
right now okay so I think you know how
to you know create these files now next
what I'm going to do is first of all for
example I want to create a table of
student information so student can have
his ID name surname and age and I want
to populate this data on our table view
so how do I do that so first of all for
that I'm going to create a new class
which I will name it as student
okay so first class name is student and
click finish and this will create the
student class and in here first of all I
will create four variables first will be
private final integer and this will be
the ID of the student ok in a same way I
will declare three more variables for
name surname and age okay so this will
be string variable and this will be our
name variable and then third variable
will be the surname and the fourth
variable will be the age and the surname
is
a string here okay so because we have
declared them as a final we need to
initialize these variables so let's
right-click on this class and then go to
source and then we are going to select
this option which says generate
constructor using fields
okay so select this option which says
generate constructor using fields and
select all the fields and then click OK
and it's going to generate this kinds of
constructor with all the fields names
and its setting all the values like this
okay now next what we are going to do is
let's transfer this variable at the top
so all the variables are at the same
place right now second thing what we are
going to do is we are going to declare
the getters for these variables right so
right click once again on your class and
then go to source once again and this
time choose generate getters and setters
okay and then select all and then click
OK and it's going to generate only
getters because we are already setting
the values of these variables using the
constructor right now after doing all
this we will change our variable data
type to simple integer property and
simple string property I have used this
integer and string earlier because I
wanted to generate this getters and
setters for this class so it's easier to
you know generate these catters and
setters using these data types right
after generating your getters and
setters you can change this data type to
simple integer property for ID and age
and for the surname you can use a simple
string property okay so for surname and
name you will use a simple string
property right so
we have done that now you can see it's
showing this error and this error says
change to the ID datatype so we need to
cast that's ID - you know simple integer
property so what we can do we can use a
new than simple integer property and in
the brackets just enclose this ID right
same you can do for the age so let's do
for the age and we can do the same for
these names and surnames right so just
enclose it like this and for the surname
also enclose it like this and we forgot
this new keyword here okay
so like this now if you remember to
access a simple integer property or
simple string property we need to have
the method called get on the variable
right so here it's showing this error
because we need to add this method
called get on this ID variable right so
just write dot get okay so add after
every variable name dot get method and
it's going to get you the value of this
property okay so this is our student
class which we are going to use to
populate our table view okay now once
this is done we are going to go to our
controller dot Java class which is main
controller dot Java and first of all we
will implement here initialize able and
then you just add the unimplemented
methods here which is initialized and
now I'm going to declare first of all at
the rate FX ml and then private table
view so just called a table view
variable from here and it takes the
template variable right so we want to
you know create a table of 2
odin's right so just call the student
class which we have created recently in
these angle brackets and then give the
name to your table for example I give
the ID as table itself okay now every a
table has its column also so we are
going to create four columns in the
table and instead of using table view we
will use a table column now okay so just
use table column and pasted four times
here and this takes two template
argument one is the class name and
second is the data type so the ID data
type was integer right so just write
integer here and then give the name to
your table column variable which is ID
for the first column right same we will
do for the age column so just name it as
age and this will be the name column and
second will be the surname column right
and just add this string data type here
and to the name also okay so we have
declared one table view variable and for
table column variables with the column
names right now next what we are going
to do is we are going to declare our
observable list so declare a public
observable list and name it as list so
this is the list of students right so it
will also take this template variable
which is student in our case because we
have created the student class and name
it as list is equal to FX collection so
just write FX collection dot then call a
method called observable array list here
and
close it and inside this constructor
brackets we will you know add some data
to our list so because it's observable
list of student we can add this new
student constructor here so just add new
student and this constructor takes four
variables if you remember right
first is the ID so give for example one
second is the name so give any name for
example some name and then third is the
surname so give some surname and fourth
is the age which can be something like
this an integer right and then using
comma separator you can add multiple
instances of this constructor right so
you can do something like this and then
change the IDS of all the student
constructors
you
so I have generated this kind of data
inside this list here and make sure the
last you know data doesn't have this
comma okay so we have our observable
list now right now what we can do is we
can take this table variable and go
inside our initialize method and call a
method called
set items on it and then it this takes
the observable list so just provide this
list variable here okay now just above
this code what we can do is we can just
use our ID variable and then we can call
a method called set cell value Factory
here and then we can just add a new
property value factory so just search
for a property value factory and it
takes two template argument as we have
given in the table column right student
and integer for ID right and then in the
constructor it takes this name of your
column okay so do the same for the name
surname and age so second is our name
third is the surname and fourth is the
age and we have to pass this here also
surname here also and age here also and
this name and surname are a string right
so just add string and string here okay
so now we are ready with our code so we
just need to add it our F XML file and
add our table view inside this so that
we can populate it so just right click
on your main dot F XML file and open
with scene builder here and just choose
your anchor pane here and then change
the layout property of it so pref width
is equal to for example this time
500 and the pref height is also I'm
going to choose 500 okay and then go to
here in the search option and search for
table view okay and just drag and drop
this table view inside this anchor pane
and to make it stretch to the lens and
height of this anchor pane you can just
select your table view go to modify and
then click this option fit to parent and
it's going to fit to prayer IND and now
right now you can see this table view
has a two table column C 1 and C 2 so we
need to add two more tail table columns
because we have four table columns right
so just add one more table column here
this will be the third table column and
take one more table column from your
controls and just drop it here okay so
now you have 4 table columns now select
your first table column from here go to
the property and change the title of it
or text of it for example first is the
ID second was the name so just change
the name of this also and then third was
the surname so change the text of this
also and the fourth was the age so just
add age here okay now once you do this
we need to connect our controller to the
Ceph XML file so go to controller here
and then choose your controller class
application dot controller okay now
select your column once again and then
go to the code here and then choose the
ID of the code right so when you just
drag here you can see we have declared
the table column variables here ID name
surname and age right so select first
column and give the first you know table
column variable here ID
like second column and then choose the
name third is the surname and fourth is
the age right now we also need to give
the ID to the table so go to the
hierarchy here choose your table here
and then go to the code and then choose
this variable called table which we have
declared here you can see here right and
now you can just save your code and
refresh your project and now we are
going to run it so just run your app and
now you can see we have successfully
populated our table view with this data
okay so this data is same as this data
in the observable list right you can
match it from here right so in this way
you can populate a table view in JavaFX
