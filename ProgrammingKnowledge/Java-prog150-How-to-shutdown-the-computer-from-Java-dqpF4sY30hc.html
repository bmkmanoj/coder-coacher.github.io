video I will show you how you can shut
down your computer using your java swing
J form application so I have taken this
button in my form and I have changed its
text so I have right click and changed
its text to shut down the computer and
then I will double click this button
here and in here first of all I will
write a try-catch block so this is a
just a skeleton of trying catch blocks
to catch any exception so just make this
try-catch block and in the catch just
write Java X dot swing dot J option
paint dot show dialog and in the bracket
pass to argument
IX dot get message and in the tribe or
above the try block we will define a run
time object so write run time and give
it a variable name run time is equal to
once again run time dot get run time and
bracket closed and then here in side
view try block write process and give it
a variable name for example proc and
just copy this run time here paste it
here dot x ec and in this exe C bracket
we will pass us argument so I will write
double flip coat and right
shut down space - s space - T space zero
so this is basically a command line
operation in window to shut down your
computer and we are executing it with
the help of this Java program if you
want don't want to shut down your
computer immediately just give a weight
or sleep time or for example 10 second
because I don't want to shut down my
computer immediately after clicking the
this button now this is the code for
shutting down the computer let's try and
run the program and I will right click
and run the program and
I click this button after after 10
second because I have given the weight
of 10 second it will shut down so before
shutting now now we'll close this method
because I do not want to shut down my
computer I have done it once and it's
working perfectly fine so it will work
so let's see let's click the shutdown
button and it's saying okay uh so so
after the weight of 10 seconds your
computer will shut down with this
command and if you want to shut down
your computer immediately just delete
this wait and then execute your program
and try to shut down your computer with
the help of your Java program I hope you
