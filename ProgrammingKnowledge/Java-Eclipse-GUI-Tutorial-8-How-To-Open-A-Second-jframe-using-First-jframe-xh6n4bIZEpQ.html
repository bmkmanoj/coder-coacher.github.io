video I am going to show you how you can
open a second jframe using a first
shaped frame in your Eclipse GUI
application so for example I want to
open a second J frame for example
employee info jframe whenever user has
passed the login test for example
username and password is correct then I
want to open a second J frame okay so
how can I do it I will show you in this
video but first of all I need a second
J frame right so I need to create the
second J frame so I will go to my
project or I will I will go to my source
folder of my project company is my
project name and this is SRC is the
source folder of my project right click
new and go to others and in here search
for window builder and search for swing
designer but this time we will not
select application window we will select
this time jframe application window it
will create a main method inside your j
frame and the main method could be only
one right and this j frame is just a
frame other frame so you need to choose
in this swing designer jframe right so
it select just j frame click next and
give the name to your class I give my
give the name to my class else
employ
employee is correct
or let's say what can mean sometimes I
get confused in the spelling so once
again employ in four okay so my class
name is employing four because I am
dealing with the employee database right
so I want to show the employee data in
the second form okay so I will name my
last name accordingly and I will click
finish and this will create a second
form for me which is a blank form which
is called employee info dot Java you can
see here I go to my design view of this
class which is employing four dot Java I
will double click on this employee info
dot Java so I can see this and for now I
will just show some message I will take
a label but before that I need to have
this absolute layout inside this and
then I will put the label and I will
just say
second form for now okay and make be I
can just resize it so we will be able to
see the message
and maybe I will change the font size so
that it's visible
okay
so I want to open this frame from my
login frame right so if you remember we
have written our code to login username
and such username and password validate
user name and password and whenever we
click this login button we will be able
to see the message if the username and
password is correct or not so just click
this login button once again and this
was the code which I have written so if
you don't remember this code just see my
last videos in which I have shown you
how to create a login page and in here
where my validation is correct where I
am showing username and password is
correct I want to open the new frame
which is employ in full frame right and
I want to close this frame okay so first
of all I walk I will close this frame
how can I close this frame just take the
name of your frame so the frame name is
frame only you see a private jet frame
frame so take the name of your frame go
to the condition where your username and
password is correct username and
password is correct I was showing there
and in here frame dot dispose okay this
will dispose your frame or hide your
frame okay and then I will call the new
class so I will create an object of the
new class my class name is employee info
class right so you see here I have
created this new class employee info
class right so right
employee info I will say the object name
is
eeehm pl/i and fo for example is equal
to new
employee info so I am creating an object
of this class and now I can use this
object to call the set visible method
which is responsible to make your frame
visible so I use this object which is MP
L info dot fact visible and what it
takes this method takes a boolean value
so I want to make this true to show this
frame right so whenever I use this true
then this second class will be visible
for me or second frame will be visible
for me so you just need to write these
two lines right two or three lines and
once again I run the program click OK it
will open error exists in required
project
let us see what is the error
I cannot see any error here let's see if
it shows any error duplicate local IMG
okay so this I think I have in the last
video I have made showing you how to
show the image and I think I have
created somewhere here some image which
is this I can call it image one ok now
this error will not come I will run it
once again ok
and connection is successful okay and
username I need to give a username and
password I will give the username and
password and when I click this login
button I will see first of all this
message username and password is correct
and when I click OK you see I can see
the second form and first form is this
post that means it is gone and second
form is open the same thing you can do
for calling the login from form from the
employee form okay so for example you
want to go from this form to the
previous form which is the login form
you can do the same with this okay so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
