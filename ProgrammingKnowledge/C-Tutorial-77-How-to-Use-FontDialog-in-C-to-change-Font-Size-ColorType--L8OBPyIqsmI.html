video I will show you how to use font
dialog with your c-sharp application so
fun
dialogue we can use it for changing the
font in your text box or in your rich
text box so let's see how it works
first of all drag and drop our rich text
box into your form and take a button
into your form okay and I named this or
I change the text of this button as
change font okay and now I will double
click this button first of all I will
see the name of this rich text box this
is rich text box phone okay
so double click this button and in here
we will write our code okay
so first of all we need to declare a
file death not file dialogue but the
font dialog so write font dialog and
give it a name I named it as phone
dialogue 1 is equal to new point
dialogue ok now as always we see that if
the font dialog result is ok or not so
we will provide a condition so right if
and in not this but this and bracket
closed and in the F condition we will
pass our font dialog name dot show
dialog is equal to
dialog result dot okay and then here I
haven't provide double equal to so here
like this and then right and not equal
to so like this and give string dot
strength
yeah string dot is null or empty and in
the bracket then provide the name of
your rich text box which is rich text
box one from here right so copy it and
inside this bracket pass this rich tick
box and then write dot text it's showing
me error because I have provided so
write this if loop here if font dialog
one dot show dialog bracket bracket
close is equal to dialog result dot okay
and give it this not equal to sign
string dot is null or empty and in the
bracket provide the name of your rich
text box dot text and now in the if
condition we can provide our condition
so we will write here the name of our
rich text box which is the rich text box
one dot
selected selection font is equal to the
font dialog name dot font okay I am
bracket closed so you need to write
these three lines in order to change the
font of your rich text box so now let's
try and run the program and for example
I write some text here some random text
and I want to change the font size of
this text which I select from here okay
so and then after selecting this text I
click this font change or change font
button and I can make it bold I can
change its size and I click OK and if
you can see its size is change and it's
bold now once again you can make any
font with this like this and italic bold
16 okay and it changes the font real you
can also give in this font dialog the
color so if you want to choose color
right now you cannot see any color
chooser here but let's add the color
chooser also to our font dialog so just
below your font dialog declaration you
right here just copy this font dialog
dot
so color is equal to true okay now when
you declare or write something here you
need to also implement it so once again
copy the rich text box name dot
selection color this time so rich text
box of selection color is equal to once
again this font dialog name dot color
okay so write this code to change the
font and the color so let's see if it
works or not so once again some text
random text and when you click this
button or first of all let's select the
text so for example I want to change the
font and color of this text which I
selected click this button I change the
font it's bold and it's 28 and now you
can see the color chooser also this is a
edition after your code for color show
color code so you can change the color
now for example this blue and click OK
and now it changes the color and the
font both so in this way you can use the
font dialog with your C sharp
application I hope you have enjoyed this
