I have shown you how to install your
MySQL whole package onto your machine
and from this video I will show you how
you can make new database on your
schemas and new tables in your MySQL
workbench so once again go here database
and click query database and as last
time we have entered our password root
whatever use your password enter you and
click OK and you're going to see SQL
environment in SQL is already provided
two schemas and once test schemas by
default and we are going to make a new
schema here in order to make a new
schema a new schema is a new database
for example you want to make a database
for your software so for that you need
to prepare a schema and in that you need
to prepare some tables so we create a
new schema see this button for a new
schema click it
this time we'll open this you can give
your the name of your database I will
name it as database only and I will
click apply and this is very important
this line create schema database is
called a query so whenever you want to
make a schema with the help of your
software for example Java you need to
write this query and that software
environment you don't have the luxury of
using this workbench in here you can
just go to these buttons and you can
automatically create your database but
whenever you are using databases with
your software you need to know these
queries so for creating a new database
you need to write create schema dot
abase and we will check it in future
also this query so I'm just copying it
and I will click apply and click finish
and you can see my daughter base is
created autumn
here for example I want to make a new
database with the help of query this you
can do it from here also this database
database I have created with the hub of
this GUI on this button but with the
help of query if I want to make a
database just from here create a new
query tab this one and it will open
query tab for you and what I will do
here I will paste it paste the query
which I have copied from there and for
example I want to make a new schema or
database whose name is database 1 1 2 3
for example and I want to execute this
query and with the help of this query I
want to create a database you can do
that also so write this create schema
database name and take this button
execute query and if in output this
green button comes it means your query
is successfully executed so let's check
our database is created or not for that
you need to refresh your schemas with
this button and you can see my database
is created
now in a database of course present
there are some tables so this is a whole
database which contains tables so now we
will create tables right now this
database contains no tables so go here
tables right drink create table and it
will open a new tab for creating a new
table so what I will do is first I mean
named my table employ for for example I
want to make table for employees in
which I could be able to see the
information of the employee such as his
name surname and age and his employee ID
how can I do this I will make a table
and if you want to give a comment you
can give it here and here we provide the
column names here so just press this
button make it bigger this region and
when it click here it will automatically
give you a first column name you can
change this name also and this is very
important the first column generally is
a primary key and now the question
arises what is a primary key the primary
key is a unique identifier for every row
so for example I have two employees both
have same employee ID so my my SQL
cannot recognize it if it has same
i d-- so there is something which must
be present in the table which is unique
for that employee only for that we need
a primary key primary key is a key which
is unique for every row in the table so
this is my primary key and second I will
write name and variable type is back
it's okay third I will names
here I will take this age in the third
column and here I want age as integer
variable so I will change it from here
the we're care means it's character up
to fifth forty five character this forty
five indicates the number of characters
okay so my columns are ready I will
click apply and once again I will copy
this because this is very important to
know create a table in your schema so I
will copy it and I will press apply and
press finish
and you will see my table is created
here and when I click right click it and
click Edit table you can see four
columns here one for ID which is a
primary key second name third column is
surname and fourth column is age the
same thing you can do with the help of
query so I will go to my query tab and
not this time I want to make the same
table for my second database which is
database one two three with the help of
query so whatever I have copied I will
paste it here the query for creating a
table is create your database schema
name so my schema name is database 1 2 3
dot whatever you want to give your
employee for a table name in brackets
your columns
and here you can give the variables and
you can decide if you want them to be
null or not null if it's not null it
should have some value when I will you
want to insert some value of C's some
thing inside the table and if it's null
it could be null so if you want to add a
new employee employee ID is must it may
happen that you may not provide his name
it will run the query fine but the
essential thing is ID employee info it
must not be null so now in my primary
key is this idea employee info column I
will click this to execute the query and
you can see the green indication my
query is correct and now I will check in
the table yes same table is created in
my second database so in this way you
can create a table and create on your
schema I hope you have learned something
new this time please wait coming in to
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
