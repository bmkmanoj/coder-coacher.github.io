Linux command line tutorial for
beginners in the last two videos we have
discussed how we can use symbolic
permissions in Linux now in this video
we will discuss about octal or numerical
permissions with the files in Linux
so let's get started first of all how we
can you know use or what is octal
permission so octal permission is a
numerical representation of the file
permission for example so let me just
change the directory to desktop first of
all and then we will create a file using
touch for example so I will just say
file dot txt and our file will be
created right and then when we list the
permissions of this file so what I can
do i can just do LS - l for the file and
then when i do this i can see the
permissions and this we have seen in the
last video so these three things is for
the users are the three are for the
groups and other three are for the you
know others right and then we have these
a tree representation which is read
permission write permission and the
execute permission so let me simplify
the you know normal numerical or octal
permissions using this concept so what I
am going to do is I will just open a
normal text file and let's say this is
our users and groups and others like
these three you know groups users groups
and others right and each have its
permissions so each have read write and
the third command which is
execute right so I'll write read and
then it has write and for example
execute in the same way group also has
read and then the right this will be
right and execute and other also have
read and write and execute right now
octal representation can be done
something like this so for example if we
are you know using binary notation this
is 1 this is 1 and this is 1 right and
same is for here so this is 1 this is 1
and this is 1 and this is 1 this is 1
then this is 1 for example right now if
we want to provide the permission for a
file for the user for example that this
will be you know users have all the
three permission read write and execute
permission so let's start from here so
what we do here so this is equal to 1 in
binary for example and then this is
equal to 2 because you can you know in
binary you can just double the when you
go left right and then this is equal to
4 right and in you know when you add
these three numbers the addition will be
4 plus 2 plus 1 which is equal to 7 so
if you want to allow the user to read
write and execute a file then you need
to give the number notation 7 and this
is calculated like this so you just need
to for example start from the right and
then write here 1 and then make a double
of it 2 and 4 for example and then if
you want to you know give the right here
do it one otherwise if you want don't
want to give the permission then do it 0
here so for the group for example I
just want to give the group only read
and execute permission so I will just do
right is equal to zero okay so what will
be the you know numerical notation for
this we will start from the right hand
side so the value is 1 here because we
want the execute permission the value
will be 0 here because we don't want the
right permission right so here will be 0
instead of 2 and here the value will be
4 because once again we want the
permission here and the addition of
these value will be for example 4 plus 1
is equal to 5 right so whenever you want
to give the only read and execute
permission then you just need to give
the numerical notation of 5 here right
and the same you can do here for example
you want to just give the read and write
permission to the others then what we
can do here we can just give 0 here and
then we can give 1 here and give 1 here
again right and then this notation will
be for example 0 this notation will be
here so let's write 0 here for example 0
and then 1 and then 1 so let me align
everything because these things are not
aligned properly so something like this
so this will be 2 according to this
notation right and this will be 4
according to our notation here right and
the addition of these value will be 6
right and so whenever you want to give
the read and write permission the
notation will be 6 so there is a table
for these notation if you want to
calculate it's really easy I have
this is how you can calculate the value
and when you use these number notations
frequently you get used to them and then
you don't even need to remember them I
mean you don't even need to calculate
them you can remember them automatically
so I have a table for the values so you
can see whenever you don't want to give
any permission you just give zero if you
want to give execute permission you give
one if you want to give write permission
you give two and then write and execute
is three read is four read and execute
is five read and write is six and read
write execute is seven right so this is
a simple table and this is how we can
calculate these value right so you can
you know calculate all the values using
this approach now for example I want to
change the permission of this file using
number notation then what I can do is I
can just do chmod and then I can for
example give 0 here for the user zero
means no permission right so for the
user we are not providing no permission
for the group also for example we will
provide no permission and for the others
also we will provide no permission for
example for this file and press enter
and the command is successful and let's
give the long listing of this file so
now nobody have any permission for this
file right now for example we want to
allow the user to read write and execute
write and for the group we just want to
give the permission read and execute
which is five right so you can just do
something like this so just try chmod
and for the user we want to give read
write and execute and read write and
execute the number notation is seven as
you can see here right and for the group
we want to give five which is read and
execute and for example others also we
want to give five which is read and
execute and the file name and press
enter once again do the long listing and
now you can see the user have read write
and execute the others and the group
have read and execute of permissions
okay so this is how you can use octal or
numerical permissions in Linux I hope
