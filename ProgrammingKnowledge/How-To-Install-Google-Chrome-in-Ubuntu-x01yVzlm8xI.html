how to install Google Chrome in your
Ubuntu Linux operating system so just
open the terminal and first we will
download Google Chrome from internet so
just give this command to download the
Google Chrome from internet I will
provide the link the same link below
this video so you can directly copy this
link and directly paste it on your
terminal and just hit enter and the
google chrome for linux will download in
your specified directory so I pressed
enter and it's starting down the
download 17% generally it's very fast
but because I'm using VirtualBox on
windows for this demonstration it's a
little bit slow process for down
download but if you are doing the same
process on your original Ubuntu
operating system then this process will
be very fast so now Google Chrome is
downloaded in my specified folder now I
will install Google Chrome in my oven
too so I will give the command
so I will give this command sudo dpkg -
I Google - Chrome and give this asterisk
or star sign after this and just press
ENTER and if it will ask for your
password just provide your password and
now the install will start reading the
database
and unpacking the Google Chrome
directories so my Google Chrome is
installed now but for some reason if for
some reason with this pseudo dpkg get
apt yeah so for some reason with this
pseudo dpkg - I Google Chrome's
start the installation fails then you
can always give the force command to
force the installation which is this
command which I am going to show you
so this force command so write sudo
apt-get install - F so if for some
reason Google Chrome is not installed
then give this command sudo apt - get
space install an - F this will force the
google chrome in google chrome installed
in your Ubuntu operating system and then
I think the Google Chrome will install
in your system so once the chrome is
installed then just go to your - home
and search for google chrome so you can
see here google chrome is present in
your system now so just click this
google chrome and open the google chrome
so you can see google chrome is now
started and now you can enjoy browsing
with Google Chrome on your Ubuntu
operating system I hope you have enjoyed
