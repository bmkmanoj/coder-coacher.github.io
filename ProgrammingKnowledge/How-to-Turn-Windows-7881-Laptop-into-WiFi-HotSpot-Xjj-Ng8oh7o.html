show you how you can convert your
Windows 7 or Windows 8 operating system
to a Wi-Fi hotspot so that you will be
able to connect your mobile devices or a
tablet to your computer's network or
Internet so let's see first of all how
we can do it in Windows 7 so in Windows
7 if you want to do or if you want to
want to set up a Wi-Fi hotspot what you
need to do is you just need to click the
start button here and you just need to
go to control panel and go to network
and internet and in here you need just
need to click this new Network Status
and tasks and anyway it will show your
network setting but we don't want to
mess with these settings we just need to
do or setup a new net connection or
network just click this option here set
up new connection or network I will
click this option and then I will search
for the option for set of wireless
ad-hoc
computer the computer network so just
click this option called set up wireless
ad-hoc computer the computer network and
click Next and these are some of the
description how it works and what is the
range of this network it's up to 30 feet
according to this description click Next
and in here you can set up the name of
your network so I can say my first
network this is the name of your network
okay and in here you can set the
password for your network for example 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it should be I think 9
digit password or more than 6
and if you want to hide this password
you can just check this checkbox and
your password will be hidden or you can
uncheck this checkbox your password will
be shown okay so give the name to your
network and give the password to your
network and then if you want to save
this netbook for further usage you can
just click Save this network or uncheck
this to you know if this will not allow
your network to you to use it okay and
now just click Next and this will set up
a network which is called my first
Network the name of my network is my
PA's network and the password is the
same as you have said earlier just close
it and now when you see here the small
little symbol for network you will be
able to see my first network the name of
your network you have just created and
it's saying waiting for users so you can
connect to your mobile or tablet by this
network name which is my first network
and give the same password also okay so
this is how you can set up a Wi-Fi
hotspot on Windows 7 on Windows 8 or
Windows 7 there is a other way of doing
this which is applicable for Windows 8
and Windows 7 both and what you want to
do in this procedure is you can you just
need to go to the search in Windows 8
you also have the search option window
on the right hand corner and to just
have the search option here the search
for CMD or command this will give you
the this command prompt here ok so I
will just search for CMD in windows 7or
just search for command in Windows 8 and
now when you when the search option pop
up you just need to right-click this
option
and you don't need to open it but run as
administrator' so remember you need to
run this command from - administrator
and click yes now it will open your
command prompt as administrator now in
order to set up your Wi-Fi hotspot'
using this procedure this is applicable
for Windows 8 also right you just need
to give these commands so what are these
commands this is first command is to set
up your network and give the username
and password so this is net SH WLAN set
hostednetwork space mode is equal to
allow and this is SSID is your username
for your network like this my first
network so this is the username PKK for
example and key is equal to just need to
give you just need to give your password
here ok so I will just copy this and
right-click Oh
right-click on my command prompt and
paste it here and press Enter you don't
need to bother about this command I mean
you just paste all these commands in the
description so you can just directly
copy and paste these come on
so the first command sets up your
network it says the hosted network mate
mode has been allowed and my bet fee is
going so I will need to do this faster
and the second command is to start your
hosted network ok so just right click
and paste it here right now I think it
will give me an error because I already
have this posted network here but in
your case it will start your hosted
network and the third command is to show
the network ok so right click and paste
it try to show the network what is the
username it will not show the password
but the username and other description
of your network now once you are done
with the usage you can stop your network
by this command net Sh
mm stop posted Network right-click and
paste it here and your network or Wi-Fi
hotspot will be stopped so this works on
Windows 7 and Windows 8 also so I think
I hope it's that's it for this video I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
