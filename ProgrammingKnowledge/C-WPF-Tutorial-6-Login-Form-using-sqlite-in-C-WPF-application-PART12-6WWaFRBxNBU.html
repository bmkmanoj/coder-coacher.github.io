I have shown you how to download and
install the new DLL files for connecting
SQLite with your WPF c-sharp application
earlier in the video number ii and no
third and fourth video number third and
fourth i have shown you how to connect
your database using finish dot SQLite
library but in the last video I have
shown you how to download and install
this new library called system data dot
SQLite library which we are going to use
because it's much flexible then finish a
dot SQLite library so in the last video
I have shown you how to install that new
library so if you don't know and if you
haven't seen this last video and you are
just have just seen the third and fourth
video then I'm not using those library
finisher libraries I'm using the DS
SQLite new library which is called
system dot dot dot SQLite DLL files now
in this video I will show you how to
create a login page but before that if
you have done installing these system
dot SQLite you need to change some
settings in your projects so what
setting you need to change I will show
you first so just write like your
project and click this property here and
in here you need to change these
properties so go to target framework and
instead of using dotnet framework for
client profile we are going to use
dotnet framework for
from here it will give a warning just
say yes and once you have clicked yes it
will generate this app dot config file
so when you do the settings dotnet
framework for then it will create this
app config file automatically and it
will disappear your older opened file so
once again you can open those files from
here and this ab dot config is a new
file so just open this files from here
and what we are going to do here is
instead of this code which is a startup
code in this app config file I will just
make it bigger so you can see it better
so this app dot config file contains
this startup code for this framework
dotnet framework for version 4 so just
instead of this startup code here we
just in between this startup tags here
and here just remove this code from here
so I remove that code and in this
configuration tag in between I will add
a new startup code which is like this so
if you want just pause the video and
copy this code I have written this
startup start and end code and here I
have given this line called used legacy
v2 runtime activation policy is equal to
true in the double quotes and in this
startup code tag I have given a tag
called supported runtime version is
equal to V 4.0 in the double-tag so if
you want just pause the video and just
copy this code here in the AB dot config
file once you have done that you are now
ready to write your login page code so I
think by now you are familiar with the
SQLite database how to create this
SQLite database and if you don't know
how to create this SQLite database you
can just go to my SQLite database
tutorial I have this in my playlist just
search for them and you can see that and
you can create your own database so what
I have done is I have created a database
which is called database dot DB here and
I am opening this database in my SQLite
manager which is a plugin from Firefox
and I have created a table in this
database DB called employee info and I
have create given one two three four
five six columns in this database first
is Eid which is employee ID second is
name third column is surname
fourth column is age fifth is username
and sixth is for password so this
username and password we are going to
use for making our login page so I have
done this simple database and I have
created this simple employee table with
these six columns and now we are going
to use this database dot DB in our file
so now what I will do is I will go to my
WPF application and I will take two text
boxes from here so text box one and text
box 2 and I will just make it a little
bit smaller so I can give a label also
so I will take two labels from here also
label one and label two and this label I
will change it as user name and second
name I will change it as password and
this first textbox name I will give it
as user name and second text box I will
name it as password okay or I will just
name it as the XTS underscore password
so it will be more appropriate for the
text box here also T X T underscores
user name okay now I will double click
this button and in here first of all
let's change this button caption also
instead of using this test name I am
changing it as login
now it's looking better and now I will
double-click this login button here and
we are just having no code here in the
last video I have just added this using
system dot data dot
SQLite for connecting my SQLite library
with this WPF application so in here in
this code you need to declare your
database location first so just below
your this public partial class which is
your main window partial class just go
below there and write this code I will
just make it bigger so it will be
visible okay so declare this first right
string and give it a string variable
name in my case DB connection string is
equal to write this at the rate sign and
then give double quotes and inside this
double quote write data - source is
equal to your database name because my
database is in my debug folder of my
project that's why I'm not providing any
path if it is outside your debug folder
or whether wherever your this exe file
is there then you what you can do is
just right click and just go to security
and just copy this path and you can just
paste it here and when it shows error
just give these double slashes here so
because it's in my debug folder I don't
need to give this long path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
