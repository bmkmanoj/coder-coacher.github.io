have shown you how to connect your WPF
c-sharp application with SQLite database
so I have this program which is running
and when I click this button it shows me
some data which is there in the database
but while I was preparing to make the
login page code I was facing some
problem with this finisher SQLite
library which we are using so in the
last video I have shown you how to
download this finish library and how to
connect this library with your WPF but
for some reason it was creating little
bit problem while I was creating a login
page so I found a better library than
this finish dot SQLite library which is
much more versatile and we can use it
much more flexibly with our WPF
application so in this video I will show
you how to download that SQLite DLL
files and then we will use that SQLite
DLL instead of this finish SQLite dll's
so let me show you how you can download
this new much better SQLite library for
your C shop WPF application so open your
browser and just write in your search
escalate - dotnet -
okay right Escalade - dotnet - and the
first link you will see from
sourceforge.net slash project / Escalade
- dotnet - just click this link which is
the same as project / Escalade - dotnet
- okay and then here is a download
button just download this new ad or
dotnet 2.0 file from here so the file is
downloading it's not a big file just
three MB file so it will be downloaded
very fast and once this is this file is
downloaded it's a executable file so you
can just run the installation wizard and
it will install in your computer so
click Next and give the deed default
path or whatever property you want to
give I'm giving the depot default path
which is C program file cross 86 slash
SQLite dot net and I will click Next and
click Next and this will install in your
computer
you may have to close your visual studio
once this is installing in your computer
if your Visual Studio IDE is open so
let's see if it asked us to close it or
not so no it's not asking anything so
once this library is downloaded we will
come back to our project and now we will
add the new DLL file instead of this old
finisher DLL file so I will go to my
project here and go to add references
and instead of going to browse this time
once your ad or dotnet SQLite file is
downloaded it will be shown or it will
be seen here in the dotnet tab so let's
see if we can find it otherwise we have
to close our visual student once again
open it yes we can find it this is s
system dot dot dot SQLite in.net tab
here so just select system dot data dot
SQLite from here this has also system
dot dot or dot SQLite dot linked but
right now I am just selecting this
system dot dot or dot SQLite so I
selected this file and it's there in my
references here and one thing more you
will notice once this
SQLite file is downloaded you can see
this file in your C folder program file
cross 86 folder and you can see it here
down SQLite dotnet folder so you can see
these files are downloaded it has system
dot dot dot s collide the DLL file and
it has system dot dot or dot SQLite dot
link DLL file so if you want to find
these DLL file you can find it here in
the bin folder now I want to remove the
older DLL file for escalade which I was
using which was this SQLite dotnet from
resources so I will right-click and
click remove and it will remove all the
references of this finis a SQLite
library and I will also go to my code
section just double click this button
and now this will the older code will
show some errors so I will just remove
all the code from here because I will
not use this code any further you can if
you are comfortable this with this
finisher dot SQLite file then you can
use it so I'm not forcing you to not to
use it or I am not saying that it's bad
but I find this new SQLite dll file or
system dot dot or dot SQLite library
much more flexible than the finisher
SQLite so I removed the finisher code
finisher SQLite library code from here
and now I will add the new code for
my new Escalade library which is system
dot or dot SQLite so right here using
system dot dot dot
SQLite here and we will check this if
it's working yes it's working so in this
way you can download this SQLite dot dot
or dot DLL files and install it into
your computer and just check it whether
it's working in your WPF application or
not or whether it's present in this ad
references dotnet tab here so I think
that's how you can link this new file
with your WPF and in the next video I
will show you how to make a login app
application with your WPF c-sharp
application so stay tuned and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
