show you how to add a table into your I
text report these things I'm showing you
because I'm creating the template for my
final report in which I will add the
values from the database but from for
now I'm taking the static values which
are not taken from the database but in
later stages I will add my database
content into the report so that the
report can be made meaningful for but
for now for the sake of learning I'm
showing you how to make everything and
then I will add my information into my
report so be patient and wait for my
next tutorial I will show you each and
everything I can to make a report so
let's get started to today's topic is
how to make a table so what you have to
do is after your title and date and your
line after that you have to write by the
way this code I have written in last few
videos so if you are directly watching
this you have to see my last few
tutorial on my text so after you are
lying you just because I want to show my
table after my title so after that you
must write e
a table table is equal to new table and
bracket and in here in the brackets you
have to give some number which will be
your number of columns for example you
want two columns in your tables table
then you have to write two if you want
to provide three columns you will write
three so for now I'm making two column
table
so I will write 2 here and it's showing
some errors so I will right click and
fix import and it's not gone so let's
see what is the problem
I think I forgot something yeah after
PDF to write capital P here PDF P table
and in here also capital P so your error
is gone down so like this and after this
you will add the content of the table so
write table which is this variable table
not bad
and in here you can write your text so
for example all right what can I write
so I will write my item sorry
item 1
and because you have for example I want
to make to cross to table which have two
columns and two rows so I will add four
element in here so copy this and I will
paste it King more times and I will
change my item to one two three and four
so I have added four items into my to
cross two table and let's see what is my
results all right click and run my
program
I'm sorry I forgot one thing here is it
not all I have to write document dot add
we've added the table so I haven't
threatened this if you don't write this
we cannot add your table into the report
so what I've done I have done these four
or five lines in order to make a two by
two table and now I will right click and
run my program
and in here I will click report
facing some problem okay why this
problem is coming because in my last
tutorial I forgot to close this PDF file
if you don't close this PDF file report
you cannot open the new new report so I
have closed my previously opened PDF
file and now when I click report my
report is saved and I will go to the
file folder where my report is saved and
I will open my report it's again and you
can see my table is made so I will make
it a little smaller Siddhant you can see
so my 2 cross 2 table is made one thing
you need to remember here is for example
if you write it now right here instead
of 2 column you want to make three
columns and you have only provided four
items so
so your report will take these three
items as first three items of your first
three columns of your table and this
will be shown in the second row this is
first row because this is three three
column line so let me show you what I
mean here I will run the program
once again and I will click report my
report is saved and when I open my go to
you
you can see only three items and you
haven't added your title so you have to
keep in mind how many columns you want
into your report
so once again what I mean to say is if
it's a three Kong table you need to
provide number of items which are
multiple of three so you can provide six
items nine items in order to provide
three column table if you have four
column table you need to provide
multiple of four items here so I hope
you can understand what I'm saying so
this was the tutorial how to make the
table in the next tutorial I will show
you how to add title to your table and
how to change the cell color of your
table so I hope you have enjoyed my
tutorial and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
