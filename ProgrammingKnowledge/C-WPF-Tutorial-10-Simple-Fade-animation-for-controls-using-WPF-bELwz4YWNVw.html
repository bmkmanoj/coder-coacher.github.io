video I will show you how to use fade
animation with your WPF control so for
example I have this application which I
made till now and I have this image in
my main window so I want this image when
I hover on this image and when I leave
the image area then it should fade in or
fade out whatever I want so let's see
how can I make it fade in and fade out
with my mouse hover so let's get started
just select your image and this is not
specific to this image tool you can do
it for a button you can do it for
background image you can do it for other
controls also so I am just giving the
example for this image tool but you can
do it for other other tool also bus but
you just need to follow the same
procedure so just click this image and
go to the properties and go to its
events here and what I am searching for
is mouse mouse leave em event so I will
search for mouse leave event I found it
here mouse leave event just click here
and double click this box and we will
reach to the mouse leave event button
action perform but first we need to
import the animation namespaces so just
go at the top and here we will import
some namespace so right using
system dot windows dot media dot
animation so because this is a part of
animation we need to import this so now
once you have imported this what you
need to go do is go to your image mouse
live event which you have just created
and here we will write image and
whatever control you are using so
because I'm making this for the image so
this image that is why I am writing
their image
so whatever control you are using just
write the name of that control and sorry
and give it a variable name I give it I
am G is equal to once again image and
not this one bus but just cover it with
bracket and then write sender
now in the second line we will use the
animation so right double animation and
what we want to do is first we will give
this double animation a variable name so
I will name it as animation itself is
equal to new double admission and in the
bracket we will pass some arguments so
first argument we want for our image is
it should fade fade out so I will give 0
here so it will decrease your opacity to
0 and comma I will give the timespan for
which I want to fade in so I will write
x span dot from seconds and give the
number of seconds so for example two
seconds okay so you have written these
two lines and then in next line what you
need to do is just copy this image
variables from here IMG and right dot
begin animation in the bracket we will
pass two arguments 1st argument is image
dot
opacity property this one comma this
double animation so just copy this
variable name animation and paste it
here so you have written this for fading
out and in the same way when we enter
our mouse in the image area in this
image area we want the image to come
back so once again select this image
here and go to the properties and go to
event once again and this time we are
searching for a mouse and so just select
this mouse enter here and double click
it and in the code what we are going to
do is we are going this code for which
we have written for mouse leave and just
paste it here and just replace the 0 by
1 so it will fade in now when we run the
program and see here we are seeing the
image and when I leave the image area it
fades out and when I enter into the
image area it fades in fades out and
fades in right so in this way you can
create a create of fading effect in your
application I hope you have enjoyed this
