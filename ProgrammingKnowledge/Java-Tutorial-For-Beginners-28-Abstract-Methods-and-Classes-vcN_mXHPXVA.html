tutorial on Java programming for
beginners and in this video we will see
what is an abstract class and why and
where we will use abstract classes in
Java so what is an abstract class an
abstract class is a class which cannot
be instantiated so for example if you
make some class as a abstract class you
cannot make an object of this class and
what is the reason behind this is for
example I have been showing you this
Bank class in the last two videos for
showing the polymorphism example so I
have this super class called base a Bank
which is my super class which contains a
method and I have a sub class which
extends from my super class which is
inheriting the super class and it also
contains a method okay which is get
interest rate now a bank is abstract in
a Bay that Bank is a general term or we
can say Bank itself is very abstract
word because we cannot you know deduce
which Bank we are talking about from
this class bank but we have bank ABC
which have some name and this can you
know give you some interest rates or
whatever other facilities which can be
related to the bank right so in a way
this Bank class is serving as an
abstract for other classes so it's just
facilitating to the other classes
it's a method on member variables okay
so for example we don't want this class
to be instantiated we just want that
this class should be used by the other
classes to have its functionality for
example we can add some more function to
the abstract Bank and we can add those
method or when BB can use those method
using the inheritance property in our
subclasses okay so Bank is a very
abstract class and these kind of class
sometimes we don't want the other user
to make and you make the instance of
this class because whenever you make the
instance of the class the interest rate
here for example we are returning zero
which means no interest right so
whenever we make an instance of this
class like this and when we run the
program it gives us zero which doesn't
really mean anything right so if we
define this class and abstract so how to
define a class and as an abstract class
you just need to write abstract keyword
before your class so this keyword when
you add to a class it makes your class
abstract and abs as soon as you add this
keyword to your superclass which is a
bank you see here that this object
creation is not possible anymore because
this is the basic property of abstract
class that you cannot create any object
from the abstract class but you can
create a reference from its subclasses
okay so you can create a reference which
points to the sub classes because Bank
ABC
is not an abstract class so you can use
this back ABC like this okay and this
error will be gone okay so you can make
an reference which points to the class
which is not abstract but indirectly
this Bank class is an abstract class
which cannot be instantiated or we
cannot make an object so indirectly we
are restricting the access to this class
from other users now we don't even have
or we not only have abstract classes but
we also have xx attract methods and
abstract method whenever you define a
method as abstract this method should be
implemented by the subclasses which is
inheriting the class ok so there are two
conditions to make a method abstract one
is the method wherever it's present so
this method is present in my bank loss
this class should be abstract to make
this method abstract so we can make this
method abstract and whenever you make an
a method abstract you don't need its
instantiation or definition so but the
most basic condition is the class in
which this abstract method is present
this should be also abstract so the
class should be abstract then only you
can make a method abstract and whenever
you make an a method abstract you need
to give the implementation of this
method in your sub classes because Bank
class is our superclass and Bank ABC is
inheriting from our superclass
we need to give the implementation
of all the abstract method which are
present in our abstract class so we need
to give the definition of this method in
here so whatever classes which are
inheriting from this you need to give
the definition here here and here for
example I just comment this in the this
method Bank ABC method which is
extending from the bang class then this
class will give the error that the type
Bank ABC must implement the inherited
abstract method right so you cannot
compile a program if you don't implement
the effect method in the subclass okay
so if you make any method abstract you
need to implement it in your subclasses
if you are inheriting from this class so
this is how abstract classes and
abstract method works the other thing is
you may encounter a keyword called
concrete and the concrete class is
literally or it almost opposite to the
abstract class so if the abstract class
cannot be instantiated the concrete
class can be instantiated and so this
class which is inheriting the effect
last week haven't added abstract keyword
here but we don't even need to give
concrete keyword in order to make it
concrete you just need to you know you
don't need to give anything you just
need to give public or a private or
whatever class you want to declare and
this makes your class apt on
so if you don't add abstract keyword
before class its concrete because it's a
it can be instantiated and if you add a
keyword abstract before a class it makes
the class abstract which cannot be
instantiated so I hope you have
understood the basic concept of abstract
and concrete classes and I hope you are
