you how you can download and install
Visual Studio code on your Mac operating
system Visual Studio code is our open
source cross-platform editor which you
can use to develop several number of
programming languages like C++ Python
node.js or JavaScript or any other
supporting language so let's get started
and let's see how we can install it so
first of all open your favorite browser
and search for Visual Studio code and
the first language will appear here will
be from code Visual Studio comm so we
are going to click on that link and once
this website is open directly on the
page you will somewhere see the download
for the Visual Studio code for your Mac
operating system so you can see this
download button here it says download
for Mac so I'm going to just click on
that button which is going to start
downloading this zip file you can see
here and this zip file is around 69
megabyte file so it will take some time
to download so I am will wait for the
download to complete and once this zip
file is downloaded we are going to see
how we can extract it and how we can
start our Visual Studio code so now the
download of this Visual Studio code zip
file is completed so I'm going to click
on this file here and now it says Visual
Studio code is an application downloaded
from Internet are you sure you want to
open it so I'm going to say open and I'm
going to minimize the browser so now you
can see that Visual Studio code is
downloaded on my system and then it
looks like this right so what I'm going
to do is first of all I'm going to go to
my launchpad and see if Visual Studio
code is there and I can see that Visual
Studio code I can is not there so what
I'm going to do for that is I'm going to
go to my downloads folder where I have
downloaded the Visual Studio code and
this icon with Visual Studio code I'm
going to drag and drop
into my Applications folder so once I
have dragged and dropped this eigen into
my Applications folder once again I will
go to my Launchpad and now I can see
this Visual Studio code I can so from
here also I can open the Visual Studio
code editor now there is one more thing
which I want to show you guys is how to
open your Visual Studio code from
command line so let me minimize this and
let me open my terminal and when I write
code space dot and then press Enter
right now it doesn't recognizes the
command code here and I want to open my
Visual Studio code for example I want to
open some directory using Visual Studio
code from the command line I just want
to give this code command and my Visual
Studio code should open in that
directory so how to configure your
Visual Studio code to recognize the
command line operation this you can do
by one simple little operation and there
is one solution I found which is on the
Visual Studio code website I'm going to
give you the link in the description
also and here the trick is you just need
to add this path Visual Studio code part
to your bash profile file so just copy
this code I'm going to just paste this
piece of code into the description also
you so you can directly copy it and then
paste it on to your terminal so just
open your terminal and make sure that
you are in your home directory home
directory means users forward slash
whatever is your max home username okay
so here you will find let me do LS - al
and here you will be able to find the
bash profile file which is this file
right and we need to add this line of
code to our bash profile and this
command is going to help us in doing
this so I'm going to
just copy this and then just paste this
so let me clear the terminal and then
I'm going to just right-click and then
paste whatever I have copied and then
press Enter we're just going to add this
export part for the visual studio code
to my bash profile file now let me just
confirm it whether this part is added to
my bash profile by using the command
called open and then the bash profile
file name which is dot bash profile and
then press ENTER which is going to open
this ash profile file in our editor and
you can see this Visual Studio code is
added to our bash profile at the end ok
so that's been done we need to refresh
our bash profile so to do this we can
just write source and then the bash
profile name which is dot bash profile
which is going to refresh our bash
profile file and now what we can do is
we can just write code and then dot
which is going to open the code in the
present working directory which is in my
home directory so let me show you one
little example so I'm going to CD to my
desktop and in them in my desktop there
are some folders so I'm going to go to
my CPP folder and I want to open code in
this folder which is CPP folder so what
I need to do is I just need to do now
code for slash dot and then press Enter
which is going to open
Visual Studio code in this directory you
can see CPP directory so this directory
is open for me
so whatever directory you want to open
you just need to write code and then the
path of that directory so this is how
you can download and install Visual
Studio code on your Mac operating system
