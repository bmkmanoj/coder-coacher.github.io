last video I have shown you how to
convert the PNG file to jpg image in
this video I will show you how to
convert your jpg file into PNG so what
you have to do is take a button and name
it as jpg to the engi and so yeah what
you have to do is just go to your PNG to
jpg code which I have shown you in the
last video I will just copy that code
here in order to to save time and I will
paste the whole code here so in case you
don't know this code this I have shown
you in the last video now there are some
changes you need to do in this code
which I will tell you right now for
example I have jpg file which is this
individual competency image which looks
like this graph or something so this is
a jpg image you can see it here and I
want to convert it into PNG so what i
will do is i will copy its name
or if you have this file into some other
directory then copy the path of the
directory and I me paste it here in your
buffered image variables buffer image is
equal to image IO dot read you have to
paste that name here dot this is a JP g
phone file so i will write it extension
yes jpg second thing you need to do is
in this line image IO dot write new
buffered image comma instead of jpg now
you are converting from jpg PNG so you
have to write B energy here and here you
have to give the name of your file so I
will name it as new PNG file dot PNG so
this this individual competency T dot
jpg image will be converted into PNG and
its name is new PNG file dot PNG and
everything remains the same just one two
three changes and now I'll try to run my
program
and I will go to my coat this was being
g2 jpg and now the PG to PNG so I will
flick it and my image is converted into
PNG so I will check it in my folder
this was my jpg file and I will search
for my PNG new PNG so this is my new PNG
file which is PNG so this looks like
this and my new PMT will look like the
same only the format or the file
extension is different now
so in this form one way you can convert
your jpg file into the PNG file so I
hope you learned something new please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
