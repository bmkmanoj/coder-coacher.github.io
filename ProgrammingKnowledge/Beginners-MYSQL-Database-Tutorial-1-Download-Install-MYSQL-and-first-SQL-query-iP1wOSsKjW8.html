video I will be starting a new series
for MySQL database in my previous
tutorial on NetBeans Java I have used
MySQL connection with my java program
and most of the guys asked me about
MySQL or SQL databases and what are they
and how they can be used so from this I
will be starting how to install MySQL
database and in the further videos I
will be showing how to use these
databases so let's get started go to
your browser and write my SQL and search
and first
link will open called www.google.com and
we want to go to the download section of
this mysql website so we check it and in
here you will see MySQL community server
mysql cluster MySQL workbench so we need
package of my SQL as a whole so we will
go to my SQL Server community click it
and in here you can see mysql installer
5.54 Pindos all mysql products for all
windows platform in one package I will
prefer this because this will install
all the mysql package in one go so
select your operating system or platform
and then download this whole package if
you want you can download these files
separately and install every file
separately also so I will click this
download and
it will download so I have downloaded my
installer and now I will install it so
click it and it will take some time to
start the Installer
and click the run preparing to install
Staller is starting
and it's gathering with requirements
generally this states the whole
installation may take up to five minutes
so be patient
it's
going on
and
still going on so you can see it takes a
little bit time to install now it's
saying that to please wait I square
installer process the current operation
and
the Installer opens so I want to install
MySQL products click OK and if you agree
with the license click I accept and
click Next and here just click execute
and the operation is complete click Next
and then here I want the default
developer default so I will click Next
and I want all these or my system
require all these my SQL products so it
will list out all the product with my
system require so I will click Next and
these are all the products so I will say
execute and it's start processing one by
one it will install every product
for us most interesting part is my SQL
server five point five point two nine at
the time of making this video this is
the latest server available and MySQL
workbench
this is a GUI - for making the tables
and executing the queries here so it's a
very good tool for developers these all
tools are also important maybe in future
I will show you how to use them like
this
C++ connector connector for dotnet and
MySQL for Excel so we will start with
using my square Wash bench first and
then we will go to other products so
it's installing
so you can see it can take a few minutes
to install all these software's one by
one connector ODBC is installing C++ C
so one by one all the products which my
machine requires will be installed
my spell documentation exam whose and
complete so click Next and in here this
MySQL server will be configured in the
next step so click Next
check your port number generally I use
these default configuration I want to
use for configuration type by
development machine that is my computer
I will click Next and in here this is
the most important part you need to give
a password and the password for your my
spell server so for simplicity I'm
giving it a password the root you can
choose your own password which you can
remember easy and I will click Next and
I want a new standard system count and
windows service name is my square five
five I will click Next and it's
installing
or my service is configuring
and yes it's complete and then I we
click Next my samples and examples will
be configured and I will click Next once
again and just finish your installation
so in this way you will finish your
whole package for MySQL and it will
automatically launch MySQL workbench so
in here you can see a workbench
environment or GUI tool for your MySQL
database in here what you want to do is
go to this click this database and click
this query database and it will show
this box I want to set my password and
my password is good once again now I
click OK and then I will click OK
so it will open my SQL work bench
environment so here I am going to make
new tables and new database and we will
see how the queries are written and how
the tables are made so I think
the MySQL will provide one or two
examples also for the databases like
this shakeela it contains so many tables
I will click actor and click Edit table
and it shows me the data so this is the
default which is provided by MySQL and
the next video we will see how we can
make our own database and how we can
create our own tables so thank you very
much for watching and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
