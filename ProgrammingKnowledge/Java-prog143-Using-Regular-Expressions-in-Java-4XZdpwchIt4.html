video I will show you how to use regular
expression with your java swing
application so let's get started we will
first start by understanding what is a
regular expression so when you see on
Wikipedia a regular expression also
abbreviated as reg X or reg reg X P is a
sequence of text characters which is
used to match the patterns okay so it's
the technology which is used by most of
the popular languages like C++ Java C
sharp and all languages and it is used
to match string patterns or character
path patterns I will give you an example
and then you will come to understand
fully how can this work so if you want
more information on regular expression
then you can just read this Wikipedia
explanation it's a very good explanation
and you can clear all your doubts from
here now let's see how we can use this
regular expression in your Java form
application so I will take an example
for example I want to enter an email id
or I want an application that I have a
text box so I will first take a text box
and I will name this text box first of
all I will clear this text and then I
will resize it and I will name this text
box as
text email so when I run this program I
can enter or the user can enter anything
here regardless of checking whether it's
the authentic email ID or not so I want
the user that he should only be able to
enter the format which resembles some
email id he should not be able to die I
mean type this and when for example he
want to save this data the data should
not be saved if it's not in the email
form right so I want to check whether
it's email or not and when it's it looks
like the original email then only this
data should be saved to the database so
I'm not going to tell you how to save
this in the database but I will tell you
how to check whether the entered format
is an original email id format or not so
I have taken a text box I will also take
a button from here so button and I will
name this as
validate a rag X for example so I have
the text box and the button now I have
double click this button and in order to
use rag X in Java you need to import
some imports so go at the top and right
here import Java so write Java dot util
dot rag X dot star so it will include
all the import related to ragged or
regular expression okay now I will go to
my design and I will write some code
here so first of all we need to
understand what an email ID
format is we want to enter so an email
ID can be an alpha numerical value at
the rate once again L a numerical value
dot dot com some for example right so
format of an email ID is like this there
it contains an alpha numerical values
and then comes the add at the rate and
then some other alpha numerical values
and then dot then calm or some some
extension for example ABC at the rate
gmail.com right so now I want
the user should be able to enter this
format only so first I will define a
pattern so I'll declare a string and
call it string pattern okay
and what is my string pattern so I will
first of all give double quote and
inside this I will give the square
bracket and inside the square bracket I
will define what alphanumeric values it
can take so it can take eight twos Z in
small letters and without giving space
it can take a to Z capital letters or it
can take numerical values 0 to 9
okay so observe here that it doesn't
have any space or anything with in
between so whatever you write in the
square bracket it takes the limit
between the dash so A to Z lowercase e
to that uppercase or and 0 to 9
numerical value then we want at the rate
and we can also define the length which
we want so for example I want to give a
length then I give this curly braces and
for example I want the length between 1
to 20 so you can give the length like
this and if you read more about regular
expression you will be able to
understand this pattern fully how to
write this pattern you will be able to
understand I just want to give an idea
how use this in Java so this is an alpha
numerical value then comes or at the
rate once again the alpha numerical
value so I will copy this once again and
paste it after this at the rate and then
I want this dot so I I write here
dot and then it can be an alpha
numerical value once again so I will
copy once again this this whole actually
and paste it here but this time I will
remove this zero to nine because this
extension when general cases it cannot
be numerical value right so that's why
it's a to z upper case and it to that
lower case and it's length can be two to
three letter long because generally it
has comm or dog or dot something that is
why a length is two to three letters so
I have defined this string called email
pattern and I have defined the limits or
pattern and this pattern always when you
match this pattern it starts with this
caps sign so give this cap sign here and
at the end of your pattern you give the
dollar sign so give dollar so it looks
like this okay so this is your pattern
of your email you want the user should
enter otherwise it should give some
warning or error now we will define our
ARAG expands so right here pattern and
give it a variable limit I will give it
as pattern itself is equal to once again
copy this pattern variable this one and
paste it here dot compile and it takes
this email pattern so just copy this
email string pattern and paste it here
in the bracket and break it closed so we
define that our pattern should be this
string
now I will create a match so I will
define a variable called matcha and I
give it a variable name as a rag X
matcha is equal to once again mature
sorry this should not be mature but copy
this pattern variable from here this one
copy here and paste it here dot matcha
and bracket closed and inside this match
up bracket here we will pass what we
enter in the text box okay
so what I will do is I will copy the
name of my text box right click which is
text email go to the code once again
paste it here dot get text like this and
now after defining my matcher and
pattern I will validate it so I will
give our condition so condition is like
this if and then bracket and then these
brackets and then in here I will write
if not equal to then copy this rag x
match from here variable and pass it
pass it
inside this if bracket dot matches so if
this reg X mature does not which
contains this user entered email ID or
whatever string if it doesn't matches we
must show some message
right so what message we can show we can
show in the J option pain dot show sorry
dot show message dialog and in here I
will write null not nil but null and in
here I can show my message so I can
write email format is not correct so I
write this J option pain dot show
message dialog and I pass this null
argument comma email format is not
correct okay now if it doesn't matter
then it should show this or else it
should show me that my email id is or
email id format is correct so I will
just once again give the option pain dot
show message dialog null email id is
correct okay so if this pattern which we
have given here matches then matches
with the entered value then it should
show me this email is correct otherwise
it gives me email is not correct okay so
this is the code this whole code we have
written for matching the text now I
right click it and run the program
so I have this message or text box and
this button so I gave something a b c at
the rate gmail dot and after dot I leave
this M D so I don't write anything
because I want that it should show me
some error so I want to check it I enter
the wrong email id and I press this
button and it gives me email form it is
not correct it should be not here right
and when I write some valid email id ABC
at the rate gmail.com it should show me
email is correct so yes it shows me
email format is correct I can just
delete this in between at the rate and
dot whatever in between I delete it and
then I see email is not correct so
and in the same way I can delete this
also and check and it shows me mail
format is not correct and once again and
I click it an email is correct so in
this way you can validate that the email
the user has entered is in correct
format or not so if the user enters the
correct format then it gives me the
correct message that the email is
correct so in this way you can utilize
this reg X method to validate your text
wherever you want to validate some data
whether it's in the login ID or
something else you can always consider
this reg X method this was just an
example the Reg X is quite broad and you
can search data or search pattern in the
text with the help of rags also and you
can do many things with this reg X
regular expression so this was just an
tip of an iceberg
I just wanted to make you aware that
this thing also exists so I hope you
