show you how to use menus in your
Eclipse GUI java application so first of
all let's see what is a menu so if you
go and see this Eclipse IDE this file
added source refactor navigate these are
the menus in your Eclipse IDE and I say
in a similar way you can add menus in
your jframe also and this menu for
example I go to this file menu you have
other menu inside this file menu which
is Java project or package or this one
so this is also called menu and this
open file is a menu item because it
doesn't have any menu and in here this
project or Java project is called menu
item because this does not have any
other other menu to go to but this new
has the menu to go to so it is called
menu ok so and if you see here there are
this small little line separating some
categories from each other so Oh new and
Open File are separated by close and
close all by this small little line this
is called a separator and I am also
going to show you how to add the
separator and this here you will see
some symbols also or icon so maybe I
will also show you how to add these
icons so first thing you need to add is
this menu bar to have menus so what you
need to do is go to your palette and
search for the category called menu they
have their own category and just click
menu bar from here and drag to your
frame and when you see this green symbol
and green message menu bar would be
placed here then only release your
component otherwise it will be placed
anywhere else and then
it will not work so just place it here
so your menu bar is here now this menu
bar will contain some menus write to an
you to add these menus
you need to have J menu ok this is your
menu bar you need to add J menu to your
menu bar okay so you add first menu and
you can name your menu as I will name
this I will try to make this menu as my
Eclipse ID so I will name it as file and
inside this you can have menu items here
right so you can add either some other
menu or menu item so let us see let us
try to make it like this ok so I will
add a new and this is other menu because
it redirects me to menu items right so I
will add a menu once again to my file
menu I will add it here and this is
called new ok and then you can add menu
items here ok let's see what menu items
we have in new Java project and project
ok so let's add Java project and project
for example this is just an example I am
giving you can make your own menu so I
will take a menu item this is a menu
item here so take a menu item this one
and drag it to your add menu item here
and you can name it as Java
project and once again you can have one
other menu item one more manual turn and
place it just below this and which will
be called project for example okay now I
have a menu which has other menu new and
this new has two menu item now for
example I want to add this this one this
new file here this is a menu item right
so I will take I will just open this
menu and I will take a menu item and
drag here when you see this red line
below your menu item you can release
your menu item here and this is called
open file or what yes open file so just
change the name of the menu as open or
open file so now you have this category
of menu right this has file new open
file now this open file and new are
separated by a small little separator
here so I will add a separator how you
can add separator just go to your
components in here components menu and
in here you will find J separator click
this J separator and just drag and drop
just below this open file you will see a
red line here and just release it there
if you see some error
just past the error and you have this
separator here right now below this you
have close and close all
so I will add two more menu items here
one menu item will be called close close
and second menu item will be called
close all
close all ok so now you have you can see
the little separator here and then you
have these menu items okay now in order
to add some icon to your menu for
example I want to add a icon I can just
select this new for example I want to
add icon to this new and you will go to
the menu item property of new and you
can add this icon from here but this is
a temporary solution in video number 7 I
think I have shown you how to add images
to your project and use those images
just follow that procedure but for a
quick quick presentation I am doing this
shortcut in order to check whether we
can add a menu item or not I am going to
take an absolute path which is not
recommended but I am doing it because I
just want to show you that you can add a
menu but if you really want to add menu
to the to your project go to go and
watch I think 7th video in which I have
shown you how you can add pictures and
images to your project and use them so
now you can see this menu here so you
can download this icons little icons
which are logic logical representation
of your text and then you can add these
icons here right ok now in order to
perform some action for example I will
add one more little separator here
and I want to add a new item called exit
exit okay
and for example I want this item will
drag and drop below my separator it
should be below the separator so this
exit I want to when I click this exit
button I want to exit from a my program
ok so how can I do this I can either
right-click this menu item and go to add
event handler and go to action and
action perform or double click it simply
and by clicking this exit button I want
to exit the application how you can exit
the application just write system
just this one dot
exit and it takes argument which is
integer so if you want to exit your
application you can just write this
jframe dot exit on close okay just place
it here and you will be good to go
if it is correct or cannot resolve exit
on clothes because I have provided
little okay now it will work so just
write system dot exit and in the as
argument just write jframe dot exit on
clothes okay
now for example I want to run my program
and check whether it it works or not or
and how it looks like on the program
and when I see this file you will be
able to see these two menu items here
and you can browse to this menu
you can see these separators separating
these two menu items from other two menu
items and when you click this exit
button my vacation closes for example
you want to add some more menu item like
added sauce or refactor you can just go
to menu drag to your menu bar and leave
it there and just right add depth once
again take a menu and add one more here
you can name it as source and you can
add other menu items like this ok this
is your menu and menu items you can even
add checkboxes and radio buttons to a
menu I will show you how so this is your
menu and this added menu source right
and in the menu section here you all
also have Ridge a radio button and check
boxes you can easily add these as a menu
item here for example you want to add a
radio button you can add it like this
and you can name something name it
something I will just name it as radio
button for now but you can change it and
I can add a checkbox to my menu
just select the checkbox from here this
one and add a checkbox to here
and you can say this is a check box
okay and now when you run your program
this will give you
this added we'll give you our radio
button which you can check or uncheck or
this checkbox also okay so you can even
add radio buttons and checkboxes to your
menu okay so in this way you can use
menus in your Eclipse GUI application I
