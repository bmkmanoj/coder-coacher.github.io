shown you how to load your MySQL table
data in a data grid view in Visual Basic
windows form application so as soon as
your form loads your data which is there
in the table which is this table in the
MySQL database is loaded in this data
grid view control now in this video I
want to show you suppose you want to
show all the data when you select any
cell in the in the data grid view you
want to show the terrace ponding value
in these text boxes how can you achieve
this I want to show you in this video so
for example I select a cell so the
corresponding data from the cell which
is employee ID one surname and age
should appear in this text boxes okay so
this I want to show you so I selected
the cell for the employee ID - so
employed it to Prudential comes here
right so in the same way I want to show
all the when you select any cell the
corresponding values should come here so
how can we achieve it let's see so what
you need to do first is you just select
your data grid view so if you know don't
know how to load the data grid view from
the database just watch the last video
so just select your data grid view and
double click it and in here you need to
write this code so what this code is
doing first of all I have written or I
have declared a if condition so just
write if e so where this e comes from
this e is a variable which is this e by
le as system dot windows dot form dot
data grid view cell event args right so
this e is this variable e so just write
if e dot row index is greater than or
equal to 0 then and just finish your and
if condition so just write this F
condition and in this if condition just
declare a variable so I have declared a
variable row as data grid Muro so this
is an instance of data grid view row and
just copy this row here is equal to me
dot data grid view name so this is the
name of your data grid view which is got
a grid view one in my case dot rows and
in the bracket just write e dot row
index okay and then what I am doing next
is I am copying the name of my text
boxes in which I want to show the values
so this e text box underscore Y dot the
Eid is the name of this text box text
box under SCOE ID and text box
underscore name is the name of my second
text box name right so in this way I am
copying all the text box names dot text
is equal to Rho dot cells and in the
bracket I am writing the title of my
column I will show you in the moment
what this is dot value dot to string so
just write these this line and in the
same way just write this these lines for
the other text boxes now what is this a
ID this Eid is the title of your column
so a ID for the title of my first column
see here name is the title of my second
column so name is the title of my third
column which is this and age is the
title of my fourth column which is this
one right so this is that text or title
of the column so just write this for all
the text boxes
and your code is done just write this
code and when you run the program and
once again when you click somewhere some
cell the values will appear here
corresponding values to the cell right
so in this way you can show
corresponding values to the guard data
grid view in your text boxes I hope you
