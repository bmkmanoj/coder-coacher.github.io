Linux command line troll for beginners
in this video we will see how we can use
top command in Linux
now top command provides a dynamic
real-time view of your running system so
for example you want to know which
process in your computer is taking most
of the or your CPU or which program is
taking most of your computer memory then
you can use a top command to see which
program or which process is you know
consuming most of your memory or CPU so
let's see how we can use it so just give
t.o.p command and press Enter
and now you can see it's going to give
you this kind of a list view and you can
see it's refreshing every few seconds so
this is the time which is the current
time and for example you can see right
now it's refreshing every three seconds
so 36 and then it will be 39 and then
once again 42 so it's refreshing every
three second by default the stop command
refreshes this view every three seconds
right now
on the left hand side you will be able
to see the PID a PID stands for process
ID in Linux every program or process
have its own ID and this is called
process ID in Linux and in short it's
called PID so you can see on the right
hand side the name of the program which
is running currently and taking some
memory on your computer so this is the
zorg or genome terminal which is auto
or Mongo Mongo D which is a Mongo daemon
which is running on my computer or even
the stop command how much memory is is
it taking now in here you can see the
CPU usage so the most of the CPU which
is 5.9 or it's changing dynamically
right so 4% it's used by the zorg
process right and most of the memory
also is used by the zorg
process right so in this way you can see
or take an overview of processes which
processes are taking a memory or how
much memory is used in your system or
how much CPU is used in your system so
you can see right not total CPU usage is
for example 8.2 or 7.5% or how much
percent is it okay now
top command provides you some more you
know
capabilities or flags you can say in
order to you know use this top in a
better way now as I told you by default
this view will be refreshed after every
3 3 seconds and this you can verify with
this clock so 58 and then b1 so for 3
seconds if you want to change this
refreshing of the data then you just
need to press S on this terminal so just
press s and then you can see here it
says change delay from 3 to whatever
second you want so for example I want to
you know see the proc you processes
frequently or I want to refresh this top
frequently for example 4
every one second so I will just give one
here and press enter and now this will
be refreshed this view will be refreshed
every second and you can verify it with
this clock also so 45 46 47 so it's
refreshing faster and for example I want
to do it little bit slower so I can do
it five here and press enter and now
this view will be refreshed every five
seconds right so 56 and then one and
hopefully it will be six here on the
clock you can see like this okay now for
example whenever you press I so just
press a key I and this key allows you to
just filter out any idle processes so if
any process is idle it will not be shown
here whatever process are running here
only those processes will be shown all
other idle processes will not be shown
or filtered right so these are the only
processes which are taking some CPU or
memories so that's why these are shown
otherwise all idle processes are not
shown and once again when you press I
that is going to show you the complete
view all the processes which are running
right now next thing here what we can do
is we can even kill a process for
example so what I'm going to do is for
example I will press this button here
and I will open for example system
settings from here when I do this on my
top come on you can see unity control C
is running and when I press I so it will
just give me the overview of the running
processes right so when I do some
you know some clicks here I will be able
to see the process which process is for
which you know what is doing what so
this when I press and I can see here
this process is 3 8 7 3 for example
right so process ID according to the
process ID I can kill any process so
once again I will press it and then I
can see this unity ctrl C command the
process ID is 3/8 R 3 7 I think what 3 8
7 3 it was let me confirm yeah 3 at 7 3
so when I press on this terminal K it
can ask me the process ID so I know the
process ID which I want to kill so I
will just say 3 8 7 3 and then I will
press ENTER and once again I will press
ENTER which is going to kill the process
which I want to kill using the process
ID so now the settings window is gone
because I killed this window right so in
this way you can kill any process in
Linux now process ID and what are
processes and how to kill the processes
we will see in details later also but I
just wanted to show you the
functionality of topsail that you know
how it works so in this way you can use
top command in Linux and whenever you
want to quit top you just need to press
Q and you are out of this top command
so I hope you enjoyed this video please
