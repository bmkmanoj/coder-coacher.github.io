video I will show you how to install and
create your first visual C++ windows
form application so first of all if you
don't have Visual C++ you can download
it for free from Microsoft website so
what you need to do is go to your
browser and just write Visual C++
Express and the first link comes is
Visual Studio 2010 I know this is an
older version there is a new version
available which is called 2012 but this
does not have windows form application
this have windows form application but
you need to install and do some setting
in order to create windows form
application with Visual Studio 2012 and
Visual Studio 2010 Express by default
have windows form application for Visual
C++ so I will click Visual Studio 2010
and this will guide me to the Microsoft
web site what I need to do is I will go
to the download section and I will go
below below and here you can see we used
to do 2010 Express you can download
Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition from
here and installation is just few button
clicks so I will not show you how to do
that by the way I have Visual Studio
installed in my computer so I don't need
to install this
and edition but if you don't have the
license then it's good to install this
and then start learning visual C++ so
that's how you can download visual c++
and then when you start your first
Visual C++ environment it will look like
this
so you will first go to this file
section and go to new project and here
you will click visual c++ yes and you
can create many type of application with
visual c++ like when console application
quite a few other application but what
we are interested in is this windows
form application which is our user
interface application so you can you
will make very good graphical user
interface with the help of this windows
form application and the advantage of
this c++ is it's very fast faster than
Java I can say that so what I will do is
I will just give it a name
lost
app I have given the name and if you
want to save your project to some other
location then you can browse the
location and then select and press ok
and make sure this create directory for
solution is checked so it will create a
directory for your project and click OK
and it will create a new window form
application for visual C++ to you
and taking time and slowly it will
create
so yes it has created us new fresh
windows form application so when you
first start your application you will be
presented this form and you have all
these things in your program so first
what you need to do is you need to have
a toolbar in order to create some
logical user interface so if you see
here you can find a toolbox which have
many components which we can drag and
drop into our from form and we can make
them functional by code so for example I
want to pick and place a button here and
second I want to pick place
Xbox
okay
and you can change the property of this
button and textbox by this properties
tab by default you can find this
property tab here but I don't like it
here I like it that this place the
property tab so I will place it here and
so for example you click this text box
it will show you this that the name of
the textbox X this you can change your
text box name so for example
name it as message text and press ENTER
and I want to change this also so I will
click this and I will go to the text
here this one and I will change the text
of this button and I will make it okay
and once you have press Enter
you can see ya okay is appeared
so once you're done with this you need
to know that how to run this program so
this green button is to debug and run
the program so just go and click this
green button and it will ask to build
the program because any changes when you
make in your program you need to build
your C++ program if you have program in
C++ so it asked for that and just press
yes and it will be read the program for
you and if you don't have any errors it
will run the application for you so this
is the run form and you can click this
button on enter any text in this text
box but of course these this button and
this text boxes is not functional yet
that we will see in the next video
sorry so you need to know these things
that you need to have tool box here and
property tab and these are the two most
important aspect of this Windows C++
form application and when you provide
any functionality to your form you just
need to double click this button for
example and it will guide us to the code
for programming
and that I will show you from the next
video so I hope you have liked this
first video and please rate comment and
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
