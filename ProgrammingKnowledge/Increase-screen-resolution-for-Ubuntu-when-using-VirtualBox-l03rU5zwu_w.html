first install Ubuntu on your Windows
host by using VirtualBox the first thing
which you observe is the screen
appearance it's a little bit bigger in
size and it doesn't look exactly the
same when you install fresh open-toe on
without your virtual machine so today I
will show you how to improve the exact
same appearance if you would have
installed Ubuntu on some individual
computer or PC so let's get started open
your terminal and just type sudo apt -
cat install VirtualBox - OS e - guests -
x11 and press enter it will ask for your
password and then enter
it will start installing the VirtualBox
guest additions plus yes
once this is installed
you need to restart your system in order
to see the change so I will wait for the
installation and then we restart my
operating system once again
it's installing
so now it's installed so I will restart
my system once again and we flows it and
we restart the system
please don't
so when you restart your system you will
immediately see the change of on this
screen it bacon little bit smaller and
the resolution has really been improved
and then I will start my system and now
my system has started and you can see
everything is really improved the
resolution is improved the sidebar which
was looking really big it has improved
and any open something it's resolution
is also improved so in this way you can
improve the appearance of your Ubuntu
operating system which is working as a
guest on your VirtualBox so I hope this
will help you to experience a good open
do operating system and I will say
goodbye to you and please rate comment
and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
