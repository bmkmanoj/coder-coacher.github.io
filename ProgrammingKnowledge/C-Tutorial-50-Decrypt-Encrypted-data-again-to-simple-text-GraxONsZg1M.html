last video I have shown you how to
encrypt your data with the help of your
c-sharp application so I have made these
text boxes and button and then when I
enter some text simple text here and
when I press this encryption button it
will encrypt my simple text into the
Rendlesham or encryption text and in
this video I will show you how to
decrypt this data and extract your
original string in this text box so I
will just decrypt this data and show
original text which is this text here
okay so let's see how we can do this and
first of all if you haven't seen the
last video you would not be able to
follow this video because I have
declared some variable which I will use
in the decryption code also so if you
don't have seen this that last video
just go and see the last video so now we
will write the code for decryption so
just double click your decryption button
and in this button click event write
this code so write system dot IO dot
memory stream and give it a variable
name I have named it as M s1 is equal to
new system dot IO dot memory stream and
in the bracket we will pass the schiffer
bytes which we have written in the last
code or last video code so this ship of
bytes is the encrypted data which you
have converted from your simple text
so this we have declared in the last
video has a global variable and this
ship of bite just copy that shipper byte
byte array variable and just paste it
here this I am declared in the last
video and then in the next line write
crypto stream see s1 is equal to new
crypto stream and in the bracket past
this memory stream variable which is M
is 1 comma des object which I have
declared in the last video this is the
Rendel object which I am declared dot
create T crypto bracket bracket closed
comma crypto stream mode dot read and
break it closed
ok and in the next line just copy this
variable paste it here dot read and in
the bracket right
Shifa bytes which is once again the
Shifa bytes which is encrypted form of
your data comma 0 comma Shiva bytes once
again dot length and then write plain
byte to variable which we have declared
in the last video also this plane by 2
is a byte array variable and this I have
declared in the last video this all code
I have declared in the last video and
this also so write that plane byte by
its two variable is equal to M s 1 which
is your this memory stream variable dot
2 string so this will convert your
decrypted data into
or this will convert your encrypted data
into originals form and this memory
stream will transfer that decrypted data
into this variable okay and just close
your CS which is crypto stream variable
so CS 1 not close and just close your
memory stream also slowly memory stream
dot close bracket and bracket close and
then we will just pass our decrypted
data byte array into the textbox so
right textbox decrypted text which is
the name of this decrypted text textbox
dot txt is equal to n coding dot ASCII
dot gate string and just pass this plain
byte array variable so for decryption I
have written this code okay so if you
want you can pause the video and write
the code and when you are done with the
code we will run our program for example
I will write hello you tube and when I
press this button it will encrypt my
daughter and when I press this button it
should convert my encrypted data into
the original form which is this so I
press this and if you can see it has
converted my this cryptic data into the
original form plus it will give some
garbage garbage values because in the
encryption we have provided some padding
to it and which is a multiple of
sixteen the try it showing this padding
garbage so in this way you can decrypt
your encrypted data using your c-sharp
application I hope you have learned
something new this time please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
