teach you about constructors and
destructors in co-op and I am also going
to show you how you can define
constructors and destructors and what is
the purpose of constructors and
destructors MC shop so what is a
constructor a constructor is a special
method in the class which we use to
instantiate some values or instantiate
some method let's see what I mean by
instantiation or initialization okay
first of all whenever you declare a
class c-sharp will create a constructor
and destructor for you even if you don't
define a constructor and destructor by
yourself
so for example we have defined this
class in the last video this is a box
class which has the member variable
length redhide lb edge and the volume we
were it has a member method volume and
we were calculating the volume and we
were using the instance of this class to
calculate the volume right so this class
we have written last time so this class
also has a constructor and destructor
which is created by c-sharp internally
for you even if you haven't defined any
constructor and destructor and the
biggest or the important property of
constructor is it has the same name as
your class name okay so how you can
define a constructor just give a power X
is specifying for example public public
it should be public and then the name of
the class unnamed
of the glass is box you see here so
constructor has always the same class
same name as your class name and just
remember that constructor don't return
anything your method return the values
and even if they do not return the value
they return null or nothing and we will
add here in the returning values as void
if they do not return anything but the
constructor never return anything okay
just remember that but they can take
parameters so for taking parameters you
can pass those parameters inside these
brackets and you can also write some
code inside the constructor in between
these two curly braces okay now I
already told you that constructors are
initialized automatically whenever you
create an instance of a class so to see
this let's see an example okay so what
I'm going to do is I will say console
dot write line and I will say in this
double quote the constructor is
initialized okay now even if I am not
using this constructor in my class here
I have just defined defined this object
of this class okay so I haven't called
this constructor specifically right but
whenever you run your program whenever
you create even an object of the class
so let's
try and comment this code first okay so
you will better understand okay so now
we only have the object definition box
and box one is equal to new box so we
have created an instance of a class and
whenever you create instance of a class
constructor is automatically called so
just when I run this program you will
see this message the constructor is
initialized right so at the time of
making the object this is automatically
called okay
now let's see the definition of
destructor the structure is also created
if you don't create a destructor by
yourself C shaft will create a
destructor for you
and destructors are also having the same
name as your class name okay so let's
see how we can define the structure you
just need the tilde sign just search for
this tilde sign here it's on above your
tab button okay and then the same name
of the class which is box and then just
the parameter brackets and then these
semicolons okay so this is your
destructor and destructor is also called
whenever your object goes out of scope
so you created your object and in the
next line you your object has gone out
of scope because you are not using this
object anymore anywhere
in the in your code so what the
structure is called automatically when
your object goes out of scope okay so
let's try to see this behavior also I
will just copy this console dot write
line and I will say the destructor is
called and when I run the program you
see here it's initialized and it's not
showing any message of the destructor
why because you have this console dot
read line code and this is holding this
destructor to not to be called and
unless and until this is there your
object will not go out of context so let
me just comment this line control dot
read line we'd keep and we just only
have the definition of this object which
is box box one is equal to new box right
now I will press control f5 to run my
program so just run your program with
control f5 okay and now you will see
here the constructor is initialized and
when the when your object or instance
who was out of the scope that means it
as soon as it reaches here the end of
the main program your object is out of
scope now and it call it calls this
destructor and it shows the message
destructor is called okay so just for
the demonstration that this constructor
and destructors are called automatically
whenever you create an instance of a
class and whenever you go out of scope
of your instance okay now this
definition
of constructor is not doing much right
it's just printing a message and you
hardly do this in your coding that you
want to print the message whenever you
define a constructor there are more
useful ways to use constructor and the
most important use of constructor is it
is used to initialize the variables in
your class okay or initialize values in
your class so let's see how we can
initialize values in the clasp so in
here I have the basic definition of the
constructor public box and these curly
braces and what I can do is I can define
or initialize length breadth and height
using constructor so let's see how I'll
write double and I will say L a for
length then double BR for breath and
double a chai for height okay and now I
will initialize whenever I create a
constructor
I will initialize I want to initialize
length red tonight
so how can I do this I will use this
this is a special keyword which shows
that your whatever you are calling is an
instance of this box
okay so indirectly it's an instance of
your class in which you are in dot L is
equal to L a so whatever user will give
the value of L a it will be assigned to
your length in the same way define three
length breadth idea right this dot B
this dot H so now what we are intending
to do is whenever I defined a instance
of class so you see here when ever I
change the definition of constructor and
I pass parameters here now your
definition or here you will see the
tilde or error and when you hover over
this class it shows that it is expecting
the parameters in these brackets okay so
now you need to give these parameters
three parameter which can be double
values okay so I will give three
parameters here for example 46 for
length 60 for breath and 20 for height
okay and I as soon as I have given these
three parameters the error is gone right
so just remember this you always or most
important use of constructor is to
initialize the values or initialize the
variables in the class okay so now
because you have defined this
constructor which expect three
parameters you need to define in the
instance of class like this box box and
the box one is equal to new box and pass
these three length breadth and height
here because you are passing three
parameters and now you don't even need
to initialize them length breadth an ID
from here you already have initialized
it in the constructor so this has
reduced your code right and it will work
fine when you run the program even you
haven't initialized the the length
cotton-eyed explicitly
now I will run the program and it
doesn't show up because this comes hold
on grid line is not there so I uncomment
it once again I run the program and
shows volume of the box is whatever is
the volume right so in this way you can
use constructors and destructors in
c-sharp and once again constructor and
destructor are called automatically even
if you don't define them by or cell and
the most important use of constructors
are to initialize the values okay so I
hope you have understood the basic
concept of constructor and destructor
and I hope you have enjoyed this video
