not a tutorial about any programming
code in this video I'm gonna tell you
that lot of you have been asking me to
give the code which I have used in my
tutorials so what I have done is I have
made a blog and I have tried to provide
all the code related to each and every
video I have made and so you can see the
video and directly copy the code from
the related video so now I will tell you
how you can go to my blog and check
which code and how to see the code so if
you have seen my channel here is the
link to my blog it's called my blog it
is linked to facebook also you can send
me a friend request or your queries
there also and this is my blog so when I
click it it's called programming
knowledge blog dot blog spot.com tree is
according to that this extension will
come and the heading shows my channel
name
which is programming knowledge and when
you see here till now I provided the
code up to 24th video so I have provided
the name of my video or name of the
title of my video and then I have
provided the code I have used in that
video when you click this link click
link to watch the video you will
directly go to the video like this and
you can see the video also from there so
up to now I have inserted 24 or I have
inserted the code up to video number 24
in the future when I will get time I
will be testing more of my codes here
related to the particular video so what
can you can do is you can follow me or
subscribe me here also so you will be
aware what I'm doing and any time you
want some code really fast and you don't
want to write the code step-by-step then
you can just come here and copy the code
and just use as it is and second thing I
want to say is just join me here as more
as you can so here also you can
see what I am doing taking second thing
is there is a second page to this
channel which C++ code examples and in
here I have given some of the C++ code
which I I have learned when I was
learning C++ and these are the code
which are made by me and that time so I
have solved whatever exercises I have
solved I just copied them and paste it
there here so if you require or you
these exercises need your requirement
all you need this kind of a code you can
copy from here directly and use it these
are the very general examples so these
will help you to understand the concepts
of C++ also so this also you can see
here and you can give me your
suggestions what do you want more and
what the improvement I can do in my
tutorials or what more you want to learn
all suggestion I will welcome so I hope
you will learn and your learning more
and more through these tutorials and I
wish you all the best with your projects
and your loading thank you and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
