show you how to add title to your table
which you have made in I text so last
time I've shown you how to add a table
by writing this code and now I will add
a title so after your PDF P table table
declaration here you have to write a
code for the title
so right here
and after that give a bracket and close
it inside this PDF cell you to give the
name of the title so write the bracket
and you will give the name of your title
so I will name it as title for example
and to write new new paragraph so you
written this you've made one cell inside
your table and the name title to it and
you know you can see some errors so
right click and it's import and then
also your
it's not gone because I forgot once
again PDF P cell you know dad every time
you made a cell that I need to close
also so I would write table dot this
alright and I will once again
right-click and fix the import and I
will click OK and my error is gone so I
have written these two lines in order to
provide the title and in between you can
give some column span and whatever
alignment you want to give to your tigey
so I will give first of all span
self-centered
to center so it will be shown at the
center of your of my title as green for
example so what I have done till now is
I've given the title to my table I've
given the span what is the alignment at
what place you have to align your 20 and
what should be the background color of
your
of your title of the table so let's try
to run our program I click run file
when I click the report the port is
saved and I will go to the folder where
my report is saved I will click the port
and nothing happens so let's see why
nothing happens go to my code
so I think my previous program was
running so I think this error was due to
that otherwise our code is correct so
what I will do is I will do run the
program once again and let's see what
happens this time and I will take report
and report is saved I will go to the
report take it you can see the title is
shown and it is aligned at the center
and the color of your background is
green I will close it and I can also
change change
I want to close last program otherwise
same matter will come now we click the
report once again and click OK before
this change movement so you can see my
title is aligned at left and my
background color is changed to do so in
this way you can provide the title to
your table and change color alignment
and whatever you want to do so that's it
