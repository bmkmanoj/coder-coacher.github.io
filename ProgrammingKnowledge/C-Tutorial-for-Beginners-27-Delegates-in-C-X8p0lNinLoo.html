show you what our delegates in c-sharp
so let's see what is the definition of
Delegates and then we will see us
declaration and using of delegates so a
delegate is a type which holds a method
reference in an object okay we can also
say it is also referred to as a types a
function pointer
okay so delegate is a type shape
function pointer and generally we use
delegate to improve the performance of
our application because we can use a
delegate to call methods asynchronously
so I will demonstrate to you how what I
mean by those lines but first let's see
how we can declare delegates so for that
what I need to do is I have this class
called example 1 and in this class I
will create a public method for example
which will be public void or it will
return integer for example int and I
want to name my method as ad or here add
numbers add numbers and this takes two
parameters which are obviously two
numbers right so this will take two
parameters first is int number one comma
int number two okay and what this method
does it just returns the addition of
these numbers or
returned number one plus number two
right plus number three this this is a
small method and this is there is
nothing special in it it just takes two
number as a pair as parameters and it's
it adds those two numbers and returns
right now I said or by the definition to
declare our delegate water delegate
delegate is a type save function pointer
so we declare our delegate to point to
this function okay so let's see how we
can declare delegates first delegates we
can use delegate away we can declare
delegate as a simple function with a
keyword delegate so for example I want
to create a delegate for this function I
will take the signature of this method
of prototype of this method I will just
copy this and paste it here and I just
need to include a keyword called
delegate here
okay so delegate and the number of the
delegate we will name this delegate as
such that it repels represent that it's
a delegate of this function so I can say
add number delegate for example okay
this is how you declare a delegate
okay and this function has the same
signature to the function you're
pointing so for now I am pointing to
this function which returns integer it
so our delegate will also return integer
and it takes two argument which are in
and my function also take two elements
which are Amy's right now
delegates are similar to a class in a
way we can define an instance of these
delegates like in a class we can define
an object of the class you can also
define the object of the delegate okay
so let's use this delegate sorry this
delegate which is add number delegate to
our main function so I can create an
object of this function like this like
me I can do it with classes add number
delegate del is equal to nu ID number
delegate and it takes two parameters
right but for pointing this delegate to
this function right now in the
definition we are not specifying that
this delegate is for this function right
but in the construction of this function
or as a constructor of this function we
pass the name of the function the point
we want to point to in this delegate
okay so here we pass a function as a
constructor right and this is showing us
error because for example we haven't
created the instance of this function to
use in here so I will declare this
method or function as a static method
and then we will be able to use it so I
will use it as static and then we can
use this otherwise we have to we have to
define the instance of this example one
class and then by using the object of
this class you can call this but for now
we declare this as a static function so
we can leave with that x vida okay so
this is how you can make an instance of
delegate it has the name of the delegate
then the object name is equal to new
delegate and as a construction
as a constructor to pass the function
name you want to point to okay and now
you can just use this del object as an
instance or object of delegate and call
that function to just write del dot dot
and you can just pass those parameters
like you can pass to a function right so
what you can do for example I will
declare int YZ int result and this is
equal to the addition of two numbers
will just write del and this will take
two arguments which are two integers
right so because we have passed this add
number function as a as a constructor in
the construction of this delegate this
delegates knows that it's pointing to
this function and this function is
taking two parameters or two integers
right so I can pass these two integers
in here right for example 450 5 comma 6
78 okay so you can just use delegates
like this you need to pass those
parameters which the function is taking
I will reduce it will return the result
as integer whatever it's returning and
then you can just print this console dot
write line and you can just print the
answer like this result ok and when I
run the program it will run fine and it
shows me the addition of these two
numbers right so this is how you can
declare a delegate and use
our delegate to point up function but
you can do it like this also why do we
really need this delegate if we can use
this function directly you can just use
this add a number here and you can pass
these two numbers instead of doing this
you can just you can just copy the name
of this function and instead of this del
object you can just use this and it will
also give the same result but why we can
you we need to use this delegate because
whenever we create some classes which
has to be you know used in a general
sense or in a multiple situation
delegates are very useful why because in
instead of this condition for example
you wanted a product of these two
numbers and these two numbers the
argument will be same but for example
you want to change the functionality of
the product you cannot change the
functionality of the product when you
use the same function but you can change
the functionality of the pro-growth
functionalities of this number or this
function when you use delegates because
delegates just point to a function so
you can point to a multiple or multiply
numbers function and this will this
delegate will forego fine so in a
situation where you need some
performance or multiple uses of the
functional method you use delegate in
the next video I am actually going to
show you how to use this delegate in a
better way using some class and some
better example so stay tuned and please
