video I am going to show you how to use
include and require function in PHP so
for example I have a PHP file which is
just containing a HTML code and which is
just printing some header on the browser
so I will just save it and I will so I
will just browse for a dot PHP and it's
just printing programming knowledge here
now sometimes or most of the times you
want some template to you know
appear whenever you use your PHP code so
for example you want to use this
template it shows this header in
different PHP file ok so how can we do
that so for example I will make one more
PHP file and I will call it page page 1
dot P PHP and I will one more I will
create one more PHP file and I will call
it page 2 dot PHP ok so I have these two
PHP file and I will just quickly make
this template and in here for example I
want that I want to use this header file
ok so I want to make this header file
once and I want to use this in different
PHP pages ok in different PHP files how
can I do this I can use this include
function and include this header file in
my PHP 1 and PHP to page so let's see
how
so what you need to do is you just need
to use the keyword include and then in
single quotes just give the name of your
header dot php' which you want to use
here so my head the PHP is like this at
the dot pH PHP okay now what this code
will do is it will call this header dot
PHP because all these three files are in
same folder that's why I can call this
for example if you want to go up one
folder you can use it like this or for
example you want to use some so if you
have this file in some other folder
inside you can use it folder slash
something like this but because this
these all three files are in the same
same folder that's why I am NOT giving
any paths here okay otherwise you need
to give relative path whenever you your
header files are in different folder and
your other functional file are in other
folder okay now I can include this file
in my PA page 1 and page 2 like this
just use include and the name of this
and then I can call pH one so page 1 dot
PHP and it will give me some kind of
let's see what's the error I don't see
any error here so let's try it once
again okay this is page one dot and I
have used comma here so instead of page
one dot now it will work so whenever we
call page one this header is called
right this header and whenever we call
page two dot PHP also this header will
be called right so page 1 and page 2 has
the same header right so this include
function enables us to use the same
template if you have in different PHP
files now for example I have I can
declare some variable variable page one
and I can show some message here for
example I can show we are in page one
okay and we can echo this echo page one
and in the same way I will do the same
in my page two so this will be my page
two variable this will be my page two
variable and this will be two okay I
save it and let's see what happens so we
are in page one dot PHP and I can see
this echo message here we are in page
one and whenever I call page two dot PHP
we see we are in page 2
right so this include function just
include the header and we will be able
to do our other tasks which are
inherently done by page 1 and page 2
also in these page 1 and page 2 dot PHP
ok or for example you decide to use
these variables in this
while also you can do the this just like
this so for example I can just declare
in my header dot PHP
I can just say PHP and in here I can
declare this variable which is page one
right page one I just cut it from here
and in my header dot PHP and my PHP tags
I can just paste it here and same I will
do from my page two right so in a way I
have declared all my variables in this
header dot PHP and I want to use this
these variables in page 1 and page 2 I
will save it and once again run it let's
see what happens so I can still get the
same result here page 1 dot PHP will
show me page 1 and page 2 dot PHP will
show me page we are in page 2 right so
in this way you can use the include
function to call files for files and
whatever variables or whatever values
are there in the files you can just
import it in your PHP file by using this
include write in a same way you can use
require function also so we can use
instead of this include require function
require and this will also work the same
way that of include so I will just save
it and when i refresh this it works
same as include function right or page 1
also it's it works same as include
function but for example I am I'm
including some text before this page 1
very page 2 variable and page 1 variable
so for example I can just say
page info and I just concatenate this in
page 2 dot PHP and page 1 dot PHP okay
and I save it and whenever I use this
require here ok and whenever this header
name is for example by mistake I have
missed misspelled this header name so
this is not a I mean original header or
header which exists
this is non-existent header right in
here also in our page 2 we just provide
the path of the header which doesn't
exist and we save it and when we refresh
this we see here the warning and the
error and we don't see this page info
message even so what this required does
is whenever it sees that it cannot find
this header file or this PHP file which
you have provided the part of then it
kills your page so whatever you write or
you like whatever you want execute after
this include or after this require
function and if this header is
non-existent it will kill your page
after that ok and this is same in the
case of this but whenever we use include
include here in page 1 and page 2 and
save it see what happens
refresh it and even this is showing the
error but it will execute your messages
or whatever functionality you are doing
after after your include function also
so this is printing page info right you
can see here page info right so if this
include function even if you provide the
wrong header name or header which does
not exist
it will keep on executing the other
codes which you right below your include
function so it will not kill your page
on the other hand when you use require
it will kill your page right so for
example I will use require for page two
and include for page one okay so let's
see page one first which we have include
page one refresh it
it shows page info bitches are after my
include right
and let's see page two dot PHP h2 dot
PHP and now it killed my page and I
cannot see the code I want to execute
after the sick while function require
function so included require works in
the same way but but only difference is
this which I have shown you so I hope
you have learned something new this time
please wait a minute subscribe and bye
