this pycharm file so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to go to my downloads
folder here I can see this pycharm zip
file I can right-click and I can extract
this file here or folder here and it's
going to extract now I'm using open -
14.4 and in ubuntu 14.4 python is
already installed so - in order to check
I can just give this command Python 3 -
- version and it's going to give me
Python 3.4 point 0 and it's even having
older version of Python which is Python
2.7 I think so just give python - -
version and i can see this two point
seven point six right so i don't need to
install pie thief i have fourteen point
four but in order to install a pycharm
you need to have Oracle Java installed
in your system so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to clear this terminal and
I need three commands you can see these
commands I need in order to install
Oracle Java in my system I'm going to
just give these command in the
description so that you can just
directly copy them and paste them in
your terminal so first command is the
this repository for this repository so
I'm going to just copy and paste this
and click enter and give my password
and the second command is update command
so apt-get update
and the third command is installation of
Oracle Java so just copy this command
and I'm going to give this command and
hit enter and click OK and do you accept
Oracle binary code license click yes now
Java installation is complete in Ubuntu
so I can clear this terminal now I have
already extracted this PyCharm folder in
downloads folder so what I'm going to do
is using terminal I'm going to browse to
that folder for by jump so CD downloads
and my pycharm folder and inside this PI
Chum folder what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go to my bin folder so in here
there is a folder called bin and I want
to go inside this folder because inside
this folder there is a file called
PyCharm dot SH and this executable file
or this shell file shell script I want
to run ok so I'm going to go to bin in
pycharm and let's list all the items
here and I can see pycharm dot SH is
here so I can run this by dot slash
PyCharm dot SH and press Enter
and it's going to run this script shell
script and PyCharm
is starting
and for the first time when you are
install or run this shell script it's
going to ask you for your key map scheme
IDE theme which is a gtk+ is default for
it and editor color and font by its
default but you can choose dark yellow
which is dark editor or other you know
Twilight or some other fancy you know
editor color and fonts but I'm going to
leave it as default then I will click OK
and now I can create my project but
first of all I need to give my password
and click enter now I'm ready to create
a new project so I can click new project
and in here I can give a name to my
project so go at the last and instead of
untitled you can give the name to your
project for example my project or
approach proj and in here you can choose
the version of python you want to use so
I err in and in here you can choose the
version of python you want to use so by
default it will be Python 2.7 for
example and you can choose if you want
to use Python 3.4 by just clicking this
button ok and now I'm going to create my
project and it's going to create me a
new project and in here inside my
project what I can do is I can add a new
Python file so right click this project
and create new python file and give the
name to your file for example my file
dot py ok and click OK
and it's going to create a new Python
file for you and this you can delete and
here you can test your Python script so
I'm going to write print and because I
have chosen Python 3.4 I need to use
brackets and I will just give hello
world okay and now you can run your
script by just right clicking and just
click this run my file dot Python so
just click this and it's going to run my
program and now you can see the program
is running and in this terminal I can
see the output okay and after running it
for the first time you will be able to
see this green button and you can run
your program once again by clicking this
green button so for example I want to
added this hello world message for
example hello world YouTube and then I
can click the screen button and it's
going to print hello world YouTube here
so in this way you can install pi chum
