video I am going to teach you about
method hiding in c-sharp in the last
video we have learned how inheritance
works in c-sharp so for example I have a
base class called FC FC spent stands for
first class and it has a public method
called this player and what this public
method is doing simply it's showing a
message and in this case it's showing FC
coolin coolin displayed that means PR in
FC class which is our base class now for
example we have second class which is
our derived class SC then for second
class and which is inheriting first
class which is FC right so this is our
derived class and this is our base class
and base class has one method called
display right now in the main method I
just created the instance or object of
the second class which is a derived
class and I display the message okay
because second class is inheriting the
first class its methods are hourly
available for use in the second class
also that's why I am using object dot
display because this second class can
also access this method okay and when I
run the program as expected it will show
this message as FC : : display so let's
wait for the console and it shows as
expected F sequel : display now suppose
for some unknown or weird reason second
class don't want
to use this method which is display and
second class want to have its own
display method that want to display its
own message rather than using the
display message or display method from
the built base class
so for example it makes a bold effort to
just have this display method in itself
also so now our second class which is a
derived class also has this display
method so let me change this to SC dot
display which is second last pull and
groaning display this is first class
going to display and there's a second
class going going the display so what do
you think now
will happen then this message will be
shown or this message will be shown
let's see what happens I'll run the
program and build and we have the
message SC which is second class pullin
: display okay
so this class is hidden by the derived
class by using this method but look at
this there is a green squiggly line here
right and this line showing the warning
to the user that method or my project
dot example dot SC dot display hide the
inherited member which is FC dot display
okay so if you do this C shop will warn
you about this that you are hiding this
method and so you will see this green
line in order to remove what this
warning what you can do is you can use
in front of this avoid a keyword called
new so
this new keyword tells c-sharp that I
want to for second class want to create
its own display method right so now when
you run the program it even it still
shows this SC dot display or X equal in
display but the error or the warning is
gone okay so now this kind of
declaration where ever derived class
want to hide the original method which
is there in the base class then it can
create its own method with the same name
okay and it'll it can hide this method
okay now for example for some other
reason some other user don't want to use
this you want to use this only even if
you have declared this so how can you
show this after having or after method
hiding of this test based class so they
can be here two or three ways of doing
this first way let's commend this and
first pay what you can do is you can
call your base class in here so what you
can do is you can write base base means
this class base is your base class and
you are in the derived class so this
base keyword automatically knows that
you are indicating to the parent or to
the base class so when I hover over this
you can see here in the message that
it's indicating FC class which is our
base class so you can write base dot
display okay and I will just give
this bracket and semicolon and when I
run this program it shows FC which is a
base class : : display okay so whenever
you want to display this base class
method even if you have defined your
method hiding method in the derived
class also then you can do it like this
there are there is other way of doing
the same thing and I will show you in a
moment this second method so what you
can do here is you can type cast your
second class as first class so for what
you can do here you have your object SC
object is equal to new SC so you have
this object okay so what you can do is
you can just copy your first class which
is your base class and then you can just
type claw cast this object as a first
class okay and just give these brackets
and just you can write dot so it should
not look like this but this will come
this FC will come in the bracket and now
you have these brackets so now when you
give the dot you have the display method
right so you can display this method
like this and you can comment this line
so what TIFF code will do is it will
typecast your object as a base class and
you already know that your derived class
is just a special case of your base
class right so the right class already
have all the method or X
to all the method and variable in the
base class right and the right class can
also have its own method but it has all
the X's to its public base class method
right so this is called typecasting your
object and when I run the program it
will show FC Poland Poland display right
and it will not show FC which is second
class : : display okay
now third way of doing this the same is
so what you can do is I will just
comment this once again and we are going
to use the third method so what you can
do is you can just copy your based last
name which is FC in our case and I can
make it object so i will write obj and
let me come in this line also so i will
there i define an object of my base
class and I will make an instance of new
SC okay so derived class I will create
an instance of second class which is
derived class as an object of first
class okay and I will uncomment this and
when I run the program that will give
you the same result
FC : : display okay so what you have
done is you have created the instance of
your base class as a child class or a
derived class okay but if you might do
one wondering that the reverse is also
also possible that you can do SC and
here you can derive this SC instance
from first class which is your base
class or two
you an error and the error shows that
cannot implicitly convert your a base
class to your child class or derived
class okay so this is not possible why
this is not possible because your base
class or your base class have or you can
create the instance of base class as a
child class but you cannot create a
child calc class instance as a base
class okay so this is the third method
you can use right so you have three
types of code from which you can call
your base class method even if you have
declared or read Eclair this same method
in your derived class right now for
example I have a third class so I will
copy and I will paste it here and I will
write that this is the third class which
is TC e C stands for third class and it
is inheriting 2nd class ok SC okay and I
will just copy this TC and paste it here
so this class also has the method
display and it shows TC whole : display
ok and now I will create an object of
this TC class and now I run the program
and I will just write object was display
so what method will be called let's see
so TC dot display will be called right
so you can hide this method also so
which is derived class from the FC but
now you are
your second class is your base class in
the case of third class and now you can
even override or e you can even hide the
method of your derived class like this
by deriving from the derived class
okay so I hope you're understood the
basic concept of method hiding ET sharp
and hope i hope you have enjoyed this
