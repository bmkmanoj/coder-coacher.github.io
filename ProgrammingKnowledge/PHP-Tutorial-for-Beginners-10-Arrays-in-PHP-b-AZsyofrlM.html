video I am going to show you how to use
array in your PHP code so first of all
what is an array array is the collection
of similar data so for example you want
a collection of names you cannot save
all the names in a single variable but
whenever you use array you will be able
to save multiple values of same data
type in a single variable so array is a
collection of values basically now let's
see how we can declare arrays in PHP the
declaration is same for array as the
variable you just start with your end
symbol and for example I want to make an
array of names and then you just give
this equal to sign and then tell PHP
that it's an array by keyword array not
here but okay and then in these two
brackets you give the values to the
array okay so for example the names can
be mark and beer in mind if this is a
string datatype because names can by
logic are some string datatype so just
if it's a string datatype just include
this within the single quotes as we have
seen in the string variables right and
second name can be John and third name
can be simple name Bob for example and
then how for exhaustive all so you have
provided three values in the array now
this these values you have provided
are called elements of the array okay so
this is one element this second element
then this is third element so this is
called element of the array now the
position of these these values or these
elements is also important and the
position of these values or elements are
called key or index and position this
key or index starts from zero okay so
always always remember that these
element key or index starts from zero
one and two this is the position at
which they are stored in the array now
in order to print this what do you just
need to do is echo and you can just use
your name with of course this and symbol
and you can use these square brackets to
represent the position which you want to
print so this is the 0th position first
position and second position because
index or key start from zero so for
example I want to print the name John I
will just echo names and with a key one
right save it and I will just run this
and it shows John in a similar way I can
print mark save it and this refresh it
it will be mark or I can just print Bob
also okay I will refresh it and you will
be able to see Bob now you can also
assign value to the array it's not
necessary that you need to only you know
give the values at the time of
initialization of this name array you
can assign these value at run time also
or whatever for a for example you want
to assign some value to
the RA you can just use this name names
array and you can assign on one more
member to this array which will be so we
have zero one two okay so members still
key to right you can add the third key
and you can add this name for example
some random name for example and then
you can print this here right and what
this code is doing is it's just adding
Julie to this array right I will save
this and I will refresh this and you can
see our array is now contained Julie
also right now for example you want to
print all the values of this array you
can do it like this you can use a
function called print underscore R and
it can take the array name like this and
what will do is it will print all the
values of your array with their index or
key so let's try to refresh it and you
see it it prints that you have passed an
array inside your inside your print R
function and the index of this name mark
is zero or key of this mark is zero John
key of John is one key of Bob is two and
you can see Julie is also added and the
key of Julie is three you can add more
values to this by just assigning it a
new T and new name
and then you will be able to see one
more key here okay so the key of Patrick
is four right so this is the basics of
array in PHP but there are different
kind of array in PHP for example
associative array or multi-dimensional
array which I will be talking in the
later videos so that's it for this video
