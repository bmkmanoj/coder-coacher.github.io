cutie tutorial for beginners and in this
video we will see how we can download
and install QT on our Windows operating
system so this QT framework comes with
Qt creator IDE QT SDK and some other
tools like linguist and some other tools
right so we are going to see how we can
download and install QT on our Windows
operating system so let's get started
first of all open your favorite browser
and search for qu T and the first link
hopefully which will appear here will be
from Qt dot IO ok so just click this
link which is QT dot IO and once you
click this link you will be able to see
this kind of webpage which says build
your world with QT and you will see this
button which says get started so just
click this button which says get started
and it's going to ask you few questions
before installing you know QT so it's
asking first of all is your application
or device being developed for commercial
purposes or in-house deployment private
use or student or open source
distribution so for now we are going to
choose this option because we I want to
learn you know QT so we are going to use
the open source option now the next
question is asking is are you prepared
to make your application source code
publically available yes we want to do
this and the next question is ask is are
you able to comply with the LGPL you
know agreements and this time also we
are going to say yes ok so now once you
answered all these three questions you
can download QT for free which is a open
source version of QT so just click get
started here and in here you will be
able to see this download button okay so
you
can click this download button and QT
executable will be downloaded on your
Windows operating system now if you are
interested in other you know downloads
you can click this link here which says
mu all the downloads right so if you
don't want to bother about other
downloads you can just click this
download button is going to you know
download QT but for me I personally like
to use the QT with mingw compiler which
is a GNU Compiler so I would like to
download this version of QT which says
Qt five point six point zero for windows
with mingw ok but you have a visual
studio compiler also 2015 as a first
choice and if you don't have any good
reason to choose other options you may
want to choose this first option right
or if you don't know anything you just
need to click this download now' button
and you will be good to go ok so it's a
about you know 1gb of executable file
you can see the you know the memory it's
going to use on your computer it's
around eight thirty megabyte for this
visual studio compiler and for min ji w
compiler it's around 1gb ok so when you
download it it's going to take some time
to download so be patient and once your
QT executable is downloaded we are ready
to install it so I'm going to minimize
my browser and I'm going to go to the
location where I have downloaded my
executable file so this is the
executable file I have downloaded so I'm
going to just double click it and I'm
going to minimize this window explorer
here and it's going to start the QT
installation so the first
set up you will be able to see this kind
of interface here and you can see at the
time of making this video
QT 5.6 is the latest version but in your
case if you are seeing this video later
then this can change to something like
five point seven eight or something like
this
okay so just click Next here and in here
it will ask you to provide your email
and password or if you want to sign up
with your QT account but for now we
don't want this so we are going to skip
this step and I'm going to click this
button which says skip and then it's
going to just give you this option which
says welcome to open-source QT five
point six setup we are going to say next
and this will be the location where QT
will be installed so it's going to stall
at C colon slash QT / TT five point six
so if you don't have the good reason to
change it just leave it as default and
then click Next and these are the tools
which will come with your you know QT
setup which is QT 5 point 6 and the
other tools you can see these are the
other tools which are going to come with
your QT you know set up so here I'm
going to just say select all ok so it's
going to download this min GB version or
in your case if you are downloaded the
visual studio compiler then it's going
to show here Visual Studio 2015 or 16
something like this and then it's going
to come with QT canvas QT location and
QT quick controls QT 3d and other tools
for QT okay so select all here and then
click
next and then here you will be asked to
agree with the license terms and
conditions so you just need to choose
this option which says I agree and then
click Next and here you just need to
click Next once again and then you just
need to click install here now this is
going to take some time so you need to
be patient in order to you know this
process to compete because it's going to
take some time in my case whenever last
time I installed this QT framework on my
Windows operating system it took around
one hour okay so you need to be patient
for this process you can you know just
leave it in background and do your work
for some time
and once it's installed we are going to
see the next step okay so let it run for
some time so now after waiting for 30 to
40 minutes the QT setup has been done
and the Qt framework is installed on my
Windows operating system and now I can
see this kind of interface which says
launch QT creator I will leave it as
checked so that as soon as I click
finish it's going to launch the QT
creator IDE ok so just leave it as
checked and then click finish and it's
going to launch your QT creator IDE now
once this QT creator IDE will be
launched we are going to create and test
our 2d Creator by creating our first you
know any widget program or some C++
program so now we can see this QT
creator is open and we will test this QT
creator by creating some projects so to
create a project we will go to file here
and then go to new and in here for now I
am
going to just choose application and
then choose the widget application and
then I will click Choose and in here I'm
going to just gave the name of my
project for example test QT and the
default location here will be whatever
in your case in my case it's document
but you can change it to any other
location right I'm going to leave it as
default and click Next and you can see
here it's going to use desktop QT five
point six one zero mingw in my case but
in your case it may be Visual Studio
2015 or something okay so click Next and
it's going to create these kind of
classes and I'm going to leave them as
default and click Next and then I'm
going to click finish so it's going to
create me a sample
QT qui project and now to just to check
it I'm going to build it so to build it
you just need to right click and then
click this build option here and you
have one more option which is this
hammer kind of tool here or I can here
you can press this and build your
project so I'm going to just press this
which is going to build my project and
you can see the progress of your build
here in this progress bar so it when it
reaches green or when it becomes green
then your build is successful then you
can click this green button in order to
run your project so I'm going to just
click this green button and once it runs
then you know that QT is installed
successfully on your Windows operating
system so in my case it's running so I
know that QT is you know
stall successfully now in the next video
we are going to see how we can create
our first QT project step by step and
I'm going to explain each and every code
step by step so I'm going to explain
what is this main window or in your
source you can see our main door cpp or
you know file here and i'm going to
explain what is this queue application
and other you know options here okay so
we are going to see step-by-step how to
create our QT project so i hope you
