show you how you can install MongoDB
plug-in in your IntelliJ IDEA IDE now
hopefully you have already downloaded
and installed MongoDB on your Windows
operating system and you have also
configured the environment variables for
MongoDB so that you can run MongoDB
using command prompt okay if you don't
know how to install MongoDB on your
Windows operating system I will put the
link in the description and then you
will be able to see the video and
install ma would be beyond your Windows
operating system now once you have
installed MongoDB now open up your
IntelliJ IDEA IDE and in here we are
going to create a new project and this
will be a empty project because we don't
need any kind of project we just need to
open our IntelliJ IDEA IDE so just
choose the empty project and name
anything so for example Mongo test for
example right and then click finish I
was going to just open up your IntelliJ
IDEA IDE now in here we don't need to
choose anything so just click cancel
here and in here you will be able to see
this kind of interface now here go to
file so just click this file menu item
here and then go to settings so just
click settings here in the settings you
will be able to see this category called
plugins so go to plug-in here and in the
plug-in we want to search for MongoDB
plugins so just choose plug-in and you
will not be able to find plug-in here so
just search for Mongo here and you will
not be able to find any you know MongoDB
plug-in here but when you go to this
category which says browse repository so
just click this button which says browse
repository and in here just search for
Mongo ok and now you will be able to see
this Mongo login ok so just choose the
Mongo plug-in and then you will be able
to see on the right-hand side the
install button so you just need to click
install and then it's going to install
Mongo DB plug-in on your IntelliJ IDEA
IDE and then it's going to ask you to
restart your IntelliJ IDEA IDE so we are
going to just click this button after
installing which says restart IntelliJ
IDEA IDE so I'm going to click this
button which says restart IntelliJ IDEA
it's going to restart our IntelliJ IDEA
when I apply and click OK here ok so
just click restart and it's going to
restart our IntelliJ IDEA IDE and
hopefully we will be able to see our
mongo you know DB plug-in perspective
here so just wait for this to open now
in here you will not be able to see any
kind of Mongo Explorer when your
IntelliJ IDEA IDE restarts so what we
need to do is we need to click this
search icon here so just click this
search icon which will give you this
kind of you know search interface so in
here just search for Mongo ok so just
click this search button and it will
give you this search
you know Explorer and then in here
search for Mongo and you will be able to
see this tool window which is Mongo
Explorer so just click Mongo Explorer
here and it's going to you know give you
this kind of Mongo Explorer on the
right-hand side ok so now we have the
Mongo Explorer now we need to configure
MongoDB to this Mongo Explorer so in
here just click this button which says
Mongo settings and in the settings you
will be able to see the last option here
which says other settings so in the
other settings you will be able to see
Mongo servers okay so go to other
settings and then click Mongo servers
and in here it will ask you to provide
your Mongo executable ok so remember
when I told you to install a MongoDB
first in order to provide the executable
so once you have MongoDB installed in
your you know you Windows operating
system then you will be able to browse
for Mongo executable file so just click
this three dots here and you know
generally your Mongo DB exe you will be
able to find in your C directory and in
the C directly go to Program Files and
in the Program Files you will be able to
find this MongoDB which is this one
MongoDB folder and inside the MongoDB
folder you will be able to see server
and the version of MongoDB and in the
pen folder of MongoDB just expand this
bin folder here and in the bin folder
you will be able to see all these you
know executable files the one we are
interested in is this one which is Mongo
dot exe okay so just like this mambo dot
exe and click OK and then you can text
your you know MongoDB exe by clicking
this test button so just click this test
button and if you see this green you
know icon here then your test is
successful and MongoDB is successfully
you know configured on your IntelliJ
IDEA IDE right now what we need to do is
we just need to define a server so just
click this
Plus icon here and in here you just need
to give the label to your you know
server so for example I can just say
local host for example okay and by
default the server URL is already given
here which is the default URL and you
just need to leave everything as default
you just need to give the name and then
click OK
ok so once you click OK then you can
just click apply here and then click OK
here ok now once you have done this you
can just click this local host but first
of all you need to start your Mongo the
you know daemon in background so just
open your command prompt and then open
your command prompt from here and once
your command prompt is open we are going
to run our Mongo d dot exe file so
hopefully you have already configured
your Mongo D or an Mongo exe you know
environment variables so whenever you
run mom go d dot exe and press enter is
going to run this Mongo daemon in
background ok if you have recently you
know installed MongoDB in your Windows
operating system what you can do is you
can just copy the path wherever your
mock DB is so go to C directory and then
in here Program Files and here go to
MongoDB server and then 3.2 then in the
binary folder just copy this parts from
here and then once again open command
prompt and then just to CD and then
paste this path which you have copied
which is c program files MongoDB Server
3.2 bin and press enter and then from
here you can run this Mongo d dot exe
commands so just right mom go d dot exe
ok and press enter which is going to you
know start this Mongo D demon in
background once this demon is running in
background you can just select your
localhost and then just you can see your
databases are listed here whatever
databases are there in your you know dB
now in order to work with these
databases you need to open your you know
Mongo shell in order to you know
interact with these databases and
provide some command and querying the
databases right so the one option which
you can use here is this Mongo shell
option ok so just click this Mongo shell
and if it doesn't work then the second
option here is just open your terminal
which is on the bottom here so you will
be able to see terminal and to do here
right so just open terminal here and if
you have a MongoDB you know path
environment variable set then you can
run here Mongo come on so just write
Mongo here so just give Mongo dot exe or
you can just give Mongo command here and
press ENTER and it's going to open this
Mongo shell in the terminal ok so it's
going to open this Mongo shell in the
terminal so we can just query our
database for example DB and then press
ENTER it will give you the you know
current DB we are in or we you can just
give show DBS and press ENTER and it's
going to give you the list of all
babies which are there in your database
right so from this MongoDB shell you can
query your database or whatever you want
to do you can do with this database
right so let's create one DB here so to
create a DB you just need to use this
command which says use and your DB name
so for example you can give the DB okay
the DB name here okay and then press
ENTER and it's going to create this
database if it's not already present and
if this database is already present then
it will you know connect to this
database now in order to insert some
collection and some data in your
database
you just need to use this command which
says DB then you need to give the
collection name so for example my call
for my collection dot insert and in the
insert you just need to give the
brackets so you just need to give these
round brackets and in the round bracket
just give these two curly brackets and
the curly brackets you can give some
jason here so for example I'm going to
just give a simple jason for example
name and then colon some name so in the
double quotes mark for example okay and
I'm going to press ENTER which says
write result so it has written the
result for us and then when we refresh
this here there's going to show this DB
database here and it's going to show the
you know collection here right now in
order to query the database you just
need to use this command debby dot
collection name so collection name is my
co l and then you just need to give fine
and then plus enter and it's going to
show you whatever
the data or document you have inserted
into your collection right so in this
way you can configure and set up MongoDB
with your IntelliJ IDEA IDE I hope you
