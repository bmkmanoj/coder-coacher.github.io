video I will show you how to use
date/time picker with your c-sharp
application so first of all let's go to
the toolbox and take the time picker
from here and by default if you can see
and I will run the program and then show
you how it looks like so so it's loaded
now and I have the username and password
and now my second form is open so this
date time from here you can choose any
date and you can choose the year also
the month also from here so like this
you can choose month or death so so
anything you want you will be able to
choose so how to use this date time
picker with our application so in our
application if you are following this
video I have a database in MySQL in
which I am trying to insert the values
which I put in these text reach sorry so
and till now I have been entering
employee ID first name last name age and
gender now I want to save or enter the
employees date of birth so for that I
need a date time bigger to choose a date
of birth of
boy and whatever date of birth we select
that should go into the database when I
when I press the Save button so and the
other problem is I don't want this
format of the date so this is very long
form it and I don't want to use this
format so how can I change my format
according to my use and how can I
customize this date time picker
according to my project use I will show
you so first of all select this date
time picker and go to the properties
here and in here it has so many
properties and you can change the
default values and minimum date Maxim
date you can change if you want and the
most important property which you want
to change is this custom format so any a
whatever format I enter that will appear
or date will appear in that format here
it can show the time also but I don't
want the time with date so I'm skipping
that part so for example I want to show
the date in the format DT
mmm - so I want date month and you're
separated by these two - for date you
write small D for month you write
capital M double two times and for year
you can write y bi bi bi for the year
for example 1996 also something and just
go below here and in the format you need
to change or select this custom format
then only it will appear in your custom
format so change custom format here and
form it and select column yeah custom
iam sorry and when you look at the on
date/time bigger it looks like this so
it's really sleek and I can use it in my
application now so I will also take a
label and I me give it a text like I
will change its text as DOB for date of
birth so here I changed the text DOB
so here is my DOB and I can select the
date of birth but the problem is if you
are using my SQL specifically it takes
the date in certain form it so MySQL
takes the date in the format first year
than month and then the day but our form
it is not like that so I need to change
that form it from here so I will change
it one
again I will select this first and I
will change the format from him first
the year then the month and then the day
okay
so now it looks like this yeah they a
month and day so once you do that you
will be able to insert your date into
your database so now the coding path is
left so when I click this Save button
and when I select some date and some
data it should be saved in my database
so what I have done is I have created a
new column called DoD
date of birth in my database and here I
want to insert the date okay right now
everything is null because I just
created it so I want this and all the
other fields to be saved let's go to our
C sharp application and just double
click this Save button the Save button
code I have shown you in the sixth video
so if you don't remember this code you
can always go to see the sixth video and
you know what code I have written here
so in here till now I am inserting
employee ID name surname age and gender
now I want to add the date of birth here
so I will change just the query here I
will write insert into database dot
table name this will remain same I will
add one more column for the database
my column name is do be if you can see
the column name is TOB so I write TOB
there I get the OB so insert into
database and all the column plus your
DOB and then values and we are passing
all the values from the text boxes so
this was the code which are shown you in
sixth video so you have added date of
birth here
so you need to add the text value from
your date time picker in it also so go
to the last here in it in your query
when you are passing the values and give
comma give the single quote double quote
and plus Andy in here you will pass the
date which you are taking from the date
time picker so I will just select this
tape time picker and copy its name which
is date time picker and once again I
will go to save code and in here in
these plus sign I will pass this dot
your date time pick a name dot text
okay so I have taken the deed from the
date-time bigger and I'm passing into
the query okay so in the query I have
added here one more column and in the
values bracket I have added the date
from date time picker okay
and now the new run your application
let's try and run our application first
username and password and now I enter
any data so till now I will see I have
if you can see your 11 entries and I
will enter the 12 entry so well any name
and username and age is 34 for example
he is a male and his date of birth I
will choose from here so date of birth
is somewhere in the 80s every 18 so 14
February 1980 and when I select Save
button or when I click the Save button
my daughter is saved I can see the
message and when you see the database
when you refresh this database you see
till now we have 11 entries and when you
refresh this database we have one more
entry which is our 12th entry end date
is also added into the database ok and
in this way you can add the date into
the database using c-sharp application
and using the time picker if you enter
or if you change the format instead of
your day via month and date in here for
example you change the format of
date/time pick pick up to the month and
yeah let's see what error we face okay
oh wise so it's showing first the date
and the month and the year and now when
I run the program log in is correct and
I will and 14:30 any name and surname
age female and I select any date of
birth from him
and when I click this Save button I get
and ever say is saying that incorrect
date value here so MySQL always takes
the form its first year the month then
day so keep in mind that this is just
specifically holds true for MySQL
database okay so just change it here and
you will be good to do so in this way
you can use your date/time pick up and
insert the date into the database so I
hope you have enjoyed this video please
