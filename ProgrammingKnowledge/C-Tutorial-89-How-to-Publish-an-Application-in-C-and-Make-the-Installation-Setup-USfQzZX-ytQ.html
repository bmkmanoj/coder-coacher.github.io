video I will show you how to publish
your fully developed c-sharp application
not only c-sharp application but any
application which you have developed on
Visual Studio I will show you how to
publish that application and make a
setup for that so let's get started in
the last video I have shown you this
project in which you can enter any word
in this text box and when you press
search its search for the word in this
list and highlight it okay so I'm going
to use the same project for this
demonstration so first thing is you what
you can do is you can go to your
solution and go to this open folder in
Windows Explorer and you can go to the
project folder bin and debug and you
have this executable file and you can
use it but it's not recommended and it's
kind of unprofessional when you copy
this executable file to the other
computer maybe so your project may have
some dependencies like DLL file or
documentation file or other dependencies
and then you could not do this so I'm
going to show you other way of doing
this so the other way can be you just
right-click your project go to the
properties and you can go to this
publish tab and there is nothing right
now and now there is so you can go to
this publish tab
and if you want to publish your project
on some website or server or some file
path you can give it from here or you
can give the URL of the web website from
here so the other way is like this if
you have or if you want to publish your
application online then you can use this
and the last and the recommendation
setup which you can do is is like this
so you have the solution and a project
so just right-click your solution and go
to add new project and just go to this
setup and development in other project
type so when you see it you have this
other project type go to setup and
development and then go to visual studio
installer and we are going to make a
setup project and we can give our
application any name so I will give it
list box search setup
ok so I have given the name to my
application and by default
you will see that it's the same folder
in which your list box search other
project is there so you are creating
your project in the same solution that's
why this folder will be same as your
project and now click OK
and you will see something like this
okay so now go to your project this is
your setup project and you right-click
it and go to add and click project
output and here you can see a different
of options what you want to package for
example only the primary output you want
to package or debug symbols or source
code or documentation file you can
select them what you want to package in
your setup right now I just want this
output of my project so I am selecting
primary output and here you will see the
project for which you are making the
setup so a project name is list box
search project so make sure you select
this if you have multiple projects and
select primary output and click OK now
you can see primary output from search
takes list box search which is my
project now once you have done that you
can go to this build tab and you go to
batch build why we are going to the
batch build because we have two project
in one solution if you have only one
project then you could have gone to this
build solution and you could have gone
for build list box search set up
differently but together if you want to
build your application both project at
the same time just click this batch
build and you can select you want debug
build and release build all
so so I am selecting all force so it
will generate debug solution and the
release solution also for both of my
project my list box project and my setup
project okay once you have checked all
four things just click build and it will
build one by one all for project files
two for this debug and release and two
for this debug and release and then you
will see here build succeed that that
means of build is succeed
this build is successful now and once
again we go to our project folder or
solution folder they say this was our
solution folder and you will be able to
see this this box search setup which I
have created new and this was our old
project which contains our executable
file so what I will do is I will go in
this list box search setup folder which
I have created and the new project and
it contains debug and release folders so
you can go to this list box setup debug
folder also or you can go to release
folder I am going to this release folder
and I will double click it and I will
start the setup of my
application so it starts the setup
wizard as any installer will start and
you can just click Next and you can give
the folder location where you want to
install your application so you can I
want to install my application in
desktop for example so I will search for
desktop users and the desktop ok so I
want to install my setup executable file
on the desktop so I selected the desktop
and you can choose who will be able to
access this executable file
I click everyone and I will click Next
and it will ask you whether you want to
confirm or not so are we click Next and
you see here the installation of my
project starts so it will take maybe few
seconds depending upon the size of your
project so now you can see installation
complete and the list box search setup
has been successfully installed in my
system so if this is correct then I
should be able to open my list box
search project
on my desktop so I will go to my desktop
and you can see here list box search
this is my project and I will just
double click it and my project start
from here and I can just run my project
I want to search Australia and ice it
search and search the word
in the list so in this way you can make
a setup for your application and you can
publish your fully made c-sharp
application or more generally your fully
made Visual Studio application I hope
