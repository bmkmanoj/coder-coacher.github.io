video I will show you how to join two
reports in one PDF file so suppose I
have in my folder report and report one
these are two file when I take report
one it has the title hello void and when
I click the port 1 it has a title title
report and these two reports I want to
see what I want to join to make a one
PDF file out of them so how can I do
that I will show you today so just go to
your Java jframe and you can take one
new button for this purpose also and you
can write a code into your report action
perform also so I will not choose an
extra button to join these PDF I will
use this report but not only to join the
two reports so I will go to its event
action and action perform and at the top
of my action perform the protection
performed first of all I will write try
catch block
you can give exception in the catch
blocks so it's easy I'm going to do that
so this is my try catch block and in my
try catch block I will write e TF PDF
reader and this is variables so you have
to give some variable name I will name a
variable as report is equal to new copy
this PDF reader and paste it here and
close this and in here
you must write the name of your PDF
report file so my name of my report PDF
is report only so I will copy it and
paste it here dot PDF and my second
report name is report 1 so I will copy
the same code once again paste it here
name the second variable is report 1 and
this PDF name is report 1 after that I
will write the PDF
copy fields is equal to so this is the
third fine this is the third variable in
which we will come show our concatenated
PDF or joint PDF so I will name the
variable name as copy is equal to once
again copy this my new same and and in
here we must write new by output stream
and in bracket and double quotes and in
this double quote you can give the name
of the new PDF which will be made by
combining these two PDFs so I will name
it as joined join report not be native
and then write copy which is my this
variable named copy dot add
and document and
automatically why this variable name is
represented here and I will copy this
code once and paste it here once again
and I will copy this variable which is
report 1 and paste it here and then I
will close my copy copy dot close and
after that here you can show the message
also that my copy is made and some
message is shown
so message dialog and I will write the
copy copy saved so I know that my copy
is saved so this is the code to join
these two PDF in new PDF called joined
report and now I will test my code run
my code and and I for example like Press
report my copy is saved you can see it
here ok and report is saved this my
previous code so I would go to my folder
in which my source file and build file
are there my project folder and you can
see there is a file called JP II sorry
join the report PDF which is a new file
by joining the pure portion here you can
see this is first report and this is a
second put test report title is a second
report and this is a first report so two
reports are joined and saved into a new
file or PDF form so in this way you can
join two reports so I hope you have
learned something new today and please
rate comment and subscribe and you can
ask some question on my Facebook page
also so bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
