you how you can set up the C++
development environment on your atom
editor so I'm going to go step by step
so first of all I'm going to show you
how you can download the mingw compiler
we are going to see this demonstration
using mingw compiler and then i'm going
to show you how we can download an
install atom and then i'm going to show
you how you can integrate both of them
to develop your first C++ program so
first of all we are going to download
and install the mingw compiler so I'm
going to show you how you can download
it you just need to search for mingw
here and the first link which will
appear here will be from mingw dot o-r-g
and when you open that website it's
going to show you this kind of website
we just need to go to the Downloads tab
here so just click on the Downloads tab
and once you click on the Downloads tab
you will be redirected to the
sourceforge.net website which hosts the
mingw Exe file and then we are going to
just click on this green button which
says mingw get setup dot exe file so I'm
going to just click on this so now I can
see the download has been started and
already finished so I'm going to click
on this mingw get setup dot exe file and
I'm going to minimize the browser and
now you can see the mingw installer
manager setup tool has been started so
first of all we will just say install
and this is the default location where
mingw will be installed so I don't want
to change it so I will leave it as
default and say continue and then it's
going to start the download of the
Installer itself and then it's going to
ask us to install some packages so I'm
going to wait for some time until this
download is finished so once this step
is complete we will see this continue
button is activated so I'm going to
click
on this continuum button we're just
going to just start the mingw
installation manager okay it's going to
show us these options you can see here
it's going to show us these options and
these options are mint you have root
developer tool mingw 30 to base and then
GCC and GCC 14 GCC for g+ + which is for
c++ and other mingw related packages so
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right click on every package and I'm
going to say mark for installations so
one by one I'm going to just say mark
for installation for all the packages
and once you are done with this marking
for the check boxes you go to the
installation on the left hand top side
and then just say apply changes ok so
just say apply changes which is going to
start the installation of all these
packages ok so this may take some time
so you can see it's asking us to proceed
so it says ok to proceed we will say
apply is going to just start the
installation of all these packages so
now all the men GW packages are
installed and I can see this message
which says all changes were applied
successfully you may now close the
dialog so I'm going to just close this
dialog and you can see everything is
green in my case so I'm going to just
close this Installer also and just for
checking I will just open my folder
Explorer and here in the C directory I'm
going to just check where the mingw
directory is there or not so you can see
mingw directory is created for us right
so I'm going to just go inside this
directory and I'm going to go inside bin
folder inside this me min GW directory
and I'm going to copy this path and I'm
going to add it to my environment
variables so just
copy this part up to bin and then right
click on your Start button here and then
just search for system so just click on
system here and once this system window
opens you just need to go to advanced
system settings and then environment
variables and then just choose the path
environment variable in system variables
and then either double click on it or
just click Add it and then we are going
to add a new variable and then just
paste this path which is C colon
backslash mingw backslash R bin right
and I'm going to just click OK and then
ok and then ok and I'm going to close
this window
and then I'm going to minimize this
folder also now the next step is to
check whether mingw is working so I'm
going to just open my command prompt so
right click on your windows button once
again and then just click command prompt
and in here we are going to check the
version of g plus plus so just write G
plus plus minus minus version and then
press Enter which is going to give you
the version of C++ in our case we have
installed GCC version six point three
point zero minus one ok basically it's
six point three point zero so G plus
plus is working fine on our Windows
operating system now once you have the
mingw compiler installed and you have
set up the environment variable for
mingw now we are ready to install the
atom editor so just to open your
favorite browser and search for atom
editor and the first link which will
appear here will be from a Tamayo so i'm
going to click this link and once this
web site opens you will see the
Downloads button on the home page of
this website which is this button which
says download windows 64 installer I'm
going to just click on this button it's
going to download the executable file
for at am editor right so I'm going to
let it download it's about 132 megabyte
while so it will take one to two minutes
to download and once it's downloaded we
are going to see how to install it so
now this executable file is downloaded
on our system so I'm going to click on
this executable file and I'm going to
minimize the browser and now you can see
the installation has been started so you
don't need to do anything to install
automatic you just need to click on the
executable file and just wait for the
installation to be done and once the
installation is complete
otama data is going to launch
automatically and this is the first
message which you will see here I'm
going to say no for now and let me
maximize the item editor and now to
support C++ development what you need to
do is you need to click on this option
which says install a package you can
also press control-shift P to just open
this kind of interface and then you can
just say install packages and themes and
then you will see the same interface
okay so I either click on install
packages and themes from here or
otherwise you just need to click on the
install packages option on the Welcome
window ok so let me just close the other
windows here so this settings window
will be in the full screen so in the
install packages what you need to do is
you need to search for GPP compiler so
search for this spreadsheet package
which is called GPP compiler and it's
going to search for this package and you
can see this is the package which I am
talking about and you can see the
description it's for compile and run c
and c++ within adam ok and around 130
our downloads has been completed for
this package so i'm going to just click
on this install button which is going to
install this package on our atom editor
and once the installation is finished we
are going to write our first C++ code or
C code whatever you want to write and we
will compile it so just wait for the
installation to complete and now the
package is installed on our Ataman
heater so I'm going to just close this
settings window and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to open a new folder for
example so I'm going to just go here and
then I will just say open folder and now
I'm going to just create a new folder in
order to just open this folder inside
atom so I'm going to name it as cpp and
then I'm going to select this folder is
going to open this folder inside atom
and now to create a new C++ file I'm
going to right click here and then I'm
going to just choose the first often we
say new file and then I'm going to name
my file as main dot cpp or whatever you
want to name your file and then press
enter is going to create the main dot
CPP file okay so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to just write our first
C++ program on item editor so I'm going
to just say include io stream and then
I'm going to just write in mean and then
these parentheses and the curly bracket
and I'm going to return 0 here and then
I'm going to just print hello walls so
STD C out and then let's print hello
world and then I'm going to just add STD
and lines so en DL okay so this is our
very simple C++ program and once you
have finished writing your code what you
can do is you can either press f5 to
compile and run your code or you can
right-click on the same window of same
you know file so right-click on the file
and you will find this option which says
compile and run ok and the f6 of option
is to compile and debug so right now we
just want to compile and run our code so
we will choose this option which says
compile and run and if you want to debug
your code you can just choose the f6
option or compile and debug option and
then if everything works fine you will
see this kind of terminal and your
output will be shown here which is hello
world in my case right let's say there
is some mistake or there is some
compilation error in the code so this
doesn't exist right now
for example and I'm going to compile my
code what it says is the compilation
error so you can see E and DL is not
valid
you know code so I'm going to once again
correct my code and once again run the
code and it's going to you know run it
once again right and if you want to
debug your code you can just right-click
and you can choose this option which
says compile and debug or + f6 in your
case and you can see you will see this
kind of option which is for debugging
your code so this is a gdb command if
you are familiar with the gdb terminal
commands you can also debug your C++
code for any errors right so in this way
you can set up your atom editor for the
C and C++ development I hope you have
