video I will show you how to change some
of the properties of your forum so in
this video I am NOT going to show you
any code but I will show you how to
change the appearance and some
properties of the forum so just select
your forum and you will be able to see
in the property tab the properties of
your forum so first of all you can
change the title of your forum from this
text here so just change my app for
example and you will be able to see this
here now one more thing you can do is
you can change the icon for your forum
which is this icon you see here so lets
change the icon what you need to have
for this changing of this icon is you
need to have the ICO image for that
which is dot I see your image you can
find these images online just right or
in your search bar free icons and you
will be able to see so many icons online
for free so I will select this icon and
open this and you see here now my icon
is changed to my icon my customized icon
now one more thing you can do is you can
change the background image for this
form so I will just select my form and I
can go to this background image property
right now it's null I select this
property and I say import and I am more
import some image which I already have
and I say okay
and once you click OK you will be able
to see this image will be set as a black
background of your form so you can see
here this image is at the background now
what you can do is you can change the
property of this image also you can
change it to tile center or stretch or
zoom so what I will set the image of the
background image property as stretch so
it stretched to the whole form one more
thing you can do is you can change the
background color of your form from here
so for example I can change but since
there is a background picture so you
will not be able to see the background
color of the form now there are some
other properties for this form for
example let me see what properties you
can change or so go to this form border
style here so when you select this form
border style you will be able to see
different style you can set to your form
right now it's sizeable when you select
none then you will have no borders or no
cancel or no minimize maximize options
to your form when you select fixed
single you will have some different
format when you have picked 3d you have
so some other and when you have fixed to
window you have only this cancel button
but not maximize or minimize button or
sizable to window
then you have this standard but I like
this sizable so just I will leave this
sizable as default and you can customize
your form by playing the with these
properties so whatever design you want
with your form just choose it from here
and just apply it to your form so I hope
