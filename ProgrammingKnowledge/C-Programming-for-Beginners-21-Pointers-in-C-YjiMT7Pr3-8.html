tutorial on C programming for beginners
and in this video we are going to learn
what are pointers and how to use
pointers in C now some of you may think
that pointers is a very complicated
concept to understand but actually it's
not so if you can understand this
concept it will become really easy to
use pointers in C so first of all what
are pointers a pointer is a variable
whose value is the address of another
variable so once again what is a pointer
a pointer is our variable whose value is
the address of another variable okay now
you may ask what is the address of a
variable so in C whenever you declare a
variable for example variable X or
variable well is equal to whatever 30
right so whenever you declare a variable
in C C stores this variable at some
particular memory address in your
computer ok now in order to access this
value or access the address of this
variable where it's stored in your
computer memory you can just access this
address like this so for example you
want to print this address we can just
write printf and then we can write
address of Val is equal to percentage D
and then comma and then comes the
interesting part you use end symbol to
show the address of any variable so
whenever you use this end symbol before
any very well variable it will show the
address of the well variable right so we
have written something like this okay
but because address is a hexadecimal
value this percentage D will not work
here because percentage D we use to
print decimal values right and to print
hexadecimal values we use this okay
percentage X and this percentage x means
we want to print some hexadecimal values
in C okay so whenever you use and before
our variable name it will give you the
address of our variable and let us try
to run the program and let's see what it
prints and it prints 28 FF c1 you see 28
FF c1 and this means it's a hexadecimal
memory address in your computer where
this variable val is stored in your
computer okay now once again what is a
pointer pointer is a variable a simple
variable whose value is the address of
another variable and what is this we are
by using and before a variable we are
using or we are accessing the address of
a variable okay so a pointer can be
declared as this value also before that
and symbol now to declare a pointer and
see you just do something like this
so it has the datatype and then this
Asterix tells see that you want to
declare a point okay
so I declare a pointer point for example
P and I will just declare this pointer
like this so it's same as a variable
right but before if you write this
Asterix before this variable it becomes
a pointer now pointer is a variable
whose value is the address of another
variable okay and why I am stressing
this so now whenever you use this
pointer variable pointer P is equal to
its value can be the address of another
variable so this is our variable and the
address of variable is this one so each
value can be address of well okay and
whenever you assign this address to the
pointer you don't need to use s tricks
before it okay so at the time of
declaration only you just need to give
this s tricks okay and at that time of
assignment you don't need this add you
know as tricks before this variable now
this pointer has the address of this
value right now how can you access this
value 30 using this pointer
first of all let's try to print what is
in the pointer so once again we write
here and let us change the line from
here and here also and we will print
this pointer P so we can just write
value of
pointer variable okay now let us see
what is the value of this pointer
variable without this and symbol okay
basically this value and this value
should be same why because we have
assigned this address of a variable to
this point variable okay this and this
should print same values let's try to
run this it prints the same value to it
F f-18 and value of pointer variable s2
8f f-18 right so pointer just stores the
address of variables now in order to
access the values which is stored on
this address you use you can so you want
to access the value 30 for example using
this pointer so using this pointer you
want to access this value which is 30
but pointer only you know can store the
address of the variable so this variable
have the value of 30 and the address of
two 8ff something right now to access
the value of a address you use something
like this so value of for example
pointer pointer you can access it like
this by a Asterix before your pointer
okay
and this basically what it does is it so
this pointer contains the address and
whenever you add this edge Astrix before
this pointer it shows the value at that
address okay so let us try to run the
program and let us change
this percentage x2 percentage T because
we want to access this value which is an
integer 30 right run the program and now
it shows the value of pointer is 30
right so once again we will repeat what
you have learned so every variable in C
is stored in your computer at a
particular address and this address you
can access by adding this and symbol
before your variable now what is a
pointer a pointer is a variable whose
value is the address of another variable
right so you can declare pointers like
this by just adding a Asterix before
your variable name and the value of the
pointer so you can assign some value to
the pointer using the address of another
variable so this is our variable for
example you want to assign this variable
address to the pointer you just assign
it like this now to dereference this
pointer dereference means to get the
value which is stored at this address
which is hold by this pointer you use
this Asterix sign and this Asterix sign
before a pointer tells see that we want
to get the value of the address which is
stored in this pointer okay so do not
get confused and in the next video we
will learn more about pointers and other
stops in C so please keep watching and
