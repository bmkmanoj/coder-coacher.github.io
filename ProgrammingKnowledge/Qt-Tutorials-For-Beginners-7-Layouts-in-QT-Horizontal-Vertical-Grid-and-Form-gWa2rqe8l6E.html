cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video we will learn about layouts in
cutie GUI application now layout helps
you to optimize your space in your GUI
application so whatever available space
you have layout will help you to
optimize the space to the maximum
whenever you use one of the layout
provided by QT so what I have done is I
have created a simple project and I
named it as layouts demo and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to this
main window dot UI file here now to
demonstrate layouts first of all I want
to show you in this section you can see
there is our central widget inside our
main window and on the central widget
there is this icon some kind of you know
grid icon here and there is a red mark
here that means whenever you create your
Bui application for the first time it
doesn't have any default layout right so
this red mark here shows that there is
no layout selected for your GUI
application now in order to give any
layout to your GUI application you can
see there are some layouts here vertical
layouts horizontal layouts grid layout
and form layout right so these are the
four most basic layouts in QT you can
use now in order to provide a layout to
your main window you may want to you
know drag and drop for example one of
the layout in your window and you may
think that this will be my layout you
can see but it doesn't go this red mark
from here that means still there is no
layout for your application right
so the good way or the best way I'm
going to just revert this change and the
good way of you know adding a layout to
your main window is first of all
drag-and-drop any widget in your window
so you can see I have a push button here
and then right click on your main window
so right click on your main window and
then here you have some options to
choose so from here you can choose this
layout in grid or layout in form layout
or there is some more options like
layout horizontally or layout vertically
so we are going to see all of them one
by one first of all we can see the
simple layouts for example vertical or
horizontal layout so let's see the
horizontal layout first so just choose
this option which says layout
horizontally and what it's going to do
is it's going to you know as the name
suggests horizontal layout so whenever
you pick and place any other you know
widgets in your window they will be
layout in horizontal Menor day will be
stacked in the horizontal manner and as
soon as you apply your layout you can
see this red mark is gone here that
means you have some layout in your main
window now okay so now for example I
want to you know add more buttons here
they will be stacked horizontally right
now there are some properties here we
can use in order to optimize the space
here so just select all the buttons here
and for example you want all the button
to take all the space here right now you
can see you can go to this property of
all these button which says size policy
here right so in the size policy the
horizontal power
is minimum and the vertical policy is
fixed so vertical you know size of these
button are fixed so we can change the
size policy for example to the preferred
you can you know play with these options
of these policies I'm just going to
choose this one preferred and now you
can say see these buttons are taking you
know full space of our you know main
window for example now I'm going to just
save my code and run it so that we can
see in in action so whenever I run end
you will be able to see how they work so
this is our our window and when I resize
my window you can see all the button
sizes change it changes with my change
of size of this main window right so
these are this is the benefit of using a
layout in your GUI application so they
will help you to also optimize your
space and make your GUI more responsive
right of any size right now there are
some more layouts so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to revert all the
changes back by just pressing ctrl Z so
all the changes will be removed and you
can see now we are in the default stage
right so vertical layout as you may have
guessed it will help you to stack your
widget vertically so I'm going to remove
this vertical layout I'm going to take a
push button here and then I'm going to
right click on my main window and I will
choose layout and this time I'm going to
choose a layout vertically and I'm going
to pick and place some more push buttons
here right and then you can just select
all these buttons and change these
policy by the way you just can play with
these
you know properties here for the button
so that you can see how they behave when
you change these properties and I'm
going to change it to the preferred
policy once again I'm going to run my
application and let's see what happens
they will you know behave in the same
manner but this is a vertical layout
right so whenever you want to stack your
widget vertically you may want to use
vertical layout okay now I'm going to
once again revert my changes and this
time we are going to use the from layout
as the name suggests these kind of
layout are used to prepare any form for
example you have some labels and added
text and button you want to make some
form for example logging form or
registration form then you can use this
form layout so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just take some labels here
first of all I will take one label for
now and let me just implement this
layout first so right click on your form
go to layout and choose this layout
called layout in form layout okay so you
can see this is your form layout so you
have some labels I'm going to take some
labels here one two three and you can
change the name of this label for
example this is for some registration
form you can change the name it is for
example name surname for example and age
or you can add more fields here right
and you can use a line added these all
widget I'm going to explain in detail in
the later video what is line edit or
labels or other things but just for now
just be patient and I just want to
explain you how these are you know
layout works in QT so you can see I'm
picking and play
saying these line edits here so whenever
you want to make a form kind of layout
then form layout is the best for you so
you can just you know resize this and
then just save your code and run it and
this will become a form right so you see
here and whenever I change this this you
know added text resize itself
horizontally you can see right so this
is how your form layout works right so
I'm going to once again revert all the
changes here and now we are going to see
the grid layout okay so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to once again take
some push buttons here first of all one
and I'm going to apply the grid layout
so just go to layout and choose the grid
layout and now you can pick and place
your widget in the form of grids right
for example I want to do something like
this you can see there is a blue line at
the left-hand side so this will place
this button at the side of first button
right now you can pick and place some
more buttons here at the top like here
and here in the form of grids right and
then I'm going to choose all the button
something like this and for them all the
vertical policy is fixed so I'm going to
change it to preferred so they will take
whole space of our layout and then I'm
going to save it and run it so you can
see what happens when they are you know
executed so you can see these sizes are
change at runtime for the button okay
now for example I want to mix the layout
so I want to have layouts inside the
layout this is also possible so right
now my whole layout is grid layout and
now I want to have some button
or form layout inside this grid layout
so I will drag and drop a form layout
and for example I want it at the right
hand side so I will just pick in place
at the right hand side and you can see
the this form layout is here right so I
can resize it right and now what I can
do is I can you know make a form out of
them right so you can see whenever I
change this size of this form you can
see the form here so I'm going to just
pick in place really fast some line
edits in the form for example here and
the label for example so this is my
label inside the form so one label to
label and three label and also the line
added here and here okay
so you can see when I change the size of
my window these layouts and widgets are
automatically resized according to their
layout right so let's run our app and
let's see how they work so you can see
now this is like fitting automatically
okay you can once again add some more
layouts here for example now you want a
vertical layout here and just below your
form layout so you can also add this
here okay
so let's add it at the bottom and let's
add it for example here itself so what I
want to say is you can you know play
with these layouts and see how they
works and they could be really
beneficial whenever you are designing
your GUI application so always try to
use them whenever
you can so that your GUI application can
be interactive and responsive and it can
optimize all the space which you have in
your main window or any dialogue or any
other widget right so I hope you've
