how to use for loop with your visual
basic windows form application so what
is a for loop by name itself
we know that for loop is a kind of loop
and specifically we use for loop if we
know the number of iteration which we
want to execute for example if you want
to show a message ten times without
writing a code repeatedly ten times then
you can use for loop and the number of
iteration are fixed in the for loop
that's the main property of for loop so
let's get started I have taken a button
in my sample project so just drag and
drop a button and just change our text
as for loop and I double click this
button and first of all I will declare
our integer variable for example so I'll
write them I as integer okay and then I
will now write a for loop so I will
write for I
cleared just now is equal to the initial
value from which we are initializing our
integer which is 0-2 and the maximum
number of iteration you want to iterate
for example 10 and then hit enter and
you will see here it's automatically has
generated this next code for us so what
it will do is let me just initialize
this integer as 0 also so we don't have
any confusion in here so now for what
this for loop will do is it will start
with 0 and it'll execute the code which
is inside this for loop and then it sees
this next and it will increase this
integer by 1 and it will keep on looping
this code and executing this code which
we will write inside this for loop till
10 is reached right so let's see for
example I want to show the message so I
will write message box dot show and I
will write a message for example all
right I value is equal to and then I
will write this end sign and I will
write this I
okay and now when I run my program and
when I click this for loop it will show
first value of for loop which is zero
and then one two three four five six
seven eight nine and ten
so if you see when I just click it to
the twelfth time my message is not
repeating because we are outside our for
loop right so it goes from zero to ten
which are eleven values if we have
initialized this with one to ten then it
will go or it will execute this code ten
times right so in this way you can
execute any code in a loop and this
variable can be anything it can be X and
X and X or any variable but just
remember it's better to initialize this
integer or whatever variable you want to
loop because if you don't initialize
your loop then it will take a random
values and it will behave ambiguously so
just remember that you don't forget to
initialize this for loop so I hope you
have understood the basic concept behind
for loop and you will be able to use it
in your visual basic project hope you
have learned something new this time
