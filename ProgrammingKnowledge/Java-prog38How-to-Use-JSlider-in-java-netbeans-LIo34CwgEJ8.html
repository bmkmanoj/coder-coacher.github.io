gonna show you how to use J slider so
let's get started take go to your
palette first and take a slider from new
palette and place it into your key frame
this is called your J slider okay and
from here you can change its properties
like minimum value maximum value minimum
value I want to keep it on read maximum
for example I want to keep it 120 and
here you can take if you want ticks in
your panel in your slider and what is
the minimum spacing of your dick you can
also define here for example minor tick
spacing I want to take it as 5 and major
tick spacing I want to take it as for
example 20 so every 20 of points it will
show a bigger thick and every by point
it will show smaller ticks ok and you
can show the values also like this 0 20
40 50 if you take paint lab bills you
can show you're ever using if you want
to hit you don't want to show the values
here you can uncheck
also this is for ticks so if you ticket
me here takes welcome I want both and
okay so let's see how this slider looks
like it looks like this and now I will
show you how to make it function so for
example some value is given in some box
so it should move according to that so
how to do that first of all I will take
a text field in which I am going to
insert my value and we take a button
which I will perform my actions when I
test the button and whatever value is in
this text be this slider should move
accordingly
change some variable names so for
example I change X variable named X
Camden okay and yeah we limit us maybe
you can't switch over us go so do that
and then right click your ok button
event action an action performed so you
will go to your method method you have
to write and we can take any variable
name and take a dance value is equal to
integer dot class int
so we take it right integer dot parseint
and in in here copy the variable name of
your this text field so my variable name
is value underscore int and they stepped
inside the bracket dot get text so do
that and now copy your J slider variable
name so I will name it as slider one and
copy the variable name and I will paste
it here dot set text
set thing set value yeah so slider dot
sight value and you will use this so
right this slider dot that value and
inside this this valuable okay and now
we will try to run our program so this
is a program for example and I want I
have for example I write right in my
expediate go 200 so let's see it happens
or not yes it goes 200 once again I want
to enter 20 plus okay it goes to 2050 so
cable goes to 50 so like this you can
use your J slider for showing some
values for example you can show these
values pressure on temperature into your
text field and then just write those two
lines of code and this slide slider will
show these values for example and my
previous project when I click here these
value changes pressure one value changes
for example pressure one is four so here
in goes to 4 pressure 2 is 9 so my J
slider goes to 9 so like that you can
use your values
so that's it for today I hope you have
learned something new today and please
rate comment and subscribe and bye for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
