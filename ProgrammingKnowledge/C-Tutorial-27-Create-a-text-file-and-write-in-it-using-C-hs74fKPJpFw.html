video I will show you how to create a
text file and write some text in it so
for that I'm going to need a button by
clicking this button I want to I want to
create a text file so I will change the
text for this file create file you can
give any text as you want so this text
file when I click it should generate a
text file for me so just select it and
double click it and here write
streamwriter
and give some variable name I am giving
five is equal to new streamwriter
bracket and bracket closed and if you
see some error while writing this code
you need to include this using system
dot IO at the top of your code okay so
if you see some error then just add this
line and then in next line write file
dot right
break it down break it closed and in
here we will pass the string whatever we
want to write in the text file so I'll
write hi YouTube for example and then in
the next line write PI dot close bracket
and bracket close so this will create a
text file and this will be the content
of your text but in here you need to
pass your part and name of the text file
so for example I want to give the name
test dot test file dot txt to might a
text file instead of giving this name
like that you can also provide the path
like C desk top and like that but I want
to generate my text file where my exe
file for this project is placed so my
exe file will placed in my solution
Explorer so let's go to a solution
folder just go to sex solution Explorer
right click it and click open folder in
Windows Explorer and it will open your
project folder go there go inside this
and go to bin-debug
and in here you can see there is no text
file right now but when I execute the
program then the text file will be
created so let's try and run the program
run and I click this create file button
create file and my file will be created
let's see in the debug folder and you
see this new file called test file here
and when I open it it shows hello
YouTube or you if you want to add
multiple line in your code this is only
one line but if you want to add multiple
line then just copy it paste it two or
three times and after one line the next
line for the next line you will write /
r / M okay so just do that in every line
one two three and last line I don't want
to change the line so I am NOT tasting
it so just after your string completes
just add / r / n this will change the
line you are writing so now let's try
and run the program once again and I
press create file and when I go to my
folder it's there and when I open it you
see four lines of text there in
different lines otherwise if you don't
want to change your line just leave it
like
this and when you run the program then
create when you go to your test file you
see that the line is not change the text
is coming literally so in this way you
can use your text file to use it
anywhere else and that's it for this
video I think so please rate comment and
subscribe bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
