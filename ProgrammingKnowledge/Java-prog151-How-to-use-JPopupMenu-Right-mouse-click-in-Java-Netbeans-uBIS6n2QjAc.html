video I will show you how to use popup
menu with your NetBeans Java forms
application so what is a pop-up menu so
for example when you click on your IDE
right click your IDE and when you see
this ad from palette or change order or
these menu items this is a pop-up menu
so when you right click and whatever
menu you can see it's called a pop-up
menu so how you can add a pop-up menu
with your form in java using netbeans i
will show you so what you need to do is
just go to your palette here and drag a
pop-up menu from yours it's in swing
menus and take a pop-up menu and drag
and drop into your form once you drag
and drop this pop-up menu into your form
it will not show in your form but when
you see here on the left hand side you
will be able to see this in other
components this popup menu one is
created here okay so in your navigation
tab you will be able to see this pop-up
menu when you select this popup menu and
you can add some more menu items to this
popup menu so just right click it and go
to add from palette and click menu item
so you have added one menu item to the
pop-up menu you can add one more item
for example so now we have two pop-up
menu items so when you click this and
you can also change the property of this
these menus so for example you want to
change the name
all the menus just select this menu item
and you can change it from here right
just change the menu a name from here or
you can just select it and go to the
properties and change the text from here
for example I want to change the menu
item as close for first menu item and
for example second menu item I want to
change the text as exit okay so I have
two menu items and these are close and
exit you can change the name of these
items from here also and when you double
click it you go to the menu item action
perform event right so what you need to
do is for example you want to provide
the menu item for this form so select
the whole form from here and you need to
for example you want to give this menu
item a or show this menu item when you
right click your home so just select
your form right click it and go to event
and go to Mouse because when we click
our mouse right click our mouse we need
to show our pop-up menu and then in
Mouse section go to Mouse release this
is the action for right click so just
select Mouse release from here and click
it and you reach to the form Mouse
release event okay and in here you need
to write your code so this code will be
a same for every right click event so I
will show you what is the code
and in here you write your code so in
here just copy this J java.awt dot event
dot Mouse event and this object you need
to copy which is auto-generated okay so
just copy this and paste it there and
for example I will write if and in the
bracket this event just I will delete it
from here if this EVT dot is pop-up
trigger so if this proper pop-up is
triggered then we show our pop-up menu
so write the name of your popup menu in
your if condition if you want you can
give this bracket also and what is the
name of your popup menu
this is J popup menu one you can see
here so I will write here in the if
condition J popup menu one dot show and
in this show condition you give three
parameters first is the form in which
you are working so you can write this
here and then second argument will be
just copy this EVT object from here and
write dot get X and third argument right
once again EVT dot get Y ok so just you
need to write this code here and your
popup menu will appear when you
right-click your form so let's try and
run the program and see what how it
works
right-click it and run the program
and when I right-click my mouse when I
select this form here not these button
just select this form and right-click
your mouse and you will be able to see
this pop-up menu exit and closed right
but these menu item are not performing
anything right now because we haven't
provided any action perform method to
them
so let's provide the action perform
method to these menu items so just go to
your pop-up menu and select this first
menu item and because it's a closed menu
items of what we can write just
right-click itand event action perform
method you can go or you can just double
click it it's not working so I will go
in action perform event and okay and
when I write here this dot dispose not
disable but dot dispose so it will flows
the form right so this method we need to
give an action perform of menu item not
here so I will go here I will select my
menu item one and double click it and I
go to this J menu item action perform
method and here I will write this dot
dispose which will dispose my form okay
and one more thing you can do is you can
add an icon to your menu items this is a
menu item select your menu item because
this is a closed menu item so I want to
add a close icon to this menu item
selected go to the properties and search
here for icon here and just select this
icon just click this small button
from here and here you can import image
from here so just you can do this or
just import image and browse for your
image so I browse for the item icon or
button close and finish it this is the
icon for clothes and I will click OK and
now when I run the program and I will
right-click it you see here the pop-up
menu with the icon and disclose will
appear here and when I click this our
form will dispose because we have
written the code for disposing the form
when we click this close menu item and I
click it and it's gone or it this post
once again I will run it and I will
right click it you can see your menu
item and when I click it it's disposed
so in this way you can give a more
functionality to your pop-up menu like
this it's very easy to implement the
pop-up menu on your project and it looks
good on in your project and I hope you
