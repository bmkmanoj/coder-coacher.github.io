video I will be starting a new video
series on c-sharp in the first video
itself I will show you how to connect
your c-sharp application with MySQL
database so in this video I will show
you how to create a new project and how
to connect it with my SQL database but
the I want to make sure and I want to
tell you that this video series is not
just about connecting it with MySQL
database or database in the later videos
I will also show you how to use the
other component like text boxes and
tables jlist a sorry list box and other
things like sending mails and other
interesting stuff which are not related
to database also but I want to build a
application step by step in the first
step I want to make a login page for my
application and then I want to create
more stuff in my application so see the
video step by step and you will
understand what I'm talking about and
gradually you will see a fully
functioning app in front of you so first
of all if you don't have Visual Studio
you can download it for free from the
Visual Studio website just right bu
studio download and you will go you will
go to
the video Visual Studio Express Edition
and you can download the visuals studio
c-sharp Express Edition from visual from
Microsoft's softer website so if you
don't have Visual Studio you can
download it for T for trial version from
their website okay so I'm not showing
how to download it simple now in order
to connect your Wii U's eShop
application with MySQL you need to know
something about MySQL so I have also
provided tutorials on MySQL which you
can find on my channel programming
knowledge and just ghost fall below and
you can see my SQL tutorial for
beginners so click on that and just
first two or three videos if you see you
know what I'm talking about and in the
first video when you are downloading the
MySQL make sure these all options are
checked so the visual studio tool for
office and microsoft.net framework
basically whatever related to Microsoft
must be checked when you are installing
your MySQL workbench okay so in this way
it will automatically add a resource in
your Visual Studio which you can use
later so when you are downloading MySQL
just make sure this is
checked now creating a new app with your
C shop application
just open your visual studio and create
a new project click visual C++ and we
are going to make a windows form
application which is a GUI application
and I will name it as so was c-sharp app
for example and choose the directory
where ever you want to save your
application and click OK and it will
create a project for you so first of all
take a button from here and if you have
installed your MySQL correctly now I
will show you how to connect MySQL with
your c-sharp application so when I click
this button I want my connection to be
established with MySQL ok so
when you create your project go to your
solution for your project and click your
project from here in my case first
c-sharp app and I will right-click it
and I will sorry I will go to the
references here and I will right-click
this reference and I will click Add
references okay this will open a
reference add reference window in your
application go to dotnet and scroll
below till you find
it could search for it yes this one my
SQL the data plugin this will add a my
SQL the data got DLL in your project
which will help us to connect with your
C shop application just select it and
click OK and it will add a new resource
called MySQL dot data in your resources
in your project now we are ready to
write the code so just I will change the
text of my button and I will call it
connect my SQL for example
so I
created a button and I mean just when I
click this button my SQL database should
be connected with Massey shop now just
double click this connect button and you
will go to the event of this button but
before writing the event for this button
or the code for the connection with
MySQL we need to include some resources
here so just go at the top where you're
using system dot whatever is there and
in here you we need to add one more
resource which is this one and using
MySQL dot dot dot MySQL client ok this
is necessary for the connection so go at
the top and just add this and once again
I mean go to the forum and I will just
double click this so now in this I will
write the code for the connection ok so
this is the code for the connection with
your MySQL so in your button event just
make a try-catch block first so if you
have some exception it will catch and
show you the error and then first thing
you need to do is you need to declare a
string and name it according to yourself
in my case my SQL string MySQL is equal
to you need to define your connections
so right datasource is equal to
localhost so whenever you have installed
MySQL in your system you will see just
launch your MySQL workbench if you
followed my video and just click this
database and click query database and in
here you can see all properties of your
connections so your hostname is 127 dot
0.3 0.1 which is a whole localhost so
MySQL is connected to my local host the
port is 3 3 0 6 for my connection and my
username is root and my password is also
root in my case so whatever you have
defined your username and password just
remember that username and password and
remember these host name and port name
so in your code you will write data
source is equal to localhost because
this is connected to my local host you
can write this IP address also which is
a local host - and if it your mysql is
connected to some other server just add
the IP address of that okay and write it
here so no data source is equal to
localhost then write this semicolon what
is equal to three three zero six which
is I have shown in my square and
semicolon username is equal to root and
password is equal to root so just why
replace this username and password with
your username and password now in the
second line right MySQL connection give
a variable name in my case MySQL is
equal to new my skill connection and
pass this connection string variable
here okay in the next line write MySQL
adopter the variable name is MySQL and
opt is equal to new MySQL adopter write
this and then just copy this adapter and
paste it here dot select command is
equal to new MySQL command and in the
bracket just pass the query for your
database so I will pass a simple query
with my data base so what I have done is
I have made a database called database
and I have a table in here called II
data okay and I have some employee
ID name surname age username password
some data here if you followed my MySQL
business with you I have shown you how
to make this and so my database name is
database and my table name is key data I
will go to my port once again and I will
select I will pass a query select star
from database name got your table name
which I have shown you and then
semicolon and in this all in double
quotes comma Mike corn which is this
variable name I will pass here then I
will write MySQL command builder
variable name is CB is equal to MU MySQL
command builder and I will pass this
MySQL adopter in the brackets here and
then write Mike on dot open which is
this variable dot Open bracket and break
it closed and after that you don't meet
that so I will delete this then write
message box dot show and this will show
the message if your if you are connected
with the database so if you are
connected with the database it will show
connected message and then you just
close your connection so right michael
dot close and in the catch block right
catch exception e x and in the bracket
pass the message if there is some error
then we will pass message the show
exception dot message
so this is the code for the connection
with your database just if you want you
can pause the video and copy this code
okay just make sure you change this
according to your setting and ports and
username and password and you can you
pass a correct query in the database so
just copy this and when we run our code
it will present me a form and when I
click this connect my SQL it's connected
it will show me connected message that
means ma I am connected to the database
if I pass a wrong port number or
username and password let's see what
happens if I change the port number
which is not the actual port number here
3 3 0 6 if I pass a wrong connection
what happens then
so I just delete 0 from here and when I
run the program and when I click
connection connect my SQL
and it will take some time and it will
show unable to connect to any of the
specified MySQL hosts so if we throw us
the exception to us so that's why I have
taken try-catch below to catch any error
if present so that's the use of the try
catch block so just once again change
your settings so this is the code for
connecting the MySQL with your C shop
application in the coming video I will
show you many things about c-sharp which
are not related to database also in the
few videos I will go with the database
and then other videos I will show you
how to use other tools with your c-sharp
application so stay tuned
and please rate comment and subscribe
and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
