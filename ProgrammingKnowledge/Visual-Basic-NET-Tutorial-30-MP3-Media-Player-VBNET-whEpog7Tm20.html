last video I have shown you how to add a
window media player tool in your visual
basic windows form application and I
have also shown you how to load start
stop and pause the video in this video I
will show you how to make a simple mp3
player with the help of this window
media player tool so let's get started
first of all what time we'll do is I
will take a list box and drag and drop
into my form and I'm going to take a
button to load the list once again and I
will take a open file dialog to open and
select all the selected files so I will
drag and drop Open File dialog into my
form and we'll go here this was the Open
File dialog from the last video and this
is new Open File dialog which is opened
by File dialog to now I will change the
name of this button as load playlist
okay and now what I will do is I will
select my Open File dialog which I am
going to use and I will go to the
property and in here we'll search for
the property called multi select and
make this property as true okay so just
go to the property called multi select
and make it true now I will just select
my load play list button and double
click it and in here I will write the
code but first of all I want to declare
some global variable so I will just go
above my thumb and here I will declare
two arrays so I will write dim
damn part parts as string and this
bracket will tell this string is the
array so this is a string array I have
declared and once again I will copy this
and paste it here and instead of path I
will say why name
okay so I have declared two string
arrays and now I will go inside my body
click event and I will write if my Open
File dialog open file dialog - this time
dot show dialog equal to dialog result
dot okay then what I will do is in here
I will copy the path of the file and I
will copy the file name of the selected
paths so what I will do is I will copy
this path and paste it here and I will
say paths is equal to open file dialog -
which is my Open File dialog name dot
save file names with the last letter as
s so it's multiple files okay so it's
names and same I will do for file names
it will be good when I add here s
okay and once again I will copy file
names is equal to open file dialog - dot
file names with a large letter s okay
now I will declare a for loop
so I'll write for I is equal to 0 to my
file name length first first of all I
need to declare it as integer so I will
write as integer okay so to my file
names array dot length minus 1 so we
count all the file names and then what I
will do is I will add this these file
names to my list box so I will copy the
name of my list box and I will write
here dot items dot add inside the
bracket I will write file names and once
again a bracket and I will pass this I
here so what this code will do is I will
it will load all the files inside the
list box okay now we will go to this
form again and this time I will select
the list box and double click my list
box so just select your list box and
double click it and it will go to the
list box selected index change event and
in here I will copy the name of my
window media player tool which is
a X the window Mina player1 and paste it
here dot URL is equal two parts and in
the bracket I will write list box name
this box 1 dot selected index ok so this
is my code and what this will do is it
will play whatever song I will select
from the left box so let's see how it
works this is the whole code for the mp3
player so first of all I want to load
the playlist so I will keep it click
this button and let me search for the
music somewhere here and playlist
no I don't have it here and I have some
playlist here so I will select three
songs from here I can multi-select these
songs because I have checked the option
in the Open File dialog that I can
multi-select these songs and when I
click OK it will load all the songs in
here and when I click this button here
or when I click this first path it will
open the first playlist and you will of
of that nothing is acting because I
think I have done a little mistake
instead of this part this part should be
here and this file name should be here
so in the file name variable I'm going
to take the names of the file which will
give one which is given by this variable
and file name path is given by this
valuable so I have exchanged these two
things so just correct this declaration
and once again I will run the program
and I will load my playlist I can
multi-select it from here and now I can
see the names of my playlists and when I
click the first song it will play the
first song so I have muted this song and
when I select second song to play the
second song and when I select the third
song it will play this chord song so in
this way you can make a simple mp3
player with the help of your window
media player tool I hope you have
