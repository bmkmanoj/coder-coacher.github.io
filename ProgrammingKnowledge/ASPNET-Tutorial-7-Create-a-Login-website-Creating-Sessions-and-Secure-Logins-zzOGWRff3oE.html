last video I am showing you how to make
this login page and how to validate
username and password with respect to
your database using this login button in
this video I will talk something about
sessions and I will also show you how to
create a logout button and once the user
is logged in he will be redirected to a
new page for example a user page which
has the secured access when user have
entered a correct username and password
so let me start first and let me
illustrate what I mean to say I will
right click my project and I will say
add new item and I will say this page
will be my users page once a user is
login then he will have the access of
this page I will say add and in the
design
I will go to standard toolbox and I will
take a blade here and I will also take a
button this button is for logout okay so
let me drag and drop this so let me
change this label text first I will say
welcome and whatever your user so just I
will change the text and I can change
the label ID also if I will say label
welcome okay and therefore this button I
give the text as log out
and this button ID is button or B
underscore log out okay now once you
have done with that you are done with
that just click your log in button and
double click it and we read to the user
dot aspx dot c s file first we will
write the code in this page load event
so what we will write here if you
remember in the last video in the login
page so this was our login dot aspx and
when you double click this button I have
shown you how to validate your password
and once your password is correct we
were creating a session called new new
session you see here let me make it
bigger so we were creating the new
session if you don't remember just
follow the last video and you are good
to go now in the last video I was also
redirecting my users once he has
provided correct username and password
to the manager dot aspx because I
haven't created this user SPX page but
now I can write here users SPX so it
once the password is correct it will
user will be redirected to this page ok
so we have the session new from our
previous video so here you write if your
fashioned new is not equal to null so if
your session is not null
then what we will do is we will say
label and we label welcome this is the
idea of our label dot text is equal to
and whatever is there in the fashion so
we have the username in the session
right in the last video we have created
that so I will convert this session dot
or to the string and I will say I will
transfer this into the label and we
already have a welcome as our text here
in the label welcome and so we in the
user dot aspx we can just provide this
plus sign so it will say welcome
whatever the username is or else we will
redirect our user once again to the
login page ok so let me write redirect
response dot redirect and here we
redirect our user to login dot aspx ok
and in this logout button what I need to
do is I need to set this session is
equal to null so I will say session new
is equal to null and I will just
redirect my user to the login page once
again ok so just write this code and in
the last video I forgot to make a
hyperlink to the register page so for
example this will be your main page you
should have here a hyperlink to the
register for the new user
so I will select the cell and I will go
to the standard tool and I will say
hyperlink from here just drag and drop
or double click it and this hyperlink
text is I will change it as new user
register here ok now once again this
hyperlink we need to connect it with
some page so I will say navigate URL I
will go to the property called navigate
URL and I will select registration dot
aspx so that becomes our hyperlink now
once you are done with that let's set
our first page so whatever we want to
set our main page
just right-click that page so in our
case this is login page and set as start
page just click this so when now when
you run your program or your website I
will just click the screen button you
have this login page as your first page
right and once you click click this new
user register here you should be able to
register as a new user or otherwise in
the last page we can validate our
username and password username and my
password I will give and I will say
login and if login is correct it I am
redirected to the new page called users
page right and it says welcome and
whatever your user name is and there is
a logout button here also so I click it
and it I will be redirected to the login
page just see here so I am redirected to
the login page once again so I think our
login website is working now in the next
coming videos I will show you how
add some more functionality to the
website so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
