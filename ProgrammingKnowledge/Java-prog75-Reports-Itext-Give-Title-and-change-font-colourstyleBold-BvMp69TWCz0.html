video I will show you how to change the
font of your paragraphs words and how to
change the color of your words and how
you can make titles for example so
generally your title font is little bit
larger than your normal paragraphs so I
will change the font of this hello world
a little bit bigger and I will also
change the color of this hello world
paragraph so you can easily change the
font and color of your paragraph and you
can frame it as a title or the body of
your report so you will see what I am
doing at the end of this so be patient
so this is this is the code we have
written last time and in here is the
hello world so in after your document
dot open and document dot add new
paragraph and between hello words you
have to write or you have to provide
comma yeah
so after that gave the comma and then
quite fond one factory dot get a point
and in the brackets you must write once
again and like three
god
whatever font whatever the style you
want to add or whatever your size you
want in your PDF report you can choose
it from here so for now I'm using x bold
so this is the font type style you want
to write your sentence in and to that I
will provide the size of my font so for
example title is a little bit bigger so
I can provide want as 18 and after that
title is also bold so I will make my
title s bold letters so font not bold
comma now I will define the color of my
title so a right
comma is color dot so for example I want
to show my title red I have written that
so this is
the way you can change the font style
your font size your font you know you
want to show it in bold or normal and
you can also show how to change the
color of your font okay so this after
this for example you can also provide a
little line so you can differentiate
that this is your title so I will white
document which is the same document dot
add enter and in here I will write new
paragraph and in brackets maybe I will
provide some line so you can easily see
that this is my title I haven't provided
double quotes in between my lines
provide so let's see how are we put look
like now one thing I forgot to add yeah
after document dot close it's always
good to show some message that report is
saved so you know that my code has
executed so I will write J
in dot show message and in the show
message I will write null and in here
right they both saved so you will come
to know that my report is saved so now
we will try to run our program right
click and run file and I click my report
so you can see my report is saved my
this method is shown I click OK and I
will go to my project file where my
project is saved in NetBeans project
this is my project name and with the
source file this is my PDF report here
is my PDF report the same so I will
click it and you can see my hello world
color is change its font is changed and
it's stylus change and this is the small
line I added after my title so you can
do that and this can be your title so
that's it for this tutorial
in the next tutorial probably I will
show you how to add date into your
report in here for example and some more
things I will show you in some videos
after this so thanks for now and please
recommend and subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
