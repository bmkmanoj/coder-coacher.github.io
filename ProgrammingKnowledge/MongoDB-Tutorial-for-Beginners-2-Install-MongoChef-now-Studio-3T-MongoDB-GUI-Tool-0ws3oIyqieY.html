MongoDB tutorial for beginners in the
last video I have shown you how you can
download and install MongoDB on your
Windows operating system and I've also
given you the brief introduction of
MongoDB now in this video we will see
how we can set up the environment
variable for MongoDB so we don't need to
you know open this MongoDB from this bin
folder inside the MongoDB every time we
open the you know MongoDB from the shell
and I'm also going to show you how you
can download and install a graphical
tool so that it will be easier to
visualize you know data in the MongoDB
so first of all we will set up the
environment variable so what we need to
do is just search for system in your
Windows operating system and then in
here go to advanced system settings and
in here go to environment variables and
in here under system variables you just
need to go to the path variable and you
can either push this added button or
double click on this path variable now
be very careful you don't need to delete
anything here and at the last at the
very last you just need to give a
semicolon here so just give a semicolon
and then just copy the part of this
MongoDB bin folder okay so in my case
it's C colon slash program file slash
MongoDB slash server slash 3.2 slash bin
but it can be different for you so just
copy this part where your Mongo dot exe
and Mongo d dot exe file is there right
so copy this part and then after copying
this part just paste it after this
semicolon in the variable value okay so
just paste this part and then click OK
click OK and then once again click OK
and now just open your
terminal once again so right click on
your Start button and then open your
command prompt and now from this place
itself you can you know just get Mongo
DDOT exe command so for example Mongo
DDOT exc and then press enter
and now you can see it's waiting for the
connections so we are able to open this
Mongo daemon dot exe file from somewhere
else other than the bin folder right so
this is happening due to the setup of
the environment variable right now let's
download and install a graphical tool
which is called Mongo chef to visualize
the stuff so go to your favorite browser
and search for Mongo chef and search for
it and in here you will be able to see
this website which is 3 T dot io / Mongo
chef so you just need to click this and
this is a tool which you can download
for free if you are not using this tool
for the commercial purpose right so we
just want to use this tool for
visualization and it's not for
commercial use we just want to learn
from it right so I'm going to just click
free download and then it will lead you
to this page in here you just need to
give your email id your name and the
last name and the company are you can
you know give private or something like
this and from where you come to know
this Mongo chef and then after giving
every information you can click download
so I'm going to quickly do this and
click the download but now after giving
the information and clicking the
download button I can see all the
downloads I'm going to click this
download for Windows and I'm going to
save
this zip file okay so save it and once
this zip file is downloaded just go to
the location where this zip file is
downloaded in my case it's here and you
can just extract this file so you can
right click and then just click extract
here and it's going to extract this MSI
file from mangu chef so just double
click on this MSI file which is like an
installer and it's going to prepare for
installation and you just need to click
Next here and just agree with the
license terms and condition and click
Next and this will be the location where
this IDE will be installed or this tool
will be installed which is Mongo chef
just leave it as default and then click
Next and then click install and once
this mangu chef tool is installed on our
Windows operating system we can just
click this check box which will launch
this tool and then we can click finish
so it's going to launch Mongo chef and
you can see it will give you this
warning for what purpose we want to use
it we want to use it for non-commercial
use and we will confirm with the terms
and conditions and click OK and then
click OK and now this tool is open now
for using this mangu chef make sure that
your Mongo D dot exe is running in the
background on your command prompt right
so once again for example you just need
to open your command prompt here and you
just need to run Mongo d dot exe and
press ENTER and once this is waiting for
the connection we are ready to use this
Mongo chef ok so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to
go to this tool and I will go to the
file and I will click connect or I will
just click this button and then in here
you can see this new connection tab so
you just need to click new connection
and then give the name to your
connection for example you can give any
name to your connection for example
mongo test or something else and then
you can see the server name is localhost
in our case and this is the default port
on which MongoDB will work which is two
seven zero one seven okay so you can
just click Save here and then you can
click connect and now it's going to show
this local here and now what you need to
do is you just need to click Intel I
shall just click this button here and
it's going to open this kind of shell
and it's same as running your Mongo dot
exe shell right so whenever you give
some command here for example DB and
then we will run this command by
clicking this button which says execute
entire script or you can you know just
run this execute statement at cursor
right so we are going to click this
button and now you can see it says local
okay so this is the test database which
is already provided by the MongoDB to us
okay and now you can open this command
shell and I am going to maximize it and
you can see connection accepted from
this localhost and this port right so we
know that our Mongo chef tool is working
and from the next video we will create
some databases and we will learn more
about the
d be collections and documents okay
so stay tuned and please recommend
subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
