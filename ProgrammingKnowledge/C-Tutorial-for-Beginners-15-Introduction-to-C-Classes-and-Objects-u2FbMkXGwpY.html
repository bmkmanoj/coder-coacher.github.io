video I will teach you what is a class
and how you can declare classes and how
you can use classes in c-sharp so first
of all what is a class a class is a
collection of related data and method
which performs some tasks for example
you can create a class of book and you
can perform the tasks like print book or
you can have the variable in that class
like book ID book author or book name
and other example can be you can create
a class to know the volume of a box you
can declare length breaths and width of
the box and you can calculate the volume
of the book using a class so a class
contains a function of related data
right so when you use this classes it
helps you to visualize the complex
problem efficiently and effectively so
let's see how we can declare class in C
shop and how we can use them so for
example we have been seeing this code
from the starting and this is also a
class class which it has the keyword
class and we have the class name example
1 and we have the main method inside a
class which is a public record okay so
for creating a class you can just give
the name class which is a class keyword
which recognizes that it's a class and
then you give the name of the class so
name of the class generally you just
take it as a convention start
with our capital letter so for example I
have a class called box and then class
will start with and end with these curly
braces okay and whatever you write
inside these classes is the member
functions or member methods of end
member variables of this box class
okay so let's declare the member
variables in class so member variable
you can declare with access specifier
access specifier can be of three types
public private and protected for now we
are using public and public means you
can use the members of the class in
other classes also
okay so let's declare a public variable
I will write public double-height comma
length comma width okay
so I have declared three variables which
are public this is called the axis
specifier and we have made this public
access specifier and we have three
variables length height and width or we
can say length length breadth and height
okay and these are the three variables
here we have declared and suppose we
want to calculate the volume of this box
so we can declare a member method of the
class like this you can start the member
method like a method declaration we have
discussed earlier in the previous videos
you have X is specified which is public
and then you have the return type for
example this is returning double
okay and then you have the name of the
method which is volume okay and then you
have these curly braces where you can
write the code right and let's say this
method takes three parameter double
length comma the double double thread
and double hunt okay so now we can
calculate length volume of this box by
returning length or in bracket we can
write length multiplied by breath or
deployed by multiplied by height okay
so this will give you the volume of this
box okay
now this these are the member variables
and these are the member functions now
how can you use this class in your main
method which is in other class which is
the main class which we are using and
here we have the main function and we
want to call this class inside our main
function how we can do it this also you
know I think you just need to give the
name of the glass which is box
and then you give the instance or object
of the class instance and object are
used interchangeably so they are the
same thing okay so I for example I
declare box one is equal to new box okay
so this I have created the instance of
the class and how we can use it you can
just copy this box variable and you can
assign for example you want to assign
the value of length breadth and height
to what you can do it is you just use
box one dot length is equal to 45 for
example in a same bear box 1 dot breadth
is equal to 10 and box 1 dot height is
equal to 20 okay this is how you can
initialize values in the Box classes so
this L B and H belongs to this box class
right and whenever whenever you give
this dot by intelligence you can see all
the members of the class breadth height
and length and you can also see this
volume function you have created here
right now you want to calculate the
volume right so what we can do is we can
write console sorry
console dot write line and you can say
volume of box one is and in the
placeholder you can write 0 and you can
call this function
which is which you need to first take
the instance of this class right so just
take Fox one dot valium
it recognizes this automatically okay so
this volume is this volume and we are
calling this function from this box
instance we have created now we can pass
length comma breadth comma height okay
and this will return the volume of the
box one I will run this program and it
says this has error because I haven't
given the semicolon here so I will give
the semicolon and now I run the program
and you can see the volume of the box is
this right but generally it's for
example whenever you assign you already
assign these values to your length
breadth and height so you don't even
need these parameters right what you can
do is you can use these parameters to
calculate the volume of your box right
so how you can do it we have the same
per variable length breadth and height
and we are calling the same variable
here length breadth and height so you
don't even need to give the parameter
here and to recognize that this is let's
say I was taking this parameter so to
recognize that this L is this L or this
L is this L we need to use a keyword
called this
okay so otherwise this will not you will
not be able to recognize it it is little
bit confusing that what this L is this L
is this one or this L is this one right
so whenever you use this keyword this
dot your length this indicates that this
is a member of the class this is
entirely pointing to the class and now
you can definitely say that this dot L
is the member variable of the class and
not this one okay so just always try to
use this keyword whenever you use member
variables in your member method this dot
breath and X dot hide okay and now you
don't even need to give the parameters
your volume will be calculated using
these parameters okay because you have
initialized these parameters like this
and once again when you run the program
it will give you the same result now you
can create multiple instance of the
class so this is the one instance of a
class now suppose you want to click
calculate the volume of the box too what
you can do is just copy this code and
paste it down so and you need to give
the different name this will be box
- and I will just change this instance
of box one by a box - okay now you have
the box - instance and here you can
provide some other length breadth and
height so it's not that you can only
create one instance of a class you can
create multiple instance of a class and
each instance of a class will have its
own member variable in its own member
function so this have this all this
instance halls also have its own length
breadth and height and this instance box
- also have this length breadth and
height and volume okay and now when you
run the program it will give you the
result for both boxes box 1 and box 2
here should be box 2 so it will give you
a clear picture so it will give you the
volume of box 1 and box 2 so you can
create the instance of class to
calculate different different volumes of
the boxes right so this is one example
how you can declare a class what is this
access modifier and how you can use
classes in your main method right
I hope here understood the main basic
concept of classes in the next video
also I will continue with classes and I
will tell you something more about
classes so stay tuned and please rate
comment and subscribe and bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
