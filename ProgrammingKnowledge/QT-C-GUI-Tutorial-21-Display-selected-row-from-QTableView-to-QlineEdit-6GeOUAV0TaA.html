last video I have shown you how to show
the corresponding data when you select
some text in the combo box how to show
the corresponding data into a line adits
and we are connected to the SQLite
database so these values are from the
SQLite database these are the employee
IDs and when I select some employee ID
the corresponding data to the employee
ID la for example his name surname or
age which is there in the SQLite
database should appear here in this
video I will show you how to do the same
thing with this table view so for
example I select some cell in the table
and I want to show the corresponding
data for example I choose employee ID 3
2 then his name which is John and his
surname and his age should appear in
these text boxes okay so it's the code
is little bit different from the last
code because here we have multiple
indexes in the table so let's see how
key we can achieve our goal so I will
close my application first and this is
my table view I will right-click my
table view and I will select go to slots
and in here I will select this first
function call activated here and I will
select it and click OK and I reach to
this table view activated event and in
here I am going to use the code which I
have written in last time because it's
almost the same code which I am going to
use with little changes so if you don't
know how I have written this code just
watch the last video otherwise I explain
the code in this video so you don't have
to worry about this
so in the first line we will take the
index of the textbox or table so we will
transfer the index which we have
selected from the table view to the
string cue string variable so I will
write Q string and give it a variable
name for example well is equal to uij
then I will select my table view name
table view and then I will select the
model of that table model and then I
will select the data and here I will
pass the index of the table so just copy
this index from this function argument
and pass it here and then write not here
but after this bracket dot to string so
what this line of code will do is it
will take the index which we have
selected from the table view and it will
convert this index and take the value
from the index and transfer it into this
to string variable and then the rest of
the code will remain same so just I
declare the login class object to open
and close the connection then I will
check the connection if it's open and if
it's open then once again I open the
connection I prepare a query queue SQL
query variable and then I prepare in the
next line I will prepare a query so here
I am going to change a little bit this
query because the index of table can be
two-dimensional earlier in the case of
table
combobox the indexes were one dining
dimensional okay and here the indexes
are two-dimensional so you can choose
employee ID or the name or the surname
or anything in the table and it should
show the corresponding data in the line
edits so our query would be select star
star from your table name where your
column name is equal to this value which
we are taking from the table view so
select star from a table name where your
database column name is equal to the
value which we have here and then after
that we will write all you need to write
or condition and then whatever other
columns you want to show the values
corresponding to the other column for
example I want to show the value
according to the name or the surname or
the age so what I will do is or name is
equal to single code and double
quotation and plus plus and I will pass
the same value which we have taken from
the table view so here we are writing or
condition because we can choose we will
be able to choose from the name column
or name cell or the employee ID cell so
I will just copy this or condition to
time more or or and wear surname or the
age right age so we can now be able to
choose in the table view the employee
table column cell or the name to column
cell or the surname console or the age
column self okay so just change the
query like this select star from
where this first column and then past
the value which we are taking from the
table same as for the other columns and
then we execute the query and if it's
executed whatever value we are getting
we are transferring it to the line I did
this I have explained it in the last
video and once you are done with the
querying just close the connection with
the database or if your query is not
executed it will show the error so this
is the whole code I'm using you can just
pause and copy the code also and now I
will just build the program and run the
program once again and it's successful
username a password I load the data and
now whatever cell I select the
corresponding value should come here let
me open the database so we can verify so
I choose employee ID to sell so let's
see double-click it and here you can see
employee ID two corresponding data comes
here now for example I select name
column and this cell which has the name
Peter double-click it and the
corresponding data come here and I
select some cell in surname also and the
corresponding data comes here and the
age also so and the corresponding data
to the age also comes here so you can
choose any cell from name employee ID
surname and age column and the
corresponding data should be there in
these line edits so
this is the way you can achieve your
goal to show the values in the line
edits and that's it for this video

bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
