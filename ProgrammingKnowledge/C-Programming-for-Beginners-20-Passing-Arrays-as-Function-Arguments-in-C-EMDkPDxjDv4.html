tutorial on C programming for beginners
in the last two videos I have been
showing you what are arrays and how to
use arrays in C and I have also shown
you in the last video how we can use
multi-dimensional arrays in C now in
this video I am going to show you how
you can pass arrays as an argument of a
function so let's see how we can do it
so we are going to take an example for
example we want to calculate the sum of
elements of this array we have so this
array for example have six elements and
we want to add each and every element
and display the sum of every element
each and every element so what we want
to do basically is we want to just add
20 plus 30 plus 60 plus 50 plus 55 plus
30 and sum them up and show the result
of this summation using a function right
so first of all let's see what are
different ways of passing arrays as an
argument of our function so I will
declare a function void for example it's
not returning for example nothing and we
can say array sum is the name of my
function I just need to change my
keyboard cell things
yeah so array sum is the name of my
function and there are three different
ways basically you can pass arrays as an
argument of a function one is using a
pointer and just pointer you can just
give this star or ester X here and give
your array name o
funny or you can say my array right my
array okay so you can pass a pointer
array to your function but we haven't
learned about pointer till now so I will
skip this for now and in the future when
I will teach you how to use pointer in C
then we will see how we can pass this
kind of arrays in as in a function
argument so second way is to pass a
definite sized array for example I want
to get the sum of this array which has
the size six I can just declare the
array so my array X as an argument and
then I will give the size to my array as
six like this but there is one problem
with this is you can only pass array of
size six to this function so this will
kill the general functionality of a
function and the functionality of a
function should be it should be used in
different conditions and this is this
condition restrains the use of function
to the size six of an array right so in
order to you know get rid of this
restriction we can pass the array as
unsigned and sized array as an argument
like this so you just give the data type
the name of the array and in the square
bracket you don't pass any size and this
means you want to pass an array of
different size or unsigned array which
doesn't have any size okay or it can
have different sizes right and plus we
will
pass the size as an argument also okay
so we know the size of the array and the
array name from here now we can pass
different size array to a function like
this okay
now using this function I want to add
all the elements of the array okay and
let's return integer as a result and
because we want to calculate the sum we
will just declare a variable called sum
is equal to zero we will initialize it
by zero okay now we will use a for loop
just like this and what is say it's
doing is it will iterate over this array
in one by one and we will add the values
of the elements one by one to this sum
right so initial values of sum is zero
and it will add twenty thirty sixty one
by one to this sum right when we iterate
over this array
so this array declaration is something
like this for in the condition or in the
bracket we will initialize this variable
I is equal to zero and then we give the
condition here so I should be less than
the size of the array right because the
size of the array starts from zero so it
should be less than the size of the
array right so just pass this size
argument here okay I is less than this
size right this size and this size are
same and then we will increment the
value of I Y by one by like this
okay so just initialize I is equal to
zero I should be less than the size of
the array which is this one and then we
will increment the
five and what we basically do want to do
we want to just sum is equal to sum the
previous value of sum plus the array
name and the index at the moment which
is I right so this I will change in the
loop so first value of I is zero size
zero' of this array is 20 so the value
of my array at zero will be 20 when we
will pass this array as an argument to
this function okay we can simply write
this in different way like this so just
write sum plus is equal to just write
this my array okay and this is basically
same as this but this is more short form
of this expression okay and then we will
just return sum so once we have the sum
of all the elements of the array we will
just return the sum here as an integer
okay now in order to use this function
for example we have this array and we
want to calculate the sum of all these
elements we can use this like this so
let me just make it smaller so we can
see here so in here we will just call
this function so I will just declare in
teacher called array some right so this
will contain the result of this but this
and this are same so we will just change
the variable name some of
arrey for example right and what its
value is it's equal to the venue which
is returned by this function when we
pass the RA so this function takes to
augment the RA so over array is this one
my number array and the size of the
array right so the size of the array in
our case is 6 right now see this so it's
6 ok and it will calculate the sum of
the array and then we will print the
menu of the array so array sum is equal
to percentage D and comma this because
now this will return the sum of the
array so this value is assigned to some
of our is this variable and then we will
pass this here
okay now let's run the program and let's
see what is the result and it shows it
should be printf ok run the program it
shows array sum is equal to 245 right
let's check whether it's true or false
so I will just open the calculator from
here and we have first element is 20
plus 30 plus 60 plus 50 plus 55 plus 30
right
all these argument 20 30 60 50 55 30 and
the sum is 245 which is shown here as a
result so we know that it has
successfully calculated or our function
has successfully calculated the sum of
elements of this array now suppose this
you want to pass an array of size seven
here so I can just change the size and I
will add one more element to my array
for example it's hundreds so our
previous song was 245 and we will just
add 100 to it so it should be equal to
345 now right so and this now the size
of the array is 7 so you need to change
this also because this function takes
the size of the array so now the size is
7 right once again run the program and
it shows 3:45 bitches correct now if you
want to pass an array of size 8 and I
will add one more element of M for
example I will just add 100 once again
now 245 plus 100 plus 100 is equal to
445 right the array size is now 8 and
once again run the program and it so
shows 4:45 which is true right
so in this way you can use array or you
can use a function and pass array as an
argument of the function using C right
so I hope you have understood this
concept and I hope you have enjoyed this
