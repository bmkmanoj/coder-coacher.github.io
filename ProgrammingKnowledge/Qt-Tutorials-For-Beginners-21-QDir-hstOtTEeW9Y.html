cutie tutorial for beginners in this
video I'm going to show you how you can
use q dair class in QT so if you don't
know what is this class and how does
this class work there is a simple way of
you know getting the help so what you
can do here is you can just go to help
here and then search for Q dir right so
there are some options here you can see
there are some options like bookmarks
content index and search so I have
selected search here and I search for Q
dir okay and when I search for it it
will show me this kind of result the
first result here is this result right
so as you can see here you can you know
get the information about q dair class
so let's read what it says so Q dir
class provides access to directory
structure and their content so this is
the simple explanation of this class so
it provides the information about the
directory structure and their content
and if you want to read more about this
then you can you know use it as a help
and when you move down there are some
more examples here right so this is how
you can get examples and help from QT
creator now let's see how we can use it
so first of all what I have done is I've
created this simple project and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go to my
forms and choose this main window dot UI
and in here first of all I'm going to
take for example list box or list widget
okay this we have seen in the last video
so it's good time to use this widget
okay and let's say we want to use combo
box also okay
so let's use combo box and let's try to
use all these things and I will take a
push button also just search for
push button and drag and drop here okay
and then I will select all these three
things and provide them the vertical
layout by using this button so I'm going
to use this and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to provide to this main
window the layout some kind of late or
layout so I will right-click on this
main window and select layout and choose
this vertical layout here okay which
will give the layout so when I resize
this main window these widgets will be
resized also now I'm going to go to my
main window dot CPP file and first of
all to use this cue there class
obviously we need to include this header
so just include cue dir and then we are
ready to use it
so I'm going to go to the constructor
and first of all what I'm going to do is
how you can create an object of this cue
there so you just need to write Q dir
and then you can give the name of the
object and then in the constructor you
can actually set the path initial path
of the directory you want to you know
navigate into and the first thing here
in what you can do is you can check
whether some path exists or not so for
example there will be some path in your
you know computer for example C colon
slash which is a forward slash generally
windows if you are using Windows you may
want to use this backslash but it's a
reserved word or escape character in C++
so it's better to use this kind of /m
right and let's say some I'm one to
search for some random directory here
okay some kind of random directory which
doesn't exist and I want to check if it
exists or not so what I can do here is I
can for example say here if
then this dear object and then you can
just call a method called exists and it
will return your bool value so it will
tell you if this directory exists it
will return your true otherwise it will
return your false right so let's add our
queue message box also so that we can
use this and show it if the directory
exists or not true or false something
like this so queue message box here and
then I'm going to use this message box
as an information so I'm just going to
use it the information function from
here and first argument second argument
is the title and in this case we will
print true here because if the directory
exists it will return the true value
right else we can just uh print false
value something like this and you just
need to give the semicolon here and then
copy this and paste it here and instead
of true just write false here and then
then just run your program and let's see
what message it shows when it runs so
you see it shows false because this
directory doesn't exist so it shows
false and click OK and it will open your
main window after ok now for example
let's open this folder in which this
project is so I'm going to choose any
file here right click and I will just
say show in Explorer and then it will
give me this kind of you know folder
Explorer place where this project is
existing so I can just copy this part
and then paste it here and instead of
backslash I will just replace them by
forward slash something like this and
this directory obviously exists because
we have just copied the path from in
there
so let's see if it shows true or not so
and you can see here it shows true so
this directory exists right so you can
use it something like this to check if
the directory exists or not now the
second thing is here you can just
declare it something like this without
any constructor argument and I'm going
to just remove these things here and
let's say we want to display all the
drives which are present in your
computer for example C Drive d e f some
kind of drives you want the list of all
the drives so what you can do here is
for example you can use a property
called for each so there is a for each
in QT and this is same as far but what
it does is it iterates over all the
fields in array so you can just take
this dir and there is a function called
drives here so just call this function
called Drive and then you can see what
it does it returns the cue file info
list right and you can see it says
returns a list of the root directory of
the system so it will return the list
and form by using for each loop we can
you know go through one by one each of
the items of the list right and in here
you can initialize it by Q file info so
just write Q file info and then you can
use your combo box to show these drives
so you can just write UI and then call
the combo box and then call add item
something like this and then use this
variable var dot and then it will give
you some options we want to show the for
example absolute file path of this so V
you will use this option and then we can
run our
program and let's see what it returns or
if it's populating the combo box or not
so you can see the combo box is
populated and currently I have two
drives C and D right so it's showing
both the drives I can verify it by
opening my folder explorer you can see
there is C Drive and D Drive right so
it's listing all the drives there in the
combo box right now the second thing
what you can do is you can also print
all the files or and folders which are
present in certain directory so how we
can do it so once again let's declare
one more queue there you know object so
I'm just going to use this and I'm going
to just say it's q dair - or me okay
and I'm going to just use this for each
loop once again
and instead of q dair here I will use q
dair - and instead of using the drives
this time I want to use some other
method which is entry info list right so
just use this to get the all the you
know files inside the folder define
folder so which folder we want to you
know use here so in here you can just
define a folder location for example I
want to use C colon slash which is my
seed directory okay something like this
or even you can use your project folder
and list out all the files which are
present in your project so let's do this
this will be good for us so I'm going to
just copy this path and paste it here
and instead of backslash I will just
replace every backslash by forward slash
here and everything will be same here
right but instead of combobox let's use
a list widget this time so just use list
widget here and let's run our code and
let's see what happens when it
once so our project is running and you
can see here it has listed all the
folders and the files which exist in
your project directory so we have the
project folder which is a queue there
demo and then the root folder then the
files inside your project so main dot
cpp main window dot cpp and other files
here ok so in this way you can list all
the files and folders in your in your
list box right you can do one more thing
if you want to know whether this item is
file or directory what you can do so in
this case what we will do here is let's
say if just use if condition here
instead of this use if and then use VAR
if bar is a directory so just use is
there and this will return you if the
directory if this item is directory or
not right so if the directory if this is
a directory what you can do is you can
just right here d ir : and then + right
so it'll print is in front of directory
directory and if for example if this is
a file there is a function for that also
should just choose wore dot is file ok
so it will return you true if this item
is a file so i will just copy it paste
it here and instead of this i will just
say if it's file i will just add a file
as a prefix here okay so let's run our
code once again and let's see what
happens so you can see this is the
directory distance or directory and all
other our files ok
so you know which one is a directory and
which one is the file in our case now
there are many other things you can do
with this queue there class so let's go
to main
you and just click this button and then
go to slot and just select clicked click
ok and in here for example I will just
declare one more object for example cube
there itself and let's say I want to
check whether some directory exists or
not and if it doesn't exist I want to
create that directory so how do I do
this so I will choose the same path as
here so I will just copy this path from
here and paste it as a constructor and
let's say I want to just check if for
example some paths exist inside this
folder which is not even existing for
example yyy ok and I want to check if
this exists and if it doesn't exist I
want to create it so I will just check
it first there dot exists it will return
you true or false so if this exists this
path what I want to do is I would just
want to show some message for example I
will just use this queue message box and
then I will just say information and
then the argument some title and then I
will say dir exists ok or otherwise I'm
going to create it so in the else
condition just write else and not square
bracket here I want to use these curly
brackets and what I can do here is I can
create this directory so I will just say
dir and then you have some functions
here so for example mkdir for make
directory right or you have this path MK
path so this you can use when you want
to create some kind of path for example
you want to create inside this directory
some folder and then some other folder
and other
you know folder for something like this
so we are going to use this one which is
MK path and we want to create some paths
so for example this path itself we want
to create it if it doesn't exist right
and then give the semicolon here now
first of all let's see whether this
folder really exists inside our folder
or not so I'm going to just open my
project folder and you can see right now
there is no folder by this name bye bye
bye inside my folder right so I'm going
to just run my project and then once it
runs I want to check whether it creates
the folder or not so you can see this is
my folder and when I click this it will
create this folder here right empty
folder ok otherwise once it exists and
again I will just click this button push
button it will say there exists so it
already exists right so you can use you
know this help to see which are the
functions you can use and which are the
properties you can use in queue their
class and I'm sure you will find many
good things using this help section of
the QT creator so I hope you have
