last video I have shown you how to pass
parameters to your methods and how to
return values now in this video I am
going to show you how to pass parameters
by reference and how to pass parameters
by output and in addition I will also
show you how to pass arrays to your
method by using the keyword param so
let's get started till now we have seen
that how we can pass the parameters to
the method by value now for example I
have a simple method which is public
static void my function and I am passing
an integer to this method and I am just
assigning a value of 10 to this integer
which is my parameter okay now I am
calling this function here so what I am
doing is I am just declaring a another
integer Y in my main function and I
assign this integer integer variable a
value of zero and I will pass this
integer to my function which is this
here this parameter I am passing it as Y
and I want to see what is the value of y
now so I will just print this by using
console dot write line so what do you
think will be the value of y or what
will be the printed value here there
will it be 10 because what we are doing
is we are passing this integer here and
now the whatever integer we pass we
assign the value of 10 to this integer
or will it be 0 because it's initialized
as 0 Y is initialized as 0 so let's see
by running our program what is the
output
and the output is zero okay so now what
is the meaning of this the meaning of
this is because we are passing by values
so whenever you pass any parameters to
your function by value it will just copy
the value here and then so whenever you
pass this Y to here it's a it's a copy
of Y okay and not its address so
whenever you pass the copy of Y here and
this Y will now be X and X is equal to
10 but this value will remain the same
because it's this Y is a copy and not
the actual address which we are passing
so another way of passing a parameter to
a method is passed by reference and the
pass by reference means we are passing
the memory location of a variable in a
method right so let's see how we can use
reference here we just need to give this
keyword re F here and now you are
telling your method that take the
reference or the address of the variable
which you pass here and then assign to
that s address the value of 10 so it's
not a copy we are just taking the
address and assigning the new value to
the address and we are not just copying
the value to the copy right so as you
can see it's showing you the error here
but when you
use the key word here this reference in
front of why this error will go okay and
earlier our result was zero but now see
what happens I've run the program and
now the value is 10 so by passing by
reference you are passing the address of
your variable so whatever whatever is
the value is assigned to this will be
directly assigned to the address of the
variable you are passing and if you
don't use this reference you are passing
by value and it's just a copy you are
assigning to your variable and it will
not be assigned to the address of that
variable so this is passing by reference
now let's assume that for example I have
a function and this function name is my
carry which is my calculation and what
we want to do is we want to take the sum
and we want to take the product and we
want to print it ok so I will declare
two variables in x and y and I will
declare here another integer which is
add and which is the addition of x and
y's x plus y and i want to return this
ok so I will say return add write and
here it will be returning integer so I
will return here in I will remove this
and so
I will also declare two variables a red
and let's say a or let's say a is equal
to 45 comma P is equal to 67 okay and I
pass this a and B here a comma B okay
and this method name is changed now so
it's my calc and we will comment this
out and here comes the comma and this
will go so what this will do you already
know from the last videos that this will
add these two numbers and return the
addition of these two numbers and you
can just print it print the addition
here right like this and addition will
be printed so addition is 1 1 2 4 4567
now suppose you want the addition of two
numbers and the product of two numbers
or the subtraction of two numbers you
can only return one value by using this
return type right but how you can manage
if you want to results from a method for
example addition and a product there is
a keyword called out from which you can
you can access to output from a function
so let's see how we can use this out
parameter so in here what I am going to
do is
I will declare two more parameter or
will pass two more parameter and I will
say the third parameter is int sum and
the fourth parameter is int prod for
product right and then I will say sum is
equal to X plus y and product is equal
to X multiplied by Y okay and now I
don't want to return anything because
whenever you want to return to value you
can use the keyword out here so use
keyword out here and keyword out here
okay and now what this is doing is let
me change the return type because we are
not returning anything so we will write
void here okay so now what this method
is doing is we are passing two
parameters here and what it does is it
will take the addition of these two
numbers and save it into this third
variable and take the product of these
two number and save it into this product
variable and because of this out
parameter or out keyword this method
knows that this is the output we are
expecting okay so whenever you add the
out keyword here it will source Europe
your method we stole the values inside
these parameters and you can access
these parameters in the main function
okay so let's see how we can access
these two parameters so now our function
has four parameters right so we have
first and second number one and number
two and we want in some pair some
parameter which I will initialize as
zero and in product parameter which also
I initialize by zero okay and we are
passing a and B as a number so we are
already passing a and B and these sum
and product we cap we can pass it here
as a third variable and as a fourth
variable so now whatever is the
multiplication of your two numbers will
be stored here and here right and you
just need to use out keyword here also
while calling this function okay and
this error is called so what we are
doing here we are passing these two
numbers a and B and we are summing those
those two numbers save it into this
variable sum and pass it here as a third
parameter and we can access this some
parameter by another variable sum and
now this value is stored here and it's
same with the product we are calculating
product saving it here and we are
accessing it with our product variable
now for example I want to show the
result so I can say sum is equal to a
placeholder which is zero and product is
equal to placeholder which will be one
and some will pass over first argument
here
and product as second okay so now we can
output to parameter at the same time and
now when we run this program it shows
the sum of these two numbers is this and
product of these two numbers is this so
whenever you want to output more than
one value from a method you can use this
keyword out and you can store those
values in those parameter which you
initialize with this out keyword and
while calling just use this out once
again and you need one more parameter to
access this that value from your method
so you need every each parameter here
and now this value is stored here and
you can access it while you can print it
or you can use it into your code now how
you can pass an array to your method
that's next so to pass an array to an
method let's delete all this code here
and let's get all this code here also
and let's delete all the parameters here
and let's say this method is our array
method okay and we want to pass array to
the this method right so you can pass
array like this for example you want to
pass an array of strings so you can
write string and this two square
brackets and for examples you can name
it as names okay and what you want to do
is for example you want to print all
these names so I will
can use for each loop which I have
already discussed earlier in the last
videos and I can print this so I can say
but these curly braces I can say string
name in names and I can print it like
console dot write line and I can print
this name here okay and suppose I want
to show the size of the array also so I
can write console dot pipeline and I can
say array size is equal to and in place
holder we can pass this so like this
names dot length so this name dot length
will return the length of your array
which is the number of element in the
array now whenever you want to pass an
array to eat this to this method you can
do it like this and there is a keyword
called param param x' which will help
you to pass arrays to the method
efficiently so let's say that we are not
using param right now and we are just
passing it like this okay
so I will declare an array here first of
all so I have the array which is my
array and I have four parameters or four
values inside my array and the values
are for 0th index name one for one name
to name three and name for ok and I want
to pass this array here so for example I
don't want to pass anything to my method
and I will just use it like this
this is showing me the error right or
this wiggly line and this means that I
have to pass an array to this method but
whenever you use param keyword here so
you have added param keyword here you
can see here this week in line or error
is gone and you can even run in your
program and it shows array size zero
because your you are not passing any
array here so array size is zero and
it's not even showing any error and it's
not printing any name because you
haven't passed anything but it's not
showing any error right so by using
param you can you can pass your array
efficiently and it will if you even not
pass any argument here or any parameter
here do not show the error now suppose
we pass this array here which is my
array then then you run the program it
will print the names which will name one
two three and four it will also show the
array size which is four so we are
printing just the same right so by using
this keyword you can pass array
efficiently to your
method now there is one more way you can
pass parameters to this array or you can
pass a list over it to this method like
this so you can pass first name for
example n1 like this second name and 2
inside this here and third parameter and
3 for example and whenever you pass this
because of you are using this param
keyword here it will take these three
patterns as a list of array so this is
the value at index 1 value of at index
evaluates index 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and when you run
the program it will run fine and to even
print your names and it will even print
the size of the array so you can pass
your collection like this also whenever
you use this param
now there are some rules of choosing
theorems as a parameter in a method ok
so what is the rule you can only declare
other parameter for example int X before
this param parameter so this param
parameter should be the last parameter
in the method ok so you cannot do it
like this this is allowed but if you
want to do it like this you want to pass
parameter after your param parameter
this will not work and this is not
allowed ok so this is the first rule and
the second rule is you cannot pass to
parents in the same method suppose you
want to pass this one param and second
param like this which is with some other
parameter name
it's not allowed you can only pass one
param parameter in a method these are
the two rules you can say of using param
keyword so in this way you can use
reference parameters output parameters
and the parameters with keyword param
and you can pass array using this in
c-sharp
