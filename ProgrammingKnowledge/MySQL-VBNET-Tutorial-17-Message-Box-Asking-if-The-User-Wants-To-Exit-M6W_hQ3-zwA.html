show you how to show a message box
asking to the user really want to exit
the application when he clicks this
cancel button here so right now what
what happens generally is and I closed
the application by clicking this close
button I close the form and sometimes it
may happen that user unknowingly click
this button and suddenly his form is
cancelled now in this video I am going
to show you how to show a message box
asking a user really want to exit or not
and if he clicks YES on the message box
then only the application is exited
otherwise he will would stay on the
application and the form will not be
closed so let me show you what it looks
like when the application is complete so
first of all what you need to do is just
select your form as a whole so select
anywhere in on the form not any control
but just select the form as a whole
okay so just select the form and go to
the property properties here and select
this event button here this small button
called event and this will open all the
events which your form can perform right
so we are searching for the event called
form closing event so click this form
closing event and in here in this text
box of box just double click here and
once you double-click on the form
closing event you will reach to this
form to form closing event right and in
here we are going to write a code so
first of all just
declare a variable called dialogue as
dialog result and in the next line what
we are going to is it should be
dialogues not dialogue as and in next
line i will copy my dialogue variable
and i will paste it here and I will say
dialogue is equal to then write message
box dot show and in the bracket we are
going to pass three argument first is
the message you want to show on the
message box so I will right do you
really want to close the app okay and
then second argument will be the title
of your message box so you can give your
message box title as exit for example
and the third argument is the kind of
message box you want so we want message
box yes no okay
so just select message box yes no so
select this message box button near snow
so what this will do is it will show yes
and no button on your message box so
what we have written we have written
dialogue is equal to message box dot
show first argument of the message box
is the message you want to show second
argument is the title of the message box
and third argument is the kind of
message box button you want
okay now in the next line I will make a
if-else condition here so I will say if
your dialogue which is this variable
your dialogue is equal to dialog result
dot no then and once again we are going
to make else condition so we want
if-then-else condition and in this F
condition what you are going to write
here is just copy your Eve variable here
which is your system dot Windows dot
forms dot form closing event argument
okay so just copy this e from here and
paste it here in the F condition then
right dot cancel is equal to true okay
and if our that if we select message box
as no that nothing will happen else we
are going to exit the applications will
just write application dot exit thread
okay so this is the code which will ask
the user that if we really want to exit
or and if the user says yes the
application will be closed otherwise
nothing will happen right let's check
whether this code is working or not
so I give my username and password and
now at this position for example like
press this cancel button I should see my
message box so I can see my message box
which shows the message do you really
want to close the app and the title is
exit which we have given here and
showing yes and no button right and if I
press no button
nothing will happen the user will remain
on the form and the form will not be
closed and if the user selects yes then
our application is closed right so in
this way we can show the user if he is
sure that he wants to exit the
application then only the form is closed
otherwise even stay on the form so I
