last video I have shown you how to use
password box with your WPF c-sharp
application and when I run my program
now I can give any user name and when I
give the password it is replaced by a
character which is set by me so like
this and now I can log login or press
login and it will show me a message in
this video I will show you how to create
an open a second WPF window when you
logged in so what I want is when I login
when I press login and my username and
password is correct
then it should go to the next window and
if my username and password is not
correct then it will show me a regular
message so in this video I will show you
how to create a new window and I will
also show you how to jump or how to go
from one window to other other when your
password is correct user name and
password is correct so what you need to
do is just go to your project right like
your project and go to add add new new
item and you need to go here in WPF here
and select this window and I will leave
this window name as default which is
window 1 and I will just or I can change
this window name as second dot XAML so I
know that this is my second form okay so
just give the name which you want and
press add and we create a second axis
a malformed here now go to your first
forum once again because we want to open
a new window when I press this login
button and my username and password is
correct so just select this login button
and double click it and in here I have
written the code for login application
or login button event so if you don't
know how I write this code then you can
go to the video where I have shown you
how to make a login page and in that
video I have shown you how to write this
code so go where your condition is
wherever your message box is showing
user name and password is correct so I
want to go in this condition where my
username and password is correct
and I will make a little space here and
here I will write my code for opening
the second window so what I will write
here is the name of my XML file so my
x-fi XML file name is second so in here
in the condition I will write second and
I will give my form name so I will give
SEC second and is equal to once again
second and before this just write new
and just close this and then just copy
the second variable it's showing error
because I haven't provided this bracket
so just copy the second paste it here
and write dot show dialog
and bracket and bracket closed so you
just need to add these two lines when
your username and password is correct it
will take your command to this second
form and it will open this second form
so let's see how this code works so I
will run the program and first I will
enter a correct username and password
and when I click login it shows me the
message first that my username and
password is correct when I click here
ok it opens my second form right and
whenever I enter some username and
password which is not correct it will
give me the error that my username and
password is not correct
so here it's giving me the error or the
error message that username and password
is not correct and it's not opening the
second window so only in the case of the
correct username and password it will
open the second window username and
password is correct and it opens the
second window so in this way you can
open the second window with the help of
your WPF c-sharp application I hope you
