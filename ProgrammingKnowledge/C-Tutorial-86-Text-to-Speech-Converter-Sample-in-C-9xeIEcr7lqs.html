video I will show you how to convert
text to speech in your c-sharp using
windows form application so let us get
started let me make a new fresh project
for this so I will go to new project I
will select visual C++ windows form
application and I will name my project
speed maybe recognition and I create my
project in c-sharp once your project is
created just go to your solution
explorer and write like your project and
go to add references because for speech
recognition we need to add some
reference for speech recognition so
right-click your project and go to add
references and in here go to.net tab and
search for system dot speech in here and
just select this system dot speech and
click OK and now I will create my form
for speech recognition from text to
speech so I will take which text box
from here to here and drag and drop into
my form and I will take 4 buttons 1 2 3
&amp;amp; 4 and I will change text of these
buttons first button is for speaking so
I name this button else speak second is
for pause so I will name it as pause
third is for resuming if my speech is
paused so I will name my button as
resume and forth is for stop so forth
but name is stop okay so now my form
looks like this I have this rich text
box and I have four buttons one is speak
pause resume and stop now we will double
click my speak button here and I reach
to the code for speak button click event
but before that I need to include some
namespaces so in I will go at the top
here and I will write using system dot
speech and second is using
you thing
system dot speech dot synthesis okay now
once you have included these two
namespaces just go to your button click
event and at the top of your function
for button click event right speech
synthesizer and create an object for
that so Rheda
for example new speech synthesis and
break it and break it closed and in now
in your speech button click event right
if break it and break it closed and in
him just give the name of your rich text
box which is this rich text box whose
name is rich text box one double click
once again if my rich text box is not
equal to null rich text box dot text I
will write here so rich text box dot
text is not equal to null then in this F
condition what I will do is first I will
dispose the reader object if any process
is going on so I will write reader dot
this pose like it in like closed and
then I will create a new object reader
is equal to mu
speed synthesis speech synthesizer and
then I will write reader dot
speak asynchronous and what I need to
speak whatever is there in the Rajput
expo so just copy this rich text box one
text and pass it as an argument in
reader dots peak async and then if this
condition is true then my speaking
process will start else if my rich text
box is empty then I can show the message
message box not show what message I want
to show is
these enter some text post okay so I can
show this message if my reader or Treach
text box is empty so this is my speak
button code now I will make the code for
pause resume and stop so double click
this pause button first and in here I
will write F condition and in this
condition
alright reader is not equal to null then
I will go inside this condition and I
will create one more condition if
my
reader dot state is equal to
speaks speech not speech but
synthesizer Tate dot speaking so if my
reader state is speaking state then I
will pause my reader reader dot pause
bracket hombre click closed now for
resuming just go to the forum just
double click this resume button and in
here I will copy the code from my pause
button click event same code and paste
it here and I will change the state here
so this F condition will remain same if
reader is not equal to null and then I
will check the state if reader dot state
is equal to synthesizer state is dot
paused then I will resume so I will
write reader dot resume okay
and last the code for the stop action so
I will write if my reader is not equal
to null
then I will dispose my process reader
dot dispose and bracket indirect closed
now my program should work let's see if
it's work it works perfectly or not so I
will write something in the text box
hi YouTube
I am
back ok and let us try and run the
program I will press the speak button
poster ok so it is working and now let
me check the pause so my pause button is
all also working now I want to resume my
process or speaking so I will click
resume so it is also working let me
check the stop button also so my stop
button is also working so in this way
you can make a simple program for
converting your speech to not speech but
converting your text to speech and you
can improve this program to make a very
good looking project so just give some
effort and you will see the results so I
hope you loved watching this video
