is at the highest it has ever been and
if your plan has to foray into the IT
industry or in particular the testing
domain then this is the best time and on
that note I would like to congratulate
you all for enrolling into Enriquez
selenium training course
my name is Vardhan and i will be your
instructor for today so without wasting
any time let me go on and show you what
will be the topics that we will be
covering in today's selenium training so
I'll first start off today's session by
talking about the pain points of manual
testing why and what are the problems
and why we need to go for automation
testing right I will talk about the
advantages of automation testing and a
flood I will give you an introduction to
selenium and comparing with other tools
and tell you why selenium is the best
and what are the other tools in the
market that are actually out there and I
will then conclude today's session with
probably the best part where I will be
showing you a demonstration of selenium
webdriver in action right that's one of
the best testing tools out there and
I'll be showing you a demonstration of
that and I can see that there are a
couple of people in the session I can
see Rakesh I can see Dee Roger I can see
up here there so guys give me a heads up
if it's all cool and we can start with
the session all right
so yeah I have a thumbs up from everyone
so perfect let me go and get started
with the first topic and that is what
are the pain points of manual testing
now for that let's presume this scenario
where you know what you have is Alex
what do you see in front of you is Alex
on the screen okay and she is a tester
and now she's a manual tester and let's
see what happens in her day to day tasks
so as a manual tester you might have to
probably write the test cases from
scratch which you will have to do even
if you're an automation tester okay so
nothing wrong there but then the problem
is the test cases that you write you
will have to execute them manually one
after the other and in case you have
thousands this cases in your pipeline
for your probably which tests your
company's website right probably
thousand test cases then you have to
execute each and every test case
manually on your own one after the other
if you have to execute thousand this
case is now the biggest problem is you
cannot execute that money easily right
in a day you can probably execute for
free 260 I would say that's the maximum
you can and if it's that number then it
would take you almost 10 days to
complete the execution of just these
thousand test cases right now that's
insane
you cannot offer so much of time given
to such a minut task right you cannot do
that and also you'll have to analyze the
past or the failed status is manually of
every test case and note it down and
make sure there is no error or
discrepancies in data you should do that
manually correct now those are again the
challenges but besides that you will
have to debug your errors if you find
any right but that again is not a
challenge with just manual testing but
anyways it's still a challenge right
humans are error-prone these are the
challenges with manual testing what
happens for someone like Alice was
working in the industry but if the same
alice is a tester but an automation test
of this time if she's using tools like
selenium then yeah she'll be writing the
test cases from scratch but what comes
next is that the 10-day task is suddenly
an overnight task right and it's not
even your task because you read it on
automation once and then every test case
we get executed on its own that's why
it's called automation testing if you
have thousand test cases then probably
before you leave home at 8 p.m. in the
night that time you can start the
execution of the test script and if you
just run that particular or test suite
right then your job is sorted so all
your test cases you can call it through
your test feed you can put in one test
suite and execute it all together and
you don't have to intervene after that
just put it on test and wait for the
result so you can do it in the night
before you go home and then in the
morning when you come back to office you
can just check off your test cases
passed or failed or know where your bug
is what could be made better all these
things you can analyze in a very nice
way and you can analyze in a very comfy
way because the report that gets
generated is again automatic so you get
it generated through a selenium or test
energy which is used with selenium and
you will get the results and it'll be in
a very nice way in a very structured way
that you'll not have problems reading it
or understanding your data right but of
course you'll have to spend time for
debugging errors now the difference that
you see here it's a very small task
right execution but see how much time it
takes
you can finish probably a fortnight's
task overnight and that's amazing if you
can reduce the time for testing by that
number correct so that's one of the
advantages with automation testing now
let me just talk a little more about the
advantages of automation testing and let
me talk about the other points here the
first point is that it yes it saves time
I just told you that second it reduces
the cost to company now when we say cost
to company then they will have to spend
10 days right they'll have to pay people
for 10 days vocal tool for 10 days so
there's a delay there and that is a cost
to a company in one way or the other and
if you can reduce so much to so little
time then you are doing amazing business
I mean you're running the business in a
very nice way that's a very good thing
for you and of course it's more accurate
right selenium or any testing tool for
that matter the results that you get is
pretty accurate at least more accurate
than manual testing because yes humans
tend to make errors right they are error
prone so sometimes it might just happen
that they have written something wrong
and something wrong comes up so that's
one point of course an exponent is you
have quality in your reports also in the
reports that get generated automatically
even they you know are in a very
structured way which you can easily
understand there are pretty much no
errors like I told you and the best part
is they are repeatable and you won't
have any problem doing that if you
repeated from scratch the same thing
cannot be said for manual testing right
so those were the advantages and that's
how Alice is having a very nice time as
an automation tester in the market and
that's why you need to go for automation
testing right so guys what do you agree
with me anybody in the session who
thinks that they do not need to go for
automation testing a bear okay so no one
no one right very good so I'm getting
good responses now let me go ahead then
and talk about how selenium compares
with other tools because before I talk
about what exactly selenium and before I
give you an introduction to selenium in
itself I will let you compare it with
three other tools in the market okay and
those three tools are HP's qdp IBM's rft
and testcomplete right now these three
are probably selenium biggest
competitors and let's see how they fare
head-on-head
so first and foremost if you want to use
the tool you gotta have a license right
you should be able to download it and
use it with qtp RFD and testcomplete you
need a license you have to pay for that
license you don't have you cannot use it
for free that may be companies can
afford to use this but individual
developers aspiring programmers they
cannot use it so if you are an
individual who is learning selenium you
can do it because selenium is
open-source part of your learning other
tools then you wouldn't be able to do
that okay second point is the cost qdp
RFP and testcomplete are of course
costly because they are proprietary
tools but selenium is free open-source
so two points for selenium over there
okay now moving on to the third point
that is customer support yeah q DP and
rft and test compete fab better because
they're a proprietary tool they have a
dedicated customer support and then in
selenium yes you again have a customer
support but that's from an open source
community and because it's from open
source community it's not gonna be as
quick or as efficient as your dedicated
customer support right so that's one
drawback but don't worry there's a huge
developer community out there that will
help you okay and talks about the coding
skills for qdp and rft it's not that
much needed that you need to be a
programmer okay as testcomplete is a
little important because testcomplete is
is all like selenium where it
tests basically web applications right
so for testing the web applications you
need some skills for test country this
is a high bar for selenium it's a little
more okay and then speaking of
environment support qtp and RFD work
only on Windows and the same with
testcomplete also but test complete
again is limited to these versions like
salmon Vista Server 2008 or any of the
later operating systems okay that's just
complete for you but selenium works on
all three of major platforms Windows
Linux and Mac and that's a big big
advantage because all the FreeBSD your
users out there all the folks are belong
to that category then you're gonna have
a nice time because you can use selenium
on your Linux also because there are a
lot of people out there who are working
on your Linux right so if you work for a
start-up and you plan to implement
selenium over there then you might be
given lonex machines on which you have
to work with selenium and of course
Linux is the tool to grow with right as
technical people Linux is the platform
after you so one more point for selenium
over there right and the I would say the
biggest advantage that selenium gains is
that it cannot pract
different programming backgrounds so
look at qdp for example qdp you have to
have VB script skill so people are
limited there right same thing with a
Java and c-sharp if you're from these
two backgrounds only you can work on rft
right but see with testcomplete
you have a few more options you have VB
script you have JavaScript
Delfy script C++ and C sharp okay but
with selenium you have a better set of
options right you have Java and Python
two of the biggest programming languages
in today's market and then you have C
sharp Perl PHP and Ruby right so if you
are programmers and if you are Rob
developers or chorus from these
backgrounds then you can definitely
start a career in selenium right so
that's what you can do that's why I
would say selenium is the best over
there so any of you have any doubts here
at this time anybody in the session
okay so you have a very valid question
here so Abhijit is asking me if selenium
is so advantageous why are there even
other tools in the market because they
will not be of any challenge against our
selenium well objet the thing is
selenium yes it's free and it's
advantageous but there are certain
drawbacks also like for instance
selenium cannot test desktop
applications okay
it can only test of web applications and
that's where qtp and rft dominate the
market for desktop applications if you
want to test the software then that's
where their business comes in desk are
made for you can be used for everything
for both
so that's test completes our USP and
with selenium yeah that's what you know
but still selenium is the most
dominating tool in the market all right
so let me go to the next slide then so
like promise now let's talk about a
selenium in particular so how it fails
as an automation testing tool and what
it has to offer first of all you have to
remember that a selenium is a tool to
automate web applications and web
applications only web pages or web
applications we can call it either of
these and it should be these across
different platforms using different
programming languages so first of all
selenium is a tool to automate web pages
or applications okay
the key point notice it's a tool to
automate only web pages or web
applications and these tests across
different platforms using different
programming languages now what this
means is I can use any of the platforms
like Windows or Mac or Linux and I can
write my code in one of those six
programming languages that I spoke about
earlier and you can run your tests so we
can leverage selenium for testing that
particular web page and of course it's
open source and mainly used for
functional testing because functional
testing is probably the most common type
of for testing everyone has to do
testing and they have to follow
functional testing and selenium is known
for its reliable performance and
execution speed because it's been in the
market for quite some time ok it's been
more than 10 years as selenium has been
in the market and it has a huge google
bagged apache bag to develop a community
that works on developing selenium right
so you have a number of versions and
yeah it's pretty impressive to say the
and I would say it's the best tool for
testing web applications that's my
opinion and according to a lot of people
I may be wrong but yeah this is my take
and that is a reason why selenium has
the biggest share in the market okay
that's about selenium
now here I'm just gonna summarize a
couple of points I spoke about earlier
if you guys don't listen then listen up
closely programming languages like Java
Python Perl PHP Ruby C shot all these
programming languages can be used to
write your selenium code and test your
web page through selenium okay all these
programming languages so if you are from
any of these backgrounds then you have a
chance to start a career and selenium
right away okay no hesitations
whatsoever and then speaking of
operating systems you can use one of
ways and Windows or Mac or liners okay
so even for testing Android applications
you have a PM which is a pretty similar
to selenium okay but it's nowhere the
same and of course all the operating
systems you will be using the browsers
right so you can use any of the popular
browsers like Internet Explorer Firefox
Google Chrome and opera safari and
probably more right you can use all
these browsers and yeah that's the big
benefit I would say no dependency is no
hesitation is nothing but like the
stories always never complete like that
we have disadvantage is also in selenium
right so that's what we're gonna see
here let's first see the advantages let
me summarize those advantages first is
it's open source and easy to set up
it supports various operating systems
and I can just use one of them right
even if I have been those what if I have
Linux I have no hesitation I can use it
straight away and then it supports
various programming environments
absolutely announced when we say
environments it's is the programming
languages on which you can use to code
we have comfort there and it supports
parallel test execution that means that
you can use you can run multiple tests
simultaneously in the same machine or in
a cluster of machines so you have that
advantage with selenium okay but some of
the disadvantages are that there is
limited support for image testing or for
desktop testing for testing your desktop
applications there's a no-go but if you
want to test images on your web pages or
your websites then yes you have limited
support to
you don't have complete support it's not
very easy you can use security for doing
that and then speaking of the other
thing is it supports only web
applications and it takes a lot of time
to create your test scripts because a
lot of programming skills is needed over
here and it's a little tough task to
learn selenium and start off with
selenium first right so those are your
challenges but as long as you are
interested in the learning it it's gonna
be easy for you okay so worried not so
now that you know about the advantages
and disadvantages let me talk about the
competence in the selenium suite of
tools so we have a suite of selenium
tools and we have IDE we have grid we
have our C and we have webdriver okay
these are the four popular flavors of
selenium you can say so selenium IDE is
the tool which is basically used to
record your interactions that you have
on your web browser okay so whatever
interactions you have that can be
recorded as a test case and then it can
be later modified or replayed again to
perform that same test okay so that's
how IDE works it does not have a
programming interface it's a plugin
which is used and you'll have to record
your actions that you do which website
you go to war you perform you have to
record it and then later you can replay
it okay you can playback that particular
recording okay so and then you have
selenium RC so RC was the earlier
version of webdriver where you can
programmatically create your test
scripts okay that's how selenium started
that is the first flavor of selenium and
you can program your code but then RC
has a lot of disadvantages the biggest
disadvantage being that it's pretty slow
okay and it's little tough to execute it
because of various protocol reasons and
then came a selenium webdriver
okay so webdriver which we use nowadays
is their flagship tool okay and you can
write your test scripts manually you
have to do it manually and you should
use your programming skills to write
your test cases on different languages
maybe and you'll be dealing with a lot
of libraries a lot of functions all
these things right with selenium that's
what you'll be doing and then comes a
selenium grid now selenium grid is the
tool which is used to deploy your tests
on remote machines now here I told you
that you can execute multiple test cases
Baddeley on the same machine that's just
one half of it you can also execute a
test or a couple of tests
cases in a cluster of machines you can
have two three machines connected as
nodes and you can deploy your test on
all of those machines three different
machines and the advantage being that
you can basically test your code at the
same time across different platforms
like Windows or Mac or liners you can
execute those test cases there and on
different browsers in those particular
platforms operating systems so that's
what grid is used for so it's not a
testing code on itself but just helps a
web grab of work now that is about the
introduction that you need as of today
for the different Suites of selenium now
let me not bore you with any more theory
and right now I would want to go to the
best part of this particular session and
when I say best part it's gonna be fun
because I'll be using my keyboard and me
writing a program for you and I'll show
you a demonstration of how selenium
works okay so for that let me first open
up my Eclipse all right so I have this
clear my Eclipse over here so I've just
created one class here okay I've created
one sample class file but anyways I'll
start a new Java class I'll show you how
to script from the beginning okay
now I'm guessing that you people are
aware of basic programming concepts so
I'll not go into the basics here
I will first straightaway start off by
creating a Java class or new Java class
and I will give you an introduction to
selenium by reading a very sample basic
code which you can understand for the
first day okay just to give you an idea
of what a selenium is all about so this
is my package let me just write like
click on new after that and say create a
new class for me okay there's the
package name and the name of the class I
wanna give is intro class alright this
is the first class of this training
program right yup
intro class and let me say finish okay
perfect I have a public class here
okay so first of all how do we start
writing our program we have to import a
few packages right we have to first have
our Ross Williams as ready and present
now for that a few people are again
newbies then let me go through the
procedure to add your jars so you have
to download selenium from the Internet I
mean you can download it for free from
synonyms website so I would request it
download all the jars from there first
and then download the different browser
drivers if you want to perform your test
on Chrome driver then you have to
download Chrome driver from there okay
and if you want to perform your test on
Mozilla Firefox then you will have to
download gecko driver from the internet
and similarly for Internet Explorer it's
gonna be I e driver and if you want to
perform your tests or execute them on
the cloud on your servers then you can
use headless browser okay you can use
one of these you can do all these things
so you can download it basically from
the internet and it's for free you can
download from Apache chases or website
itself so you just need to put in
selenium downloads and open the first
thing that comes here
the latest versions three-point w10 go
ahead click on that and selenium would
be downloaded and you have to extract
that particular folder and get all the
jars inside okay so once you have your
jars what you have to do is you should
have Eclipse pre-configured with Java
this point of time and you have to input
your selenium jars to these Java jars
which is present and which eclipse is
using okay and how you add dust your
basically to your project you have to
right-click over here okay that's your
project that's your project directory
click on build path click on configure
build path from here and over here you
should come to libraries okay this tab
and over here you have to click on add
external jars and then you can choose it
here so I already have it so we can see
it over here okay but if you do in for
the first time click on add external
jars and then choose all your jaws
choose the folder where your raw Sydney
Amjad are downloaded it would look like
this then just choose all by ctrl a and
then click on open and they would all be
added over here okay so you should have
all your raw server jars server
standalone jars and all your jars which
selenium needs and when you do that
click on apply then click on ok then
your jars are present and then you can
start writing your selenium script
straight away now I want to start my
script so I will first start off by
creating a main class ok a main method
inside this class of mine so let me say
public static void main
public because I wanted to be accessible
from you know everywhere globally and
static because I want to create memory
space automatically that a Java class
which has a static main program defined
then that has memory allocated
dynamically to it okay so that's what
starting does public static void because
it's indication that there's no return
type it will not be returning it will
not be receiving any parameters okay and
public void main okay so I have a
spelling mistake here let me chain to
Mei Yin okay
now here at this point of time before us
do anything on selenium right before you
open your browser before you invoke your
web browser and before you do anything
on that particular web browser like
calling a website you have to first tell
your program where exactly your chrome
travel is present because the chrome
travel is the one that's gonna make your
browser do something so for me it's
gonna be chrome driver because I'm gonna
execute the test on Chrome so I'm using
a Chrome browser if you are executing
this program on a Firefox Mozilla
Firefox browser then you have to
download gecko driver and invoke your
gecko driver you have to first say where
your gecko driver is present okay and
for that we have to set the system
properties okay
so look at the command that I have on
the screen now so let's say system dot
set property so after first safe what
I'm going to invoke okay after I have to
say the path where microgram is present
so I'll first say webdriver dot chrome
dot driver okay and this of course has
to be in double quotation marks I'm
saying I want to work with chrome driver
and then after specify the path where my
chrome driver is present so the path
where my chrome travel is present is
over here because I downloaded this only
today so I'm going to copy this Chrome
add basically outdated and that to
download my that basically download an
updated version of Chrome driver so I
just did it some time back
and let me again put that in double
quotes okay now remember if you're using
Windows then you have to put a double
backslashes everywhere okay because that
is how Eclipse understands things
okay and now I have to say the
application right chrome driver dot exe
because that's what it's called chrome
driver
okay so this is what is invalid alright
so I put my program where my chrome
gravels present now that I've told it I
have to first create a new object
instance of a class
okay so there's already an in-built
class of the briber which will perform
the actions after just use that
particular class so let me create an
object to run that particular class and
let me create a new object called
webdriver now let me give the name
driver for my webdriver is equal to new
chrome driver because I wanna use chrome
driver okay
so at this point of time it's showing
errors because when you're doing it for
the first time you would not have
imported any packages so have to import
these packages because they are the
libraries that contain what my web
browser should do okay so all the
functions and all the classes are
written there so I'm importing that
package by thinking on this okay
so as you can see it says import orz or
open QA or selenium dot webdriver so all
my webdriver related commands are now
imported and now I can use webdriver
okay so earlier I was getting that error
and now if you notice on Chrome travel
it's again showing me an error for that
I have to click on this input
chromedriver because with this library
package I download all the functions
which are related to chromedriver now my
code is perfect so it's a warning but
anyways I can when I write my of a
blabber commands it will be fine so now
that you've actually said bought your
driver is and where it's present you
have to straightaway see which URL you
want to start testing on okay but before
that if you're doing for the first time
then it's fine okay but if you're a guy
that already regularly works on browser
drivers then it's very important that
you clear all your raw browser cache
okay so for that we have this command
called driver dot manage dot delete all
cookies so you're going to use this
command to basically delete all the
browser cookies that you have and also
you should know that when selenium uses
or Chrome grammar to open the browser
then Chrome is not in full screen so if
you want a selenium in full screen the
test to be visible in full screen then
you got to use this command which I'm
about to type okay but otherwise it's
not a big deal that having a smaller
screen so I would say for that I would
run that come on again driver dot manage
dot window dot full screen
okay
you can also run the command maximize
okay this would maximize your window
screen so now we have done all the er
other things which you need to get a
cilium running with you've set your
browser so by now it's time to go ahead
and write your code for testing so let's
say I want to test Amazon dot and okay
so Amazon is a very famous ecommerce
portal right now if I want to probably
do some testing that what would I do
okay so first of all I would say I would
tell my browser driver to get to that
particular URL so the command for that
is driver dot grabber or gate and in
brackets have to say the address where I
want to go so first of all let me get
amazon's you are okay so let's say
amazon daughter
okay so Amazon dot n right so I'm gonna
copy this URL here and I'm gonna put it
in my code okay Dravid orget okay so
once I reach your what should I do next
what kind of web application testing are
we talking about right so what kind of a
webpage testing are we doing here
let me anyways is to open at an
incognito okay so let's say I wanna go
to Amazon Norton and what kind of
testing are we talking about we are
talking about testing like clicking on a
particular image or on a particular
button okay you have certain links so
clicking on those links checking if they
are working or not right so probably
clicking on this field over here and try
to send text over here type something
right and then click on search and then
then continue searching and so that's
basically the agenda of my test right so
that's what I want to do so let's do the
same thing so let's say that I want to
first get to this search bar and then
put in something here send some text and
then click on search okay let's say
that's what I'm gonna do okay that's a
good first day session for you people
okay so if I want to do it how will I do
it okay so for doing that we have to
first of all identify what is the ID of
that particular web element okay I
wouldn't say it's just ID because there
are seven other techniques called
XPath then we have CSS then we have by
name
by class so we have a couple more like
that so we can find those web elements
in that way and then you can do whatever
action you want to perform if you want
to click on it you can do that if you
want to send some text you can do that
you can do whatever you want if it's
drop-down or a radio button you can
still handle it very easily but in our
case we want to find this particular
search bar and send text to it so to
find this particular web element let's
first do a control shift I okay and
we'll have to inspect all the web
elements over here so this is your tab
which comes with chrome and with Firefox
and pretty much every other browser
okay control shift I that's the shortcut
or we can also do this inspect
and over here click on this button over
here which would let you choose one of
your web elements so let's say I won
this is my web element I want to choose
so if I click on this web element then
it's pointing me over here so this is
the HTML line of code which contains the
properties and basically the name of
this particular web element and it has
various orpheens it has the ID field
which means that this is the idea for
this particular web element and then you
have a name for it the value name that
is this you have a couple more okay
now let's say I want to use ID to locate
this particular web element okay so I'll
copy this and after go back to my script
and write the line of code to identify
this particular web element using this
particular ID of it and the command to
do that is first call your driver object
and the classes which are present over
here say a driver dot not get it's
gratifying element because it's a web
element you're trying to find okay
now you have to see how do you want to
find it based on what ID or name or
XPath or CSS what so in our case it's ID
because if you remember from here we are
choosing the ID property right so this
is the property this is the value so I'm
copying this value here I'm going to say
by dot ID the third option over here
okay so I'm gonna hit enter and you have
to put the value of my ID so this is my
value okay this is the ID and I would
like to actually not close this line
because here I have done the find
element by ID okay now what do I do
after that what kind of an action would
I want to do on this particular web
element after doing it in my case I
would want to send some text so let's
say I'm gonna type in Nike shoes and
perform a search so the text I have to
send over here to this box is Nike shoes
right so let's enter that text over here
so for that you have the option of send
keys okay so click on send keys and over
here in double quotes say what you want
to basically type over there I want to
type in Nike shoes in this format okay
so I'll send the keys and then I'll
close this line okay with a semicolon I
line the line and for doing that I have
to click on this particular button right
so if I want to click on this particular
button let me again inspect this
particular element and find out what is
the values so if you can see here we
have the input we have
classname we have value and we have
tabindex but we don't really have what
is important for us for a selenium to
find okay we don't have ID or name so in
this case what we'll do is we'll use an
XPath because XPath is one of the best
ways to find out the absolute address of
that particular element okay because
XPath is the most ideal way you should
use but you have some easier ones like
by ID or by name
so vo you're used by ID but the SEM let
me show you XPath and show you how it's
done the XPath way so if I want to first
of all find the XPath I'll have to click
on this right click and then chrome does
your option to copy the experts from
your straightaway so click on copy the
XPath go back to your Eclipse go back to
your program and then put an on put it
over here okay so first the command for
that is driver dot to find element by
avoided by XPath and the expression is
going to be this okay but this might not
work because I have to pass in the
absolute XPath relative XPath some time
doesn't work so what I'm going to do is
I will open it through Firefox
okay so I have Amazon already open over
here right through Firefox it's open so
let me first locate or find out the
XPath from here so I can easily inspect
this particular web element with Firefox
okay it's easier to do it in Firefox and
copy the actual XPath so let's again
click it properly this time and this is
that particular element right so I'm
gonna right click copy click on XPath
and this time let me paste it over here
and let's check if I have the absolute
HTML path yes I have the absolute XPath
right in his Jamel format so are you
from the root so this is good enough for
me for Eclipse to find this particular
web element and once it's found I don't
want to just end it there I want to
click on that particular button so I'll
say dot click OK last time I send the
keys this time I'm clicking it so
because this is the search option and
when I'm done with it I would like to
basically wait for some time for Chrome
to finish doing the actions because your
web applications are sometimes they are
heavy on the browsers right so it takes
sample load if your net is slow then it
will take time to load and at
such times when the net is slow if your
testing is happening and if your browser
is not able to locate that particular
web element then your test case would
feel so it's very important that you use
weights okay and weights are used for
page synchronization for making sure
your web browser waits until all the
elements in your web page have loaded or
probably until all the web elements are
available at least for performing
actions with okay and in our case we use
one of the implicit wait statements
which is to basically tell driver to
hold on until my browser loads and the
command for me to do that is again
driver dot manage because the manage
package again does a lot of things for
me with respect to the browser okay dot
timeouts dot implicitly wait okay so
there are three types of weights
implicit weight explicit weight fluent
weight and leaving these three types of
weights we have another technique called
thread door sleep so you can use these
these function calls and our views
duplicity weight which is the common one
where I will say I want to implicitly
wait for this much amount of time before
the driver throws an error that a
particular element is not found so if I
say thirty seconds over here implicitly
wait for 30 seconds then it means that
driver will wait for 30 seconds to find
my particular web element and even after
thirty seconds if it can't find the web
element only then it will throw an error
okay so that is this particular command
so I'm going to say 30 over here and
we're off to say what is the unit
whether it's 13 seconds or 13 minutes
after communicate that so we can simply
say time unit okay this is for me to set
my time unit dot I have options here and
I need to choose 30 seconds and remember
this has to be again in double quotes
actually it's not needed right so 30
year time you know 30 seconds and that's
it
so my code is almost ready I'm gonna ask
my driver to wait for 30 seconds so up
at this point I can run my final command
which is nothing but a driver dot quit
ok so if I don't want to do anything
more then I can just simply use Gravatar
quit because since it's your first
training session on selenium I would
like to stop it over here because
otherwise it'd be a little too much for
you people to taken so I would say
grabber or quit and close my browser and
end my testing per se okay now that's
your introduction to selenium and that's
how simple it is to code okay now let me
quickly go ahead and complete this demo
by running execution okay let's first
save this ctrl s and then so after that
straightaway just click on this play
button
that should start your execution so
that's chrome that's come up and ask for
the first command it's supposed to
maximize and there we go it has
maximized that is Amazon Oren for you
you have the search bar where Nike whose
is typed search buttons clicked on and I
think it's gonna stop here for 30
seconds right yeah so it was supposed to
wait for 30 seconds until the web
element is found but it's routed much
earlier so the execution was continued
and the driver quit on its own right so
those are my commands and that was the
demo right so that's how nice it is
that's how fun it was to execute
selenium test cases okay and you can
also later on write a cilium
suite okay which will contain a number
of selenium test cases like this you can
call each of these test cases in that
particular test suite and then this run
out for execution in the night and then
you can go home sleep and get back the
next day and then find out the test
results for that particular test right
so all these can be done and that's what
is the advantage with selenium okay so
that's also introduced so on that note I
would like to end my demo for today and
go back to my slides and conclude
today's session right so I had a good
chat with you people and I got good
questions keep it up for those questions
guys so we'll talk more about selenium
in the next training session and we keep
you posted about the date but until then
