modules so basically it's a collection
of modules from a spring framework so
there we have different modules we will
talk about more when we talk about
spring architecture and here is a brief
introduction of those inversion of
control done through dependency
injection okay what is loose coupling
what is inversion of control so
inversion of loose coupling we have
already seen with user and the car
example and inversion of control we will
be seeing with that will be configuring
the beans in XML file and we can get a
beam from the text ml file which will be
injected with all its dependencies okay
that we will see aspect-oriented
programming which enables implementing
cross-cutting concerns the example that
we covered just now and the data access
which works with JDBC and hibernate we
have spring TM o and we have spring
batch and we have JDBC template there
are so many other stock which which
offers data access Model View controller
this is very important MVC framework
which provides M easy support through
terribly kind strands this is a web
framework a remote axles framework which
supports remote access through RMI a web
service through soap on the rest so here
what is our M my remote method
invocation what does it mean assume
there are two I am putting it in very
simple terms I am NOT going into deeper
deeper what we call levels in I don't
want to confuse you in very simple terms
we can think of
RMI as for example I have a method which
is in G JVM or they are what we call in
one JVM and I have another method in JVM
- if the method which is in JVM - if it
won't to call or invoke method which is
available in JVM one that can be
possible using RMI that can be possible
using our Embree so that is what our MA
and we have a module with respect to our
ma that is remote access framework and
spring has inbuilt support our web
services also as you know next slope
stands for simple object access protocol
and the rest is transfer oh wait a
moment
okay rest stands for representational
state protocol next
yeah then we have a remote management
module GMX is the technology that is
used to manage the system objects and
devices like printers jmx Tantra java
management extensions usually you can
treat your network printer as an object
as a Java object and you can monitor
your printer through java using a a mix
and then that is an example there are so
many other things that can be achieved
using GM mix for example if you want to
have a control on your JVM that you can
use that can that you can have by jay a
mix in force on your JVM you can monitor
your JVM have it exactly working
messaging uses JMS to communicate
through message queues GMA stands for
Java messaging service so here the
messaging could be synchronous and
asynchronous testing supports classes
for writing unit test cases and
integration test cases so we have spring
unit testing module also so which offers
different classes and interfaces which
what we call which gives better unit
testing kind integration testing
capabilities then we have spring Roo
which offers convention over
configuration it is like a framework
which eases the development effort this
is rapid application development tool so
for example if you want to create a
spring project so if you have this kind
of IDE
it is a matter of selecting file new
spring project so it eases the develop
that is what we can achieve using spring
Roo authentication and authorization so
this is covered as part of your spring
security module okay next this what is
the difference between authentication
and authorization so authentication
talks redwood
validating your user and authorization
talks of what what user is accessible
true then there would be hundreds of
features but is the logged in user is
authorized through all of them or some
of them and we got replaced from others
also who need says authentication means
you are an authorized user and
authorization means you have right to
perform some action
yes ah see who says authentication is if
the user can log into system that is
true and authorization means the
permission to this system for our user
if the user is read-only or rewrite yeah
it's more or less whether the logged in
user is accessible to this feature or
this module or not it is something like
that
and this Regina says authentication is
who you are and authorization is what
you are allowed to do oh very nice so in
very simple terms switch as Regina said
authentication is who you are and
authorization is what you are allowed to
to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
