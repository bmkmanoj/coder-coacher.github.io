and welcome to this blockchain tutorial
session now blockchain and bitcoin are
some of the most trending keywords as
part of today's technology and even
those who are not familiar with
cryptocurrency are quite interested in
the same and today's session will give
you a complete idea with respectable
without wasting any time let's move
forward and look at today's agenda for
the session now blockchain is being used
highly for transaction management and it
is replacing the current existing
transaction management system if a
technology is replacing the existing
system there must be certain problems
and that's exactly what we'll be
discussing at the first once we've
understood this let's try to discuss how
bitcoins can help solve these issues as
well as how the Bitcoin transaction
takes place now if a transaction has to
take place there needs to be certain
medium and that's exactly what
blockchain is moving on from there we
try to talk about the various blockchain
concepts the various blockchain features
as well as we see where blockchain is
being used apart from the banking dummy
finally towards the latter half of this
session we'll be looking at a banking
use case demo where what we'll be doing
is we try to create an alternative
banking system as well as we try to make
it a bit better since you are
reinventing something let's start to
make it better than anything that is
there so for that first what we'll be
doing is we'll be installing GUI theorem
and then we'll be registering and
account to go aetherium block the
etherium basically is an online
blockchain system which helps you manage
your cryptocurrency once you've done
this we'll try to create a private sort
enormous blockchain on our system itself
and then we'll try to perform
transactions internally now these are
more transactions but it will at least
give you a complete idea of how a
blockchain system works a support so can
you guys give me a quick confirmation in
chat box if you are clear with today's
agenda ok so I seem to have got a
confirmation from Deepika Matilda Aditya
it says it looks great Ravi says
promising that's great to see that you
guys are interested for the session so
without wasting any time let's move
forward to the first topic of this
session that is the issues with the
current banking system now before I go
ahead with the slides can you all take a
moment and please tell me what do you
feel is the issue with current existing
banking system
so this can be something that you feel
as such is wrong with the current
existing system so please put it across
in the chat box
okay so I have already started getting a
few of them let me pick them out
so there are radiating interest rates
definitely agree on that
transactional charge with everything
definitely that is another problem
financial crisis yes definitely agree to
that as well net banking fraud
definitely that is another problem so
there are multiple problems that you can
see as part of the current existing
system and this in turn led for the
requirement for a parallel system but
before we go into the parallel system in
detail let's try to talk about the
challenges that are faced with the
current existing banking system now the
first and we'll be talking about is the
transaction fees now let's take the
simple example here when Chandler wants
to send $100 to Joey due to a
transaction fees of $2 Dewey ends up
getting only $98 now it may not seem a
huge amount but let's assume that every
day there are 10,000 transactions that
happen and in that 10,000 transaction
even if it's a two-person Commission
it's a huge amount that we are talking
about if you look at what is given here
in the year 2015 3 organizations that is
CPM Irving Bank of America and Wells
Fargo made close to 6 billion just from
ATM and overdraft transaction fees so
this is a very huge amount and most
banking and financial organizations
depend on these kinds of fees to have
this source of income as well now
wouldn't we all like not to how US
transaction fees because every
transaction that we make be it in an ATM
wait net transfer bit back withdraw
everything these days comes with a fixed
transaction fee even though it would be
a small amount wouldn't we be happy if
you could say that definitely I do want
to save that so moving forward let's
talk about the next problem that is
there with the existing banking system
now this is a challenge that you would
have seen if you're from financial aid
of me but to those of you who have not
heard of double spending before let me
put it very simply take the example here
PETA has $500 in Lusaka but what he is
trying to do is that at the same time he
is trying to send James $400 and Mary
$400 now in both transactions go through
at the same time then it becomes problem
to identify which is valid because the
digital signature attached which digital
transactions can be
to an extent falsified and copied as
well this makes double spending quite
possible and is something that is off
the challenge now this is one challenge
that most banking or Bissell's financial
solutions had faced across when they
were working with online payment
transactions apart from this this also
the challenge of financial crisis and
financial depression now all of us
remember the depression that had
happened in the year 2008 now to put it
very bluntly one of the key factors
which led to this depression was because
financial organizations and banks had
actively lent out all their money as
subprime mortgages to people who
couldn't afford to pay them back this in
turn led to a huge fall with respect to
real estate value and created a huge
financial crisis for everyone who is
associated with respect to that a lot of
people lost their jobs as well as money
but then again this was something that
people had done to try to get rich so
now comes the question that how can
Bitcoin solve these issues now to
understand this let's take these four
issues in itself the first is the issue
of centralized power now when I talk
about a centralized power every monetary
system that out there today is
controlled by a central governing
authority it could be a federal body it
could be a unanimous personality and so
far almost all currencies out there
today are actually controlled to an
extent by a central authority
however with Bitcoin this system got
decentralized and distributed among
everyone who is part of the Bitcoin
system and it keeps going on let's say
tomorrow you move into the Bitcoin
system then definitely you are also part
of it and you hold a certain power to
that as well now how that happens that
will be talking in our upcoming sessions
as to how the value of bitcoins keeps
scénic but for now let me just help you
understand that anyone who becomes part
of the Bitcoin and blockchain system
becomes a powerful person and the power
that is held by one single Authority
gets distributed to everyone who's part
of the network
apart from this most banking and
financial organization follow a private
ledger the only thing that you are aware
of when you put your money into
something is whether or not the certain
transaction that you have made as a
person as such
you have no idea whether someone else
has taken some money whether the bank
has in itself invested this money
somewhere and so far however with
blockchain system the ledger in itself
is public everyone who becomes part of
this blockchain network get a complete
copy of the entire blockchain as soon as
they sign on so immediately when you
sign up for the Bitcoin gob check you
get a list of complete transactions that
has happened from the start of Bitcoin
transactions now that's a huge amount of
transactions but not chain make it way
easy as well as completely secure to
store all this transaction detail and at
the same time ensures that none of this
gets manipulated as to how this can be
completely secure we'll be talking in
the upcoming slide but I hope you get a
simple understand now although it is a
public ledger you can have the complete
details with respect to the transaction
that happens as part of the network you
still don't know who exactly is doing
this transaction and this is the
anonymity that blockchain gives you
really neat right crashing it now the
other challenge that most transaction
and financial organization faces is the
challenge of hacking every now and then
we do hear that a financial organization
has been hacked and certain data has
been leaked certain transaction details
are released certain amount has been
stolen from their accounts and so all
this is something that we have heard
every now and that but blockchain system
is completely immutable too hard any
transaction that takes place cannot be
modified ahead and even if you try to
modify it the blockchain system is built
so securely and so smartly that this
false transaction detail gets rejected
now don't worry about how this happens
we'll be talking about that in the
upcoming slides moving forward coming to
the final challenge that is the double
spending problem as I had mentioned most
financial organizations that have a
digital platform have faced the
challenge of double spending through
blockchain system
double spending is not possible and this
is basically because of how the
blockchain system in itself was
structured and created now the double
spending problem was something that was
faced quite popularly at the time when
the blockchain system was becoming
popular keeping this in mind they had
structured the blockchain system in such
a way that even in future
the challenge of double spending can be
completely tacit without any problem
until they you do not have any
transaction that was part of the double
spending issue so are you guys clear
with respect to these points any doubts
with respect to this
Matilda is asking me if I have the
access to the complete ledger can I not
modify it as per my request
definitely not Mittal day definitely not
because we will be talking about the
challenge just to do that the upcoming
slides but to give you a clear cut and
straight idea let me clarify it now
itself this is one with key reasons why
blockchain is highly being used in
today's pavement platform you cannot
directly modify even a single
transaction that's part of the
blockchain now literally let's say you
are trying to modify a specific blow up
without the complete transaction details
it is going to cost you at least half
the world's resources and why is that
we'll be talking for now let's say it's
going to be very expensive and
impossible tasks for one single person
or a group of people to modify a
transaction part of the blockchain
iclear middle day great now the first
challenge that we had spoken about was
the transaction fees now today there are
out close to 650 different kinds of
cryptocurrency but most of them don't
even charge a minimal transaction fees
you can transfer your money from one
account to the other account at no
transaction charge but let's say if you
do wish to add a specific transaction
charge you can do that there are certain
cryptocurrency that do follow a specific
transaction fees but this is comparable
minut when you see the transaction fees
that is associated to a bank transaction
so does this solve most of your problems
can have a quick confirmation in the
chat box
okay so Aditi has asked me how realistic
is it up so Aditya let me give you this
understanding the value of a Bitcoin was
somewhere close to $1,100 in the start
of the year it was January 2011 today it
stands somewhere close to $2,800 this
basically has grown because of people's
belief in the system and their
investment into the system as well so
the more people we trust the system and
invest their money into it the more the
value keeps going and every day you have
new people who are moving into the
Bitcoin system rather than sticking to
the conventional banking system now
there are a lot of security features
that come with respect to this which we
will be talking as part of today's
session let me put it this way are the
theum most people who are part of the
financial domain today are already
moving into cryptocurrency market or
have already moved in so definitely this
is something that will rapidly grow as
well
Chum shaker is asking me how can I
purchase a cryptocurrency Orbitz cut
something like that that's quite easy
all you have to do is register for a
cryptocurrency wallet and then you can
go on to purchase there are different
sites that help you do that with
different charges you can just have a
look at that it's quite easy you can
just check it out
okay there's a question here from tipica
be-because asking me if there is a
choice of no transaction fees why would
there be people who add a transaction
fees with respect to that okay because
let me park your questions aside for now
we'll come back to this for those fees
were not clear on what Deepika asked she
quite simply asked if I don't have to
pay then why do some people pay for the
transaction fees and sango so we'll come
back to that don't worry if you're not
clear at that time we will take this
question of path again
is that okay Deepika great so since all
of you understood till here let's talk
about the Bitcoin transactions but
before we actually talk about the
Bitcoin transaction system what we need
to understand is what exactly is blocked
a blockchain basically is the core
technology behind Bitcoin in itself you
can say it is the spine of Bitcoin
system to put it quite simply blockchain
is actually a public distributed
database which holds the encrypted
ledger so why is it encrypted to keep
the details of the people involved in it
completely anonymous apart from this
what exactly is a block you might be
pondering a block is a collection of all
the recent transactions that have
happened and are verified you group all
those transaction details create a hash
code for this and then you store it in a
block once the transaction is verified
then what happens is this block becomes
a permanent part of the block chain and
the chain keeps growing so it is
believed that every ten minutes a new
blog gets created and the blockchain
keeps growing according so how many
transactions happen with respect to that
time frame all can be grouped as part of
the block and then stored into the block
change block but then again you might be
wondering what exactly is Bitcoin in
itself so don't worry that's exactly
what talking about next
bitcoin is the first decentralized
digital currency that came into the
market and was introduced in 2009 by a
pseudonym called Satoshi Nakamoto now he
brought in the concept of Bitcoin and
blockchain together in an open paper and
this was something of a revolution he
was not until July 2009 the first
blockchain came into implementation and
became quite popular since then now you
may be wondering since it's a
decentralized Android digital currency
can't we just keep creating bitcoins as
per our needs the answer is no because
use various cryptographic as well as
mathematical problems that ensure that
the creation as well as management of
bitcoins is restricted now there are
only 21 million bitcoins that can be
created and as on 2016 we've almost
created 14 million of them
so what bitcoin community has done is
that they keep upgrading the algorithms
as well as cryptographic technologies in
word in Bitcoin on a regular basis this
ensures that even if there are more -
that come into the Bitcoin technology
every day that the Bitcoin system does
not get exhausted with the increase of
complexity it ensures that only by 2001
40 does the last Bitcoin get mine apart
from this we let Justin which keeps a
track of how much Bitcoin gets
transacted is in itself completely
electronic and highly secure now if you
need to change any specific transactions
let's say you are trying to send someone
because that you don't have let's say I
want to send 500 bitcoins to every one
of you who are part of the session this
becomes impossible because the ledger in
itself is completely electronic as well
as every transaction is verified and
validated before it gets added to the
blog now going back to a previous topic
that was blockchain now in a block there
are mainly three key concepts the first
is the previous block hash code now
every block has a specific hash code
associated with it which is used as an
identifying factor for that block now
this hash is something that gets created
with a very complex hashing algorithm
where even on my new change with respect
to the input can create a highly
different hash output asshole now you
cannot reverse engineer this hash code
as well
algorithm is created in such a way that
no one can actually get the complete
data by reverse engineering the hash
code as well apart from this you have
the complete hash details of every
transaction that has happened as part of
that block now there could be multiple
transactions that happen at one book so
if we verified and validated transaction
gets added to block with thereby
ensuring that this transaction cannot be
manipulated apart from this the third
thing that needs to be part of a block
is basically the value or proof of work
for that block this basically is a
mathematical solution that you attach
with a block to ensure that this is a
valid block now we're not going to go in
detail with respect to the mathematical
proof but we'll talk about that in the
upcoming slides now you may be wondering
since it is a ledger and everyone has
access to it can I just not directly
modify the ledger or the transaction
definitely not these ledges are
something that gets created by software
which in itself have to solve a
mathematical problem to get the valid
output so as I had mentioned all the
output gets hash and this hash value is
what becomes a proof-of-work so even if
you try to falsify or even if you try to
fake a specific transaction or a detail
with respect to the ledger it is not
going to get accepted apart from that
since the ledger in itself gets
distributed throughout the network
everyone has a valid copy of the same
let's say if you try to change even one
specific transaction which is part of
the block it does not get accepted
because majority of the people of the
network have a copy of the block which
is valid so your modified block what
transaction gets completely rejected and
does not become part of the original
blockchain as a hook thereby ensuring
that every transaction as well as every
block is highly secure as well as valid
and verified so are you guys clear with
respect to what is a blockchain and what
is a Bitcoin
okay so Andy is asking me can I purchase
bitcoins definitely Andy anyone can
purchase as well as perform transactions
using bitcoins you can do that using
various online platforms which help you
convert your currency into bitcoins now
you can choose whichever is star as per
your requirement but put your answer
quite simply yes anyone can use Bitcoin
and blockchain
okay I have a question here from pony's
penitas asking me can Bitcoin or a
blockchain system be hacked directly I
have heard this okay Polly let me put it
across
till date there has not been even one
single incident where Bitcoin or the
blockchain system has directly been
hacked okay although blockchain system
in itself is being implemented with
other applications there have been
certain incidents where the application
gets hacked but the blockchain system
till date has never been hacked if the
application which is built on top of the
blockchain that gets hacked well trust
me the blockchain in itself can never be
hacked or modified does it answer a
question commit okay that's great
so moving forward let's try to
understand how of Bitcoin transaction
takes place now let's take a group of
eight people to a part of my blockchain
network okay you have James you have
Stephen you have Rahul Kevin pork Robert
and Itza now James wants to transfer 500
bitcoins from his account - Kevin's
account
now just because James wants to transfer
500 bitcoins to Kevin's it may not seem
possible to give you a better example
let's say I want to give every one of
you a part of the session five crore
rupees sorry I don't have enough balance
so I can't do that but that same thing
needs to be validated by somewhere else
and that's exactly what the role is of
Robert at visa who are special
professionals called - their main job is
to see whether James actually has enough
sufficient ballots now there are a lot
of protocols as well as security
features that come into this and we'll
be talking about each one of them one by
one
James here wants this transfer 500
bitcoins to Kevin and Lisa and draw our
job is to verify that they have
sufficient balance now before we go on
let's look at a sample ledger here here
you have a core number as well as the
balance that is there after each
transaction takes place
now this balance gets updated every time
a transaction gets introduced and the
ledger in itself gets updated with
respect to every transaction so here
rather than having the details with
respect to one single account you store
the details with respect to the
transaction as part of the block this
again ensures that even though there are
details with respect to the transaction
available you cannot directly attack or
hack the end user and take away his
money from his wallet although there are
different kinds of cryptocurrency system
in the market today
to give you a simple example blockchain
system actually keeps count of the
unspent transaction output whereas the
systems like GUI theorem follows an
account based system where an account
balance is also stored so based on
different kinds of requirements by the
user you have different kinds of
blockchain in itself but we're going to
be talking mainly about Bitcoin
blockchain itself so we'll be talking
about the unspent transaction organs
that is the amount of bitcoins that are
unspent now before we move forward let's
assume that the third entry present here
is of James who has to send 500 bitcoins
to Kevin so I'll take this entry to be
Kevin's okay I hope all of you can see
this right now here what needs to be
done is that 500 bitcoins has to be
taken from this on and has to get
transferred to this account now this the
transaction is successful since the ins
has sufficient balance the transaction
will definitely go forward and the
account balance of Kevin gets updated
with respect to everyone who holds the
copy of the ledger that is this
transaction is successful gets broadcast
to everyone across the network who's
part of the blockchain and they
themselves update their ledger
accordingly but then you might be
wondering whose job is it to verify that
this transaction goes through and James
has sufficient balance that exactly is
what the job role of - Lisa and Robert
is as we have discussed earlier now what
is going to happen is that Lisa and
Robert are in turn going to check the
complete transaction history of chips
they're going to see if at any point
James has received more than 500
bitcoins or at least holes or
corresponding previous balance of above
100 requests so let's say there has been
a scenario where Rahul had sent them 600
bitcoins so this in turn makes it quite
easy and you can immediately see that
okay he has received 600 bitcoins so I
don't need to look any more further I
can definitely ensure that this
transaction can go through since Dean's
has not spent it all so but let's say
James has to see from Stephen let's say
200 bitcoins Paola sent 100 so I need to
keep checking
all the previous transactions to verify
that he has sufficient balance including
his credit as well as debit history and
then decide whether this transaction can
go now this is exactly what Lisa and
Robert as - - now once they have
validated that James has sufficient
balance in his account to transfer
friend rate bitcoins to Kevin then what
happens is that this transaction gets
added as part of the block and once the
Block in itself gets validated the money
gets reduced from James's account and
goes to Kevin's Bitcoin occur now
usually this whole process of a block
validation gets completed in a minute
but it is suggested that you wait about
30 minutes to confirm a transaction now
why is that so we will be talking in our
next session but for now just keep this
in mind now again since every
transaction gets validated by a miner
they go back to all their previous
history and keep checking now let's say
James at the same time had tried to send
500 to Kevin and 500 to Rahul having
only 500 as part of his pallet then what
would happen is since each transaction
is individually being checked the
transactions would go through one by now
since James has sent Kevin 400 bitcoins
the transaction which is sent from James
to Rahul
won't go through because he recently
disciplined 400 bitcoins and he only had
500 bitcoins as part of this Bitcoin
wallet so therein it completely avoids
the problem of double spending that we
had discussed so I guys clear with
respect to how a Bitcoin transaction
system takes place now don't worry too
much we are not going in detail with
respect to how completely it works there
is a separate session on that but I at
least hope you've got a complete
overview of how things work around
okay I have a very good question here
from the bish B patients ask me if James
request to transaction and Lisa is
taking care of one transaction while
James is taking care of the other
transaction isn't their chance of douse
panic okay now because that is a very
good question and we will be talking
about that in the next session actually
where I completely show you how it is
impossible for anyone to actually do
double spending challenge now since both
of them are trying to confirm this
transaction it can take both of them
different times to confirm this
transaction there is a very good chance
that by the time Lisa has verified the
first transaction she's going to
broadcast this to avian in part of the
network and Robert although he still
verifying gets the update and then
realizes okay this is a double spending
problem he can avoid this transaction
but this very very very my new chance
that both of them solve it at the same
time and both of them confirm it but
even then there is actually a solution
to that now to put it in simple ways
what happens is the message gets
transmitted across multiple peoples in
the network as we have taught now the
message gets transmitted accordingly
from isa as well as robert at the same
time verifying the transaction which in
turn causes the issue of dubs match but
the person who solves the next block his
input that is whether he scored the
transaction confirmation from Lisa or
from Robert whichever transaction he has
accepted that will be accepted and the
other transaction gets rejected I hope
you've got a simple understanding of
this B page don't worry we talked about
this extensively how the blockchain
algorithms ensures that without spending
problem doesn't happen okay yeah good to
see that you understand capiche any
other questions okay it's good to see
that you guys have followed me till sure
but let me ask you this why would Lisa
and Robert actually sit down and
validate their transactions what do they
have to gain what do you think and it's
not easy to validate a transaction as
well as a mind on you dog because it
requires a lot of the source in today's
world it's highly impossible for a
single person or an entity to mine a
complete law so it requires a lot of
resource as well as investment so why do
you think James
lissa do that okay deepika tells me they
may get some transaction charges because
again we spoke about this earlier as
well the transaction charges are
completely neglected here even if you go
by the minimalistic amount that is one
millionth Bitcoin so that's not a huge
number for them to invest they would be
investing a lot more than that okay
don't plant a your heads anymore let me
answer that the miners who validate the
transaction as well as complete the next
block of the blockchain get a 12.5
Bitcoin as an incentive for the creation
of the new block now this is something
that gets created out of thin air and
gets added to their Bitcoin wallet
associated to it now 12.5 bitcoins is
not a small amount
in today's value with somewhere about 33
to 34 thousand dollars which is a very
huge amount and you also need to
understand that almost every ten minutes
a new blogger gets created and becomes a
part blockchain
so you can assume that every 10 minutes
$30,000 gets credited into someone's
account but it's not as simple as you
think mining requires a lot of
investment and as I had mentioned it's
not easy for one single person to mine
the resource so in today's world what
happens is a lot of miners come together
and form something Munna support these
people invest all the resource that they
have to solve the pool together and
based on how much resource that they
have invested in mining the pool
Tord gets distributed accordingly now
let's take a real-time scenario
$33,000 and let's say there are 11
people as part of that each one gets
close to $3,000 in itself $3,000 again
is a huge amount for something that
requires 10 months to mine but again
let's not go into how much efficient it
is to mine the resource and all that we
will talk about that in the upcoming
sessions as well but just to give you a
simple idea this an incentive also added
to Lisa and Rob middle days ask me can
anyone become a - definitely Mittal day
you can definitely become a miner all
you have to do is register as a minor
and then allocate your resources are
courting you now again there are a lot
of sites that help you do this but again
what I would request you is to check
whether you are actually going to get
any profit before you become a miner
because again the resource needed for
mining a block is not less and
day by day it keeps increasing aspect
because the complexity involved in
solving a block keeps growing day by day
as we had mentioned earlier there is a
certain level of complexity that is
involved in mining and this keeps
growing as time goes because a lot more
people are mining today when compared to
six or eight months back and this is
mainly because of their attraction for
region centers but at the same time
since more miners are coming we need to
ensure that the Bitcoin system does not
get depleted as I had mentioned earlier
there is only 21 million bitcoins that
can be mined so the system itself makes
it difficult for you to compute the
resource and as I had mentioned just
check how efficient would be for you to
the coal miner okay
great to see that you guys are
understood to get here now it's time we
try to understand how blockchain
achieves the Bitcoin solution or the
Bitcoin parallel system now what happens
first is that this is a request for
transaction initiated basically what
happens is someone requests the
transaction now it's quite easy for
anyone to request for a transaction all
you need to do is that you need to have
the details to whom you're sending and
with respect to details you need to just
have a unique number that they're going
to be shared now what exactly is this
unique number we'll be talking the
upcoming slide but there are certain
cryptocurrency wallet that even let you
scan the QR code of the sender and
initiate this transaction as well so
it's quite easy all you need to do is
enter one specific unique number that
they provide you with you have to enter
your unique number and then you need to
specify the amount that you need to send
to them once you do this it gets
transmitted across to everyone who's
part of the Bitcoin network once they
receive that and validation of this
transaction is done then the
verification goes on and then this
transaction becomes part of the new
block which is going to be added to the
existing blockchain once the new block
is created it goes on to get added to
the existing blockchain and the
transaction process gets completed quite
simple don't you think definitely here
in it also avoids the need for a third
party who in turn access mediatory
between the sender and the receiver
thereby this exactly awards the need for
a transaction fees as well and is one of
the key factors that has increased the
popularity of blockchain and
Bitcoin network as such right so going
forward if you talk about blockchain
itself blockchain basically is the spine
of Bitcoin system it is again a publicly
distributed database where you're
holding encrypted ledges of everyone
involved in the blockchain now once a
transaction gets verified and validated
it becomes part of the new block and the
new block in turn gets added to the
blockchain now the number of
transactions at this point could be all
the recent transactions or only those
that have been completed as well this
depends on the total number of
transactions that get verified and
validated in the time that a new block
gets created so each block once it's
completed gets added to the blockchain
and the next blocks work begins again
the next set of transactions get added
on to this block and in turn it gets
added to the blockchain and it ever
keeps going now as I had mentioned once
you join the blockchain
you can get the complete block list
right from 2009 when the first log chain
was implemented moving forward let's try
to address the three key features that
make blockchain so popular the first is
the blockchain cryptographic so you use
a combination of public key and private
key cryptography apart from also using a
highly secure hashing algorithm now this
hashing algorithm is so precise as well
as complex that even a single space or a
comma can make a huge difference with
respect to that set apart from this we
use a p2p network that is a peer-to-peer
network which ensures that there is a
complete constancy with the blockchain
let's see even if one person tries to
make a slight change with respect to a
transaction or a block which is part of
the blockchain then that change block
does not get added or reflected in the
blockchain because most people in the
network have the original blockchain
this change block does not get accepted
and gets rejected as well apart from
that the program in which blockchain is
created has a lot of protocols as well
as security feature in itself now
talking about the private key
cryptography here again you use a public
key and a private key what do you do
basically is that you share your public
key this is similar to the account
number that we had discussed earlier so
what usually happens is that in case
you do want to send your money to
someone you basically request them for
that public key and then what you do is
you share your public key their public
key as well as the amount that needs to
be sent as part of the transaction
details now based on what data you're
sharing you can select whether it has to
be encrypted by the public key or the
private key and the other would be used
for decrypting the data it's completely
an asymmetrical encryption process that
takes place now apart from this we use a
p2p net
how does the p2p network work now
suppose a let's call a as an D here
finds out that a transaction has come in
which Bobby wants to transfer five
bitcoins to Cindy what happens is that a
broadcast this message to both B and C
we in turn verified it and transmitted
it accordingly to their peers as well
now once they have transmitted to their
peers they keep transmitted it across
the network and this transaction gets
propagated throughout the network once
this transaction gets propagated and a
new block is about to be created the
transaction gets verified and validated
and then get added to the new block in
itself thereby keeping a complete
consistency now you may be wondering
what happens when one person as far as
the network tries to make a modification
with respect to this transaction details
as I had mentioned earlier it is not
possible let's say this node is called D
now what he does is that he actually
defies the data suggesting that the
amount has to come to D rather than it
has to go to C and he propagated to his
nodes now what happens is that once this
gets propagated throughout there's a
majority and a minority difference here
now this is certain limit that D can
propagate his data but since the
majority of people have the correct
details that it is B who wants to send
the five bitcoins to C not B the
transaction details with respect to
which is original get accepted and the
modified transaction detail gets
rejected now I hope this gives you an
understanding of how secure the p2p
network is as well as what happens when
you try to modify the transactional data
it's mostly based on a majority vote
here apart from this is also another
preference that comes into the picture
but right now let's not talk about it
and complicate things for
now moving on further let's talk about
how to distribute to let the system
itself works in the p2p Network now
let's say Andy is sending Bobby five
dollars Bobby is then giving Debbie
three dollars and Debbie thereby is
giving Cindy one dollar now this is a
complete cycle that keeps happening but
we have only one central ledger which
gives taxable what happens is the
central ledger gets corrupted or some
problems comes with respect to this data
then the complete details with respect
to the transaction is lost then we can
always tell that he's not taking three
dollars from Bobby and same could be
said by Bobby himself to Andy since the
central record is not there anymore
there is no proof with respect to that
same and this is where exactly are
distributed ledger comes a distributed
ledger ensures that everyone who's part
of the cycle has a copy of the ledger
thereby ensuring that no fraud can
happen or no changes with respect to
that now even if Andy loses his record
of the transaction detail he can take it
from Bobby they'd be awesome and if
either of them try to make a change with
respect to that always the alternative
copy can ensure that this is the actual
transaction that had happened okay
Dileep has a question here Dilip is
asking me what if a majority of people
come together to tell the transactional
sports ok Dilip let me come to your
question itself let's take the same
example now Andy has lost his copy and
what he's trying to do is he's taking a
copy from Bobby Debbie and Cindy now
Bobby has made a certain change with
respect to the transaction details he
doesn't want to pay Andy back the file
so he has made a change with respect to
his late' similarly he requests baby to
do the same and what happens is that
there's a conflict of interest that
takes place but since Bobby and baby
have the majority their decision is
accepted but let's look at a real-time
scenario at present the blockchain
network is distributed throughout the
world so if you want to modify a
transaction and it has to get accepted
you need to be from the majority group
that is you need to be more than 50% of
the group that is part of the blockchain
this basically means that you need to
influence more than 50% of the people
who are spread throughout the world do
you think that is possible definitely
not and
this is what ensures that every
transaction is highly secure as well
there are certain ways that this can be
proved and secure but let's not go into
that detail and complicate things even
further for you today
great I'm happy that you've understood
any other questions
okay that's good so now moving forward
let's try to understand how a digital
signature works with respect to it now a
digital signature is a very important
part of the transaction details because
it ensures that the person who's sending
the money is the real person as well as
the amount that is being transacted is
the correct number so what happens is
you merely take the public key of the
sender the public key of the receiver
and as well as add the amount that has
to get transmitted once you take this
it's fed to a hash algorithm and then it
gets encrypted by a private key which
then is added as a digital signature to
your document now this is the CM
document that has the public key of the
sender public key of the receiver as
well as the AMA once it gets transmitted
across the network you feed the data to
a hash algorithm which then again hashes
the amount that has to be sent the
public key of the user as well as the
public key of the C you also decrypt the
signature that is attached to this
document using a public key that is
being provided and then you check if the
hashes are C if it is same then it is
understood that this is a valid
transaction and this has not been
modified as such while it is being
propagated so this in turn is another
security feature that ensures that no
transaction can be directly manipulated
as well now apart from this are not the
major key feature is the blockchain
program now the blockchain program is
not something that can be implemented in
the banking domain it's being right now
implemented across multiple domains and
has provided one of the new generation
solutions as well as welcome most of the
challenges faced by a previous
generation of applications
apart from this blockchain can be
implemented using any language as per
the user's requirement but right now
solidity is the most preferred language
for writing blockchain programs talking
about the blockchain transactions in any
blockchain every transaction that gets
verified and validated in the process of
creation of a new block is logged along
with the information of time the
participants as well as the amount that
gets transmitted across each node of the
network that is each user who's part of
the blockchain holds the complete
blockchain in itself
so even when to join the blockchain you
get a complete
because the blockchain from the start
usually there's a 24-hour validation
process that takes place but after 24
hours once you've set up a blockchain
network you can go on to perform various
operations as part of it talking more
about the transactions involved in a
blockchain each transaction is verified
by a miner after he solves a complex
mathematical puzzle and once he solves
this and verifies the transaction he
maintains and updates the ledger as well
now the mathematical principle which is
involved as part of the validation
process ensures that every node which is
part of the blockchain are automatically
and continuously in sync with respect to
the current state of the ledger and
every transaction in it basically it
ensures that everyone has the same set
of transaction as well as same state of
ledger as well
apart from this as I had mentioned even
if one person tries to corrupt or change
the transaction part of it the other
nodes would not agree with it and
thereby refuse to incorporate and
neglect this transaction detail now
moving forward let's talk about three
types of blockchain there are mainly
three types of blockchain you have
public blockchain private and consortium
blocks check the public blockchain is
similar to your Bitcoin or Goethe reom
blockchain which anyone in the world can
be part of you can both read as well as
write data into this blockchain if you
are a miner and also you can read data
if you're part of the peer-to-peer
network as well so anyone who's part of
the network can verify and add a new
block of transactions that has part to
this project
private blockchain however is something
that is quite restricted usually only
one central person has the complete
right to both verify the transaction as
well as either you block to the
blockchain how our consortium blockchain
is something that is between public as
well as private here what happens is
that instead of one person it becomes a
group of people let's say there is a
group of ten backs
among them five may be chosen who can
both verify as well as add a new block
as part of the blockchain
now with respect to the view that is
available a public blockchain is
something that anyone can access to as
we have seen the Bitcoin as well as go
etherium blockchain is something that
anyone can download and work with but at
the same time private and consortium
blockchain are created and managed with
respect to their specific purposes you
may not always be able
to access the private or a consortium
block tip because they may be set to the
specific users requirement however there
are certain private as well as
consortium blockchain which are
accessible to the public but again this
is something that the user has to do
that is the creator of the blockchain
has to set according it if you do wish
to create a blockchain which is
accessible to the public but lets you
only add or modify it then definitely
you can do that as well and we'll talk
about how this can be done as part of
the session as well so are you guys
clear with respect to what we have
discussed to hear any does is what we
have discussed
okay Mary is asking me can we combine
two different block scenes definitely
Mary that also can be done and it can be
done to form a completely large block
chain as well there are certain things
that you would need to change but
definitely it is possible
okay Deepika has a very interesting
question be-because asked me if I have
to only use bitcoins as part of my
project definitely not the pickup as I
have mentioned the blockchain which is
used most popularly is the Bitcoin
blockchain apart from that you have GUI
biram blockchain which mainly works
around ethers let's say as part of the
blockchain you want to convert your
etherium to bitcoins as one that can be
also done you would be creating herbs
sub blocks chain called sub chain where
you will convert the bitcoins or
etherium to the other and then take it
forward as part of the blockchain as
well so that is also possible with
respect to does it answer a question
Deepika okay that's great so let's just
summarize what we have talked about
blockchain blockchain basically uses
various mathematical functions as well
as algorithms to create a highly secure
as well as a distributed ledger system
which enables transactions to take place
without a need for a third party or any
need for transaction or Commission
requirement you don't have to depend on
a third party to take your transaction
through and this is one of the key
reasons why the blockchain system is
referred to as a no trust system it's
not that you don't trust someone you
don't have to put your trust on a third
person to complete your transaction it
is something that gets completed without
a problem now let's move forward and
look at some of the blockchain use cases
and understand where exactly is blocked
in being used apart from the Bitcoin
system now these are some of the most
popular domains where blockchain at
presently is being used now we've talked
about the banking domain where
blockchain is currently replacing the
existing as well as overtaking the
current existing system as well as the
payment and transactional system the
Bitcoin wallet system has grown so
rapidly that it becomes quite easy for
anyone to transfer their bitcoins or
cryptocurrency across to other users and
these days as I had mentioned you don't
even need to bother entering that
publicly all you need to do is scan or
unique QR code that is present as part
of the blockchain wallet and the
complete transaction happens right away
apart from that healthcare is a domain
where blockchain
is presently being used to store the
details with respect to the patients now
this ensures that anyone who has access
to this plot chain can access the
details of the patients are such so
imagine what would happen if we had a
nationwide blockchain with all the
details with respect to the patient
since it's highly secure no one can
directly access this detail and make any
changes with respect to it then by
ensuring the anonymity of the patient
but at the same time let's say a doctor
wants to see the details with respect to
a patient all he needs to do is give him
this details given this public key
through which he can access the complete
details present on the blockchain and
get the required data with respect to
that set
similarly law enforcement agencies are
using the option to ensure a highly
accessible database comes up with
respect to the criminals and the crimes
that they have gone so this is something
that you can see coming out quite soon
then coming to the election and working
doing now this is something that is a
domain that is getting revolutionized
with blockchain we possibly might see
the next or the next two next election
made quite easy as well as secure and
feel proof with the blockchain system
apart from that Internet of Things is
another major domain that is currently
using blockchain system to ensure the
transfer of data between the devices
without any Corrections as well as
without any interference as such all in
music market is something that is
rapidly growing - the blockchain system
as well here what is happening is that
the music domain is completely changing
and putting up with music on a
blockchain wherein anyone can have
access to it but at the same time cannot
make any modifications with respect to
that so let's say there's a specific
customer who has paid for the song then
all I need to do is give him the details
and he can take it from the blockchain
as well apart from that real estate
domain is also being influenced by
blockchain and pretty soon I am quite
sure that you will be buying your
properties directly off a real estate
blockchain as but now talking in detail
with respect to the banking domain
blockchain this is the possibility of
cutting down 20 billion dollars that is
mainly taken up by a middleman now this
20 billion dollars is something that
these little mind organizations earn
with respect to a year yes although it
does increase a chance of reduce of jobs
respect to these domains but at the same
time in
what could happen if banks themselves
would implement blockchain and that's
exactly what they are being doing these
days and apart from that the opportunity
of hacking into the band strangers and
making changes with respects that same
is becoming highly impossible as well
for the people imagine what you would
have done earlier was you would actually
hack into the back make the changes in
the ledger take money from someone
else's account put it in your app but
now it's quite impossible because the
only details that are present as part of
the ledger is the transaction detail
which as you know cannot be modified by
a single person because you block change
this design as such also it solved the
problem of double spending as we have
discussed and read how the double
spending problem gets solved this is
something that can be quite useful for
we be stood back in the main system
finally talking about these risks in
world with respect to that same since
you have an idea of what is happening
with respect to your money you get a
clearer idea at this one rather than the
conventional private legislation that
has been followed earlier the next
generation of distributing data system
helps the people get certain clarity
with respect to how exactly is their
money being transaction and where
exactly is their money at the moment
although it again as I have mentioned
maintains anonymity but gives you at
least a clearer picture with respect to
exit now apart from this the payment and
transfer domain is completely changed
because of the security feature that is
being provided by blockchain this
becomes a highly essential factor
ensuring the ease of usage now bitcoin
is basically a system that runs on low
transaction fees and let's say if you do
want a transaction to be computed on a
very high priority then it's up to you
to add a specific transaction fees ok
these are coming back to your question
is remember that you are asking me why
would anyone add a transaction fees if
you don't have to add because this is
very simple let's say at a moment there
are about a million transactions
happening now a minor needs to validate
even though this huge number of - it's
not easy for him to verify all the
transactions that come in at the same
time so what he is going to do is that
he's going to see if there is any
incentive added or any transaction fees
added as part of this verification
process so if there is a specific
transaction at it then definitely he
will pick up the transaction first
rather than a transaction which does not
have
transaction fees a password so let's say
there is a real-time transaction that
you are doing it's a very huge amount
and you need it to be completed
immediately then what do we do is you
can attach a certain transaction fees to
that and this will ensure that your
transaction is on a priority when
compared to other transactions which do
not have a transaction fees attached to
this is another way how - actually make
up some amount of their phone while they
are investing their work sauce but again
this does not mean that those
transactions which does not have a
transaction fees attached to it does not
get verified as I had mentioned in the
process of mining for a new block most
transactions to get added to the ledger
and a new block gets created according
it so only if the new block is created
then do they get revert and to create a
new block we need to add transactions as
well so trust me all the transactions to
get through a partion that you don't
need any specific bank accounts that are
required you do need to be ink your bank
account to your Bitcoin wallet you don't
need to I'll give the complete details
you don't need to attend to annoying
calls that you get from banks and so
forth apart from this your anonymity is
completely made take now as I have
mentioned earlier you are basically
providing the public key as part of the
ledger now there is an upside and
downside to it the upside is that no one
really knows who is the person who has
the most balance or how much balance
does each person have was part of the
blockchain but at the downside all of
you do remember the ransomware attack
there what had happened was they had
requested in terms of bitcoins and they
had given their public ID now even
though the public ID was provided it
does not easy to identify who the person
was at the other receiving end because
their complete details are hashed and
hidden as well so there is always a
positive and negative to certain
technologies as far apart from these
domains election and working domain is
one domain that is expected to change
completely with the involvement of
blockchain using the blockchain you can
always authenticate the identity of
everyone who's voting using their
signature as well as secure their
personal information now this ensures
that we are not quite sure who exactly
has voted for which party but at the
same time their personal information is
valid and this highly secure such
now apart from this it ensures that
there is no word frauds that happen as
well as the loss of a car does not take
place as I have mentioned any
transaction that gets added to the
blockchain becomes a permanent part of
it and you cannot modify it thereby
ensuring that waters fraud does not
happen or any other kind of foul tree
does not exist now this in turn is going
to lead to increase in term because
everyone is sure that no one is going to
know about their boats there is no
damping that's going to happen as well
as it becomes easy for people to become
part of this blockchain and submit their
ports but this in turn is going to
increase the voter turnout as well
because there are certain organizations
that are investing the source to build
an application itself which makes it
easy for people to work from anywhere
that they are wouldn't you like to vote
for your party sitting at home or
working it from the office making it
sure that you have cast your vote you
have made your decision you have
supported for your party at the same
time the details are not leaked and at
your convenience as well now one of the
popular organizations working in the
voting domain is follow my work we
presently are trying to change the
upcoming election ideas and trying to
implement the online blockchain voting
system by maybe the next or next next
elections as well so hopefully let's
keep our fingers crossed because I would
definitely like to be part of a
blockchain system that takes my wood and
helps me support my party as well now
these are just some of the most popular
domains apart from this blockchain is
being used in different domains and you
have a lot of organizations who are
coming in and investing in the
blockchain technology as well now to
give you just a simple idea some of you
might have heard of the concept of hyper
letter now this basically is a cross
industry collaborative effort from the
Linux Foundation to support the
blockchain distribute a latest apart
from that organizations like JP Morgan
and IBM are investing a lot of resource
to build a public blockchain and
increase the awareness at the same time
making a profit out of it at the same
earth show so again blockchain is not
something that is restricted only to the
bank end of me because implementing a
blockchain systems is not very hard it's
quite easy
- how is fundamental knowledge now
moving on let me help you understand how
to work with a blob cheat with a demo
for today's session
now the demo that we will be performing
today is going to be using a PDF idiom
basically is an online open source
publicly distributed blockchain system
to which anyone can be a part of it's
similar to your Bitcoin system itself
now what we need to achieve as part of
today's demo is that we need to
implement a digital Bank which actually
implements the etherium blockchain now
this system has to allow us to do three
things first is make cryptocurrency with
a fixed market supply and token that
represents your world well that
basically means that we need to create a
cryptocurrency which has a fixed value
outside
apart from that we need to autonomously
create a private blockchain as well as
mindful new ethers while validating the
transaction so if you're validating a
transaction and creating a new block you
need to ensure that ethers are being
provided to biess - as well okay
so let's not waste any time let's first
begin by installing go aetherium onto
our system then let's register an
account to go aperian blockchain then we
will be creating a private autonomous
blockchain and finally we will try to
perform few transactions in turn now as
I had mentioned at the start of the
session these are basically dummy
transactions that we'll be working on
but again we should give you a concrete
idea of how a blockchain system works
and how it effectively solves your
problem so first let's begin by
installing blockchain on to our system
now for this the first thing that we
need to do is that we need to clone the
gooey tedium path that is present on the
clip tub repository and we need to
create a local repository as part of our
now we'll be doing that on an Ubuntu
virtual machine so in case if you do
have an Ubuntu virtual machine to your
access immediately you can go on and try
it out simultaneously as I do or even if
you have open to installing a system I
would recommend that you try it out so
we want to go in step by step and I will
be explaining to you completely so even
if you face any challenges at one step I
will be able to assist you with respect
to that thing okay
so first let's begin by clearing the git
repository
now the first thing that we're going to
do is we're going to execute the command
git clone and then we're going to clone
we go aetherium repository present on
git so for that use the command git fuel
now this may take some time so I request
you to be a bit patient while this
command gets executed because the git
repository fuku aetherium is slightly
pay
okay so now that the repository has been
clear let's go into the folder see you
CD go - aetherium and let me show you
the files that are present here so these
are all the files that are present in
the Goethe reham folder so now what
we're going to do is that we're going to
check out the tags or the versions which
are present for Goethe Rhea
for that what you can do you can check
the commit issues so this will give you
an idea as to different versions of go
hit region that are present so you can
use the command git tag and you can see
the different versions of Goethe F since
one point six point seven seems to be
the latest version we will use that as
part of a practical now what we're going
to do is that we are going to create a
branch of the version one point six
point seven for that you can use the
command git checkout tags slash the
version which you want to branch so in
this case it's V one point six point
seven followed by - B branch and the
target destination so what I'm going to
do is that I'm going to set the target
destination to be as head Eureka
aetherium wee one point six point seven
let me just increase the size now let me
just show you the branch for that you
can use the command git branch
now before we move forward and begin the
blockchain execution you need to install
the go language as part of your system
not to do that what you can do is that
you can go to the website so if you
search for golang download you can be
directed to the efficient download page
forgo language and you can choose
whichever packet meets your requirement
if it's up X if it's burnt to if it is
Windows you can choose correspondingly
and install your line now since I am
using a 32-bit Ubuntu version I have
downloaded this packet now it's time for
me to extract and install it as part of
my system to do that let me just open a
new terminal
this maximize this as well
and here let me go to my home directory
where the file is present so by default
it would be stored in your downloads so
I recommend that you open a new terminal
and ensure that package is present into
your home directory so this is the file
that I have downloaded now it's time to
extract this so for extracting and
installing this file you use the command
sudo tar
- XPS following which you specify the
finally always ensure that you are
extracting the correct file so the name
of file is go one point eight point
three Linux - 3 8 6 now if you're using
a 64-bit the file extension which each
and once you specify that just hit on
enter and the extraction and
installation will start but before that
always ensure you are using the sudo
command to execute this because this
requires administrative privileges
now as you can see the goal language is
getting extracted and installed onto my
system and it has successfully extracted
it now what I need to do is that I need
to move it to a specific location that
is my slash user slash local this is we
need to ensure that I have ease of
access to this language when I need it
so for this you can use the following
command that a sudo move
go that is the folder to which it has
been extracted to to user slash local
now make sure that you execute it and
the file would have moved now just to
check if the file is successfully moved
you can go to the directory that is CD
slash user slash local and check if the
file is present here
about that so you
you can see the gold folder is present
once you've done this just close the
terminal
now before you finally complete and
execute this the last attach you need to
do this open a new terminal and here you
can try the command sudo dot quatre dot
bash RC now this is mainly to add the
environment variables to my list of
variables so here there are three lines
that you need to add first is export Co
route is equal to the location where GUP
variable has been moved to so once you
set the go route then what you need to
do is that you need to specify the
working folder for that what you can
specify is the GUP path variable
so for that you can use the following
syntax that is gopath is equal to my
home directory slash project slash
project 1 now this can be set to any
location as per your requirement I'm
just setting it as to the following
finally what you need to do is you need
to add this to your path list so the
command is going to be the following
path is equal to the syntax that has
been specified here that is go path
slash bin coolant goo root slash bin
coolant path video so once you do this
you can save your bash rod RC and close
finally use the command source dot bash
RC to ensure that the bash file gets
restart
now to check if the go line has been
installed successfully just execute the
command cool version
you can see it has successfully been
installed now if there is certain change
with respect to this if you are not
getting this command then you have
missed out on any of the steps so please
let me know in case you are facing any
trouble and forwarding all of you the
commands here as well
great now that all of you successfully
installed golang as well so let's close
this and let's go back to our GUI
theorem terminal and here what you need
to do finally is that you need to
execute the make all command
okay sometimes
tends to happen so what you can do is
close this open a new terminal let's go
back to our Goa theorem folder
and here the sec the go version
this is working so sometimes what
happens is an existing terminal does not
accept the updated value so in that case
is open a new terminal and execute the
following command so now the final
command that we need to execute is make
all so here this execute make all
so as you can see it is getting executed
so what it does is that it basically
tasks it to build the target file as per
the input with respect to it works
again this may take some time so I
request you to be a bit patient
great so with this is completed the
first phase of our demo what we have
successfully done is that we have
successfully cloned the gate code from
the git repository
now the next step is to create a Genesis
block now what exactly is a Genesis
block Genesis block this always referred
to as the first law or the zeroth block
for a blockchain
it basically contains the details with
respect to the blockchain so what we
will do is we first begin by creating an
Genesis folder and then we'll add a
Genesis JSON file into it so what we'll
be doing this in our Goethe reom
directory we will be creating a new
folder called Genesis
now let's go into the genesis folder
and here you need to create a new JSON
file which has all the details of the
Genesis block so for that use the
command get it
Genisys
same in Genesis 3 dot Jason
and let's add the code now what has to
be present in the Genesis block let's
discuss about that now in a Genesis
block you define the different rules for
our blockchain so for that what you have
to do is you need to understand this
code so let me just give you a brief
summary as to what is present as part of
this code now let's start by the simple
things time stamp basically is a time
stamp and X or Y basically is the extra
32-bit memory that you can use to pass
any message with respect to that thing
then comes difficulty difficulty
basically is how difficult is it going
to be to mind a specific law as part of
the blockchain so you can set this
difficulty and modify it as per your
requirement then come into coinbase
coinbase is basically the address to
which the coins have to be sent to after
the block has successfully being mined
then comes a parent hash parent hash
basically is the hash code of a parent
in a block chain every block has the
hash code of the previous block and this
is how you identify which is a valid
block or not so in our case we are
setting the value of parent hash as well
as coinbase to 0 and now we will talk
about both nonce as well as the mixed
hash value a mixed hash value is a value
that is kept fixed throughout your block
check but your nonce is the key value
that needs to be computed by every miner
ok the combination of your nonce
as well as your mixed hash is something
known as a proof-of-work
you need to get a specific hash value
with the combination of nonce and mixed
hash which is less than the set value
for a block how is this value defined
there's a certain mathematical logic
associated to it so let's not go there
now basically what you need to do is
that you need to identify the value of
not once you identify this value and
added it to the mixed hash it should be
equivalent or lesser than the
mathematical value set for that block
now this is where the resource gets
invested the value of nonce is something
that you get by trial and error method
now it was believed that in the year
2040 the value for nonce had to be tried
between 1.4 till 15 quadrillion valves
so you can understand how much effort it
takes this is exactly why I said one
block cannot be completely solved by a
single user and require
a lot of computational power by EIU's
and this is why in today's world most
miners come together to form a code when
the work gets distributed among them
they try out different values
accordingly and once the block gets all
the incentive gets distributed among the
people in work so I hope this has also
given you an idea as to what is a role
of a miner as such okay
so two things that we left out with is
gas limit gas limit basically is the
limit of gas or resource that you can
spend while mining a block what happens
if too many people invest too much of a
source then it becomes easier for them
to mind the block so there is a certain
limit set for that so that is what
exactly is your gas limit and finally a
loss is the last command that you have
here this is mainly used to define a
list of prefilled wallets now since we
are not using prefilled wallets system
we have left it empty here great now
let's add this code as part of our
Genesis block now I have also shared it
with you so make sure you are doing it
simultaneously so let me just add it
here and save it
so once you've completed this we have
done with step 3 now it's time to
initialize our blockchain so for that
let's go back to our presentation now
for starting your blockchain you need to
execute the following command that ask
own /ad Drakkar slash grow it here now
ad data will be replaced by the user
that you have specified then inside the
GUI PDM you need to go inside the build
bin and get and there you need to
specify the data directory which is of
the Genesis file so that is AP diem net
3 in it Genesis 3 dot jason khalipa is
execute this now let's go back to our
home directory and here let's execute
the command that I have just shared with
all of you
now this command will help you start the
GUI period object great now that we have
initialized the blockchain it's time
that we get the guest console asks now
the gate console is important because
all the commands that you need to
execute as part of the blockchain as
commands that get executed on the gate
console so for that we use the following
command where the only variation is with
respect to the network ID where you have
previously initialized the genesis file
here you need to use the network ID 3
console ok I am sharing the command with
all of you
make sure that you're executing this as
well once you've done with this you get
direct access to the case console where
we'll be executing certain commands so
as you can see the get console is
getting initialized and here you have
the gate console initialized
so now let's discuss about the various
commands that we are going to use as
part of today's session so we need to
create new account as we had discussed
as part of the problem statement we need
to check the balance we also need to
mine and check the wallet balance of
each of the - so for that let's go back
to the slide and discuss each one of
them one by one
now the first command that we need to
execute this personal dot new account
now this creates a new account as part
of your blockchain which has a specific
wallet attached to it so every time that
the blockchain mining happened the
wallet gets updated with respect to the
ETA value apart from that the next
command is f dot accounts which will
help you check the various accounts
which are part of the blockchain then
you have F dot block number now this
helps you identify the total number of
blocks which are part of your present
blockchain then you have miner dot start
this starts the mining operation and to
stop the mining operation you can use
the command miner dot stock finally you
have s dot block number which tells you
at which block you are after performing
the mining operation and finally the
command that is f dot get balance will
help you identify what is the balance in
a specific occur now this is basically
the account details that we had seen
earlier this is a hash value and you get
it as soon as you create a naka so now
let's go back to a console and begin by
executing each of these commands one by
one now as we have discussed the first
command that will be executing is for
creating a new account so that is
personal dot new account
now one thing to remember is that a is
captive here
and once you hit on enter it asks you
for a passphrase which is quite similar
to your password so once you set a
specific passphrase it will ask you to
confirm it again once you enter the
passphrase it begins the creation of a
new account and you get the account
number added here now let's see which
are the accounts as part of your present
locked chain so for that use F dot
accounts and it will give you a complete
list of all the accounts part fill top J
so I have been using this blockchain for
a while so there are different accounts
which are part of my blockchain so since
you are creating account for the first
time you will just have one I'd
recommend that you create to a concert
before you go ahead with the next step
so you just need to exclude the previous
command that is personal dot new
accounts to create the second account as
well please let me know once you've done
that ok great so now that you've all
created at least two accounts let's
check on which block I am at present so
for that use a command F dot block
number
and here remember end is capital so once
you do this you get the value of the
block number now I am at three three to
six because I have already abused this
operation before but you may get the
value as 0 because you might be on the
zeroth block okay
so let's start our mining operation for
that which come on are we going to use
that's correct
Aditya we're going to use miner dot
start
do this it may take certain time for the
resource to get allocated and the mining
to start so I request you to be a bit
patient and what we are going to do is
that we're going to execute this mining
operation for the next ten minutes and
let's see how it goes
so as you can see here the mining
operation has started and we are mining
your blocks a square so let me run this
operation for the next 10 minutes and
let's see how it goes
okay so now we have run our mining
operation for ten minutes let me just
stop this so for that we are going to
use the command minor dot stop
and once you execute it if you get true
that means the mining operation has
stopped now let's see which block we are
presently in so for that which command
do we have to use
because we're going to use the command F
dot block number
now if you can see we are at block three
three six seven who remembers the first
block before we started the mining
operation
yes it was three-three two-six so we've
mined close to 41 blocks in just 10
minutes now this is because we have set
a specific value of difficulty if you
want you can increase it you can change
the value of that thereby increasing the
time for mining a block so I request
that you try that out by changing the
values the genesis blocks now it's time
that we go to the last step that is to
check the balance of anaka now let me
just see all the accounts that are part
of this blockchain so for that we can
use the command F dot accounts
now to check the balance you need to use
the command F dot get balance again here
B is capital
that's why the account number so let me
just pick the first account number here
I'll copy it and pass it as a parameter
for my get balance function now when you
hit enter you can see the corresponding
value of ether that is present in this
aqaq now since this was my first account
it has a certain specific value now the
more time that you run your mining
operation more will be aether get
created and added to these accounts if
you see newer accounts they may not have
the same ether that are present that it
gets distributed according to how much
resource has been put in by H might in
this case the first account has been
there for longer time but if you see the
latest account
if I execute this then you see the
balance to be zero because it has not
contributed that much as part of the
school so I would request that you try
mining it for a while maybe try mining
about 500 or 600 blocks and then you can
see the difference with respect to the
latest account that you have added is
that okay are you guys cleared to hear
any problem with respect to what we have
seen okay Deepika is asking me why is it
written five blocks to confirm ok
Deepika
there is usually a weight or a delay
that is present as part of every block
for usually it is three with respect to
a Bitcoin blockchain here it is being
five to confirm so it's always suggested
that you wait at least five blocks to
confirm any transaction or to confirm if
any block is part of earth no blockchain
there is specific fixed period it
changes from blockchain to block now why
that happens we'll be discussing as part
of the next session where we will see
the problems that are faced when you are
trying to insert a false node or a false
transaction as part of the blockchain
okay great now coming back to our
presentation with this we come to a
conclusion of today's session just to
summarize what we have learnt we started
off by understanding what would a world
look like without banks we even saw the
Bitcoin history and how blockchain helps
with the Bitcoin solution after that we
talked about the various blockchain
concepts and the blockchain use case and
finally we saw the demo as part of
today's session so any dots with respect
to today's session any questions that
you have that you would like me to take
up anything that you want on
ratification on
okay so Mary is asking me who should go
for this
I'll put it very straight forward a man
who has an open mind and is willing to
explore and move into new and technology
should definitely go for this course
people who are looking to get better job
opportunities this is also one good
domain that you can consider and people
who are already familiar with Linux
programming and some amount of
JavaScript fundamentals can definitely
pick up this course as well okay so the
puck is asking me how do I 9 actual
bitcoins people how would we do this in
the next session where I will actually
connect to a real-time blockchain
Bitcoin network then we will try to mind
something when let me put it quite
seriously across it's going to take a
lot of time and it's going to cause both
you hand me a lot of stress if you are
open to that definitely we can do it in
the next session that okay the puck
great seeing as - there's no more
questions for today I hope to see you
guys also the next session hope you have
a great weekend happy learning
thank you
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
