years started my career with EMC storage
they moved on to cloud and from there
and to DevOps now so that's a constant
improvement what we had to do as IT
professionals to survive I was doing
some tutorials but to integrate
everything and learnt a box what
industry is looking out for now is as a
complete DevOps office who can do
end-to-end you need to have a bull what
do you want to achieve once you have
that get the right partner in a do rekha
what I found was it integrated
everything in a Concepcion way you know
step one step two step three it's just
similarly you know just do get outside
and then find there's a difference
between watching videos or getting to
him or someone man getting trained by a
real professional was designed then
you're on a cloud and we're on because
here I found a very good architect who
trained me at he explained how it works
in real time what are the you know
interviewer point of you know how he
thinks
so all my new details arrest I use the
knowledge I gained from a Judaica
trainer and it is reka support teams you
know a technical support in 24 by 7 they
so attend our calls actually when a
light session is going on suppose I
didn't understand or I miss the class or
say suppose I didn't understand the
concept on the day or I had to leave in
between I can always reschedule the
course at a different date I'm really
confident I am able to take up a role
with some of the companies as well as
tech need it just boosted my career and
so I give the credit to our director and
to the trainer
