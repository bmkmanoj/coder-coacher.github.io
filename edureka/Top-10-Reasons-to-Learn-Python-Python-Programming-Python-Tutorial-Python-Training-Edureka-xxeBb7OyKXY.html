today I'm going to tell you with the top
end reasons to learn Python now there
are n number of programming languages in
the market and in this video I'm going
to tell you what Python is the best
among all of them and why you should
actually go for it so get ready to fall
in love with Python now let us start
from the tenth point as to why you
should learn this language so at number
10 we have Python which is extremely
simple and easy to learn so python is
easy to read easy to learn since it
closely resembles your English language
it is a very powerful language and it
takes absolutely no skills to learn
Python so Python is free and open source
it is a high-level language where one
does not need to bother about low-level
you can simply write your code in
English and Python will in turn convert
it into lower-level details also python
is an interpreted language where machine
reads and interprets the code wearing
all the arrows are checked during the
runtime now python has a large community
so if you have any doubt at any
technical issue you can see health and
thousands of Python community members on
forums Twitter Facebook Q&amp;amp;A sites pretty
much everywhere now if you compare
Python with any other programming
language such as C C++ B it's Java PHP
or anything so python has outshine among
all its peers now if you see Python you
don't have to deal with complex syntax
for example if you want to print hello
world
you have to write these three lines in
Java whereas in Python just one line is
sufficient to print hello world it's
that simple guys so the tenth reason
lies in the simplicity of the code which
makes the best suit for beginners now
let us go to a next point that is it is
portable and extensible so by
portability of Python I mean python is
supported by the most platforms present
in industry today it could be a Windows
platform
it could be Macintosh as well as you
Playstations upwards Python now let me
talk about the extensibility of Python
so in Python you can completely
integrate your Java as well as dotted
components and even if you wish you can
also invoke C and C++ libraries as well
therefore you can perform cross language
operations with Python
so with this Python is extremely
extensible with most of the programming
languages now at eight point which is
quite the most popular reason to choose
python is web development
so we're programming with Python
provides a lot of choices as Python has
an array of frameworks for developing
website now the most popular frameworks
available in Python are django flask
pylons and web 2 pi now django and in
fact all other frameworks are written in
Python and as the core reason which
makes the code a lot faster and stable
then there is frost which is another
Python framework but it is tiny ant is
majorly built for customizability
there is once you start using these
framework you will never look back to
PHP or any other programming language
now with Python you can also do scraping
which is nothing but fetching details
from any other website and storing it in
your local system you will also be
impressed as many websites such as
Instagram bitbucket with interest a
build on these frameworks only therefore
Python is majorly used in the web
development next at seventh point we
have artificial intelligence so
artificial intelligence is the next huge
development in the tech world now when
it is combined with libraries such as
scikit-learn Python has the ability to
do complex calculations with just a
single statement furthermore libraries
such as Kara's and tensorflow ping
machine learning functionality into the
mix now with artificial intelligence you
can actually make a machine mimic the
human brain which has the power to think
analyse and make decisions on it also we
have libraries such as open CV that
helps in image recognition such as
computer vision you can detect a face or
a color and apart from image cognition
you can also detect a character or a
handwriting as well and everything is
available in Python so all this is a
part of AI and machine learning so
artificial intelligence is the broader
concept of machines being able to carry
out tasks in a way that we consider
smart and hence you can also boost up
the overall productivity of the company
by saving their time and money and all
this can be achieved using Python so
next on my list is computer graphics so
python is largely used in small large
online or offline projects it is used to
build GUI which stands for graphical
user interface it is also used for
desktop application and then we have
game development so tkinter
is the standard GUI library for Python
so Python when combined with
dick until it provides a fast and easy
way to create GUI application then we
have JSON which provides Python scripts
seamless access to Java then also we
have WX Python which is an open source
Python interface for Windows next I have
already told you that it is used in game
development so in Python we can simply
write the logic of the game now it uses
a portable called a spy game and these
PI game applications can run on Android
devices as well isn't it cool guys you
came to almost everything with Python
then our number 5
I have testing frameworks so Python is
great for validating ideas or products
for established companies now creating a
software is not an easy task as it
contains many processes starting from
its design its code and the test cases
and software testings undoubtedly the
most important process of the software
life cycle it is also the challenging
task for a software tester to choose the
best programming language for automation
testing and Python is the best solution
for this problem so it has many built in
testing frameworks that covers debugging
and fastest workflows now there are a
lot of tools and modules to make the
things more easier such as selenium
which is a popular automation tool and
then we have splinter so it supports
testing with cross platform and cross
browser with frameworks such as PI test
and Robert frame book now it has many
great software testing supports and
tools available which helps a tester to
complete its work in less time and much
easier way so software testing is indeed
a tedious task and Python is the booster
for it
so every tester should definitely go for
it next on forth number I have big data
so PI can handle a lot of hassles of
data
it supports parallel computing we can
use Python for loop as well so in Python
we have a library called as pi do where
you can write a MapReduce program in
python and process data which is present
in the HDFS cluster now there are many
of the libraries such as dusk and pius
park for big data processing so i'm just
giving you a general overview that you
can use python in order to process big
data next one third number i have
automation so many people only knows
that python is a programming language
but python can also be used as a
scripting language so in scripting the
code is written in the form of scripts
and gets executed
machine basically runs and interprets
the code whereas all your error checking
is done during runtime and once this
code is checked it can be used several
times so the important difference
between a scripted language and a
compiled language is that you don't have
to worry about running a compiler ahead
of time I think technically is compiled
at runtime that is the compiling happens
when you run the program so by
automation you can automate certain
tasks in a program you can actually open
a browser and post a facebook status so
this is how automation plays a major
role in Python next one second number I
have data science so python is the
leading language for many data
scientists now for years Academy
scholars and PI field researchers were
using the MATLAB language for scientific
research now that all started to change
with the release of fight the numerical
engines such as numpy and pandas python
also deals with the tabular matrix as
well as statistical data and it also
visualizes it with popular libraries
such as matplotlib and Seabourn so
imagine it guys you have large amount of
data let's say terabytes or petabytes of
data and using Python you can easily
gain insights out of it so this is how
Python is majorly use in the data
science domain next coming - last but
not the least is pythons popularity and
high salary it's all very guys and all
the features look pretty interesting but
what about the paper so Python ingenious
have some of the highest salary in the
industry so the average Python developer
salary in the United States is
approximately 116 thousand and twenty
eight dollars per year and if you see
the train Python is still there and has
a strong spike in popularity over the
last one year next there are many big
players in the industry who have been
using Python from quite a long time now
here is Google who is actually using
Python for web searches then we have
YouTube which is largely written in
Python and many other companies such as
Instagram NASA Dropbox Facebook and many
more so I have just listed a few
companies but a lot of companies uses
Python so by this we come to an end of
this video on a personal note guys
Python is ideal and it is completely
capable of doing the job so if you're
looking for an online Shafter training
