direcor and today we'll be discussing
about the Google Cloud console so before
moving forward if you guys want to know
more about the Google cloud platform and
the various services it offers plus if
you want to know how to create a free
trial Google account make sure you check
out our videos the link to it is given
in the description box below and if you
got any other topics that you think that
a director should cover for Google
platform let us know in the comment
section below so let's get started
so the moment you create your free
account or your professional enterprise
account you'll be redirected to this
page now here you have the option to go
to console let's click on that
now counsel will redirect you to the
space and this is basically the summary
of all the Google cloud platform
services that you are going to use from
your account now this thing is based on
project basis the dashboard because the
billing is done on a project basis you
can select your project and the
dashboard will change so let's see what
are the different features of this
dashboard and what are are present in
the summary now on the left-hand side
you have the project info the project
name project ID and the project number
these are the details of your project
which you can change by selecting your
project coming down you have the
resources I will tell you about this in
a bit all the resources YouTube create
will appear here coming down you have
the trace section where you can trace
your data from the past seven days or
the past seven months everything is
customizable coming down we have the
getting started section in this we have
the various tutorials which are offered
by Google to help the big-nose learn how
to create an instance and various other
things which are easy but they need a
certain guidance so coming on to the top
here we have the API overview as you can
see the API requests on the right hand
side we have the Google cloud platform
status it shows the status whether the
service is running or is it in a halt
State or it's not running coming down we
have the billing estimate now this
section provides you with the billing
details in a real time scenario coming
down we have the error reporting where
we can see if we have any errors in any
of our instances or in any of our
resources which we have created coming
down we have the new section in which we
get the news related to the Google cloud
platform and learn about the new things
finally coming down we have the
documentation part where we can learn
about the different resources and the
different services which are offered by
Google now let me show you how to create
a resource and then we'll see how we can
manage it through the dashboard
so guys Here I am creating a VM instance
if you want to know more about creating
a VM instance and various other things
make sure you check out our tutorial
video select your machine type and the
memory you need going to your
requirement and just tap on the create
button and it will create your instance
within seconds
as you can see there we have a pop up
that instance ad regular one is
underutilized you can save an estimated
16 dollars per month by switching it to
the small type so this is one of the
most important features of Google cloud
platform is providing you with instance
details and automatic resizing according
to your needs and you can see them a lot
if you follow these pop ups which appear
here now and then on the right hand side
you can see we have the info panel of a
particular instance you have the labels
and the monitoring part now let's go
back to our home section of the console
here you can see under the resources we
have a compute engine one instance as
you can see our API requests have gone
up now coming on to the top right hand
side you have the customized option as
you can see you can enable the compute
engine you can see the CPU percentage of
the utilization and here you have the
SQL also you can see what all the
storage and space are utilized by all
your resources so as you can see our
compute engine is showing instance
utilization and the CPU utilization now
let me create one sequel instance
I'm going to create a my sequel instance
as opposed to our one is in beta format
select your location and your zone and
just tap on the create button and within
minutes your sequel instance will be
created
while the instances be created as you
can see here on the right hand side we
have the notification bar where you get
all the information about the instances
which you created or deleted or are
being in progress the top and side we
have the first free trial status as if
you are using a free trial account you
have the Google cloud shell and you have
the feedback form and the health form
now on the left-hand side on the stars
bar you have the various services which
are offered by Google such as the
compute engine the storage in networking
services monitoring services and the
various development tools moving
downward we have the pig data tools and
the IRT course
you
the moment our instance is created as
you can see here we have a short
indication of the storage being used
which is the default storage in the info
panel you have the monitoring as well as
the label section now let's get back to
our home
as you can see here under the resources
section I have a compute engine resource
and when cloud sequel instance and under
cloud sequel here you can see we have
the database and a disk byte used which
is indicating which I have used as 1.4
to 3gb
now on the right hand side you'll see
that create cloud sequel instance a
trigger sequel tree has been created
so you can also trace the data which you
are sending from one resource to another
on the trace section here and below in
the documentation if you want to know
more about compute engine the various
services it offers like the Kuban it is
engine the machine learning the big data
and the IRT services
now when we go to the activity section
all you can see here are the various
activities you performed so that
everyone can keep a track and no one can
jeopardize anything in the organization
so as you can see I have created certain
instances and I've deleted certain
instances hey I've got a failed error
which was reported to me by the
notification as well as the error
section which was there on the console
you can filter it according to your
projects I want you to the categories of
the configuration data access
development monitoring or the platform
and you can also filter it according to
the resource type so coming back to the
dashboard so guys this is it I hope you

Google Cloud console and the dashboard
