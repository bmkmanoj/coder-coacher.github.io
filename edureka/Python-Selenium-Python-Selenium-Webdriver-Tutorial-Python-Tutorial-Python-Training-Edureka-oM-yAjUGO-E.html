Rekha and in today's session we'll be
focusing on Python selenium so without
any further ado let us move forward and
have a look at the agenda for today
first we'll understand what is
functional testing then we'll focus on
selenium and understand what exactly it
is and then we'll see the binding
between selenium and Python after that
we'll get started with our first code
and then we'll learn how to locate
various elements from the page source so
you can locate elements by ID name class
hyperlinks all those things we are going
to see later in fish and finally I'm
going to tell you how to take the
username and password for facebook login
so I hope you all are clear with the
agenda kindly give me a quick
confirmation by writing down in the chat
box or if you have any doubts you can
ask me Shivani says looks fine so does
davon Jason I you she jogged the-- or a
fine noise so let us understand what
exactly is functional testing so
functional testing basically means
you're testing the application against
the business requirements function
testing is a software testing process
used within the software development in
which software is tested to ensure that
it conforms to all the requirements now
functional testing involves evaluating
and comparing each software function
with the business requirements so you
have certain requirements so what are
you going to do you're going to check
the functions of your software based on
those business requirements software is
tested by providing it with some related
input so that the output can be
evaluated to see how it confirms relates
or even varies compared to its base
requirements so basically you give
certain inputs and you know what should
be the output and then you're going to
compare the actual output with the
expected output that's what basically
function testing is now there are
various steps in order to perform
functional testing let us have a look at
those steps one by one so first you need
to identify the function of that
particular software that you want to
test on after that you create the input
based on the specification of your
function then in the third step you
determine the output based on the input
that you have provided and then our
fourth step you are going to execute the
test
and after executing the test cases
you're going to see the actual output
and the expected output you are going to
compare both of them and then finally
you're going to check whether the
application works as per the customer
needs so this is basically a general
overview of what is functional testing
if you have any questions or any doubts
you can ask me right now
Shivani says no question Dorothy says no
question
davon jason kion all right fine guys
so let's move forward and understand
what exactly is selenium so what is
selenium selenium is basically a web
testing tool which uses simple scripts
to run tests directly within a browser
or in simple terms you can even say that
it automates browsers now it is a
portable software testing framework for
web applications that provides a record
or playback tool for authoring tests let
me tell you guys selenium also provides
a test domain specific language
Cellini's to write tests in a number of
popular languages for example you have
pearls Java PHP Python groovy so you can
write tests in any of these programming
languages now these tests can be run
against most of modern web browsers so
you can run those tests on Google Chrome
on Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox or
you can even run it on Safari so this is
what exactly solarium is so if you have
any doubts any questions you can ask me
after that we are going to move on and
we'll understand the binding between
selenium and Python so basically we are
going to focus on Python here guys let
me add this thing let us make the
session interactive you won't even enjoy
it if it is a one-way conversation so at
any point of time any doubt you have
regarding anything you can ask me or if
you have no doubts you can just write no
doubts in the chat box and that will be
very encouraging for me so that I can
move forward all right so I've got a
confirmation from almost everyone so let
us move forward and understand the
binding between both of them that is
selenium and Python
so selenium Python binding provides a
simple API to write functional tests
using selenium webdriver
this is where you write your functional
tests using selenium webdriver after
that you send a request to selenium
server
selenium server then runs those tests on
various browsers it can be Google Chrome
Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox or
Safari so this is how it works guys now
let us not waste any time and let's get
started with it so I'll show you the
first code that we are going to execute
today so this is the first code that we
are going to use today over here what
will happen this will open the web site
WB dot PNG and in the search tab it will
search PyCon so it is a relevant search
then it will display the search results
or else the test will fail that's all
that this code will do now let me
explain you each and every line of this
particular code so basically the big
thing you need to import a couple of
modules the selenium webdriver module
provides all the webdriver
implementations the currently supported
webdriver implementations are Firefox
Chrome ie and remote now after that we
need to import the keys class this keys
class provides keys in the keyboard like
return ethanol etc alright so this is
why we are importing these two modules
after that we are going to create the
instance of the Firefox web driver as
you can see that in the bracket I have
given an executable path to the driver
so for Firefox we use gecko driver so
that's why this is nothing but the path
to that CACO driver and then the driver
dot get method will navigate to the page
that has been given in the URL so over
here we have www is an orgy and after
that in the next line an assertion will
be performed to confirm that the title
has Python word in it so this line
basically will confirm whether the title
contains python word in it or not now
before we move forward let me tell you
guys that the web travel provides us
with a number of ways to find elements
and one of this is fine element by name
so over here it will actually search the
element by name that is Q so the syntax
will be driver dot find element by name
Q and the next these three lines we are
actually sending keys this is similar to
entering keys using your keyboard
special keys can be sent using keys
class important from the selenium
webdriver dot common dot keys that you
can see it over here now before we move
forward we need to first clear any three
popular
edit text in the input field so it
doesn't affect our search result so this
is what LM dot clear will do now we are
going to send the keys that is PyCon
that will navigate the Python or website
that is Python to our G and in the
Search tab PyCon will be written now
after submission of the page we should
get the result if there is any to ensure
that some results are found we make an
assertion again assertion no results
found not in driver dot page source now
after that you need to exit from that
particular web browser maybe Firefox
Chrome whatever you're using so for that
we write driver dot quit you can even
write driver dot exit here as well but
driver dot quit will close the whole
Chrome or the whole web browser that
you're using maybe Firefox is well but
driver dot X it will only close that
particular tab so this is how we are
going to write a first code now what I
will do I will open my PyCharm and I'm
going to execute this practically so
first let us impose the modules that we
were talking about so first I am going
to import the selenium webdriver from
selenium import webdriver then we are
going to import the keys class so
federal type from selenium dot webdriver
dot common dot keys import keys perfect
now I'm going to create the instance of
Firefox webdriver so for that I'll write
driver equal to webdriver dot Firefox
and independent this is I'm going to
write the executable path for my Firefox
driver that is nothing but the Gecko
driver I've told you earlier Smith
executable path equal to let me just
copy the path and now I'm going to use
driver get method that will navigate to
a page that will be given in the URL so
I write in here
driver dot ket and open and close
parentheses and parentheses I'm going to
write the URL that is HTTP :
Python dot o-- r-- g-- the next line is
an assertion to confirm that the title
has Python word in it sofa dollars right
in here as assert python and where it is
it should be in title so i write in here
driver dot title all right now as i've
told you earlier as well that the web
driver offers a number of ways to locate
the element but over here i am going to
use locate the element by name so let me
tell you why i am going to use that
first let me open this particular
website and show you
now over here when I go and inspect this
particular element you can find here the
name is equals to Q so I'm going to
search this particular element with the
help of the name that is given here so
I'm going to write here as driver dot
find element by name and the name is Q
so that is why I'm going to use it in my
code as well so let me go back to my
code and show you that so over here I'm
going to write in LM equals to driver
dot find element by you can see it is
there for class CSS selector ID link
text name I'm going to use name Q next
what I need to do I need to send keys
now this is pretty much similar to
entering the keys in your keyboard
but for sending certain special keys you
need to import this particular module
that is a keys so you need to import
that in order to send some special keys
but first let me clear any pre-populated
take to the input fields further I'll
write in LM dot clear now I'm going to
send the key that is LM not send keys so
I'm going to send PyCon and then get the
return so I write in LM dot send keys
dot return now basically after
submission of the page you should get
the result if there is any but in order
to ensure that some results are found we
make use of an assertion so I'll type in
here as assert no result found not in
driver dot page source driver dot page
source and finally the browser window is
closed so for that I can call the quit
method as well as the close method but
the close method will only close a
particular tab in the web browser
whereas the quit method will close the
entire web browser which is Firefox in
our case so let me just call the quit
method cell so I'll type in here as dry
word dot quit all right so this is how
our code looks like if you have any
questions any doubts you can ask me
right now T on Maya
David any questions all right so we have
no questions so let us go ahead and
execute this and see what happens so as
you can see it as automatically open the
web browser and over in a searched PyCon
and yep it was able to find certain
results so what if I remove this
particular line so it will not close my
web browser and you can see that search
results as well so let me go ahead and
execute this
PyCon and you are going to get all the
sources for PyCon so we have an event
Pike on cz 2017 AIPAC 2017 Pike on
Amazonia all right let's not waste time
here and I'm going to close my browser
for now so this is a pretty basic
example guys now what I will do I'll
actually perform the same task using the
unit test module so let me show you that
first let me clear all of this and now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
import the unit test module first so
I'll type in here unit test so the unit
test module is a built-in Python based
on Java as a unit this module provides
the framework for organizing that test
cases so after that I'm going to import
the selenium webdriver which I've done
earlier as well so I don't need to
explain that now import webdriver and
finally I'm going to impose the keys
class so for that I'll type in from
selenium dot webdriver dot common taught
keys
import keys all right so
now I'm going to create a test case
class so basically this test case class
is inherited from the unit test test
case so inheriting from test case class
is the way to tell unit test module that
this is a test case so I'm going to type
in here as class and let me name my
class as paesan or G search and inherit
from a unit test dot test case so I'll
type in unit test dot test case so let
us go ahead and write a method in it so
now I'm going to write in here a method
that is called setup so the setup is
part of initialization this method will
get called before every test function
which you are going to write in the test
case class so basically you are creating
the instance of Firefox webdriver so
self :
and over here I'm going to type in self
dot driver equal to webdriver dot
Firefox and the executable path which I
have told you earlier as well let me
copy that again so now I'm going to
define a test case method so the test
case method should always start with the
character's test the first slide inside
this method will create a local
reference to the driver object created
in this setup method so let me just show
you how to do that
I'll just define that test case method
so I named it as test underscore search
underscore in underscore Python
underscore arrrg and the self so this is
what the test case method is but one
important thing that you should notice
here is that your test case method
should always start with the word test
now basically the first line inside this
method will create a local reference to
the driver object created in the setup
method as I've told you earlier as well
so over here I am going to write in
driver equal to self dot driver
and now I'm going to use driver get
method to navigate to a page given by
the URL so I'll type in here driver dot
get HTTP :
www.eso.org ESO and I delight Python
were in it so for that I'm going to type
in cells dot assert in python comma
where should it search for that it
should be there and driver dot title now
again I told you earlier as well that
webdriver provides us with a number of
ways to find elements but over here I'm
going to find the element by name so the
syntax for that will be LM equal to
driver dot fine element by name and
which is Q and I've actually shown you
why I'm writing Q here let me show it to
you again I'll open my browser and over
here when I inspect you can see that the
name is Q over here that's why I've
written Q so now we are going to send
the keys like we have done earlier as
well so let me I won't explain you much
about it so if you have any doubts you
can ask me right inner LM not send keys
PyCon LM dot send keys keys tour to
return now after the submission of the
page you should get the result as per
the search if there is any now to ensure
that some results are found we need to
make an assertion so I'll type in here
as assert
no results found and then not in driver
dot paid source now I'm going to create
a teardown method so this teardown
method will get called after every test
method let me create that so type in
here as define teardown and over here
I'm going to use a quit method that I've
told you earlier about it so I'm going
to type in here as self dot dry word dot
quit and now finally what I'm going to
do is I am going to write some
boilerplate code to run the test suite
so for that I'll type in if
name equal to equal to Main
and then call unit test dot min so
that's all guys so if you have any
doubts with respect to any of the lines
in the code you can ask me right now
any doubts Maya Devon
Theo and I you see Java T any doubts
guys you can ask me so it'll actually
perform the same function here that we
have done in the previous code as well
so let's move forward guys and execute
this and we'll see what happens so that
started testing and it has open the
browser is well it is going to search
pike on and yep at all tests have been
passed successfully so this is how you
can write tests using Python by
importing selenium webdriver any doubts
with respect to this you can ask me any
doubts guys Devon says no doubt so
desire she jogged see Dave Maya
all right fine guys so let us move
forward with the presentation so we saw
how to actually search for a particular
word in a URL at
www.fiberlinecommunications.com
so you can use this when you know the ID
attribute of an element with this
strategy the first element with the ID
attribute value matching the location
will be returned if no element has a
matching ID attribute and no such
element exception will be this now if
you have a webpage that looks something
like this so over here we know that ID
is equal to login form so if I am
locating the element by ID what I need
to write is a variable and inside that
variable I'll write the driver to find
element by ID and the name of the ID
that is login form pretty easy guys so
we'll move forward and see one of the
other ways to locate elements now you
can even locate the element by name as
we have seen this earlier as well where
we were locating the element by name
you in the previous example now you use
this when you know the name attribute of
an element so with this strategy the
first element with the name attribute
value matching the location will be
returned and again if no element has a
matching name attribute and no such
element exception will be raised now for
instance consider the page source that
looks something like this that is there
in front of your screen the user name
and password elements can be located
like this username equal to driver dot
find element by name and username which
is the name over here as you can see
similarly for password also you can
write driver dot find element by name
and password now let us move forward and
see one of the other ways to locate an
element so we can locate elements where
the help of X passes well what is X Box
X path is the language used for locating
nodes in an XML document and as we all
know that HTML can be an implementation
of XML that is XHTML one of the main
reasons for using XPath is when you
don't have a suitable ID or name
attribute for the element you wish to
look at so at that time you can use X
paths to either locate the element in
absolute terms or relative to an element
that does have an ID or name attribute
for instance consider the page source
that is there in front of your screen
now over here the form element with
attribute named ID and the value login
form if I want to locate that so for
that what I am going to use is login
form driver dot fine element by XPath as
this is the path for that particular
login form so this is how you can find
the element by XPath so you don't need
to worry much about this XPath because
I'm going to explain you XPath when I am
showing you a practical example of that
so let us move forward and see one of
the other ways so we can locate the
hyperlinks by link test we use this when
we know the link text used within an
anchor tag so with this strategy the
first element with the link text value
matching the location will be returned
and again if no element has a matching
link text attribute and no element
exception will be raised for instance
consider the page source that is there
in front of your screen the continued or
HTML link can be located like this
continue underscore link equals to drive
find element by link text continue it's
pretty easy guys
now let us move forward and see one of
the other ways so you can find the
element with the help of tag name as
well
so you use this when you want to locate
an element by a tag name and with this
strategy the first element with a given
tag name will be returned and again if
no element has a matching tag name a no
such element exception will be raised
for instance comes into the page so that
is there in front of your screen over
here is the heading edge when element
can be located like this heading 1
equals to driver dot find element by tag
name h1 which is nothing but welcome so
this is how you can locate the h1 tag
element now let us move forward and see
what are the other ways to locate an
element so you can locate the elements
with the help of class name as well and
you use this when you want to locate an
element by class attribute name and
again with this strategy the first
element with the matching class
attribute will be returned if no element
has a matching class attribute name and
no such element exception will be raised
consider the page so that is there in
front of your screen so over here the P
element can be located like this content
equals to driver dot fine element by
class name and then content so these
were the ways through which you can
locate elements in our particular web
page so let us now move forward and
execute an example now over here I'm
going to tell you how to check the
username and password for facebook login
page so before that what I'm going to do
is I'm going to open the facebook login
page and I'm going to show you how you
can do that facebook.com now over here
I'm going to locate the user name and
password elements so now what I'm going
to do is first I'm going to inspect this
email id and over here you can see that
I can actually find the element with the
help of ID as well and I can find the
element by name as well similarly when I
do that for password I can see that I
can find this element by path ID or with
the name path as well now let me tell
you guys first let me enter my
credentials
so the left hand side you can notice
that there is an FB logo so when I go
ahead and inspect this
so basically when I have entered the
correct credentials that is my
credentials are valid then I should be
able to find this Facebook logo so I can
find this Facebook logo either with the
help of class or I could use the XPath
as well so I'm going to use the XPath so
let me exactly show you how the code
looks like I have already copied it and
pasted in my PyCharm so this is how the
code looks like I will explain you each
and everything in detail first we are
importing the module that is selenium
webdriver I have told you earlier as
well why we are importing that in the
previous example also then we will
import webdriver wait this will actually
wait until the web page has been loaded
it is used for that purpose then we are
going to import time and unit tests I
have told you unit tests as well and now
as I told you earlier is whether the
test case class is inherited from the
unit test or test case so inheriting
from test case class is the way to tell
you the dish module that this is our
test case so this is our test case login
test over here I have defined a method
that is set up and it is part of
initialization this method will be
called before every test function which
you are going to write in the test case
class so here you are creating an
instance for a Firefox webdriver and
I've given the executable path for my
gecko driver then driver target method
will actually navigate me to the URL
that is WWF acecomm and then this is
basically to maximize a window now in
the next line so this is basically the
test case method and I have named it as
test underscore login but one important
thing here to notice is the test case
method should always start with
characters test and the first line
inside this method will create a local
reference to the driver object created
in the set of methods for that I've
written driver equal to self dot driver
then I have defined a couple of
variables Facebook username this is we
username this is the password then the
email field ID pass/fail ID login button
X path so this is IX path for the login
button this is the FB logo XPath that
you get after you have entered the
correct login credentials so these are
all the variables that are
and now what I'm going to do is I am
going to first write email field element
a variable and then a web driver wait
wait
driver comma wait for 10 seconds and
then until lambda driver :
driver dot find element by ID email feel
ID which is nothing but email then
similarly find element by ID for path
feel ID that is nothing but pastels for
password and then after that we have
login button X path and then finally we
need to clear all the pre-populated
searches for that I'll type email field
element dot clear then we are going to
send keys that is Facebook username and
then Facebook password and click on
login button element that's all then I
should be able to find the element by
XPath of FB logo that is I should be
able to find the FB logo now this
teardown method will be called after
every test method this is a place to do
all cleanup actions so you can write
here a driver torque weight method or
you can even use the close method I told
you the close method will close only a
particular tab with the Firefox but the
quit method will close the entire
Firefox and the final lines are some
boilerplate code to run the test wait
that's all so let us go ahead and
execute this and see what happens let me
first change my facebook password and
write the correct password here
now let's go ahead and execute this
instantiating test
it has entered the email ID and password
and click the login button it was able
to find every login XPath
so all test has passed successfully so
this is how you can actually test the
facebook login username and password if
you have any doubts any queries with
respect to the example that I've shown
you or any other part in today's session
you can ask me right now all right Maya
says no questions so does Jessica Janice
tea on Jason Mahesh I you she jogged
Eeyore it fine guys so everyone's clear
so by this we come towards the end of
today's session let me just give you a
quick summary of what all things we have
discussed till now so first we saw what
is functional testing then the framework
that is use of functional testing is
selenium so we understood what exactly
selenium is I gave you a brief
introduction about selenium then we saw
Python and selenium binding and then we
started writing our first code in which
we were actually writing an element in
the search tab president one of the URL
that is pythons Auto RG then we saw how
to locate various elements from the page
source we saw how to locate elements by
ID name class tag hyperlinks all those
things right and then finally I
explained you how to test the username
and password for facebook login page so
if you have any doubts any questions you
can ask me right now my assay is
excellent session Thank You Maya I'm
glad you find it useful
Jana says the session was really helpful
