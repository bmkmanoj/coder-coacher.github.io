the automatic updates so we can set up
automatic updates for the young so that
all the packages can be updated on
monthly or weekly basis the ways you can
do it you can
first install yum cron which is another
package so young - by install and
they've the name of the package which is
yum Khan and then you type yum update
then you say check config yum on which
is in to ensure that you know your
service is running the m'kraan is
running then check our config yum cron
is on okay that is volume down and then
you have these two config file that you
can edit and can make changes if we have
to in exclude you know some packages
from being updated you can you know
enter it as yum parameter
- external - access PHP in this case any
kernel upgrade or the PHP upgrade will
be excluded so - X is - excluded these
are the set of commands that you need to
follow and you know then it will take
care of that okay now let's talk about
the version control system I hope many
of you at least are aware at least one
of the version control tool SVN or it
used to be CVS earlier it's a very
famous one or very popular one which
used to be get is another you know
package installation tool that you have
or the source control sorry sorry I kind
of got diverted so git is another source
control revision control tool that you
have we are going to practice in fact
get and then we have other packages like
new perforce or the tools like perforce
google code bitkeeper and all that it's
being used to be very popular by the way
but now git is gaining a lot of
popularity get is by the way it written
by Linnaeus Torvalds I'm sure most of
you are aware Linus Torvalds is the is
the owner of actually Linux kernel he
wrote the
colonel now let's start with the version
control system or revision control
system and why do we you know we think
that is required now if you see the
picture on the right hand side on the
slide it talks about the baseline
version and then you have you know a
different version which is version 1 2 3
and so on then you have different kind
of subversion again in you know on that
or the revision so version one has
revision 1.1 similarly version 2 has
revision 2.1 version 3 has revision 3.1
and 3.2
right so what are the you know major
version and you know what are the
division or the bug fixes so you know
suppose you're using a particular
version so suppose iOS has say yearly a
you know yearly release now they are in
nine and in between you may see that you
know they have 9.1 9.2 9.3 and so on
available these are you know the sub
release you can say or maybe the you
know they may have some bugs reported
and they have a fix for that
so you will have say version 9.1 9.2 and
9.3 available but they may still have
annual release where the next release
will be with maybe version 10 now if you
are a developer you have to ensure that
your codes are or the application codes
are really organized so in the sense
suppose you are working on your the
developer who worked on say version 9
and now you have to ensure that you know
whenever there is any bug reported you
branch out or you create a branch in 9.1
right and then you make the fix on that
one at the same time you may have a set
of developers who will be working on
maybe the future release which is
probably version 10 now they will be
working on version 10 but maybe you are
you or maybe couple of other folks are
helping you fix any of the bugs reported
out of the version 9 release so then
whenever you release a new one on say
version 9 any bug fixes on version 9
that will be say 9.1 or if there are any
further bug bugs reported you will have
say 9.1 or 9 or 2 and so on
right so this is how the version control
system works and the reason why you need
this is what if you have to go back to a
previous version as an organization you
need to have the different version of
the software available somewhere and
some repository which is called the
source control system or revision
control system yet so far now to do that
as I mentioned you have different you
know tools available
Espeon which is by apache no Apache
foundation
that is one option get is another option
and then you have you know many other
tools I will be like per first moving
couldn't be better and so on now on git
you might have also heard about you know
github as well now as you might have
heard about git or github as well in
some cases now we'll talk about that one
but just to give you a high-level info
github is a hosted environment where
your application application code can be
pushed to a central system git is like
in a client you know just like you know
you have booty as a client to connect to
the server
git is more like a new client that is
installed on your local machine or some
in our case will actually install it on
our Linux system through that you push
the changes or you push the application
code to github and github is as I said
is a hosted environment or hosted set up
now talking more about the revision
control system here if you see you know
three developers are working together as
a team and they check in their code to
SVN system right and from SVN system
which is the source control or revision
control system you create a build out of
it know from your source code once the
build is created on the left hand side
you see staging environment so you push
the code or the build to staging
environment or more like you know
non-product repro environment you test
it once it is all tested and verified
then you push the co2 reduction or live
environment this is again kind of
high-level this is how it works okay now
it talks about why do we need revision
control system so Praveen has a question
on github yes like server and client
setup yes that is how it is going to be
so we'll practice on that in fact now
why do we need revision control system
so it is very important for due
diligence it is essential for any form
of distributed and collaborative
development so suppose you are a team of
say 10 people
for working from 10 different locations
maybe now you know in this case this is
distributed in a development environment
but collaborative because maybe all 10
of you are working on say you know on a
common project so all 10 of you need to
be in sync and all 10 of you need to
have your files stored in a common
location and that is when the version
control or revision control system is
needed in a very large organization
where there are many developers working
on a project distributed working on a
project or the same code it is required
to make sure that they maintain the best
working code so that means there's needs
to be a central place where they can
check in their code or store their code
right or application code every change
made to the source must be tracked means
who made the change why the changes were
made what time the change we are made
all those details need to be tracked and
stored somewhere right so in case say
for example if you are working for
Facebook I mean Facebook page when you
log in when you go to the Facebook page
when you try to log in you have the
login and password in the same example
row but whatever organization decides to
display and to have the login page
similar to maybe Yahoo or Gmail now they
may ask you to you know make the change
but you want to record it like you know
who made the change
why the change was made when the change
you know what was made and all that this
to maintain the history or the revision
history now here this is a comparison
between SVN and get his bian as I
mentioned is from Apache foundation so
servers SVN is same as salvation version
is an open-source version control system
it was founded in 2000 by a company
called collab nate and then later you
know patchy to cover and now it is owned
by Apache foundation SVN employs concept
of atomic operations that prevents
corruption of database and then SVN does
not use peer to peer model now in case
of get git is a distributed version
control system
which is designed and developed by Linus
Torvalds which is you know talked about
earlier get supports very rapid
branching and merging and include
specific tools for visualizing and
navigating you know which is as I said
you know the github right where you have
this hosted and you will see that you
can see all your files and everything
through your web browser you have full
history tree that can be viewed offline
means you have your own git installed on
your local system right so and that can
be viewed or you can make the changes
even in offline mode it is distributed
and uses peer-to-peer model it is of
course the distributed model you know
teams can be located in different
locations are and they can still work on
the same codebase
