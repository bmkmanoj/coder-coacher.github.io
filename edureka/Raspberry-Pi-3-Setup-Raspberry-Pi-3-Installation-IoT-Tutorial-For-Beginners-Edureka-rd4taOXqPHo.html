welcome to this session on raspberry pi
in solution now raspberry pi is one of
the most popular Internet of Things
device that is present out there in the
market today and today as well as the
session we'll be learning how to install
raspbian which is one of the most
fundamental and the most popular
operating system on top of the raspberry
pi hardware okay so now let's start with
the raspberry pi OS installation I'll
help you understand how you can actually
install raspberry pi operating system
once you've bought the raspberry pi okay
so we will divided into different parts
first let me help you understand the
different operating systems that are
available at present okay
raspberry pi in itself supports multiple
operating systems as such but will
mainly be working on raspbian okay so
these are some of the most popular
operating systems supported on raspberry
pi so you have RISC OS you have FreeBSD
operating system you have net bsd
operating system plan 9 is again from
Bell Labs as well as Windows has its own
Windows 10 off IOT version okay so for
this session we're not going to go into
the Windows 10 we stick to the core
Raspberry Pi operating system now for
downloading the operating system you can
go on to the original site that is
raspberry pi dot o-r-g and there in the
Downloads tab you can download the
operating system let me just show it you
okay so this is the Raspberry Pi
homepage and here if you go on to the
download section you can download the
operating system now if you are starting
off with raspberry pi an Internet of
Things trust me this is the best place
that you can find a lot of informations
with respect to it okay most people
actually publish their details with
respect to the projects that they are
working many popular projects are also
available you can find a lot of help as
well as good information here ok so this
is definitely the place to go to if you
go onto the download section here ok
this will either show you two options
you have noobs or you have raspbian I
would recommend that you go with notes
because this is a complete package with
respect to the different operating
systems as such so here again you have
noobs and noobs like so my
recommendation would be you download
notes and make sure you using a 32 GB
memory card but if this would be really
helpful because it gives a lot of memory
for your operating system so in case if
you're going for a 16 GB or below I
would recommend you go with the noobs
line but make sure you keep the bare
minimum of 16 GB in case if you are
working with Raspberry Pi but do not
mistake me when I say use a 16 GB memory
card you can install it on an 8 GB s1
but again the operating system has less
memory to work with so at least go for
16 or higher 32 is what I would
recommend so once you download this zip
file or you can even download it by a
torrent ok but I would recommend
download it as a zip file let me show
you the file so this is the noobs file
let me extract this ok it may take some
time it gets about a 1.5 GB file ok the
lights version is slightly lower in
comparison but this is something that I
would recommend in case if you're
working with Raspberry Pi
ok so I have my noobs folder here so
what you need to do is that you need to
copy everything inside the noob folders
and then paste it inside the SD card ok
make sure you are not directly copy
pasting the folder that you have extract
so what happens is if you do that it
does not actually recognize the
operating system as part of the
Raspberry Pi so copy everything that you
have extracted and then directly paste
it inside the SD card now again this is
why I recommend that you use a
high-speed memory card because in case
if you are not using it then what
happens is that it takes a lot of time
with respect to fetching the data ok now
as I had mentioned if you're going for a
memory card for your Raspberry Pi you
can use something like a 16gb at least
and make sure it has a high transfer
speed so this in turn will give you a
lot of memory area to work around with
as well as I would recommend you take
something like a class 10 memory card
that is available in the market today so
these have a very good read and write
speed ratio so definitely this is
something that you should consider while
you're getting a memory card for your
operating system ok now once we are done
copying with this let's go on to install
this memory card on to our Raspberry Pi
and let's begin the installation process
okay so now we've successfully copied
all that is needed for our operating
system so safely remove this make sure
you're ejecting it safely but then
sometimes what happens is if we do not
safely eject it the files get corrupted
before you load it into your Raspberry
Pi this is a certain issue with respect
to the memory card so just eject this ok
so this is my Raspberry Pi and if you
actually flip it over
this is the slot where you have to
insert the memory card and we've copied
the noobs folder into this memory card
again let me just insert this into this
and let's begin with respect to the
installation process
let's begin installing this memory card
on to my Raspberry Pi and start with the
setup
so let me just turn though on my
Raspberry Pi
okay so this is a screen I'm getting by
default again now what happens is the
installation steps B initializes so the
raspberry pi is getting loaded
okay now there are two operating systems
that are present here by default and we
want a raspy and so let me just select
raspbian and click on install option
present here now if you see here it
basically is telling me that it requires
4.5 GB so this is why I was recommending
you to get at least 16 GB or more
because if I have an 8 GB memory card a
4.5 GB goes off with the operating
system itself then there's not much
memory left for me to work around with
ok now let me just click on install
okay just before I do that in case if
you are using a different language or if
you want to use a different keyboard as
well you make sure you are specifying
that okay
so there are different languages present
here so choose the corresponding
language as per your requirement okay
once you selected that this click on
install and this is just basically going
to ask you whether you want to format
your data and install the operating
system on top of this so click on yes
and the installation process has begun
now it may take some time so I request
you to be a bit patient because this is
an operating system installation process
so please be a bit patient and hope you
have fun meanwhile
okay so now as you can see the operating
system installation has completed
successfully
once you hit on okay it's going to ask
me whether I want to be wood or it would
automatically reboot as well okay so
yeah it's automatically rebooting at
this point
you
okay now as you can see the Raspberry Pi
operating system has successfully been
installed okay so this is what your
Raspberry Pi operating system would be
looking like okay so this is raspbian as
such there are different operating
systems that are available today for you
to install that we have discussed
already so let me go back to my slide
and let me just summarize the
installation process again now if you
see here we started by downloading the
noobs folder and then we move Anton to
extract the folder and copy it into the
sdcard
okay make sure the SD card is empty as
well once you're done with this insert
it into the SD card slot and then we
have completed with respect to the
installation process all right that's
great so now if you successfully install
a Raspberry Pi on our devices with that
hope you have a great weekend thank you
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it

and queries and we will reply to them at
the earliest do look out for more videos
