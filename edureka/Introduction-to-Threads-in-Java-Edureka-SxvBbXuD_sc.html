through threads in the previous classes
we learn hash map hash table we learn
ArrayList everything now we'll move
further and we'll go through threads
okay so moving forward first of all what
is a thread a thread is a part of
execution in the program so what is the
use the java virtual machine allows an
application to have multiple threads of
execution running concurrently so that
you can get the multitasking feature
available in your system in your
application so you have got different
you can use different threads so that
multiple tasks are done simultaneously
in the background okay so one third will
do one particular thing the second third
will do something at the same time this
way you're saving a lot of time or a lot
of time as well as your application is
becoming fast okay that is why we use
thread as well as they are very
lightweight okay they're lighter than
procedure and processors so it takes
less memory as well as the execution is
faster now let's see a small diagram
where threads are used in our day-to-day
lives in our computer so your card your
supercomputer right here or anything
that is your computer now with that
computer you've got playing video you've
got another task you've got notepad
opened up downloading files playing
games browse internet music player so
all these things you can use
simultaneously you would have used it on
your system as well as well so have you
used it let me know do you do multiple
tasks all together yeah exactly so how
does done it is transferred threads okay
these are all different sets that are
working simultaneously that are running
simultaneously now let's consider one
example that off
okay Nikhil says I'm downloading a
torrent right now
exactly you are taking class and you are
downloading a torrent right now so that
is multitasking now similarly when we
talk about a music player with
about one thread even in that particular
search you have got different sets
working tardes playing songs managing
playlists accessing internet downloading
updates okay so you've got multiple
threads working all over the place like
anything okay they make the processing
faster it provides you multitasking
music layer isn't actually an
application okay
the previous slider if I say these are
thread so far a supercomputer these are
different threads right for a
supercomputer these are different
threads but when you go inside so
musically RS on itself is an application
in that application you've got different
things present over here so these are
different threads for a music player
right so this was just for the idea so
that you can understand what is the
function of a thread and why do we use
it for achieving you multitasking now
why do we use it
threads is a light-weighted process as
it shares the same memory and the
resources of the process in which it is
created okay so since it shares a
particular kind of memory in which it is
created so all these threads will be
using the same memory this way they do
not need much resources and they are
very lightweight at heads okay so that
is why we use thread in our day-to-day
applications that we make this could be
a diagram so it will be using the
resources that are available in the
process right here in this particular
process itself so threads threads and
different words it will be using the
same resource but and hence it will be
lighter than others lighter than
processes okay
because process require a different
resource for itself so that it could run
now let's see a very small lifecycle of
a thread okay so first of all your
thread starts new program starts said
your program will be starting the thread
using the runnable you can you make the
thread weight using the weight function
that is available and it will be
unlocked okay you can send your thread
to sleep it will be sleeping for
sometime and again it will start
executing so you can stop your thread
using a sleeve function that is
available similarly when the task is
completed that completes tasks it gets
terminated it ends after that ok so this
is a small life cycle it can go to
weight it can be sleep put into sleep as
well as when the work of the thread is
finished it will finally die it will get
terminated ok so I hope you're clear
with this small diagram moving on now
thread methods that are available for
you ok machine says yes clear you create
a new thread ok when you have the start
you'll be using T dot start T is a
thread so when you have to start you'll
be calling this function that is T dot
start it will come to ready state after
that you can notify
T dot notify or notify all these are the
two functions that are available because
simultaneously they could be many
threads stunning and when you have to
send a message to any other thread but
you can use you can use notify T dot
notify or you can use the notify all
function that is available for you now
after this starting the thread if you
want to run the thread I'm sorry I just
told you notify first after starting the
thread you'll be running the thread by
using T dot run it comes to the running
state either after running it executes
the complete task and go to the
terminated state or else you can send
the thread to sleep by using T dot sleep
or T dot wait ok now this for at this
particular state it is blog the thread
is not doing anything okay it is
stagnant at that particular moment after
that when it is coming back to the ready
state it will notify the other threads
that I'm coming back by using T dot
notify or notify all again it will come
here T dot try and come to the running
state do its job and finally terminated
or comes back here so this is the life
cycle this is the functions those are
called in the life cycle of a thread now
there is one more property there is one
more thing that is available with the
thread that has thread priorities ok
when multiple threads are running the
order of execution of threads
one on priority given to the thread okay
different thread you can provide
priority to a different side now it when
multiple threads are running it it will
be running on the basis of priority if
you want okay if you put the priority
one two and then seven so first one will
get executed first then two and then
seven okay
so priority value ranges from one to ten
and the default value is five because it
could be that you haven't defined the
priority of your thread in that case it
will take the default one that is equals
to five okay and in order to set the
priority of a particular thread you'll
be using set priority and priority
you'll pass the priority within that it
got me one Tilton and method to set
priority this is the method to set
priority so if the thread name is T then
you writing t dot set priority brackets
int priority that could be one to ten
okay so I hope your clear birth priority
as well what is the priority of a thread
now creation of threads and multiple
ways they threads can be created in two
ways implementing runnable interface or
you can use extending threads class you
have got a class that is thread using
that class you can create a particular
thread or you can use a runnable
interface that is available in java
using which you can implement that
interface and you can create a
particular thread okay so I've got two
ways in Java run email interface and
thread class now first of all
implementing runnable interface how to
create a thread using the runnable
interface so the code is like this you
have a class that is thread class you
implement runnable okay as soon as you
implement whenever you have a method
that is public void run and within that
your right system dot out println hello
from a thread okay so it will be
creating one thread now you gone to the
main class using the thread class object
you'll write thread class object equal
to new thread class that is object of
class thread class which will be a
thread so thread thread thread
underscore runnable is equal to new
thread you pass the object within that
okay so this is the function that you
have to use this is a thread class you
write trade runnable and you write new
thread you pass the object within that
and hence using this you can start the
thread that is dot start okay so let's
see the example on eclipse now okay
so first of all I come to creating
threads first through runnable so I have
my examples thread class I've got thread
class equal to implements thread and I
implement the runnable interface within
that I have a function that is run okay
okay add an implemented methods as soon
as you implement the interface that is
runnable you'll have this method that is
public void run and within that you can
print a statement okay
whenever the thread runs hello from a
thread and now you come to the main
method in the main method what you did
thread class object new third class you
paint in the object of class that is you
defined right here that class then using
the thread you've got a class thread
available in Java so using that you
write thread right thread runnable you
make an object you write new thread and
you pass the object of this class in
which you have implemented the runnable
interface you pass the object and
finally thread and the school run able
dot start your thread will start
executing so when I run this code okay
as you can see hello from a thread okay
so this is a thread that is running
right now now we'll be using the second
thing that is extending thread class now
what I do I have the same class that is
thread class extent said of the function
like system hello from a thread again
now package comedy Rekha in that
I create an object okay similarly so I
get back to my presentation I go to the
second one I'll just close this one main
thread thread class okay so third class
extent said and when I come here I can't
do the same thing this time I'm doing by
extending the thread class and I had to
pass the object into that when I run
this code
I have hello from a thread okay this
time I'm extending a class that is
thread right here now we have got the
thread class I extend this class that is
thread I have got I implemented a method
so that I can understand that I'm using
this class right I come to the main
class in this I have created an object
of this class itself that is thread
class obj new thread class now you got
to think that since I have extended the
class I can use obj dot start but that
will give you an error why it is because
what you are doing yeah you cannot
access a method that is start okay it is
not defined I will just show you once
again when you come here you'll find
that the method start is undefined for
the tied thread class okay hence you
cannot use the start method to start the
thread they will have to pass this
object into thread class itself on an
object of thread class and then only you
can use the function that is start then
only it will start a particular thread
okay like you have got this start okay
synchronize void start you can define it
right here as well and in which it is
calling super dot star so you can use
this function right here in your main
thread okay so if I right let's try it
rule seven I come on the top obj dot
this time I'll have us
a new threat class search laws I've got
a function that is thought okay that
means we can implement runnable and
extend thread also yes alone you can do
that okay and the thing that I was
trying to do I'll just try it and I'll
post it on become Nidhi itself now we
were on methods that are available with
threads so you've got end get priority
for getting the priority of that
particular thread void set priority you
can set the priority as in the priority
you can pass within that word sleep that
will be of long milliseconds world join
will be also on long milliseconds
threads current thread gets stayed set
name get state and now this day the
difference between guested one is
returning a thread the other is
returning the string now void start run
wait notify notify all stop and yield
okay these are the different methods
that are available with threads you can
try each and every one of them one by
one okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
