called s you see what losing is all
about what you see is all about
so whatever the search mechanisms you
are doing so far okay
yeah because I think the such mechanisms
like whatever the operation will be okay
fine whatever the such mechanisms so for
example when you are going to Google and
you are searching something right Google
and you are searching something you've
got any keywords or you want to search
so the base is the search mechanisms I
loosen it's a very powerful library for
doing this such but it is targeted
towards them text library search for
e-text library search to a lot of
machine language the other points like
mahute except for all those things you
just boosting very very effective it's
an index system it's going to be index
the data whatever has been provided it's
going to index the data and you can do
so when you provide in totally data of
different standards so you're going to
give a paragraph let's consider you give
a paragraph or you give a paragraphs on
some level of things and the best way to
do always providing the search is
indexing if you index something if you
say 0.1 this is going to come at point
two this is going to come then only you
can search it effectively otherwise you
can't search effectively right you
understand quite so any amount operator
given by the user it may be from a file
or it may be from the string solution is
going to make it indexed so once it puts
in index so it's going to provide you
the search in a very very very fast
allocation compared to other tips so for
example if I have paragraph and in the
paragraph I on to find a particular word
okay so so if I add so for example if I
give you a paragraph let's consider I
have a very big paragraph and in that
paragraph I want to find how many times
this word has repeated name do subscribe
this is what most of these cases are we
always have to find in a given document
in text how many times together repeat
that or how many times the particular
text just maybe that we have to find so
what is the best way of doing the best
way of green is index see the verge in
the paragraph that's what losing is
going to do it very very effectively so
when you index something it's going to
make your life very very is here to
search so that's been losing comes up
it's a full full let's text search
engine so what is going to do is that if
any words can be big or small and etc
even a big file also loses is going to
index in such a way and also it's going
to provide very very powerful cooling
mechanisms so that you can query it
effectively okay
that's what reducing is all and losing
is the moves really use search engine
doing like food etc and all you sluicing
to a very very very interaction
okay so losing is very very pretty here
so particularly the very latest version
of fiber name for points you I have
targeted towards this so hibernate such
as targeted loose into a very very very
credential
okay all the real-time analytics however
you see loosen up okay so that's the how
using keep enumeration tentative so
touch the power of the framework it's a
very strong indexing mechanism you can
revamp the indexing whenever you want
you got it - it's not like all miss you
have to group so if I won't invite you
to eat I have given a paragraph after
some load of that you can again go back
and front the indexing again if you
don't the indexing again and again again
and so that the search will be very very
much affected finance but it so it's not
a problem
you can you can go back and run anything
you can schedule it anytime so that
makes the energy very very easy for it
when you touch it it automatically index
all the words or developer has an option
to index for SES subs or developer is
also having an option to index box you
can provide a file and you can index the
data and inside ok I'll show an example
sentence color is it possible to create
index with every word yes yes it can do
it it will do it that's the powerful
mechanism after loosing if we modify the
paragraph yes you can you have to rerun
left so for you - curricula
what I'm trying to say you can do it we
do it's a very powerful mechanism to
only so so basically what it does
for mechanism is pretty simple
okay it is is it possible SQL DB or no
SQL DB also estimate in the Reg we are
going to see that
so now interesting you want to
anachronistic loosing is now doing on
the file system I burn it is going to
use loosing to work with the data
business this is what the brilliance
icon it is going to do the same level of
thing whatever happens I burn it is
going to do with database average that's
why the search engine is going to be
very very effective maybe a spear up
Louis for input that's why I burn it now
become a very very bigger impact in the
market particularly the next light when
you speak or no second which is going to
be very very interesting the loosely
NoSQL
make Cybernet very effective because of
loosen is something which is coming with
analytics well now you can use unlearn
things on your database data because
loosen is there right so this makes
things very interesting okay so the main
magma of closing is a powerful powerful
indexing you can even you can write
yourself with a separate index idea you
can say these are the themes I want and
I already get only these things you can
even say that
okay and the search as a second it is a
very very very powerful searching
mechanism police you can frame your
queries for very very very clear
direction okay fine I am showing an
example you know I'm going to open an
example now I will show you what are the
index writers etc finding them
I'll show an example so you can see that
thank you
I just will open example I'm just going
to the slides we'll come up with an
example introducing okay so the index
Center but the the name index sub cell
itself the beeping plus finding we are
building classes then there general will
be classes products in their searcher
and indexing you can have any number of
classes suppressing them these are the
parent yes
okay so losing is basically what it
described lose that any amount of text
provided by the user will be taken in
index and such will be provided with the
very very powerful query mechanisms on
top of them so this is what using is
telling I believe me or not true
delusions from most widely used in get
analytics
okay now let's take a news piece of such
I'm going to have a pine system or I'm
going to have an basic paragraph
perverts I am going to do level of
examples so first developer example is
searching second level of example is
going to do index I won't do only to do
one indexing and what I have to do so
let's go back all these practical smells
good right now pickles are always a good
thing to see
okay everybody able to see their clips
and I get a quick yes
place yeah so let's see let's see if we
firstly
Oh the indexing is going to happen
inclusive okay so this is an indexing a
very basic Java code so if you see here
loosen is has unique provide the data
what you are toward it so I'm telling
this is taken apart and it's telling
telling me where I have to create rain
dances so let me give a new location
index on those for you because all the
day than this example right so now what
it does it creates a file system
directly reached all the finds available
under this data
okay uses an index vector file in its
writer is the garret built in class
can you will see rearrange fine and
writing it so but it's pretty day next
what happens it is trying to get a
document by document whatever the line
is available from the file it gives one
lane at a document and it tries three
things in Delphi what is that content
what is the mean what is the part where
I got the content for which file I have
can't cut the content and what is the
paper so now let's take the gate of us
the deed is done it stated it so ei you
welcome data okay so I'm sorry I'll
prove you eat is ready I also three
level of points so edit with notepad
plus plus something is that anyway I
guess I do so let's open all the three
files it said you repress the leaving
group on online training provider
reading only makes life easier for
learner fine good one yeah fine
so same thing I will repeat it the same
things nothing else trap them let's take
another front so these are the three
facts sets to participation let's see
how effective it creates indexing then
we'll go for searching so many this is a
java application save query remix it's
just total files index p just even
before I finished it in Van Elst our
application it says I mean it's a
complete files so it has gone through
all the words it index very very very
effectively so let's go back and look
how can be that much out that much
faster indexing say next
I must renews the folder we have given
for indexing it clear into only of
indexing finest now this makes it so
it's now going to search views on terms
efficiently traded index funds you see
the ROM on the speedy can't win the rain
it's three files in order to do even a
file open and close will take some time
but it has created right so now you go
back let's do a basic tortoises such
even your thing on top of that
okay let's say 13 so this is the
standard I'm using a very basic static
analyzer but is what the point I'm
trying to say is I'm very very very
powerful
Cody algorithms so you can pass them to
me you can say which is a worry of to
such ok if you want to see what is it
what is a good IAM to such etc now now
when you run this application ok
now interestingly this is ready come
very fast you know why because it came
from the index I I even can't go to
speed controllers right
I created an even three files it indexed
I'm asking Tel Aviv and already record
comes this and you gave me three effects
is what unifies coming I'll make three
it and this is what I got output this is
quite amazing quite if I open the file
even a controller I don't know just
watch boss this is where I don't lose it
is extremely important okay so now what
I burn it you can do it this I'll use
case outside she understood thing so I
have created one three files which I
have created three fine side even those
three fights equator index and such is
just like this everything happen in a
macro sense so you may understand how
much powerful use in structures that's
why the idea with exposes quit now now
the use case we are continuing our
Internet is going to provide so we are
to do in tables no right this is not it
this is not it's understand losing is
very very powerful to the file system so
in cyber neck is going to give a
solution so let's see what I believe is
going to do so what I believe is telling
I am going to use the same loosing
concept but this time the index is going
to be created for the tables in the
database for industries right I when
it's now coming back and telling I am
going to create index for the tables
indicators whatever you are doing with
the file system I am going to do the
same level with my tables so this is
where the interesting thing hibernate
that's why I do
recent releases of a grenade was
extremely powerful because of angling
dipped the powerful using technology on
the already available data this is
something quite interesting quite so
this is something new something you
protected to the complete foot can you
do a DB combinations
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
