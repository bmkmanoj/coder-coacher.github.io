this is the fifth process of the
knowledge area project integration
management and the inputs to this
processes the project management plan
work performance reports change request
and after change request what we have us
the standard EEF which is enterprise
environmental factors and then comes
your OPA which is organizational process
asset so you should be very clear in the
last two and what I need to now tell you
over and above the names
of the respective processes that the
monitoring and control area for this
particular knowledge group has two
processes in it the one which we talked
on is monitor and control project work
which we just finished and the second
which we are into which is performed
integrated change control so this is the
second area in the monitoring and
controlling yes first area from the
project integration management
perspective okay so let us look at the
perform in Tagaytay change control the
tools and techniques they remain expert
judgment and meeting which is the item
which we have used in the previous
process the change control tool is
something which is coming up as the new
item in the tools and technique the
output what this process yield is yields
into is an approved change request
because it is the process of the change
control so of course it would lead into
the change request and approach change
request various change locks because you
are making the changes and the another
two outputs remains the same as our
previous process which is project
management plan update and the project
document updates so what is the process
of change management I have shared with
you on this process may be in various
discussions let me bring it back again
to you with the words which I have used
during the discussion call a CCD which
is a change control board let me start
with the first activity in this process
so change management is a process which
is a process of raising the change
request and why the
created as that once you start reviewing
the progress once you start reviewing
and tracking the progress of each of the
process areas you realize that the
output which is getting produced this
output is may or may not be in the line
of the expectations or with respect to
the baselines what we have aggrieved and
that forces you to initiate a change
request so that the remaining portion of
the work we can execute and implement in
a way that I meet my project objectives
I meet my final baselines and that is
where there is a need for us to put
those change requests so once we raise
our change request the change the
wrister gets updated we also look at the
impact what this change is going to
bring in on to the various other
processes and we also involve the
subject matter experts to look at
whether those kind of changes which vary
which we are going to bring in whether
they would be leading into the any
search impact on to the other
and before we go to the change Control
Board it is expected that the project
management team and the project manager
they have done the impact analysis and
you have considered what are the
positive and negative impact of a
particular change which you who are
gonna bring in so remember one thing
before you go to the change Control
Board it is expected that you guys have
considered all the possible options to
look at why the changes is needed and
the why Cannot you manage with the
change so you have considered all the
pros and cons very clearly before you
put back those changes back to the
management and that to be change Control
Board change Control Board has the right
either to approve or to reject a plan so
remember sending a change request to a
change Control Board does not always
mean that you are going to get an
approval out of your change request
there can be a some shortcoming in the
impact analysis which we have done and
the change Control Board realized and
maybe they have a perception this messes
the analysis what we have done they feel
like that no this change is not really
needed and the team can still manage to
deliver without this change so the final
decision of the approval or a dismissal
or the rejection lies with the change
Control Board very clearly and Inc
the change Control Board approves a
particular change in that scenario
you'll have to do the planning all over
again because that change would have an
impact on all the subsidiary plants all
the different processes and just think
for a while that you had initiated a
change request to the time maybe you
realize that for some unforeseen reasons
the project is currently running late by
two months you had raised that concern
to the change Control Board with all the
justifications with all the impact and
you realized that by putting up the
extra efforts by expediting various
activities the best you can do is that
you can only mitigate about one month
out of that two months lag what you have
even if you put in the additional
manpower so that means if the change
Control Board has actually approved a
another one-month extension to your
project then this one month activity
would have an impact on each of the
planning portions of your processes and
very clearly you might have to replant
those activities and bring back all
those activities back into this thing to
ensure you are matching up to meet those
timelines and why that is needed is that
because we have very clearly understood
that once the project is getting started
lot of those processes they would
interact with each other in various
stages so at lot of places you would
have seen that the output from a various
process is being fed as an input to some
process so if we are not in sync then it
would we would not be meeting up the
time targets and this is what I meant by
the replanting of all the activities in
each of the individual processes yeah
so when we are into a perform integrated
change control once we are into the
perform integrated change control VR
into the monitoring and control process
group area we are into a knowledge and
group from the knowledge group so we are
into a project integration management
and we are on the fifth process from the
project integration management
perspective all right just so that you
are clear so we heard about
configuration management so once we are
doing that change will have to also look
at the various mechanism various
opportunity that this change would not
impact the other activities and if it is
impacted we have to replant those
various activities so configuration
arrangement activities are basically
identifying what are the items we'll
have to reconfigure any status
accounting that means pertaining to
various the configuration status
anything which we'll have to redo and we
need to also look at the verification
and audits this is pretty much needed
from the most of the industry's
perspective and you talk about the
configuration management
if for testing if our testing
construction line the results that the
output what is actually getting
delivered is something not strong enough
so the configuration of various
ingredients will have to believe of that
if the initial configuration was
actually telling you that you will have
to use maybe four portions of the cement
to be mixed with the other ingredients
and the quality aspect that comes out
and very clearly says that hey this is
not strong enough you might have to
reconfigure and see whether you you need
to use the six portions of the cement
from that this is maybe from a
construction perspective again let us
look at managing the integrated change
control so project managers then they
need to protect the project scope from
being change
remember scope baseline so one should
try the best to ensure that the the
scope remains the same because the scope
is one thing that if the project scopes
is getting changed it would have a major
impact on each of the sub processes
which are there as a part of this
project and with the change in the scope
I am afraid this would directly lead it
lead to the more cost and maybe due to
more time and this is what we mentioned
on a triple constraint so if you disturb
one the other will get disturbed pretty
fast and
to correlate back with chapter which is
called your project stakeholder
management and this is where I
emphasized that once we identify these
stakeholders it is in the project
managers interest to identify all these
stakeholders in the beginning of a
project and if you have identified the
majority of these stakeholders before
you have frozen on the scope that would
be the best thing for a project manager
to deliver because once you have
finalized the scope and then my first
stakeholder it is asking for a change of
the scope then it is going to be a very
tough task for you to bring in a change
in any of the critical constraints so
the early you identify your stakeholder
is better it is for you and it would be
easy from a stakeholder management
perspective and to keep them satisfied
if we know off the changes the
suggestion the concerns well in advance
so as a part of the integrated change
control a project manager must provide
for identifying a change which is
proposed or which has already occurred
influencing these stakeholders so that
the approved changes are incorporated
into the project work
remember if these stakeholders are not
satisfied you will not get the
satisfaction and maybe a kind of the
mindset from those people into the
project the project
must provide for reviewing various
contents reviewing change requests and
you should maintain and manage the
changes by B change the quest any change
done here should reflect back a change
in the baseline which is your the the
triple baseline along with the quality
which is time scope cost and quality
considering the impact in a change
request on the rest of the project as
well as considering all the knowledge
areas which is going impact we might
have to redock you meant everything and
look at from the perspective of the
continuity on the defect repair
validation and the quality control so
this is what which covers up the
managing integrated change control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
