so HTTP stands for hypertext protocol it
is used for it is underlying protocol
you Bible by web it defines how messages
are modified and transferred what action
web servers and browser should take in
response to different command and your
entry you enter a URL in a browser and
HTP command the sent across your web
server to a fetch and transfer to get
pages okay so we let's see these are
what does this protocol means so this
particular protocols has a lot of
commands okay like I am sure you may
have heard of this your get command your
post command delete there are various
kind of such command so what you do is
you know when you see a wwo on
google.com or whatever is in the backend
you are actually sending a you are
actually sending a protocol like this
okay you send your protocol like this
what is saying is get me that file get
me the file the file name is it's in
this path and yeah and and its name is
file dot HTML and please use protocol
WonderCon
this is what happens when you type jww
google.com or father
okay so gate is to get all your web
pages so this way when I when I'm
browsing it's a key we are using a lot
of this gate gate but it can also be
used for the purpose now imagine a
situation where you're going to say
doing a registration say looking at
ticket or whatever in this case what
we're trying to do is we are sending
some data which we have typed in of the
Paige to the web server right and what
happens there is this web server in turn
captures all this data and then call the
respective language in which it is
processed okay and and it does the
processing it could be a submit or
retrieval or whatever that may be and it
comes back into your page so for that we
use this protocol called up okay I think
it's up mentioned here it's use a
protocol called post so like that h HTTP
has multiple probe get post what those
things mean okay so are you getting this
any questions here
okay so so this is however our HTTP a
program or our webserver actually works
then if you notice this HTTP server has
a lot of these so you get this you know
numbers like 200 or 400 which is pretty
much common okay
and sometimes you hear this fine so if
it's errors on your internet are quite
frustrating especially when you do not
know the difference between ugly so
these are ways that called it HTTP
status codes okay our response codes
given by the web server and leaves help
to notify the cause of the problem but
so what are these it support to know
these codes and and it helps you to bug
debug this these Enfamil equals 100
means it is continued that means just an
informational code if it's 200 that
means the webpage has been downloaded
and there's no big problem if it's 300
that means that URL does not exist and
it's redirecting you to another place if
it's 400 that means that URL does not
exist and if it is 500 that means I
think if you if you have if you've been
developing any applications you would
have noticed a up when you notice that
the dump
ship event in women you're kind of doing
a registration you you have to call some
programming language if that programming
language in a simple case may not have
an execute permission then you also get
such a door lights okay so this is there
are these errors I and they are the
disease are the different title that's
all you get you know your status or
keynote or web as such
you
okay now there are actually so many web
servers that are in the market and so
many of them the most popular is Apache
and it today the second most popular web
server is what is called as nginx okay
I'm sure you might have heard of this
it's becoming the second most popular or
web server in the market followed by
your microsoft iis internet information
server and a host of other servers that
are are there but of assitant continues
to be the most important and the most
powerful okay the most important the
most powerful and the nginx kind of
coming up to be the next most important
now the configuration of your apache now
that's a very simple thing you you have
to install your web server okay that is
through either it could be if it's
centos it's going to be httpd
installation then it just has a single
configuration file okay so it just has
single console configuration file which
is called your h OD p dot corner and the
directory where all your objects are
kept when i say object this is your
images your HTML files or or your or any
other files that you want to solve
through the vet are kept in this
particular path
okay so this is how this is configured
as it but the N end of cause we're going
to the labs of all of these things any
questions okay then um once you you have
configured it there is you start your
service your the service is called httpd
okay
and if you make some changes in your
HTTP can't con a file if you want to
immediately take effect we do this
command Condor reload okay so it will be
example like adding a new domain into
your configuration file so we add this
and then we reload the whole stock okay
okay so if you look at your ad p dot
connect you will have a lot of a lot of
these configuration configuration setups
and then the sum of all our of all these
like routes over this this specifies
your where your documents are going to
be located and in this case your Val W
HTML easier route server okay
then keep alive better server allows one
or more requests per connection okay I'm
not sure how many of you are loaded then
I do a browsing through any other
browser it is not a single connection
actually there can be multiple
connections so what happens in multiple
connection means that I'll be open to
different to different sockets to
connect to this particular so each a key
just helps in improving your speed and
the things like that now keep alive is
another situation where I I do not want
to opening a creating socket every time
I try to connect to a web server and and
any time I also connect to a web server
I want to use that existing connection
to actually send the request and what
happens is if I don't say keep alight
I'll be keep opening up and be sending
my connections to new use of it every
time I want to process something so this
helps in kind of doing a single single
pipeline is complete always opened up to
do a to hit multiplex is basically
multiple start servers sex a how many
server process you have to start so when
an Apache start there is a server
which starts up okay so what does this
is so this server handles each other
client requests but if there is only one
server and then I can only start then
only one guy can actually connect to it
so but what he does is each such child
versus so max a requisite the total
number of the kids each child server
process serves before the child acts
okay so that's your charters and max
client 60 total number of server process
that can run at one time and so what
that means is then when somebody says
that I'm able to process thousand
requests per second it means that the
server is designed to handle thousand
clients simultaneously and therefore the
backpack okay and then you have the
mints pair and Max fit if number of
servers waiting for a request is less
than min server it creates some and if
the number of so is waiting for request
is more than max it kills some so what
what this does is he actually the light
engine X engine X has become so popular
s every time I had to connect to a
server I'll have to spawn a socket okay
I will have to spawn a socket the
spawning of the socket is a very
expensive process within your server and
it takes definitely some milliseconds
for this to happen now if there are
thousands of them it's very difficult
for your server to handle and it goes it
starts going slow okay so so that is why
sometimes you instead of waiting for
some time to come you keep some minimum
servers ready and if you feel that it is
actually going it's time for so many
goons are you going on
I actually feel this so that is why this
min and Max servers are okay
any questions
you
you
okay so uh yeah as I said it's the most
widely used it's an open source product
every every flavor of units this
actually has a zone so you might have
heard sometimes there is an IBM HTTP
server oracle HTTP server now they are
all Apache servers rebranded by these
organization basically they are using
just a I mean Apache as a server to do
the services okay so as a part of so the
whole idea of having a big server is
definitely to do some kind of uh Ted
serving now for this content serving to
happen we have to integrate the store
DNS otherwise we'll have a problem right
that's what you see now how the web
server itself is placed in an
organization depends on how do you
design a fiber and as always as I said
firewall has three legs you're a public
side your private side and what is
called as the DMZ or the demilitarized
zone kind of a site okay so all your web
servers or any server that needs to be
internet facing are kept in your public
side sorry in your DMZ side and all the
DNS s that and all the DNS entries which
needs to talk to these servers are kept
in the public dns not in the internal
DNS oh yeah so that means you need to
understand if it's sir if you keep using
the internal DNS then the public who is
going to come will never find this
server so you understand I am sure you
understand why it has to be captain Lee
and then now you also get a confusion
here you have an Apache server which is
serving the Internet right
what about the internal users so what
they do is now to handle such a kind of
a scenario internal DNS will have to
create its own entry to actually point
to this product so normally they don't
do a forwarding
they will create another pointer or to
this to the web server so that it could
handle but when you are in a DMZ zone a
DMZ zone you could move from internal to
Z a DMZ but not at the external site and
external could come from outside to the
DMZ so it dmz is like a quarantines yeah
it's a bit of a current time it's a
controlled area there people from both
places could come and interact yeah you
know it and this is to keep all other
unwanted users away FP whole idea of
this particular set right patch I can't
run in two modes three for a prefect and
birth curve multiprocessor mode prefect
mode three mode creates one thread per
process each of the channels one user
requests in preform mode process handles
one connection only this process this
thread safe whereas in worker mode
creates new process tool but each has
more than more than one thread and each
of which handles each always having one
request per user in worker mold
processor handles more than one
connection okay see this is an
architectural design of your application
okay so there are two ways for your
application to be designed okay now
let's take a telephone example right to
answer this particular a solution okay
now if I'm making an individual call
I can't talk to anybody in either the
person the other side can talk to
anybody isn't it
it's just a one-to-one connection and we
can't just get out of that loop right
but imagine if you're doing a conference
we have simultaneously many people
handling many many people coming in and
talking and and it's a completely
two-way right it's a two-way talking but
it's a conference there are multiple
guys who are getting connected there so
Apache server has also been designed in
there when I say pre poked it is
one-to-one and when I say multiplayer
mode that means one socket can handle
multiple connections okay so what is the
advantage so what is the advanced if
there were this challenge called 'm c
10k a c NK now this particular challenge
i probably not know who might have who
actually started off the opposite
conceiving it yes the the the challenge
was can i use my existing dev server and
can i have 10,000 simultaneous
connections I'm talking of not DIF
always the earlier service I am I think
these were ever give times when you had
that one Giga processor can it handle
10,000 connections Apache server not
because to handle such a kind of a
connection you need to have very fast
CPUs and equally good amount of memory
okay
only then you could handle it now so
they so they realize that in a prefect
environment this would not happen so
they designed this architecture of
worker mode way of processing in which
if I had 10,000 connections right I
would not open 10,000 sockets
I will I sorry yeah I mean you're
welcome owed I won't open temple I will
just Oh
up from 1020 of them and we 1020 can
then handle IT 10,000 people so that's
the architectural different just like
how how you're wrong the analogy and the
analogy is basically the big you know
group chat and group or conference calls
work that is because there there is a
day of slicing and slicing and waiting
and dicing I mean lot of things in terms
of how that multiplexing happens there
it's a time division there that each
though though it appear that everybody
is together there is definitely a a
serial way of connection which is
happening but we do because of the speed
of the process we are not able to feel
that you feel all of them are happening
together simultaneously okay are you
reading this any any questions that are
arising in your mind
okay so yeah the limiting factor as we
all know has been the memory which is
always been a problem for all the
internet hissing gets the server's right
and the potential to deadlock they block
threads that are contending for the same
CPU and memory so if you thread this
stop the use of eights for the web page
to appear until the prison makes it so
it gets in back the paper thread is
deadlock it does not know how to do
stuff thus remaining a stop okay so when
does a deadlock happen deadlocks happen
when there are too many threads if there
are too many threads I mean we know
right when there are too many people
there is a general chaos if if they are
trying to seek an attention of some
particular stuff right so the same thing
happens within the CPU itself and and we
don't know how the deadlocks happened
right because everybody are given a
certain amount of time to process and
during this time if that particular
webpage is he is not able to get then
there may be other guys who are trying
to vie for that CPU time and during this
process certain threads can just get
hung and it gets hung and then nobody is
able to process so that's why the
deadlocks kind of event it could be any
reason you really don't know how and
what is the reason behind them a lot of
these deadlocks
