the paint object the paint object
represents the brush right you use draw
themselves in the ondraw so let me just
first tell you show you the example and
then only you'll be able to make some
cues out of it so here I have the
drawing brush application so here I have
created two classes one is the drawing
brush to Java which will be holding the
activity all right in this application
if you can see I'm not specifying any
layout if you all can see I am NOT
specifying any layout because what I'm
ultimately doing is I'm creating a class
which will be extending the view plus
all right and you can see that my touch
view plus I go on to here you can see my
touch view event class extends the view
plus all right here what I am doing is
I'm creating various variables so I just
first run this up for all of you so that
we can talk about the all three
parameters one by one so if I try try to
draw anything you can see there's a
circle and there's a line that is going
along can you all just see that the
circle arc along with the line all right
so let's talk about these attributes one
by one now so here what I have is I have
few objects just remember there are two
objects that are working for the line
and there are two objects that are
working for this circle so here are the
voice for objects that I have de paint
the path the circle pane and the circle
path all right only my even touch view
what I am doing is I am set
of the parameters so the parameters are
the ones that I'm using in my
application for example the paint region
that I have available to me is the
complete region alright so that is where
these parameters comes into picture you
can see the parameters being wrap
content and wrap entred all right then
I'm sending some site type of styles to
my paint that is the line that I'm
drawing here you can see that the
anti-alias equal to true the color black
the style the stroke join the stroke
width as to how big the width of the
stroke is similarly for the circle paint
attributes I'm having some attributes
like Andy a Lea's color style stroke
join stroke width now what I am doing is
I have a parent linear layout alright
then I'm adding some few buttons on to
the parent linear layout the reset
button if I click on the reset button or
the clear screen it will just clear up
or you can see that path start reset and
then post invalidate so that it calls
the draw again aren't we on raw this is
the method that gets called whenever I
am drawing something onto the canvas
I say canvas not drawn robot but with
the help of paint method and circle path
with the help of circle paint object
these are the touch events like whenever
I move up move down what should happen
here so I'm just saying path dot move to
point path dot move to point and
similarly path reset if my action is up
tell us I have taken the I have taken
Mikey up that means my path hat can be
anywhere now I do not need to hold the
old but all right so that's what I'm
doing here
and finally calling invalidate which
will just force of you to draw again
so I I'll let you all take a look here
at this particular sample code I just
just tell me whenever you have finished
reading the complete line then I will
just scroll down alright so I had
requests you all to take a look and if
you have any problems you can ask me up
onto the chat window
I have used canvas few months ago ball
movement with collisions assuming zero
friction and no energy loss from
collision so have you created that
application on Android Allah three would
you like to show us the application that
you have created do you have the machine
with you is this the same machine are
you build the application on you have
the source code with you
so take your time and if you feel like
you're whenever you are ready you can
just tell us so that everybody can take
a look at what all you have done all
right all right so I should scroll down
under two so that everybody can see it
just let me know whenever you are
finished with the code read up if there
is any problem you can let me know about
them and if you have finished with the
code code reading up and understanding
what exactly the code is right and then
you can just let me know about
as if in order to save what we have
drawn under the screen you have to take
a screenshot of the image of the screen
all right there are actually multiple
ways of doing that either you can have
the gesture recognizer that you can use
in your application for a signature type
of component all right you can have it
like that or what you can do is you can
find out ways how you can capture the
image from the device itself all right
so there are two ways of doing it if you
want to capture something like an image
you can have the gesture recognizer for
that gesture libraries of Android if you
want to save it up as a text or
something then you have to have the
various recognises D text recognizes all
right such but I scroll down further
I hope everybody everything is clear
with everyone here any doubts any
queries that you people have so let me
tell you about all the possibilities
that you can use here asked if
invalidate what it actually does is it
removes the current view and asked the
view to be drawn again it's like a not
suppose you want to repaint if you I
don't know whether you people know about
it or not it's very much like a repaint
method on canvas alright so these are
the various properties that have been
used here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
