eureka and welcome to this in eureka
life session on getting started with
Poppaea
now papaya has gained a lot of
popularity in the recent years and has
become one of the most widely used
self-service business intelligence tool
in the market let's move forward and
look at today's agenda to get a better
understanding of what we'll be
discussing as part of the session we
first try to understand what exactly is
self-service business intelligence
because you need to understand what this
approach is before you understand about
popular after that we'll move on to
understand why we need to use power bi
when there are different tools in the
market that help you do the same moving
on from that we'll talk about what
exactly is power bi and then towards the
second half of the session we'll be
working on a demo wherein I will be
helping you understand how we can create
a report as well as dashboard using
power bi so I hope you guys are
definitely looking forward to this
session we so let's start with the first
topic of today's session
what which is what exactly is
self-service business intelligence now
self-service business intelligence
basically is an approach for data
analytics here the end user does not
need to have complete detailed technical
knowledge while working with these tools
he needs to have simple understanding on
these tools before he goes on and works
with them using these tools he can
actually perform various operations on
the data like filtering the data
segmenting the data analyzing it
transforming it visualizing it anything
that he wants as per his required now
what you need to understand is that
there are mainly three approaches while
you're working with business
intelligence - the first approach is the
technical tool approach here people who
have complete knowledge with respect to
the tools are professionals who got good
understanding of how databases work how
ETL operations work how these tools have
to communicate with each other how the
database connection has to be maintained
and so forth but this basically
restricts people from using these tools
only people who have technical knowledge
will be using these tools then you have
the end user business intelligence tool
here and people who have no knowledge
but have a specific requirement use
these tools as such here mostly it's
drag-and-drop operations that you would
be
farming using these tools as such third
approach is the self-service business
intelligence approach this as you might
have assumed is a middle approach with
respect to the earlier mentioned
approaches here people who have
technical knowledge and people who do
not have technical knowledge can use
these tools as per their requirement so
as I had mentioned this approach is for
people who come from both backgrounds as
such and this is one of the major
reasons why these tools are gaining a
lot of popularity in the industry today
now once now that you understood what
exactly is self-service business
intelligence approach let's move on to
understand why exactly you need to go
with power bi when there are different
tools that help you do all these
techniques as well as these operations
on your data now here are some of the
major reasons which I feel made power bi
stand across the different tools in the
market now anytime that you're using a
tool the first thing that comes to your
mind is the cost factor ba bi basically
is a free tool you can go onto
Microsoft's website and download the
power bi desktop as well as logon and
create an account and begin using the
power bi service application it's quite
simple and easy as such power does have
a pro version but again do not worry
when I say a pro version because it's
going to cost you as much as 10 dollars
a month just to use the pro features
okay now in comparison to other business
intelligence tool let's take table for
an example you need to have you need to
spend close to thousand two thousand
five hundred dollars just for a single
users license but here the same work
almost the same operations the same
visualization you can completely use the
pro version of power bi at the cost of
only 120 dollars so with respect to the
cost factor
definitely power bi is one is packing a
big punch here now let's say you want to
integrate various applications with
respect to your tool you can do that as
well let's say you want to integrate
your power bi with respect to a
different application that is also
possible
power bay provides you with various
applications which help you in to create
your data integrate the power bi itself
as well as integrate various
applications with each other as such now
this one major factor helps you bring in
your data from different sources as well
as helps you provide your visualization
and analysis on different applications
as well now if you are looking at power
bi just as a visualization tool then the
first thing that would come to your mind
is with
spectra the customizability of the tool
how much can you customize and visualize
with respect to our data here are power
bi obeah is not behind because ba bi
gives you a range of about 30 different
visuals pre-built it apart from that you
can use various custom visuals that are
available on power bi store let's say
none of this meets your requirement not
a problem you can go on to build your
own custom visual using power bi now if
I'm using a business intelligence tool
and I am NOT someone who has good
technical knowledge the first thing that
would come to our mind is how easy is it
for me to interact and use the
application now with respect to the user
interface as well as the user
friendliness power bi stands across with
respect to of huge margin okay it's very
simple for people who come from
technical background as well as non
technical background to interact and
perform various operations with respect
to their needs in Poppaea now machine
learning is one of the biggest buzz
words in the industry today
once you integrated your power bi with
the ovule service then you can bring on
your data to Microsoft Azure and then
perform your machine learning on our own
once you've done that you can provide
your analysis as well as your
visualization using power bi so power
helps you with respect to the final
representation as well as the analysis
of the data that you are achieving
through your machine learning operation
now reports and dashboards are something
that are quite essentially important for
all of us we need to have complete
access to them and we need to have the
access to them at any given instant
there provides one of the creative
mobility factor into this apart from
being easy to access on your on your
desktop as well as on the cloud service
you can also download power bi a mobile
application through which you can
completely view the reports as well as
dashboard and get an insight as well as
access to your reports anywhere at any
time now
coming coming to power has a technical
person the first thing that you want to
do is that you want to play with your
data you wanna analyze it you wanna
perform various operations with respect
to your data before you go on to
visualize it so in that aspect also
power bi is not behind you can integrate
power bi with our when you can write
your a scripts to process your data as I
had mentioned you can integrate various
applications which will help you perform
your analysis
but again let's see you if you're coming
from a technical background you want to
be a bit old-school you want to write
your SQL queries you want to put across
all the queries filter out your data
separate your data select your data that
also can be done you can put in your
queries and perform all the operations
as you want now one of the cool features
that power bi offers is the integration
of power bi with microsoft personal
assistant cotton this in itself makes it
quite easy for interaction and quite
user friendly yes sir
it's always helpful to have someone
there to help us in case we are not
comfortable with that tool right
definitely now these are just some of
the major reasons which I feel that make
our bear the most popular tool but this
does not mean this these are just the
only reasons okay because there are
various other reasons and to give you
just a simple fact
Poppaea has helped Microsoft stand in
the leader Quadrant with respect to
Gartner ranking if you see the previous
few years if you see 2015 2016 Mike
Microsoft had actually had a decline
with respect to the growth in popularity
for power bi Microsoft has again come up
in the race and it quite seems possible
that Microsoft will take our tablets
position as the market leader as well so
I hope you guys are clear with respect
to Y power bi stands up when compared to
the other tools in the market ok so
moving forward you might be wondering
what is probably I have been talking so
much about power bi so let me address
that question as well
Pavel basically is a cloud-based
business intelligence tool using this
tool you can perform various operations
like data integration data analysis as
well as build interactive visual
visualizations and reports are such now
it's not just a single application it is
a collection of various software
services applications and data
connectors which work together and help
you create various visuals and insight
and analyze and integrate your data as
such now again with respect to the
capability of power bi specialization is
one of the best in the market analysis
and integration are one of the key
features that come as an add-on with
respect to a data visualization - now if
you're someone who's worked with
Microsoft bi then you might be wondering
ok
is this something that's going to
replace Microsoft Pia to be
straightforward no but seeing as to how
much power bi
growing over the years I can definitely
assure you it is quite a possibility
okay so moving forward let's try to look
at a demo for today's session now what
we'll be doing is we will be starting
from scratch we will be building a power
bi report and then I will show you how
you can create a dashboard from the
report that we have built okay now
before we move on to our power bi
desktop the data set that we'll be using
today is a product and sales data set
okay
this is from a superstore in US and it
will the data actually was collected
from 2013 to 2014 now what exactly are
trying to achieve from this demo we
basically want an overview with respect
to the products that we have we want to
understand how our products are with
respect to which segment has which
product and how many products are
present in different categories as well
apart from this will also try to achieve
an overview from the manufacturer
perspect will try to understand which
manufacturer provides how many products
in which segment as well as in which
category okay so let me go ahead and
show you my power bi desktop
so this is my power bi desktop okay so
you can all download the power bi
desktop from the bar from the website of
power bi okay my team will also be
sharing the link across with you so you
can use the link go on to download power
bi desktop okay and why you are
downloading power bi desktop please
ensure that you are signing up for power
bi okay this is important because only
and only if you sign up with power bi
then can you access and publish your
reports on power bi service which is the
third product from power bi now again
coming back there are mainly three
products from power bi you have power bi
desktop which is a desktop based
application where you'll be creating all
your reports as well as performing all
the operations on your data then you
have power bi mobile application which
is an application on your phone which
you can use for viewing your reports and
dashboards as such the third is power bi
service
so immediately once you sign up with
power bi you get the access to power bi
service
so this is my power bi service here you
can build your dashboard for edit and
modify your existing report also you can
import workbooks that is Microsoft
workbooks into this to use for different
data set users different data sets I'm
sorry as well as you can integrate
different applications here ok now if
you click on the apps option you really
need a presence there no apps present
here but once you look at the complete
list of applications through which you
can integrate your power bi that is you
can integrate these the data present or
here on to the power bi or you want to
have a live communication between these
applications and power you can just
integrate the application as such now
there are multiple applications and
every day there are new applications
coming in husband so this definitely is
something that you should look out for
okay
coming back to my power bi desktop so
this is what it would look like once
you've logged in and opened your power
bi desktop ok so first let me load the
data so click on get data okay so these
are the different data sources from
which I can bring in the data to my
power bi desktop you have various types
of files you have various databases you
have Microsoft Azure services as well as
various online services available as
well
now apart from that let's say you want
to load from web page you want to bring
you want to load a HDFS file you can do
that if you want to bring us a scrip you
can do that as well so there are
different options here no this is also
another contributing factor which has
helped our bi CRO as such because if you
look at the other data visualization and
self business intelligence tool the
number of data sources from which you
can import is quite restricted okay and
I'm not even using the pro feature so
these are available to me as a standard
input itself okay
so let me just click on connect because
I'm going to load an excel file with all
the data present here so this is my file
and once I have selected my datasource
bobbya is going to give me an overview
of the data present in the file before
it actually loads into power PA so here
in this file there are six different
pages and each has a corresponding table
so I'll just show you the tables present
here so you have date you have
geographical details manufacturer
details you have product details now we
will be mainly working with the product
details but what I would be doing is I
will be loading all the tables as part
of the session because I can also show
you how these tables will be related by
a power pair when you load in multiple
tables as such now once you've selected
the tables that you want to load just
click on load option and power bi begins
loading these tables now since this
table is a slightly big table it takes
it's about 30 MB file so it may take
some time
meanwhile if you do have any questions
you can pull it across in the chart box
and my team will be able to answer your
questions as such
okay so here you can see the different
tables being loaded now one thing I want
you to do is I want you to keep your
interest here so here you can see it's
detecting relationships that is it's
trying to identify how these tables are
linked okay now keep that in mind we'll
be coming back to that in a few minutes
now let me just give you a simple
overview of power where data okay so
there are mainly three workspaces
there's the report workspace there is
the data workspace and there's the
relationship workspace now the report
workspace is the default workspace that
you will be redirected to whenever you
open power bi and this is the workspace
that you'll mainly be using for creating
your various visualizations and reports
now in case if you're wondering where
the visualizations are present its
present here okay apart from the
standard visualizations you can also
import custom visualizations that can be
in form of a file or it can you can
directly import it from the hobbyist
Microsoft Store lattice okay now here
are all the tables that you are that you
have loaded into power bi present now
these are the six tables are loaded from
one file let's say you're loading from
multiple files then all the tables will
be present here correspondingly you can
find all the columns presenting each of
the table as well okay so whichever
table which or column you want you can
drag it and drop it to your
visualization apart from that all the
visualizations would have at least two
planes present here the first is the
fields okay that is the fields
associated with the visualization this
is where you're going to add in all the
values for that visualization apart from
that let's say you want to add any
filtration condition to that
visualization you can specify that here
as per second is the visualization page
now here basically you're going to work
around with respect to the radius
visualization that is like the view or
the style associated with respect to
each of the visualization okay now let's
move on to the next workspace that is
the data workspace and this is an
interesting workspace because this lets
you view all the data present in the
corresponding table okay earlier when
you were loading the data we had just
got a preview here you can view the
complete data as well okay now let's say
you want to make any operations on this
data you want to modify the data you
want to write any queries so I am quite
sure all the technical people here would
definitely be wondering where do
do that for that you can just click on
the Edit queries option present here
once you click on this power bi square
the editor gets opened and this is the
place where you can work around with
your data you can manipulate it and do
whatever you wish to do okay so here I
have the complete freedom to manipulate
my data okay you have the standard
operation of splitting the data grouping
the data a part of that let's say if you
want to present any expression to that
that also can be specified you want to
create a new column you can do that you
want to delete a column not at all a
problem now let me just show you a
simple operation here let's say this
date column okay so by default power Bay
also detects what data type is present
in a corresponding column and it sets it
but always make sure you're
cross-checking it before you go ahead
okay now here once I click on once I
right-click on the date column and if I
go to the change type option it's
telling me it's presently a date-time
format if I want I can change that as
well let's say I want to track I want to
transform it I just want the dates from
this column so I click on date only
option okay and it's extracting only the
dates from the scholar now if you've
noticed in the applied steps there's a
new steps added that is extracted only
date so this operation that is any
operation that you perform on these
tables get reflected as steps in this
table okay so let's say you don't want
any step that is you want to cancel any
step then all you need to do is just
cross out the step and your table goes
back to how it was okay so this is a
very nice workspace for everyone who
wants to play around with the data they
know try new things and this is
definitely the place that you want to
try out okay once you're done with all
that you have the option of close and
apply now I don't want any changes to
get applied so I'm just click on going
to click on close option so this is how
you work with your data workspace okay
there are multiple operations here and
we'll explore more of this in our next
session as well okay apart from that if
you want to enter a data as well you can
do that here okay so it'll add a new
table or if you wanna add X you wanna
add a new row as well you can do that
finally coming to the third workspace
which is the relationship workspace this
is an interesting place where you this
will come into picture when you're
working with multiple tables as such ok
let's say you're taking multiple tables
from a database now there's always going
to be a corresponding relationship
present between them
and you need to maintain that before you
go on to create your visualization or
analyze and work around with your data
so that is quite important and this is
the place where all the relationships
are reflected now power farway by itself
or detects the different relationships
with respect to the tables that you're
loading so let's say I'm loading I've
loaded all the six tables so what it has
done is that it's checked the column
names and it's correspondingly
established or relationships between
these tables okay but one thing you need
to remember is that these relationships
established by power beer may not always
be correct
okay so always ensure if you're working
with multiple tables you are using the
correct relationships okay now comes the
question on how do I manage how do I
correct my relationships how do I create
a new relationship how do I delete it
it's quite easy just click on a
relationship in case if you want to
delete it you have the option of
deleting let's say you want to create a
new relationship I want to link the date
from my date table to dates of seals fat
I just have to drag and drop and that
relationship gets created okay
it's quite simple process okay let's say
you want to go in more detail with
respect to do you want to manage
multiple relationships then go on and
click on the option of manage
relationships once you do this okay what
happens is you get the complete list of
relationships that are present between
your tables okay this not only helps you
create new relationships and modify
relationships it can also help you
delete it as well apart from that let's
say you want to verify these
relationships in detail then it's quite
useful so let me just verify this
relationship more so I just double click
on this and it goes into the end of
relationship one okay so here you can
see it's selecting the manufacturing ID
from my products table and it's linking
it to the manufacturing ID of my
manufacturing table so it's correct and
it's being linked by a many to one
relationship okay so this is something
that is an active relationships now
apart from active relationships you may
have passive relationships also okay so
power bi actually decides this based on
your requirement so let's say if you are
defining all the relationships then it's
left to you as to decide
which are the active relationships which
are the passing relationships apart from
that once you've loaded a new table
Bava does not immediately detect the
relationship so you can go back to the
auto-detect option and then select this
this will help RBI understand that a new
table has been added and it checks if
there's any relationships between the
new table and the existing table and it
creates the relationships okay so I hope
you guys have got a simple overview with
respect to the three workspaces
associated with respect to bobbya now
coming back let's go back to the report
workspace here what we'll be doing is
we'll start by creating our first of all
so as I had mentioned to you this is
going to be a product report so I'll
first begin by renaming this just double
click I'll call it product ok now let's
begin by creating our first two issue
first thing I want to start off with I
want to know how many products do I have
okay for that I'm going to use something
known as a card visual card visuals are
usually used when you need to represent
something specific so once I have
clicked on the visual you can see
immediately the visual has been added
here but it's blank at the moment
because it does not have any values
there are two ways that I can add values
to this I can either set the
corresponding column drag it and drop it
into the field option present here or I
can directly drag and drop it to the
visualization okay
now this in turn taps the visualization
this is the field that I want now here
you can see I have two thousand four
hundred and twelve products now you
might be wondering how so if you click
on this you can see the option it is
counting the number of product IDs that
means it's giving me an overview with
respect to how many products are present
okay so now I know I have two thousand
four hundred and twelve products let's
say I'm going to create a new card now
what I want to know is that I want to
know the number of manufacturers that I
have so what I do I just drag and drop
the manufacturer ID now here again it's
showing me two thousand four hundred and
but now I'm quite sure this is not
correct because I can't have so many
manufactures so I go back to my field
operation I select here now I see it's
counting but rather than counting I
needed to count the distinct values
because a manufacturer could sell
multiple products so what I'm going to
do is that I'm going to change this
count to
district immediately the valley changes
from 2412 to 14 so this tells me that
okay I have only 14 manufacturers with
me okay similarly what I'm going to do
is that I'm just gonna add two more
cards here which will give me a better
insight for today's report so I'm going
to keep a count with respect to the
various categories okay and I'm going to
create one more I'm going to create
different keep a count of the different
sections present here as well so I'm
going to drag and drop the segments now
you might have noticed earlier it was
taking curve but now suddenly it shows
me values okay now what is happening
here is that it is picking the first
value from these corresponding values
present here okay so I don't want it to
do that I want you to count the distinct
values so I go back to count distinct
and here you have the total number of
categories similarly if I go back to the
segments and I change the segment from
first segment to the count distinct
option it tells me that I have eight
segments now this is essentially
important for me because it helps me
keep track of the total number of
products that I have so let's say I'm
connecting it to my real time database
in that case there would be newer
products that keep getting added so the
product ID the count of the Product ID
will help me understand how much is the
product ID had the given instant as such
now power bi can handle real-time beta
as well so this is one of the major
factors that may for BI stand above all
the other data visualization tools as
such okay
now let's create the first now let's
create the second visualization I'm
sorry okay so this is going to be a bar
chart basically what I'm trying to do is
that I'm going to get my product over
for that there are different types of
patch are present in power bi okay so
what we're going to do is that we're
going to use a clustered column chart so
once I click on it the clustered column
chart gets added here to this I'm going
to first bring in my product ID and then
I'm going to bring in the segment's okay
so this in turn gets converted to the
visualization that you see here okay so
here what it has done is that it's
identified the number of products in
different segments and then it's
correspondingly plotted it in in a bar
chart so all-seasons has once
chenine convenience has four or five and
so forth so it's picked up all the eight
categories and then it's given me the
corresponding values
apart from this I feel okay what if I
want to know the number of products with
respect to the categories as well in
that case rather than creating unusual
we'll try something new what we'll do is
we'll add categories column to the same
issue notice what is going to happen
there is no immediate change with
respect to the visualization but don't
think nothing has happened because we
have already created two different
layers with respect to this the first
layer or the first level is a plot
wherein you are identifying the number
of products in different segments and
once you go down to the next level of
this hierarchy then you can see the
number of products with respect to
different categories this gives me an
idea of the number of products in
different categories now in case if you
have creating reports this is essential
because rather than creating multiple
reports or visuals for the same purpose
but slightly if they're slightly
different you can create a hierarchy on
the same visual itself and this may not
be possible with all visuals so I
definitely leave it up to you to try and
explore this apart from this as we had
discussed we're going to get an overview
with respect to the manufacturers as
well so what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to bring in the details of the
manufacturer and I am going to drag and
drop here so immediately when you drag
and drop Bobbie recognizes this is a
value and it creates of default
visualization in this case it's created
and default table Ushuaia station that
is it's given me my values in form of a
table now I feel no I don't want it in
form of table I wanted something more
interesting something more visually
appeal
so what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to change the Sushil to a tree map
which will once I click on tree map
you're sure you're not going to see
something immediately this is mainly
because I don't have enough inputs for
the tree map visual okay so to this what
I'll do is I'll just provide the Product
ID as the values so here you can see
different fields you can see group you
can see details you can see values color
saturation and tooltip so for the values
feel I'm going to provide my Product ID
what it basically does is that it groups
the manufacturers and then it allocates
area based on the
number of products that they are selling
okay so this basically is a counting
number here so again it's taking the
count value now here again let's say
okay I'm not satisfied with this I want
more filtration I want to understand
better what you can do is that you can
add another column to this so what I
lose I'll add the segment's as my detail
field now earlier value where it was
just one single area taken up by this
seller now it is being divided into
different different segments as well so
let me just remove this and show it to
you again okay here you have the
complete number of cuba's and when I add
the segment's the same number gets
divided with respect to the different
segments that they are selling their
products
okay so cubis has 288 products in
productivity segments so let me just
show you something interesting here
remember how I told you power power BIA
is very interactive once I click on a
specific segment here okay all the
corresponding visuals reflect the same
that is there's a change with respect to
all the corresponding visuals let me
show you that again okay can you put
right with respect to the cards present
here as well as the parts are present
here what I'm doing is that I'm just
selecting the productivity segment of
cuba's okay so my manufacturer is cubist
and the segment is productivity once
it's selected everything gets changed
corresponding so all the data that is
linked to this gets affected with
respect to this this is same as applying
a filter condition but at the same time
I don't need to go manually add a filter
condition as such once I click on it it
becomes interactive it goes on and gives
me the required details so here you can
see the total number of products is 286
we have verified that here apart from
that my current manufacturer is just
Cuba's there are two categories here
okay let me just go down so here you can
see the two categories where the
productivity products are being accept
and this segment is just productivity I
hope you guys I go with this you've got
a simple understanding of how to create
a report and how interactive and simple
it is are such okay now one of the other
interesting things about
there you can perform analysis
operations here although they're not
completely understood you can integrate
various R scripts to integrate that but
I'll just show your simple analysis now
we've talked about the feed fields and
the format tabs I'll just show you the
analysis field with respect to a bar
chart let's say I want to draw a
constant line okay I'll just go up and
here let's say I want to identify the
products which are above a constant line
let's say constant values of 350 so this
will tell me those categories which are
above this so any representation that is
going above this line has a product
about 350 now again this is just a very
simple explanation or the simple
representation that I'm showing you okay
there are various things that you can
try out and work around with it okay so
power bi is one of the tools that you
can definitely play around get good
understanding and this is one of the
easiest tools in the market today for
business intelligence data visualization
as well as all your operations your data
could be small data present on an excel
file or it could be one of biggest data
that you can come across it could be
your Hestia first file it could be
present on a cloud database and so forth
so you can link all that and you can
work around with power bi now moving
forward I have created I have
successfully completed my first report
as such now it's time to go on and
publish this report so I can create my
first dashboard as such so first thing
ensure that you have saved this so I'm
just gonna save this okay now that I
have successfully save this what I need
to do is that I need to click on the
publish option present here why am i
doing this is that I'm gonna publish
this report on to my power bi service
where I can create my dashboards now I
hope you guys have an understanding that
how different how dashboards and reports
are different okay now once I click on
publish it's going to link to my power
bi service based on my account and then
it's going to publish this report okay
this is why I had mentioned earlier
always ensure that you have created an
account on power bi and you're linking
your power and you've signed in Casper
in your power now if we look here it's
successfully you publish my report on to
power bi and I can also view this or get
a quick inside so let me go back to my
power bi and show you this okay
so let me just refresh this page
and in my workspace you can see two
things in my report there's a new report
called life and in my dataset there's a
new data set called life so this data
set is correspondingly of the data that
is associated with the report but one
thing you need to understand is that
power bears on power bi service you
cannot manipulate the data associated
with respect to the data with respect to
any report as such you can modify any
existing report you can make new
visualizations but you cannot change the
data associated with it okay so I let me
just show you the report again present
here so this is the report that we have
just created as such okay now again if
you wanna poof add any filters you have
the option present here as well so with
respect to my products by segments or
products by category I can add any
corresponding filters as per my
requirement okay
now apart from this once you click on
file you have the option of publishing
this to the web okay this basically is
going to give you an embedded code once
you have the embedded code you can go on
to our and add it to your website and
thereby giving everyone an access to a
live and interactive dashboard at their
is so let's say you you've created a
visualization for a company's
requirement then definitely you can make
sure that you create giving them an
interactive dashboard so anyone who
comes to the website we amaze with
respect to how interactive this
dashboard is and how let's say if you
even connecting it to real time data
definitely that would be something
interesting so definitely explore this
as well now let me show you how to
create a dashboard now by default
there's not going to be any dashboard
present on your power bi service so what
you need to do to create a dashboard is
that you need to first pin a visual ok
you see the pin option present here it's
going to pin it to a dashboard now I
don't have any existing dashboard so
it's going to ask me whether I want to
create a new dashboard so let me just
call it it rekha life okay and then I'm
gonna pin this now before I go on to my
dashboard
let me just pin all these visualizations
with the dashboard okay so I'll just pin
this
now it's telling me there is an existing
dashboard and do I want to pin to it so
I click on pin see impure
I'll just bring this as well okay now
one thing I want you to remember this is
a multi-layered visualization keep that
in mind and I'm going to show you
something when we move on to a dashboard
okay so you're gonna pin it while it's
in the level product by segments so I'm
gonna pin this pin it and I'll pin this
as well okay now let me go go on to my
dash either I can select the dashboard
from here or choose the option of go to
dashboard from here once I click on go
to dashboard then it's going to show me
your dashboard as such
okay so sure I have all my
visualizations here it's called a tile
assets now on the dashboard only thing
that you can do is you can move it
around or change the results but you
cannot directly manipulate it also the
interactivity with respect to the
dashboard is quite limited now let's say
if I try to select the same field that I
had selected earlier on my report what
is going to do is that it's going to
redirect me to the report
correspondingly okay here I can select
the field and it's going to change as
such but on my dashboard it's not going
to be reflected what you get from this
is that the dashboard is just a
read-only view but at the same time if
you've linked it with corresponding
report any changes with respect to the
report are not linked correspondingly to
the lab to the dashboard so even if you
are changing something with respect to a
specific visual then what you need to do
is that you need to either repin it or
you need to remove it and add it again
okay now as I had mentioned earlier the
same product by segments that I had
added is just with respect to the first
level the multi-level is not reflected
here so in case if you've creating a
multi-level visual then go back to your
report come down in your hierarchy okay
and then you need to pin it individually
again okay if you go back to your
dashboard it's present here bottom okay
so in case if you've creating a
multi-layered which will then make sure
you do this because what happens is it's
a static view only visual that is
getting out of here okay now finally let
me show you a very interesting feature
of power bi - PO
now from a non-technical was built
usually a dashboard would be something
mostly people who have not much of a
technical knowledge would be using okay
for them identifying and filtering out
the data from the dashboard is going to
be hard but what Pavia has come up with
is a new feature called power bi q and a
if you click on ask a question about
your data it's going to launch the power
bi Q&amp;amp;A feature here all you can all you
need to do is that you need to write
your query directly so let's say I want
to identify my manufacturer so it's
directly show me which field do I want i
select manufacturer with most products
so here you can see i just entered a
simple question i want to know which
manufacturers has the most products
automatically its fetched the data that
is it's converted this question into a
query it's gone into the data its
fetched the corresponding result and
it's also given me an output in form of
a visual so this becomes a highly useful
feature when you're dealing with a
non-technical person so this makes it
quite easy for anyone to get insight
from your data as well okay so I hope
you guys have had enough learning
experience where we've created our first
report and our first dashboard as well
coming back let's just summarize what
we've learnt as part of this session we
