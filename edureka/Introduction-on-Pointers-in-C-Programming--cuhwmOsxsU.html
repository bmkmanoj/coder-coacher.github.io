let's move on to our next topic which is
pointers you would have all heard or
learned that pointers are little
complicated and difficult to understand
but that's not true the fact is pointers
are very very similar to any other
variable type that we've learned we've
learnt about integers floating point
variables characters and so on a pointer
is another variable now integer variable
is used to store integer numbers a
floating point variable is used to hold
a floating point number
similarly a pointer variable is used to
hold an address so a pointer variable is
similar to any other variable but the
difference is that in a pointer variable
you're going to store the address of
some other variable or a particular
memory location so that's all you need
to remember that a pointer variable is
going to store the address of some
memory location how do you declare a
pointer you specify the type of data the
pointer is going to point to so let's
say my pointer is going to hold an
address where we stored an integer then
I need an integer pointer so I specify
the type which is int then I specify
star which means this is a pointer and
then finally specify the variable name
so in start B means P is a integer
pointer which means P is going to store
the address of some memory location
which has an integer number before we go
forward let's look at a simple memory
diagram as to what a pointer looks like
in memory compared to any other variable
so let's draw memory again
that's our memory now let's say I
declare our integer variable a he's
going to allocate four bytes of integers
for and call it a now if I say a equal
to ten in this location is going to
store the number ten so because this has
some memory location this memory
location has an address so let's say
this has the address 2004 this is the
starting address and because this takes
up four bytes
it goes from 2004 to 2007 so we have the
address 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 which
belongs to the variable a similarly
let's say I have a character CH and I
say CH equal to C it's going to allocate
some space for CH in this equal
characters one byte it's going to be one
byte it's going to call it CH and he's
going to store let us see and this will
have the address let's say 5,000 so you
know then how variables work in memory
so what about pointers so now let's say
I declare a integer pointer as a int
star PTR just like any other variable is
going to look at space in memory now how
many bytes is it going to allocate for
PTR if it's a 32-bit machine we've
learned in the first chapter that a
32-bit machine means you just need 32
bits to hold the address which means
even the C program you don't need more
than 32 bits to hold the address because
your memory or RAM cannot go beyond 4gb
so we need only 32 bits or 4 bytes so
any pointer no matter what kind of
variable pointing to is going to take up
four bytes on 32-bit
if it's 64-bit machine is going to take
up a bytes and this is because a point
to variable is going to store the
address of some memory location and on a
32-bit machine the memory location
cannot be greater than 4gb so you don't
need to store an address anything
greater than 4gb and for anything less
than 4gb all you need is four bytes so
now peter is going to take up four bytes
in memory I'm going to call this PTR
right now this is going to have some
junk value because it's an automatic
variable it's going to have some junk
value so how do I assign some address to
this just like any other variable I can
assign addresses directly I can always
say PTR equal to I can give some address
let me say 4,000 so it will store the
value 4,000 here but then the edges
4,000 has no meaning to me because I
have no idea why am i pointing to the
address 4,000 so most of the time you
will not do this so how would you assign
some address so let's say I want PTR
because an integer pointer it needs to
point to an integer variable so we have
integer variable a so I'm going to make
PTR point to a in which case
SAPT are equal to if I just say equal to
a a is what a is 10 so he's going to
land up storing 10 here which is not
what I want I want to store the number
2000 Forest or the address of a over
here so how do you get the address of a
variable with the ampersand symbol so
ampersand and a variable name will give
the address of that variable so now PTR
will have the value 2004 so we're going
to store 2000 for you so what is the
point of the point of variable I can use
the address as it is I can print the
address of variable but that's of no use
to me and there is no point of me
modifying this because I'm not really
modifying any data that I need this is
internal the address is internal to the
computer I don't need to increment this
pipe
four or one bite or two bites if I make
this 2005 or 2006 makes no difference to
me right now what I need is the variable
a that is what matters to me so how do I
access the variable a using the pointer
because the pointer is pointing to the
variable a you can access the particular
variable using the star symbol so if I
say star and a very pointer variable
name
he basically dereferences the address
stored in this memory location goes to
that address and then fetches whatever
is stored over there so when it says
start PTR he goes to the address 2004
and fetches four bytes from there and
gets me the integer in this case the
integer here is 10 so star PTR is
nothing but 10 so now you've learned
three concepts PTR is a pointer variable
so the pointer variable can store an
address of some memory location to get
the address of some variable you use the
ampersand symbol so if I say ampersand a
it gives me the address of the variable
a and I can store that in PTR and
finally if I want to access what is
stored in this memory location
I say star PTR start PTR would
dereference PTR what is PTR PTR itself
just PTR alone is the address two
thousand four so if it is star PTR it
slicing star 2004 which means go to the
address 2004 and get me what's stored
over there so star pti would fetch the
value 10 so as you can see pointer
variables are exactly the same as any
other variable the integer variable a is
storing the number 10 the character
variable ch storing the character C and
a pointer variable PTR storing an
address 2004 the only difference is
using pointer variables you could use a
star symbol next to a pointer variable
and dereference the address so there is
another thing I can do with the star
symbol let's say I say star PTR equal to
20 so what does this mean go to the
address 2004 and put the value 20 there
so equals edge 2004 put so value 20 so
now if I try to after this point if I
try to print a is going to print the
value 20 because whatever a is pointing
to we have 20 there now so we have now
learned how to declare pointers and
we've learnt the use of the ampersand
symbol and the star symbol the ampersand
unary operator is used to get the
address of a particular variable and the
unity operator star dereferences the
address stored in the pointer to access
the data the pointer points to not to
complicate it right it's simple now
let's write a simple program to use
pointers and see what exactly happens
okay so let's try a simple example we
have an end a equals 10 then we have a
pointer PTR int star PTR we can point it
to the address of a am % a now before I
do anything with the pointer let's print
what's stored in the pointer itself
so printf PTR now generally it's a good
practice to print addresses in
hexadecimal format I can of course print
a pointer or an address as a percentage
D Co is just a number right but just so
that the person who is looking at it
knows it's an address we generally print
addresses as hexadecimal format so I'm
going to use percentage X Shen I say PTR
as you can see I'm just using the
variable name here so the variable name
alone means get the contents of that
particular variable if I'd used the
variable name here as a cura printed 10
in hexadecimal format similarly I'm just
printing PTR which means whatever is
being stored in the address location PTR
should be printed in hexadecimal format
and in PTR is storing the address of a
so right now he should print the address
of a
let's try that no errors or warnings and
there you go
he prints 28 FF 44 so that is the
address of a now let's see what happens
when you dereference the address so I
say printf star PTR when we put it as a
decimal and we say star PTR so here
we're trying to dereference the address
so you go to the particular address PTR
is pointing to and then print that value
so in this case he should print 10 run
and there he pins 10 now let's modify
star PTR and we incremented by let's say
20 so star PTR plus equal to 20 which
means 10 plus 20 is 30
now instead of printing star PTR we're
going to print the variable a
so the variable age should also have the
value 30 there you go
a is 30 so when I increment a by 20 or
an increment it start PTR by 20 is the
same because Star PTA finally goes to
the memory location where a is and
modifies that value so similarly if you
want to have a character pointer you can
always have care star see PTR but we
don't have a character variable to point
to so let's have a character variable -
so care CH equal to C so now I can say
equal to address of CH this will behave
exactly the same as PTR there's nothing
new here but let's see the size of C PTR
and PTR we know that a is going to have
a size of about 4 bytes
CH would be one bite I had mentioned
that both PTR and CPD are no matter what
type of pointer it is all pointers would
take up four bytes all pointers would
take up four bytes on a 32-bit machine
and eight bytes on a 64-bit machine
let's see what we get as the result here
so I would say printf
size of int PTR thousand HD / n size of
video then we say printf size of gap PTR
isn't HD / n size of CPT are let's run
this
and the size of NPT is for size of cal
PTR is also for two because is a 32-bit
machine we get both of them as four
bytes another thing you should notice is
just like any other variable
you generally mention it as data type
and then variable name so similarly here
to PTR is a variable name and a data
type is in star which means the variable
PTR is an integer pointer
similarly here CPT I is a variable name
and your data type is Cal star kCPT as a
character pointer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
