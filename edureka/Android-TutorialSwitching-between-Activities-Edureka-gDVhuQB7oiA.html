is talking about switching between the
activities any Android application
comprised like I said there could be
more than one activity which is existing
there and then you want to transact data
or even just want to navigate from one
activity to other activity this you can
achieve with the help of an intent so
Intel is one of the class in Android
which allows you to send messages or
intimation to respective components and
Android to perform certain task now
second thing I would come to is I hope I
have clarified you are clarified with
the concepts explained so far with the
help of intent and the activity are we
all clear so far with this negative
sheesh jiten are you all here so far
with this ok cool everyone is clear so
I've got answer of negative and
understory she understood Japan has
understood okay everyone has understood
yeah so going ahead with this now any
Android application will compile many
activities the same what I was saying
that you might need to sync data from
one activity to another activity for an
example let's say let us take an example
now what I want is when I have a
application which I which has a login
page then once you enter the login paste
and it comes the homepage what I want is
once my user logged in to the login page
I want to show this user ID by which
user has logged in always on my home
page at the top now this is something
what I want is as I am trying to access
the data from the login activity on my
home activity from the login screen from
on my home screen so this is somewhat
called as transferring or transacting
the data from one activity to other
where I am transacting the data from the
login activity to my home activity now
how do i achieve it for understanding it
there are certain methods which will
allow you to do this like
10 dot spot extra will allow you to send
the key value pairs like the value which
you are sending is the well and you are
putting a key to it the same on the
other side you need to extract it let's
see an example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
