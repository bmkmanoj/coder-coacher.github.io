this webinar I will be walking you
through the various aspects about how
QlikView is helping answering business
questions so as you are aware today most
of the time we are developing so many
solutions out there in the business
intelligence tool but with a main one
goal in the mind to answer the questions
which business is asking to satisfy
their needs so that they can you know
earn more and more revenue and you know
get more clarity about into their
complex business so about my brief
background I have around total 10 plus
years of reporting and analytics
professional experience out of that I
have 5 plus years of develop 5 plus
years of experience in developing
reports and dashboards in quick view and
that's what I was going to explain from
my experience that why click view is is
a choice which pretty much every major
company is taking today and how it is
different from any other BI and data
visualization tool which is available
today and at the last how you were going
to be benefit by attending this course
and the expectation you should have from
this course so let's move on to the next
slide so here is the agenda that we will
be covering today in this webinar so a
brief history of click view so as they
say it's always good to know the
background before doing a deep dive into
a particular subject so that we are
aware how the things have been generated
in the past who have actually created it
and stuff like that
that will help us you know having a good
good knowledge about the tool or the
technology that we are using second is
why click you as compared to other BI
tools here we will look at various ways
QlikView is different from other BI
tools next is career opportunity with
click view here I will be showing you or
around three different slides
about what
those major companies using the QlikView
what is the job trends today here in
India and how many and what is the
salary range which is which is currently
being given by the companies here in
India alright so the next is advantages
of using quick view here I have listed
out couple of advantages which I will be
showing with the help of the application
also that the kind of advantages you
should expect from the quick view if you
are learning it and then finally using
it in your business and in the business
or in the department next is how next is
understanding how companies are adopting
quick view so this is very interesting
and a kind of a revolution that QlikView
has made when it comes to the adoption
of QlikView as a tool into the company
then second law stays hands on example
or we will look at the application a
demo application to see the QlikView
power and how it really helps in
revealing the answers which generally
business users or analysts ask on the
fly and lastly the Q&amp;amp;A section where you
can write your questions to me and I
will read out your question to everyone
and then give you the answer back so
let's move on to the brief history of
click view so click is a product of
click tech which was founded in 1993 by
the Schomburg and stuff and chairs
originally as a consultancy so
originally it was called as quick view
which means the quality understanding
interaction and knowledge so click view
was basically designed to mimic the wave
brain works so for example brain can ask
any question and that was the basic goal
click View developers had in their mind
that it should be a tool which can
answer any question
even if it is on the fly or you know the
way brain works up down back and forth
whatever way maybe you know the tool
should be able to answer based on the
data or based on the information that it
has been supplied to it and the key
aspect of of doing that or designing
that tool is the color coding scheme
whereby selected values are highlighted
in cream linked values in white and
excluded values in highlighted gray so
to make you better understand about it I
have a application here with me which
will give you an idea what I am really
talking about so in this application if
you can see it is a demo application
which usually come when you install the
QlikView in your system or in your
personal computer so whenever we select
anything it is highlighted in green
right the thing which I mentioned the
link value that means the value which is
related to this selection is highlighted
in white like this and all the values
which are not related to these selection
which is highlighted in green is
presented in here in the light gray
color so this is what you know it really
makes it special first two versions were
basically written in Excel using the
vlookups and then they hired heck and
walk was to basically redesign
re-architect this click view from the
ground up as an in-memory application
they finally renamed it to click you in
1996 its IPO get caught out in 2010
under the symbol click and it was
awarded as this seventh best IPO of 2010
in the Nasdaq Creek tech now has over
24,000 it's relatively old figure right
now it has crossed I think thirty six
thousand also thirty six thousand
customers in hundred countries and
currently employs over more than
thousand people worldwide a different
location
the current market cap that it has is
2.5 billion and so that you can
understand that this is how the company
is growing and currently having the
presence all over the world ok so let's
move on to the next slide to see why
QlikView why click you all how it is
different from other BI tools so this is
what I have tried to answer with these
main highlighted bullets its patented in
memory technology if you have read
little bit about the click view you have
definitely read about it's a patented in
memory technology I will going to show
you with the help of a simple visual
what it really means in a nutshell and
then we will look at the faster bi
solution development how QlikView do a
comparatively faster Doug allows you to
do a faster development as compared to
other BI tools complete suit for rnd
which is reporting and analytics that
means right from data integration to
data modeling to finally data
presentation everything is built-in in
just one tool so that you don't have to
go into to any other tool and everything
is set every year concerned satisfied
here in just one particular tool just
click view and finally we look at the
associative user experience what it
really means and how it benefits to the
end-user having an associative user
experience ok so let's move on to the
next slide to see the in-memory
technology if you can see this visual so
this is basically I have tried to show
whatever calculation that be specified
within the script or within the
expressions of the click view is
basically happening into the RAM so this
is the click views or technological
differentiator that it uses an in-memory
data model data model which is stored in
the
Ram instead of hard disk and because the
RAM is much faster than this or the
hardest it allows for very fast response
times resulting in very smooth user
experience if you have seen this
application right if I make any
selection over here you know the
response that you get is very fast you
can obviously argue that currently the
data is is maybe the small but that
happens that you know user experience is
maintained even when data's volumes are
becomes really big and if it is if the
experience is going down then obviously
we have the quick view best development
practices which you will see when you
will actually learn this bi tool are
more about best practices and the
different things that you can do to
increase the user experience as you are
moving on towards the big data or data
that is having the large volumes but
overall the idea is that whatever you
will select you know this this is a very
fast and great user experience which
keeps on telling what what is related
what you were going to show as soon as
you click on any of the thing so
everything which is which I am selecting
all the all the evaluation or expression
building is happening at the back end in
the quick view engine and what you are
getting is the smoother experience so
the one thing which I just touched that
that you can argue that if the data is
is small then probably this is this is
the kind of result we are getting which
is very fast and smooth but as I
mentioned as we will move on and once
once you go into this course you will
see how we can increase the experience
but before that I can actually share how
you can really you know increase the
user experience if the if the experience
is going down or there is a latency in
the calculations that is something like
at a high level by increasing the ramp
size which is logical by looking at is
visual
so you can see all this expression
building and the logical logic building
is happening in RAM so logically if you
increase your RAM size obviously your
calculations and everything becomes
faster so today we know that Ram is
comparatively very cheap as it used to
be in the old days which was very
expensive so you can increase the RAM in
your system or in your server and your
experience increases and user get a
faster response when they click on it or
you can tweak the data model which
obviously we were going to cover in this
course so that in such a way that it
becomes a design like a star schema
which is a recommended data model design
for QlikView if you are not sure about
star schema and in general we can say
that it is a data model where a fact
table table which has all most of the
measure values along with the unique
values that is surrounded by the
relevant dimension tables having
one-to-one connection between fact and
dimension tables every every developer
that you will come across doing
development in quick view most of the
time they advocate about the star schema
and we will go definitely in-depth into
this course another way we can dock him
we can improve the user experience is by
document chaining so document chaining
is something like connecting multiple
QlikView document as in as an enterprise
application so that your concerns are
satisfied by having a distributed data
architecture into the quick view so
whatever I have just explained will will
going to cover all of these distributed
application architecture or data model
data modeling best practices everything
into this course and that's why one of
those reasons developers really like
that doing the development into the
quick view as it gives them lot of
options of enhancing and increasing the
user experience so let's move on to the
next slide to see how it allows us to do
the faster BI solutions development
so as you can see from this image that
and even historically bi has been very
much IT driven so what you are seeing on
the left hand side is basically a bi bi
which is IT driven but on the right hand
side you have PA which is more of a
analyst or business driven so as I said
bi has been very much IT driven
historically IT departments were mostly
responsible for the entire business
intelligence lifecycle right from star
extracting the data to delivering the
reports analyzes and dashboards while
this model works very well for
delivering static reports but most
business find that it does not meet the
need for business users as it tightly
controls with IT and the data and tools
users often experience long lead time
whenever new questions arise that cannot
be answered with these standard reports
so whenever user has any question they
need to go back to IT then I key will
going to prioritize this and then they
will going to roll out the application
or roll out the answer of the business
question probably by that time the
question becomes obsolete and business
have already moved ahead with whatever
gut feeling they had in there based on
their experience but on the right hand
side the click tag is basically pride
itself in taking an approach to business
intelligence that is different from what
companies such as Oracle SAP and IBM who
are traditional bi vendors are
delivering click TAC aims to put tools
in the hand of business users here we
have given the business users and here
also business users are very much
tightly integrated to even IT where IT
has just the role of data preparation
and governance but business is basically
responsible for creating their own
analyzers so click their aims to put the
tools in the hand of business users
allowing them to become self-sufficient
because
so that they can perform their own
analysis and because of this approach
clique that has made clique you in such
a way that a normal analyst who was
earlier engaged into producing the
report we are Excel or sequel queries
can have a quick learning curve with
QlikView and star delivering new
analysis and insights to the company
which ultimately results in fast proof
of concept development as they are
working very closely with the business
they can easily negotiate on the change
or the requirement they have and they
can get an early sign off also from
business users as they usually know what
kind of reports or questions is
generally being asked by the business
users AJ has asked how about using the
dot xlsx or CSV files yes you can use
Excel X or CSV files so let me show you
here in this quick view so what we are
currently seeing is the front end of the
click view where we have got the data
but there is a back end of click view
let's go to the back end where we write
the script to fetch the data so the
button is here edit script once you go
into the edit script you have the this
window where a script is written if you
can see this statement which is saying
load star you can actually take a kind
of verb or make a precursor to a select
statement saying select star or rating
as read like a normal sequel statement
it is similar to that so what you are
doing you are loading a data here in
this statement similarly you are again
loading some other data and if you see
here we have used the dot XLS file so
there is an option either you can write
the script like this in this fashion if
you know all the key words and all but
if you are not aware of how to write an
script then it is very easy to
automatically write this script how let
me go back to the end and you can
basically go to
will files go to the relevant location
wherever the data file is present and
choose the data like I have this test
file and as soon as I click the finish
all my script is over here and this is a
CSV file which I have just imported so
yes you can get this data and we will go
in-depth about all of these different
data sources I hope it is clear now
about from XLS or CSV file so the heart
is asking do you think the future
managers need to update their skills in
click view along with Excel to make
inferences yes I strongly feel so why
because in Excel the reports that you
make is generally static but today you
know there are tools like fiber power 5
pivot and all to show you the dynamic
nature of producing the results from the
given data set but click who actually
takes the next step in providing the
analysis even if you can see it over
here you will find a difference so the
difference is when you do any selection
in Excel it shows only the result which
is relevant to the selection but click
view takes a next step where it also
shows what is not selected to it
sometimes it is very much relevant for
managers who is managing products and
all and responsible for sales or
marketing so if they have suppose any
sales user or or a sales rep who is
going and doing the sale in different
locations so you can select any location
like in this case I have just selected a
title of a movie and I can clearly see
who are all the actor were there in this
movie and who are all the actors they
were not there in the movie so it gives
me both the perspective what is related
to them selection what is not related to
their selection so thing which is
related is always useful but sometimes
things which is not related gives us the
new
effective and helps us move into that
direction by asking that questions oh
okay if we are not having sales in this
area or this particular sales sales rap
is not doing a sales in this area and
what is the reason why is not doing that
he has been assigned with this territory
let me go back to that sales rep and ask
what what is really going on are you not
finding any customer or you are not
doing any cold calling or anything in
that that area so that's I hope that is
probably answer your question so I hope
you are able to understand how QlikView
helps doing a faster bi solutions so in
a nutshell in in the past days or
earlier in the days I I T used to manage
most of the reporting and analytics
cycles for releasing out the reports and
dashboards but in case of a click view
they have given the tool in the hand of
the users by making it so simple that a
normal user or an analyst can quickly
learn it and start delivering the
insights that's overall in nutshell what
this slides mean so let's move on to the
next slide which helps us understand the
QlikView architecture at a very high
level and tell us the cup that click
view is a complete suit for rnd so as
you can see from this image that click
view provides a complete suit for doing
the reporting and analytics work you
have as a first layer you have the data
by which you know you can fetch this
data from different data sources it can
be ODBC well ADP file custom data XML
SAP system or Salesforce system so these
are basically the custom data sources
apart from the normal data sources like
ODBC oledb or file from all these
different kind of data sources you can
fetch the data data execute it into the
load script the script section where I
showed you about the load statement and
all how you fetch fetch the data or
write the script and then what we have
is the consume content that
means your presentation layer and as
well as layer where you put all of these
objects and all and then finally you
roll out to all of your presentation or
dashboard into the these different
clients and this these three layers
which is data layer load conclude
content and consume layer and finally
the blind player is covered by the
security layer from the initial date
from the initial layer which is fetching
the data so what it means basically that
you can have QlikView security either at
a document level which means you are
providing a password to the document and
you are saying to the user that if you
have the password then only you can open
the document or you can assign the role
based security also which means if I am
a user from a particular geography let's
say APEC Emir let him or North America I
hope you guys are aware about that or
maybe I can take an example of countries
country like India Singapore and learn
the UK so if I am if if any user is
longing logging in from a particular
country then they can basically see
their own data and that's what we do it
if by creating groups into the active
directory we will see into this course
how we can do that
but apart from the normal active
directory we have a basic security where
we can specify in the script about the
users who will go in to access this
application and what is there but what
their permission should be it has some
third party tools also for providing the
security and native click with security
is the one which I just explained where
you can write into the script itself who
are all the users and what and how to
specify their security that means the
password and all and the fields that
they can access so overall this is this
is where you know it is specifying their
data integration over here data modeling
is happening here in
load script and then finally the
presentation is happening here in the
presentation engine and the actual user
are consuming it via these different
mediums so click view will get the data
from all the database or file system
saya - Rafa has asked this question
so idly yes click view has the ability
to take the data from almost every
system like I have mentioned here most
of our databases gets captured here in
oledb ODBC connection click view has
already provided some custom connectors
to SAP or Salesforce click we also
provide you the option to write your own
custom data connectors it's just that
you need to really learn how to write
that script and do the connection to
that custom data but that will be very
rare probably when you will go through
this course you will see that almost
every data like earlier I mentioned xlsx
file CSV file or whether it is Microsoft
Access database sequel server database
from Oracle any other or any of the data
source it can be it has the capability
of accessing it even from the web also
so in that case if there is any
connector which is not present then you
have also have the ability to write the
custom data so the question which is
coming again from Sayer Ashraf that is
this include no sequel database HDFS
MongoDB or CouchDB yes click you click
you is going in that direction where it
can connect to this Hadoop ace file
system or MongoDB or no sequel which you
have mentioned it's just that for
certain
these databases quick view has developed
their connectors as we are saying that
there is lot of development is going on
into the big data market so another
question which is coming is load content
means the data will
cash into memory so if I understand this
correct question correctly from Sayer -
of then it is you are basically saying
that whatever data we will load from the
data source will actually going into the
memory yes this is right and that's what
the beauty of QlikView as a tool that
whatever data you will fetch from the
data source system it will going to load
that data into the memory so that you
can produce your charts and objects into
the front-end and interact with it you
don't really have to connect with your
data base all the time all of your data
you that let you have finished based on
your expressions or script is there in
the clicker system within the RAM and
you are having all that data to do
whatever analysis the charting and
visualization you want to do okay
so let's move on to the next slide
associative user experience so I think
this is one of the slides which is very
much attractive to to the big nurse and
it gives a very good perspective also
about the click user system because it
gives us a clear differentiation between
what our traditional VI system actually
creates the filters or the hierarchy
based on or the predefined hierarchy
based on the user's input and as
compared to how click view is doing that
and it basically shows the way the brain
works so let me first go back to and go
to this traditional VI systems our
approach of dealing with the BI solution
so here is this main difference which I
only mentioned also between click view
and other BI solutions is the
associative user experience where
tradition we are used solutions have
predefined paths to navigate and explore
data like here may have mentioned as
region first user we are going to select
the reason then they can select state
then they can select product and then
they
select the salesperson so it is a
step-by-step approach if you if you are
just saying that okay I'm not really
interested going in that direction if I
just want to select the salesperson and
wants to see how each and everything is
related to that whether it is product
sales region all chard and data which is
over there presented in the front end
then that kind of functionality was
missing in the traditional BI system and
that's where click view has its take
where you can go in any direction which
which is easily depicted from this
figure whether you can select any region
you can select a salesperson state of
product no matter what the selection is
it is completely free and up to you what
selection you want to do and you are
there you are there and getting your
results so in this way it provides the
Infinity flexibility to the end users or
the business users to ask the question
which is coming in their mind so to give
a quick view about that how we can do
this is basically this say for example
this dashboard so I have these this
again this movies dashboard where I have
director actor or title it doesn't
really matter whether I am selecting
director or actor or title if I need to
I can go back and select whatever filter
I am self interested in even apart from
that if there is anything I want to sell
I can actually do a loss of selection
and select it from the charts it doesn't
really matter it just there my mind and
I am just selecting that in getting my
desired output so this is what I have
tried to show in this figure where you
can go in any direction and do the
selection so how traditionally it has
worked I there we have an example also
for that that kind of environment so in
so this is basically a a list box or a
filter which works based on traditional
hola
we're a hierarchy is set like this that
first you need to select then you select
the region then State then product and
then salesperson similarly you need to
first select any director like Albert
Ray then it will ask you to select the
title and then it will ask you to select
the actor and then you finally get your
desired result however this was not the
way in click view over here so if I just
clear the selections I can do whatever
selection which is coming in my mind I
am just interested that I am I am
interested to see movies somewhere
between 1960 and 1970 and here I get my
result and then my interested is
interest is to see okay what is all this
for clown or seven woman boom movies
when they actually came in then I can
simply see that and see what is what are
the figures which is related what is the
values which is related to it okay so I
hope it is clear of how click View
associated user experience works as
compared to the traditional solutions
which produce the standalone reports and
visualizations alright so here it comes
the interesting part about the major
companies who are adopting click view
here I have given a couple of example
which I usually see from any of the job
site or job portal and in couple of
companies I have my own experience also
in in giving the training and you know
getting basically working in one of
those companies also that they are
really you know going ahead and adopting
this tool for their either their own
purpose companies like HSBC or my Indra
to do their business analysis or
companies like Infosys and Tata are
basically you know using it for
providing the consulting to their
clients Flipkart has been using click
view from I if I believe right from past
two years or so
and they are using it for doing all of
these you know data mining or answering
the critical questions or building the
to what-if analysis kind of things to
answer their complex queries about the
transactions which is happening over
there so but these are couple of just
names out of the list of for around
36,000 companies worldwide who actually
uses QlikView for to to get the answers
of your questions companies whether old
or new adopting QlikView because of its
simplicity
scalability and patented in memory
functionality which provides faster
reporting and analytics and you know
it's growth explosion there are very few
experts in QlikView and that's why quick
fix first demand is growing and you will
see in the next two slides how much
companies are paying as of today and
total number of openings that we
currently have out there in India for
click you as a developer profile so
let's move on to the next slide to see
the salary trends over here if you see
this salary trends so this salary trends
is basically taken from the indeed.com
and I searched it based on the openings
the companies that is providing salaries
here in India for click view and the
related technology and you can clearly
see the bar which is there for click
view is the highest one as compared to
any other one whether it is tableau
consultant or any other option like
marketing operations analyst or
different you know comparison which it
has done based on the keyword it was
provided which was click view and in the
next slide it shows that job trends in
click view which is as of 16th August
2015 the source fall this slide is now
Crede calm it shows the number the
number of openings in at different
locations the maximum openings are out
there in Bangalore
which is 182 but if you if you sum up
all of these openings then there are
around 400 plus openings that we have in
QlikView as of today and trust me now we
don't have enough experts out there to
fill in all these vacancies people are
they're definitely having an idea about
the QlikView but companies are really
looking for and experts who have a
in-depth understanding of the QlikView
and probably forth for those right
candidates there is technically no part
for good Sandri so let's move on to the
next slide of advantages of using
QlikView so advantages of using click
you so first thing is this that it is
having a down top approach of adoption
instead of top-down approach so what it
means that that first it is an analyst
or a business user who is basically
first install installing it on their
system or adopting it creating their POC
and showing the capabilities of click
through to the senior management and
that has happened with me also where in
my initial role I have given I have just
downloaded this tool and and basically
showed of POC and get their buy-in to
get the license and this this has been
the trend in many industry top
industries also and that's where even
click who has published a case study
that because it is so much business
centric that it is the first business
user or an analyst who is who is
downloading it using it creating a loop
of concept and then getting a buy-in
from their business so instead of IT
department that is taking up the
responsibility of what solution analyst
will going to use and then push the
senior management to adopt it as
top-down approach of dictating tool what
is good for an analyst so following this
way the actual user who is an analyst or
a business user give thereby in the
first crucial step so it's a down top
approach of development instead of
top-down approach second advantage of
using QlikView is that it is an analyst
and business friendly approach we have
already discussed a little bit about it
and it is because of its simplicity for
developing the BI solutions it is
becoming the first choice of existing
analyst for business user who currently
using either some excel sheets or other
sequel based systems for reporting and
dashboard the third thing is faster
development and change management
because QlikView follows the agile
methodology for project management and
solution development so in case of a
professional VI solution development
business centric user actually takes up
the tool and do the reports and
dashboard of element which results into
faster developments happen along with
the collaborative change management
because analysts and end-users generally
work pretty much closely and since they
are collaborating and doing a constant
work with each other and using the agile
agile methodology for project
development results in faster
development and change management
self-service bi for end-user so while it
is an advantage because QlikView gives a
greater flexibility to end-users for
adding new chart or filters on the fly
and that's why it has become a
self-service business discovery tool for
end-users to satisfy all their analysis
requirement so this is something
self-service bi for end user is pretty
much in demand because business users
really don't want to go through a long
change or or a long development cycle if
they have of whatever they need as a
data point they just want to use that
data point and move ahead with that and
that's where you look like you has also
created it's good you know benchmark in
that direction
of providing a self-service bi or end
user the next advantage is minimal
previous IT knowledge to start working
in click view that's that's really one
of the advantages for those guys who are
who are previously having some kind of
analysis or some kind of little bit of
IT experience of how things work and
wants to make a career in click view so
clicker is basically designed in such a
way that a normal business user or an
analyst who is working closely with the
business of preparing analysis in
spreadsheet or security system have a
quick learning curve for understanding
and doing the development so most of the
features that are automated in click you
and is just a matter of fact that you
should know where the right option
exists for the required functionality so
this is this is something you know which
is very much there in click view about
choosing the right function if I can
show you like for this chart so
concurrently it is showing us ratio to
total 50 50 % so generally if you are
not aware if option exists to show the
value instead of percentage probably you
may be creating a different expression
or a chart here in click view and maybe
resulting in longer of development but
if you know the right option like if I
go here right click on this go to
properties it has lot of properties in
there and as if I know in expressions I
have this option relative if I uncheck
this then it should show me the values
like this one and one so if I am if I'm
not aware i mirror I may have to write
some expression like I have written over
here some or some divided by total film
film count and everything but if I know
that option exists which Priya
calculates the percentage then I will
just click here pillage ship which means
relative percentage to total click apply
now it shows me the percentage similarly
it has lot of features in there which
you would definitely wants to explore as
a beginner
and figure out all of these
functionality instead of you know going
through a long cycle of loving it
through the different materials so
that's why I say minimal previous IT non
little bit idea of programming you can
definitely have a very good and quick
learning curve with QlikView and start
developing the BI solutions I mentioned
the second last point which is data
integration ETL and presentation in one
tool this this thing I mentioned in my
earlier slide also and it is one of the
very major advantages as compared to
other BI tools because generally these
capabilities are not present in the in
those tools where it provides you the
data integration ETL and presentation in
one tool like even in case of a tab you
what it provides is basically you can
just simply import that data can't do
much of scripting over there and finally
do the presentation and pretty much
similar kind of functionality and other
tools but in QlikView you have all these
data integration from multiple sources
do the ETL by providing the formulas and
all and finally do the presentation so
if I have to show you how it is doing it
you know to control e which is added
script or I can go from here also added
script for simplicity and you can see
that you can specify expression you know
you can specify different kind of
functions which is present over here to
do all that you usually do in an ETL
system also integrating data by taking
it load which is coming can either be
from one one file or from different kind
of files or from different kind of
connections so data integration and ETL
is opening happening over here
and this is the presentation layer where
you will do the dashboard preparation
and report preparation so data
integration ETL and finally the data
presentation in just one two
and the last thing is this that it has
efficient multi-layer application
development as I have stated earlier
also that it provides you the
multi-layer application development
which is something like that you are
preparing data in one click view
application getting the output of that
data into another application so that
your application is not bulky and you
are having a good user experience so in
that way it provides an efficient
multi-layer application development for
a smooth and efficient business user
experience so I will take a pause and
before going to the next slide I will
just see few questions so ask couple of
questions I took it from the hadoop
system and all I have tried to give in
in the answers for that so the next
question which is coming that is what is
the basic requirement I mean technology
wise or skills set so basic requirement
from technology wise or skill set so
minimum requirement from for doing the
development here and click view if you
need to install it minimum you need to
have of 5 1 2 MB RAM generally in
today's environment you can easily get 1
or 2 GB RAM or even 4 GB RAM which is
very very good the hardest size we are
usually getting today is 40 GB which is
obviously way above then what is minimum
requirement for QlikView minimum
requirement for KQ is somewhere around
having 10 or 20 GB of hard disk from the
skill set perspective I mentioned if you
have a little bit experience about how
how to do the expression building within
the axle or having a little bit idea
about how to do the macro development
and as little variety about the sequel
then you can very easily you know
understand the click view and get get
quickly started with developing the
reporting and dashboard
so next question is do assist with any
job openings in QlikView that something
you may need need to reach out to a
gyrator for this and ask your questions
over there
no examples are shown us by Venkatesh so
Venkatesh please bear with me for some
more minutes I will definitely gonna
walk you through with one of those demo
which I am showing you in between of
presentation switching between
presentation and that application
I will walking you with walking you
through with that and maybe with some
other demo which is currently present
with me okay how can I use this to
handle telecom data that's pretty a
broad broad question again from
Venkatesha it does its again depends on
data to data and what analysis you want
to produce may be weak you can ask very
specific question after this session or
send your question to to at Oracle is
then get your concern satisfied what are
the type of script what are the type of
load in script Arjun has asked this
question
so the type of script which is in there
is pretty much similar to QlikView so if
I are prima similar to SQL but I meant
so if I go back to my click view demo
which I am showing for a reference if I
press ctrl e to go into the script or
click here to go into the edit script
this is very much similar to sequel like
you mentioned select star from table
name right like this similarly it is a
load distinct in this column 1 column 2
column 3 and then some formula they have
applied for ETL column 4 column 5 from
the table name or the file name and then
it is specifying that the sheet name or
that
is film dollar since I have some
experience here in in reading this
that's why I am able to read this but
once you will makes your hand dirty with
this click who you will be able to read
it like a sequel statement but yeah the
answer is it is very much similar to
sequel and as I mentioned earlier also
if you have a sequel background then it
is very very easy for you to really ramp
up here your skills and click view and
start producing the work apart from that
the expression or the the conditional
expression it uses is very much similar
to excel or any other programming if
experience that you have like this if
condition if this is true then do this
otherwise do this which is tan for and
even the concatenation is pretty much
similar to excel it is using M percent
to doing the concatenation so if you
have that experience I think your
learning curve will be very fast and you
should be able to really make a good
progress in your initial day's learning
quickly so let me move on to the next
slide and I think that is ways companies
adopting click view I touched a little
bit upon it about how company is
adopting click view so in the previous
slide I have touched upon this where I
mentioned that it is a down talk
adoption instead of top-down adoption
that statement is clear from this image
this is visualization which I am showing
it over here that when a user has
downloaded the click view personal
edition from website and quickly produce
the solution for a problem statement and
shows the solution to the management to
get their buy-in so if if the analyst or
a developer get their buy-in then the
department are topped the click view so
here in this case the sales department
has adopt the click view once
other Department sees the
abilities of sales sales department or
the productivity gains that they have
increased further from the sales
department other departments also adapt
in this case of finance and marketing
and then finally all the other different
kind of departments which is in there in
your enterprise adopt this tool and
finally it becames an enterprise wide
click adoption so this is an official
statement or an official way which click
you even have researched that this is
how companies are really adopting click
view and making a full use of their
analyst or the manpower that they are
having who is actually responsible for
doing the development support activities
click view so this is a modern way in
which companies are working and adopting
the click view as compared to the
traditional way where IT has a super set
position for doing all this kind of work
and fine pushing the senior management
to take a top-down approach so this is
this is pretty much all of from this
slide about pays companies adopting
click view next is is I think demo so
this demo I have shown you between the
slides that I have covered have switched
from slides to this this demo
application so before that I'll show you
let's clear some basics first
so the basic is we call this application
has a document so whatever we are
specifying over here is basically a
QlikView document or a click view movie
database document it has many tabs like
this it has intro section where some
introduction is mentioned it has how
click view works this is basically for
your users if they are not aware they
you can basically specify that colors
how color how each color association
means like we have specified selected
values in green associated values in
white
so ciated value is in gray color clear
is basically to clear all the selection
like the one that burden which is
mentioned over here so and back is to go
back to the back selection forward is to
move forward to the selection that we
made earlier in this traditional Ola I
have covered this example where we have
shown I have shown you how traditional
OLAP system used to work where there is
a hierarchy that first I need to select
the director then the title of the movie
and then the actor to finally see my
outcome in this table box about how
traditional systems used to work but in
case of a click view model we can select
anything according to our interest so
for example if I want to see how many
movies Albert Austin has made so I will
click on this and I will see there is
just one movie and there may be couple
of others if down there no there is just
one movie which has appeared at the top
which Albert Aston has Austin has
prepared by boy and these are the actors
who have worked in this applet in this
movie so but the next question which
comes into my mind okay let's see how
many in what how many movies Jackie
Cogan has has actually on how many
movies Jackie Cogan has worked on I will
just select on this and uncheck or again
click on Albert Austin and see how many
movies Chucky has done so we can again
go back and see okay Chucky has done
these a movie with these three directors
and these are the two movie names which
was there then the next question you may
ask okay so the kid is my interesting
movie who are all the actors who have
worked in this movie and who is the
director so you click on the Kid movie
so you can get the answer Charlie
Chaplin is basically the director but if
you again click on Jackie you get to
know who are all the actor
well in this movie Duquette so you can
see you can go back and fold and ask
whatever question which is coming in
your mind all the data points is in
front of you is just that your
imagination the question which is coming
in your mind and you can already one
answer okay if I need to clear this he
will just hit simply hit on clear and it
will show me entire data the next is the
dashboard so this is probably most of
you are aware of the dashboard but this
is how we generally prepare the
dashboard the standard design that we
have where we have all the filters on
the left hand side how you can create or
what kind of enough analysis that you
can create and to show the different
components so here we have used the
container component which comes in click
view to show multiple analysis right
there at the main space so the first is
the average length of movie over time
how it has increased can be seen over
here and if you want to see the movie
list then you have the movie list over
here based on your interest or the
selection that you are making an
interesting part is this which I showed
earlier also to make the lasso selection
so you can simply drag with the help of
your mouse over the chart area and make
the selection all the relevant
associations are made in the memory and
even this movie list and everything is
updated into the click view if you are
really interested in if you are really
interested in exporting this list into
the hexer then you can actually export
it by hitting this excel button which is
over there if I click over here it will
import export your data into Excel so
that if you want to send it to some user
who does not have click view or or does
not use click view and use generally the
spreadsheet you can send this data right
to those guys as an extract so this is
how you can export the data into the
click view and this is the container
which we were seeing for the for this
object to show the different components
in one at one location apart from this
it has different types of charts like
you can go to new sheet object by
right-clicking on the white space or the
blank space and go to the chart you have
different kind of generally used chart
like bar chart line chart combo chart so
on and so forth along with definitely
private table and a straight table to to
do the charting and you can basically
select any of this one and produce the
required visualization for you
and apart from chart so apart from the
normal charts and all we can we have the
different types of object like list box
which you are seeing it over here you
have the statistics box which creates
the general statistics about the field
multi box where you have the multiple
filters presented over there for example
if I click over here I can select the
different filled list values which I
want in multi box or whatever I want I
will simply select and click OK it will
create a section for me where I have
multiple filters over there
and we can select them interested value
and so sometimes it is very handy
because you cannot show list values like
this in that case if it is multiple
filters are over there you can make use
of list box the next thing we have is
input box which is an advanced one it
uses to make analysis like what-if
analysis and all and where you can give
an input to the click view dashboard and
the click view dashboard is changing
dynamically based on your input current
selection box
current selection box is very simple it
basically shows you what we have
selected like I have just selected had
none and that's what Adrienne that's
what it has shown if I select anything
from ami then here is showing Amy it is
basic it is very helpful in those
scenarios where we have lot of
selections and we want to review what
selections we have made apart from this
we have other objects like but none
which is pretty much self-explanatory I
think most of you have used it it has an
Events attached to it and that event can
trigger based on the configuration we
are making text object is simply to
enter the text or the formula line or
arrow object is is very simple to put a
line or arrow to make some kind of
divide or some kind of an arrangement so
that it is clearly visible to user that
thinks two things these two things are
separated slider or calendar object to
move the two basically have the
continuous data or the numeric data on
the slider to make to move that calendar
is to select the date values bookmark
object is really interesting and I would
like to talk a little bit about this
bookmark object really helps in getting
a snapshot of your application so if I
just say bookmark give a bookmark as a
title and I will say show Add button to
add a bookmark show remove button to
remove a bookmark and click OK
so if I am interested that ayah I have
done all of this selection and I want to
save a snapshot I will simply click add
bookmark and give is has named selection
selection 1 click OK once it is there
and if I have cleared it and after
couple of days I am back and and want to
see the same analysis which I have done
I
simply select select one and all of
these selections are given to me so in
this way you can actually save multiple
analysis and whenever the situation
occurs you can simply select that in
that way you will not have to remember
what are all the selections that you
have done so similarly it has a couple
of others search object to search the
values container I have shown you this
is the container object where you can
show multiple analysis and then custom
object and system table it is basically
related to any other object which you
want to create an example game can be an
HTML text object which can take X HTML
input or a system table is basically
showing the system values related what
is the table name and all so this is
from my site from a demo I wanted to
show the different charts the different
components little bit about flexibility
a little bit about the simplicity and
power nests of click application the
next thing I have is questions so I will
go and try to answer remaining questions
which is in there
okay so Swati astana has asked how can I
practice click Yui scripting and where
click the scripting or is something you
can practice within the click view
system for that you need to install the
click view system you can actually go to
the website of click view which is click
comm click comm and here you can
actually get the click view system few
little bit explore this side but I will
just try to give you the information so
like here it has said at the very first
at the main page try it you know all of
these products which which is there to
free download you can download and start
practicing the click view but yam you
need to install it which is
very simple installation it's not
difficult okay the next question I have
how much work is going on integration of
QlikView with our so connecting QlikView
with our or integration of QlikView with
our is something either you can build a
custom script so that it can understand
the the workspace or the data source
that heart repairs or if it is something
like you want to get an extract from the
heart if you are aware of are then
probably you can use a command like
write and take that data out and put it
there in play cube which which will be
pretty simple to get the relevant data
set out and if not then you may need to
write a custom code for that to connect
to our there are different types of role
click sends clicks and system
administrator ok so what is asking about
again the click view system so this is a
click view 11 developer which you need
to download and install it's click view
11 developer ok
so Karen is asking how much scope do you
find for click view after newly launched
product click sense so yeah it's a good
question and click sense if I if I say
click send is basic basically kind of
having all pretty much not all then most
of the functionality which click you has
but it has its own leak as compared to
click view so click really when it comes
to click sense you know it is very much
like for dashboard users and those who
wants to create the stories or generally
they have marketed it is marketed it
with click view dot next still you know
it the development is still going on and
it is relative east
but not completely stable but click new
11 is a stable system in my view once it
has all this capability and it is stable
then in few in in future they may be
able to better position clixsense
as a better tool then click view if if
it becomes relatively stable but yeah
when it comes to handling and doing the
data modeling and data integration and
you know the document chaining and all
those advanced concepts click View
becomes really handy and you you are
able to do much more than simply -
boarding and the story building which
you usually do which is quite fancy in
clixsense
and one of those reasons I would like to
share that my click sense was introduced
is because of the tableau as a product
because it provides a great flexibility
in terms of and a very very basic hand
user who just doesn't know much about
scripting and all they just want to you
know simply create a jazzy presentation
or jazzy crafts and stuff you simply use
that blue and created kind of similar
functionality they have tried to give it
into the next sense to complete it with
that but when it comes to click you it's
more of a complete solution where it
comes to read integration and modeling
and presentation also I would like to
thank you all and spending time with me
it was great to have a webinar with you
guys and I look forward to see you guys
in the class thank you and good night
and I'll meet you in the class thank you
