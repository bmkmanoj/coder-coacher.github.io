on Santos
so far what we require we require a
virtual machine called a VMware Player
need to be installed over Windows
operating system after that we have to
download a Centaurus version and we to
configure that in Java Virtual Machine
ah we have where player we have
different version of sent OS 6 point X
and 5 point X currently I am using a
version 6 - in dire also 6.2 it's up to
your choice which version you want to go
with you can choose that out and you can
go with installation ok now we have to
write the commands in the terminal where
we can find a terminal
go to applications volley system tools
and press terminal as you can see that
for this user is prom by default user
created is from over here if you are
creating your own user then it will
display your name of whichever name you
want to give an exact localhost the
password is for a Thomas TomTom TM TM ok
now let's start the installation before
that we need to require our OS operating
operate oh s bit for that we have a
command key you name - M it will list
our OS bit whether it's a 64 bit or a 32
bit it shows me X it is unless course
it's 3/4 more for me it means that my
system is 64 bit now I have to perform
installation accordingly to proceed
further with the installation we have to
move to root directory for that we have
a command su and we need to type a
password Tom down ok as you can see that
I am logged in as a root user now Route
exit localhost tom
first of all what we have to do we have
to edit our change and not repulse while
for that we have a come on VI space ATC
space try what space you can say
backslash m dot repos dot d - tension
dot repo
let me cross checked off and command
data given before proceeding further VI
space EDC slash iam dot repost or D
paint general Ripper okay as you can see
that I have logged in through a VI
editor that me needs to press I to
insert any ex answered inside that so we
have to write the command according to
our 64-bit I will show you the command
for 32-bit as well what need to be
changes what changes we have to do in
this 10gen name it goes through
tangent is pain
was a tree after that you have to give
the base URL which will be downloading
the file HTTP downloads
- distro dot Mongo d dot o IG backslash
repo backslash shred-head
backslash OS for that x86 underscore 64
this is a command for a 64-bit if you
are using a 32-bit then it you need to
change only this line
up a little bit we have to change this
commanded sir I 686 okay now as I'm
using 64-bit so I need to make changes
again x86 underscore 64 after that GPG
check that's true see now we have
written the text inside that we need to
save the file
it's for that we have a command scape so
double : down look Q we can cross check
it whether the text reading has been in
this it's correct and fully saved before
that we have a command cat space
backslash EDC backslash m dot triple dot
d backslash tender not triple you can
cross verify over here once named engine
repository base URL okay it looks good
now we can proceed further with the
other step for that we have a command I
am installed with this command you will
be installing a latest version of
MongoDB
for that we have a command yum space
install space Mongo - Tenjin
space Mongo - Tenjin - server it will
start downloading the packages of mum
ODB okay it asks me whether it'll
download or not I had given the
permission yes so in this it will
download five packages for us one is
already been done because the size is
very less 4.6 Kb
so it took swing left less time now it's
downloading the second package for that
the size is 9 MB okay second package is
also done let's see how much time it
will take for the third package speed
looks quite good
so I don't think so it will take much
time over here 40% already done 60% gone
okay I'll person done not installing the
fourth package for that also
37% 4550 80% done and it wasn't not the
five our fifth package is quite heavy so
it will take a time for you to download
it
let's see how much time it will take 4%
is done let's wait for that till it
downloads as you can see that 38% is
done and the size of 30 MB so I 3 6 MB
is done so I think the size is quite
around 100 m e for this speed looks
quite good so I don't think so it will
take much time the stay might hit time
displays over here is 1 minute 2 minute
over here 50% done ok it means the size
is 90 MB for this as we can see that 95%
is done and 4 MB is left 88 MB is done
98% ok hundred percent is done now it
will enter the packages we don't have to
do anything for that it will
automatically do it ok it shows that the
solution is completed now we can start
the mom or DB database first of all we
have to enable MongoDB on boot for that
we have a command chk
convict iPhone - a DD space
Mongol D okay now we have to enable
Mongo D on run level for that we have a
command CH cake config
- - levels 235 support after that manga
d dot so evenly spaced all now we have
to start mobile DB server for that we
have a command EDC Mac / iya night e dot
d bat / bongo d dot start it shows me no
such file phone ok because I have used
dots start and we don't have to use
taught over here that side shows me no
such file ok
it shows starting mama D and it's ok now
we have to restart it let's see how did
you start it for that we have a command
back slash a TC backslash ini T dot d
mama D space restart it to stop the
earlier one in studied once again now
how we can stop it
EDC space ini T dot d backslash Mungo d
dot stop again I have used talk dot we
don't have to use it ok it's stopped now
finally let's start it after that we
will move to longer division
okay
finally our MongoDB started now we can
move to the manga the manga shell with
the help of command mangu okay now we
are in MongoDB shell and we have
downloaded the version of two point six
point four okay welcome to my machine
and we can write the commands over here
for the further use this is installation
for the MongoDB on send to us with the
latest version of two point six painful
