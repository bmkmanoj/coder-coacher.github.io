Azure so today in this session we'll be
understanding Microsoft Azure storage
components all right so let's go ahead
and see what is our agenda for today so
we'll start off by discussing why do we
actually need storage all right and then
we'll move on to a question which is
frequently asked that when do we huge
storage versus when do we use database
right after that we'll move on to see
the topic of the day which is waters
Azure storage and then we'll move on to
discuss the components of Azure storage
and towards the end we'll be doing a
hands-on on each and every service that
we'll be learning today all right so
guys I hope the agenda is clear to you I
welcome you all to the live session any
doubts that you have please put it in
the comment section I am a team with me
here they'll be answering all your
queries here today all right so with
that let's begin today's session with
the first topic that why do we actually
need storage alright so for this let's
take an example first let's take a use
case and see and understand what is the
need of storage in today's era alright
so for example we have an image
processing application right so for this
image processing application we have
given the user interface as a website so
around say a million people can access
my website and put in their request to
process their image alright so we don't
want the processing of the image to
happen on the server which is hosting my
map my website I wanted to be happening
on some other server all right I want
the processing to happen on a back-end
server so for that we have some back-end
servers now my request for the
processing will come in from website
servers so I need a place wherein I'll
be processed I'll be storing all the
jobs right which can be accessed by the
backend server as well so for that I
need an entity where I wherein I can
dump in all the jobs which are there
which are to be done by the back-end
servers now obviously all the jobs
cannot be done simultaneously by the
back-end servers right so say like I
said there are like million people who
are accessing your website at once and
they put in a mil
in requests right and your back-end
servers cannot process all the requests
at once so they will do it one by one
right and they can do that with the help
of this entity they will they will pick
up a job do that job and then go again
back to the entity pick up another job
go back to the entity and so on all
right so now when you have all the jobs
in this entity these jobs have to be
distributed equally to the back-end
servers right once that is done once
your back-end servers process all the
images which are there or process an
image which has which had some
operations to be done on it then the
image has to be stored somewhere right
because you have to store the end result
somewhere so you will store all the
properties like the name the location of
the image everything on the database but
here comes the change you cannot store
an image on a database I mean you cannot
actually do that but when you look at
the data that an image contains it is
all randomized it is there is no
structure in the data that an image has
or for that matter any video files or
any any kind of file has right so that
is the reason we need an entity to
actually store this kind of data so that
the processing that is required to query
this kind of data which would have been
there in the case when you would have
stored your image in the database right
so in that case process a lot of
processing is required if you try to
query them so we wanted the processing
power to become less the processing
burden to become less and hence we ends
we wanted an entity we can do which can
actually store any kind of file let it
be images let it be video files etc came
in storage so let's discuss the first
case wherein we had to store the jobs
right so when storage came in now we can
actually put in say 10 thousand jobs per
second inside this storage this storage
service without any overburden on any of
the servers beat back-end servers or
beat website servers right so the
processing time has drastically reduced
and the jobs are now listed in the queue
so Q is actually a service which is
offered by
right so now what back in Chavez will do
is it will take up the job from there
and execute it and once they have
executed that job will be deleted and
the next job will be queued next when we
talk about this section where and we had
to store images so now any kind of file
can be stored on this storage service
which is offered by cloud it's not only
limited to the cloud if you think about
it in your computer and your own local
computer on your mobile you store some
pictures or you store some video files
right and you store it inside a file
system it is not a database it is a file
system and it can contain all the
objects that you want to store you don't
you do not store your objects inside a
database all right so this is why
storage is needed let's go in under and
understand what is the difference
between storage and a database so a
storage is basically needed whenever you
have objects like I said so you have
when you have music files when you
whenever you have video files whenever
you have images right so in all these
kind of cases you use a storage kind of
service but when you have see something
related to the metadata of a file for
example when you store the file in the
storage like you need to have the
location of that particular file you
need to have the properties of that
particular file so all these things all
the properties all the any location
column that you want to add all these
are structured right they are not
randomized and hence they can be added
inside a database beat sequel or no
sequel it can be added right so this is
the main difference this is how you'll
differentiate between using a storage
and a database moving along guys so now
we have understood what databases water
storage services when do we use the
storage service when do we use the
database service let's move on to the
topic of the damages as your storage so
what is as your storage so as your
storage is a service from a server so
you use it whenever you want to store
something on the cloud and since we are
using the cloud provider as as y'all
will be using the storage service from
Azure and that's so
service is called e as your storage
service now when you begin to use the
azure storage service first of all you
should have a storage account which you
can create in the azure management
portal so let me show you how you can do
that so let me quickly jump on to my
browser so that I can show you my Azure
dashboard so guys this is how my
dashboard actually looks like right so
as you can see on my dashboard
I have all these services listed so what
I'm interested in today is the storage
account so I'll click on storage
accounts so I have some deployed already
over here I click on add to add a new
storage account and then I'll have this
page now you will enter the name of the
storage account here so that name has to
be unique so let me enter a name say
live demo 2 3 2 double 3 6 alright so
that seems to be available then comes
the option of account kind right so how
do you want that account to be what
would it be a blob storage or going to
be a general purpose so we don't want to
restrict our account to only blob
storage we want a general purpose
account alright so we'll choose that and
then comes the replication part how do
you want your data to be replicated now
there are quite a few in what should I
say there are quite a few good options
that we have here one is called the
locally redundant storage so when we
have the locally redundant storage what
this basically means is so understand it
like this that there are regions and
inside a region there are zones so for
example we have the US and inside us we
have cities like Chicago New York right
now in New York and Chicago are two
zones and the region is us all right so
when I say locally redundant storage
what that basically mean is that inside
a zone that is inside in say New York
you have a data center for Azure in in
that data center you are so your storage
account has been created so when you
select the options or option of locally
redundant storage what basically
Italy it'll replicate your data inside
the data warehouse it is replicate the
data inside the data center in which you
have actually deployed your storage
account so that if one server crashes
you you have your storage account in
other server in that same particular
premise right but when we choose zone
redundant storage what that basically
means is so our zone was Chicago or New
York right
so in Chicago if you have a data center
in New York if you have a data center so
whatever is there in the New York data
center will be replicated to the Chicago
data center as well so that if one zone
goes down so if this if the data center
in New York goes down Chicago would be
up and hence your storage account can
still be used all right so that is what
the meaning of zone redundant storages
when we talk about geo redundant storage
what we basically mean is you have
different reasons so for example we have
the US region and we have the India
region so inside so inside India region
we have different zones right so if it's
select the geo redundant option we will
have the readwrite access to both these
regions that is in the US region and the
India region as well so whatever you
have deployed in the US region in the
Chicago zone will be replicated across
India region as well whatever zones you
ever deployed in India regions also all
right so this is what the meaning what
is the meaning of georan and storage and
then we had the read access geo
redundant storage which is a very
interesting option wherein you only get
a read access of the redundancy for
example your main server is in New York
right so it's a zone inside the u.s.
region so if you select read access geo
redundant storage if in India your your
data will be replicated to India as well
but when a failover happens that is when
your New York server is down and when
you are accessing when you're redirected
to the India region in that case you can
only read the data you cannot write on
it all right
so it is useful for those applications
which only fetch data and there is
nothing to write so in that case your
internal storage would actually be
pretty costly for you but if you select
the read acts
during an assorted it is a less little
less cheaper than the regio redundant
option since you are not writing on it
you don't want your data to be
replicated whenever you write a thing
right and that so this is the reason
that read access Geo redundant storage
is kind of cheap but since as is the
demo today so I'll select locally
redundant storage and then the
subscription you can choose
pay-as-you-go or free tier in your
option if you have created a new as your
account and then comes the resource
group so resource group is nothing but a
group of resources so it is basically
created to manage your resources more
efficiently in the case when you have a
large use case wherein you're deploying
a host of different services if you
include them inside one group it becomes
easier to manage because if you want to
delete all the resources you just have
to delete the group and all the
resources and the dependencies will be
deleted automatically right so this is
how the resource group is helpful so
we'll create a new resource group today
let it be live - demo one right and
we'll pin it to dashboard and we'll
click on create so when you pin it to
dashboard it basically has a shortcut on
the desktop for Azure so let me so while
this is being created let me show you
how that dashboard actually looks like
so that dashboard basically gives you
all the shortcuts that you want so this
is the dashboard guys so you get all the
shortcuts that you want to your services
right so my life so my my storage
account is now being created it is
called live demo - double 3:6 so I can
quickly access it from here rather than
to go to my store particular storage
account over here and then accessing it
alright so while this is being created
guys this was about as your storage this
is how you create a swathe account let
me come back to my slide so this is what
an azure storage is let's move on to
discuss the components of Azure storage
so right till now we have discussed how
we can create a storage account but
inside the storage account you have a
host of different services which you can
make use according to your use case
alright so the first
is called The Blob service so blah de
blah blah whistle Blob service is
nothing but a file system service
wherein you can upload any kind of file
right so for those of you who know about
AWS so AWS has a service called s3 right
so it is exactly like s3 right there is
nothing change into it just the name of
the service is called blob
now inside blob you can upload any kind
of file and then that file can be
accessed by depending on the permissions
that your girl can be accessed by any
anyone on the planet for example you
have created a website and it's showing
some images so those images rather being
on the websites server it could be there
on blog and can be accessed directly
through the link of any object that you
actually upload in the blog alright
having said that guys let me quickly
show you how you can create a blob
storage so let me go back to my
dashboard so as you can see my storage
account has now been created so if I go
into my storage account
I get the screen where and I have to
choose a service alright so let me click
on blobs because that is what I want to
create I click on blobs
I'll open open it and ok I'll open it in
the same tab and then it will show me a
screen where it will show me that there
has nothing been added right so there
are no containers yet so what are
containers containers are nothing but
folders that you have inside the blog
all right so you cannot store anything
in the root directory that is you cannot
store upload any file over here you have
to have a folder inside which you will
be uploading your files all right so the
folders are nothing but containers don't
get confused with the nomenclature right
so inside this I will create a container
called live - demo right so it's done
the access type is blob so what that
basically means is if it's private it
cannot be accessed by anyone if it's
blob inside this particular container
all the files can be accessed and if if
it's container this basically means that
if it
this container you have created one more
folder that also can be accessed but
when we select blob only the files can
be accessed so we'll select blob and
we'll click on OK and it will hardly
take a second to create a container in
the blob service right so we have a
container now which is the live demo and
if you go inside this container there is
nothing in it as of now right so now I
have actually created a website which
can interact with the blob service so
let me show you how that website
actually looks like but before that let
me show you the queue service I discover
the queue service first and then we'll
come back and discuss the blob alright
so let me come back to my slide so blobs
like I said you have created a blob you
can upload any kind of file inside a
blob using a website or you can read the
files as well from a website alright
let's move on and discuss queues so what
accuse queues are basically it's exactly
like a data structure wherein you
whatever information goes first is the
first to come out as well alright so you
use queues to basically list jobs so in
our use case we discussed that we have
an amount image processing application
which has millions of users accessing it
and since millions of jobs cannot be
executed at once they are listed inside
the queue so that the server at its own
pace can fetch the jobs and execute it
alright so this is what a queue is all
about as simple as that now the way you
can create queues in the azure dashboard
is something like this that you have
your storage account right so let me go
to my storage account so my storage
account is now being opening alright so
inside my storage account with the blob
service as well I had queues option
right so I'll go to that queues option
and create a new queue so my my soul is
account was live demo to double 3:6
right and now I will choose queues I'll
go inside queues and as you can see as
of now there are no queues that have
been created so I'll create a new queue
and let me call it hello one two three
all right so I'll create the queue now
so my queue has now been created
now if I go to my website which is
therefore Q this is how my website will
look like if I want to upload some data
into Q so this is the sample website
guys that I have created now this
website has to have the has to know how
to interact with your Q service for that
you have a thing called your connection
string so every storage account that you
create will have a unique connection
string that you have to include in your
code now if I click on access keys here
you will go to your storage account and
then you will have this pin in that you
have to go to access keys once you go to
access keys you will have a connection
string and a key so you have to have the
connection string in your code included
so that your code can interact with the
particular service all right so I'll go
to my Q's code so my Q code is this and
if you can see this is the connection
string that I have to specify I'll
copy/paste this connection string over
here and this endpoint has to be removed
because it is not required in the
connection string once you do that you
will save it and my bucket name sorry my
container sorry my cue name is hello 1 2
3 so it has been already specified here
right now I'll go back I will go to my
website which is this right so I've
already specified to it for it to send
messages to my queue right so if I send
a message saying hello world right and I
click on send a message it will actually
send that message to my queue which can
be seen here so as if you if I go to my
queue you can see that a message has
been added which says hello world
alright so this is what I just entered
now if I go on and process this queue
which is I want to receive message now
so I'll have to change this in the PHP
as well so I'll go to my process PHP for
my cue I will change my connection
string so that it can interact with the
queue and fetch the messages from over
there right I'll change it here
I'll change the end point as well and
now my code will be able to interact
with my cue that I've just created all
right so if I go to processed or PHP
it'll basically fetch the message from
that cue and display it here all right
so as you can see the message received
as hello world
if I enter any other message say add
Eureka is the best right I entered this
message I send it to the queue all right
and now when I process it I'll get the
same message back and if you will see
over here guys I will just refresh it
now as you can see him the message has
been processed and it has been deleted
from the queue so as and when the
message is processed it is automatically
deleted from the queue all right so this
was how my queues work let me quickly
show you how the blobs work all right so
let me go to my blobs website so this is
where I'll be uploading a file onto
blobs and again I have to change the
connection string again right so I'll go
to my blob code and change the
connection string which was here all
right
I'll change the connection string to my
current storage account and my container
name I have already specified it to be
live demo right I created a live demo
container now if I'll save this code and
if now I choose a file and say I upload
the desert file all right so what it
does is it basically renames then the
the name of that file automatically
according to system time so that there's
no clash when 2 or 3 files are created
with the same name all right so I'll
upload this file now so as of now as you
can see if we go into our blob there are
no files right if I go inside my blob
which is here there's no file in it
right but the moment I upload the file
from this particular website
my file will be listed here so as you
can see my file has been successfully
added over here and now if I go to the
particular link of this file I'll be
able to download the file right so my
dump my file is now being downloaded and
once it is downloaded and if I try to
open it it'll be the same file that i
just uploaded right so if i open it now
you can see this is the file that we
uploaded in the blog and it is now
accessible on this particular link by
everyone in the world alright so this is
how cool blob is now I'll be using blob
and Q's together let me show you how so
what I basically do now is this this
image or this image that I've just
uploaded has also been added to the
queue that I created so let me show you
the queue so if you see the queue it'll
list the message that or the file name
that we have just uploaded will go into
queues this is my queue and as you can
see this image has been added to the
queue now I'll process this image and
the way I'll do it is like this that the
image will be fetched from the queue and
then the link of that image will be gone
too and that image will go into the
background of the website alright so for
that first I have to change the code
obviously so I'll go to my blog process
website right and I will change the
connection string to the one that we are
using right now one second right so this
is my connection string I'll change it
to what we are using right now
right and then also I have to change the
link that will be accessing the file
right so this is the link that it is
accessing so the link has changed now
because the storage account has changed
right through let me
select the link for it so I will go
inside blobs and I'll go inside the
container so this link is going to so
from from this point onwards till this
point that is till the container name
the link will be same right so let me
copy the link and paste it in my colons
and I'll show you what I mean so if I
paste the link here so the link to live
demo will be same and just a file name
has to be fetched right so this is the
this file name I am fetching from the
queue and what we'll do now is it will
fetch the file name from the queue and
we'll change the background of the
particular website right so if I process
the page now that is processed or PHP
what will happen is it will fetch the
file from the queue until it change the
background all right so I have dated the
desert file right so it is showing the
desert background now now I'll show you
how exactly queues are basically used so
say I upload say three four files right
I applaud this flower image and mind you
the file that the message that means
just received would have been deleted
from the queue all right and I just show
you whether that is working or not so
I'll upload this flower file it might
take some time because the files are
kind of large all right so the file will
be uploaded okay it gave me an error let
me upload it again so I'll choose a file
so sometimes when the size window the
size of the file is more it throws you
an error right you cannot do anything
about it
so let me upload the file again so once
it is uploaded guys I be able to see it
here right so I have like three files
right now so it says a Weldon block did
complete and if i refresh it I'll be
able to see for three files now cool so
if I go to processed or PHP now it will
not list me the previous file that I
uploaded but the recent
that I just uploaded so let me go to
process and now it will show me the
image that I've just uploaded all right
it will fetch it from the queue the file
name and then it will show me in the
background
all right the net is a little slow bear
with me
all right so as you can see the file has
been there I'm getting some weird error
where just because the net is not
working but forget this error guys you
can see you you get the image in the
background right so similar is the case
now let me go to my storage accounts so
we have discussed queues and blobs now
right so let me go to my slides so you
discussed what blobs are we have
discussed what queues are let me go to
my file system which is the best thing
that I have figured out in Azure so with
file system it is exactly like blobs you
can upload any kind of file but with
file system you can actually mount it as
a drive on your computer right you can
use it as it as if it was an extended
drive in your own computer right but and
also you get an authentication protocol
with it which is called the SMB 3.0
protocol which is used by servers when
whenever there is a file transaction so
that authentication you will also get
when you're using the file system and -
and how you can mount it let me show you
how so
first of all this mounting process is
not available in Windows 7 it is only
available in Windows 10 and above so
what I've done is I've deployed a
virtual machine in Azure let me show you
the virtual machine right so this is my
virtual machine so I have deployed a
Windows 2012 server on this now what
we'll be doing is we'll be mapping the
file that we'll be creating in our
storage account in this particular
system alright so I'll connect to it and
now it will ask me the username and the
password so I'll specify the password
and I'll click on OK yes and then I'll
be connected to my system
so I'm in so this is my system guys so
if I go to my computer right now as you
can see there is no Drive that is listed
right so we'll be creating a network
drive over here on which we can upload
any kind of file now the way to do that
is to first go to your as your dashboard
and create a file over there create a
file system directory over there right
so we'll go to us told accounts so it is
in live demo to double three six and
then we'll be going to files right so as
of now as you can see there is no
directory which has been listed here so
I'll create a file save a share service
and let me name it something as my drive
right and the quota is basically how
many GBS of drive do you want right it
can go two terabytes but since I'm doing
a demo let me create a hundred GB drive
right now right so I create a hundred GB
drive and I'll click on ok all right so
my drive has been successfully created
right so I'll go to the drive I'll click
on connect and then I will get this
command to connect to it all right I'll
copy this command and I'll paste it in
the notepad so I'll use this in my so
that I've just deployed now how will you
use this now if you look at this command
guys this is the address of your server
alright so this is the address of the
your storage account and this is the
file share that we have just created
which is called my drive write the user
name to access this would be Azul slash
live demo to double 3:6 alright and the
password for this would be the key which
has been specified here now I have to
specify everything in that I just
mentioned in this server that I have
created all right so the way you will
map the network drive is like this we'll
go to PC you will right click it and you
will click on map network drive
alright now it will ask us the drive
name that we want to allocate it so for
example we want to allocate the K Drive
to it alright and in this particular
thing you will be putting in your
address of the server right so let me
copy the address of the server which is
this alright I'll copy the address and
I'll save it over here alright
so it has saved it and now I will click
on finish so if everything goes well
guys it will ask you for the username
and the password
now the username would be this that is
as your slash live demo to double 36
right so I'll go to my server paste
username here and then it'll ask me the
password so like I said the password
would be this your key so I'll copy the
password I'll paste it here that is in
this particular field and click on
remember my credentials and click on OK
so now if everything is authenticated
it'll go inside my drive so as you can
see I'm inside my drive right now and if
I go to this PC that is my computer I
can see that a drive has been added over
here now this drive in this drive as you
can see the total size is 100 GB and the
space free is under TP so this is the
quota that we assigned in file share
while creating it right now if I want to
copy any file over here I can easily do
that I will just copy this particular
file and paste it here right so it'll
easily copy it and say I want to I want
a shortcut to be copied here I can
shortcut copy the shortcut as well
because I don't have any files on this
particular server that I can show that I
can copy here so as you can see the
files have been copied here and these
actually having uploaded to this your
account as well right so let me show you
on the dashboard if these files are
visible so I'll go to these your
dashboard and this is my Drive if i
refresh it right now refresh so it'll
ask me all the files that I've just
uploaded alright so it is taking some
time
and so basically when you create a
network drive in your own computer it is
as if you are using your own driver on
your local computer if you in an
Internet network its code right so as
you can see we have added these two
files in our directory in the server and
you can view it here as well and you can
download it from here you can click on
it you can download it and anyone can
now download it if they have the link
all right so we are done with files of
some let players come back to a slide
and discuss our last component of today
which is tables now tables is again an
amazing service from a Java so it is
just like no sequel but it is basically
you can say a child of no sequel you
cannot do complex queries on it now the
way or the advantage of using tables is
that say you have a data of in which the
structure is changing dynamically you
what I mean by that is say you are and
you have a form you have created a
website in which it accept three things
it accepts your name it accepts your
mobile number and it accepts your
location all right so once it does that
it will upload it in the database right
normal as usual but what if tomorrow I
use case comes in wherein I want to add
one more field which maybe is asking for
your credit card number right so if it
is asking that if you were using
traditional systems you would have to go
to your database and add one more column
and then go on to change your user
interface and your PHP or whatever
scripting language you're using but with
tables the thing is that you don't have
to change anything in the backend as in
you don't have to change anything in
your database it'll it will
automatically adjust according to your
data and create one more field which is
basically add which is basically you're
trying to ingest for example in our case
we are trying to ingest the credit card
number as well so it will do that
automatically so let me show you how you
can use the table service so we'll come
back to our dashboard and go to storage
accounts right and again in in your
storage account you'll have all the
services listed so we will select tables
will go inside tables
right and once we are inside tables
we'll have to create a new table so
let's name this table as a new table
right
and we'll click on ok so my table has
now been created all right now the way
you can upload your data to this table
is the same you just copy the connection
string you call the API and you can
upload your data but to view the data in
the table you will need your visual
studio alright so this is a one table
that I created earlier
so for adding it I'll show you how to
add it but first let me add some values
inside this particular table that is my
new table right so there is nothing
inside it because I just created it so
what I'll be doing is I will be going
I'll be showing you the website through
which I'll be uploading the data into
the table so it is this so this is my
website using which I'll be updating the
table right now
the way I will be doing it is I'd be
first changing the connection string so
the connection string can be found here
right I'll have to change this this is
my connection code for table so I'll
have to change the default connection
string so let us quickly change it this
is my connection string I'll come back
to my code paste it here right and
remove the endpoint cool so my
connection string has been given now I
have to change the table name as well so
my table name is new table right and
alright so nothing else has to be
changed cool so our code is done now
I'll come back to my slide and refresh
it
alright so now there are two things that
you have to understand that are there in
a table one is called the partition key
and one is called the row key all right
what is partition key what is rocky let
me explain you
so whatever files are you try
to store in your table are stored in
different nodes when I say nodes there
are basically different servers all
right now each server will have a
partition key which can identify it so
say there is server one server to server
3 and server for all right so I want to
store my data in server 1 all right so
my particular type of data that I want
to store in Suffern 1 so for that the
partition could be partition key would
be 1 right now inside my server every
row has to be identified by a unique
identifier and their incomes in the row
key so this row keys should be unique to
each and every record that you will be
putting inside a partition key table
that is inside that particular server if
you change the server again the row key
can be same as that of the previous
server but when your you are creating
records inside one particular partition
key the rows key value has to be
different all right
having said that guys so we have this
website and we have created our new
table over here all right
now what I will be doing is I will be
mapping this new table in my visual
studio now the way to do that is open
your visual studio go to server explorer
and once you have you'll be listed your
as your service over here all right now
I have to map my particular storing
account on this visual studio as well so
the way to do that is in the storage
section click right click it and click
on attach external storage all right so
once that is done it will ask me the
account name and the account key now the
way to attach it is like this that you
will go to the table service so your
storage account you will copy the name
paste in the account name and then your
connection string sorry your key right
so in this case you'll be copying the
key and you have to pace the key here
remember the account key so that you
don't have to enter it again and again
and click on ok so this will add your
storage account over here right so this
is my storage account live demo to
double 3 6
right so my storage account has now been
added and inside it I have created a
table called the new table all right so
if I click on the new table as you can
see there is nothing that has been added
as of now so what I'll do is from my
website now I'll add a new value so I
have already specified the partition key
as default it is called task Seattle
right all I will be doing is I'll be
entering the name over here now entering
the row key over here which will be
unique alright so as of now there are no
records so I'll enter one as my as my
arrow key and now I'll enter the columns
that I want this row this particular row
is the number is the columns and this is
the values that that I want for that
particular column so for that I was for
example I want the name column to be
there right inside the name column I
want the name he month all right I
specified that and say I want my mobile
number to be there I'll specify mobile
you know right and I specify the mobile
number here that is one two three four
five six seven eight nine see and now
I'll click on upload data so this will
upload the data to the table that I just
created so if I go here go back to my
visual studio and i refresh it I'll be
able to see that new record has been
entered in which the row key is 1 right
the name is he month and the mobile
number is this now say I want to add one
more field which is asking for my credit
card number right so as I said the
rookie would be different now I'll enter
the name so whatever column you have
already specified it'll go inside the
same column so I have already specified
name right so if I enter the value hey
month here it will not create a new
column and enter the value hey month
over there it will just create then
column which is new to the data alright
so the mobile number is again say five
six seven eight and now I will ask me
for my credit card number right so the
credit card number could be
all right so now if I upload the data
and I'll show you how it looks now so as
you can see now the credit card number
of field has been added so the for the
first record there is nothing there in
the credit card number field but in the
second record I have added that I want
this data alright
also guys you can specify in any order
there is no specific order that you have
to specify right so I can enter the name
first right and then I can enter the
credit card number so this is the credit
card number that I want to add right and
say I'm entering the Mobile's here right
if I upload the data now so this is
required sorry three upload data this
data will be updated and if i refresh it
now you can see that
okay so M capital and AM small you have
to be careful of the of the indentation
of the sorry your syntax as well so
whatever column names you're specifying
it is case sensitive so like you can see
I made a mistake here by specifying a
small C and it created one more column
alright but as you can see the name is
in the same column now alright so what
in in whatever sorry in whatever
sequence you can add your record that
record will be added automatically in
its respective column alright so this is
how tables can be used alright guys so
with that I think we are done with our
services so we discussed water blow ups
we discussed what a queues we discussed
what our file systems we discussed what
our tables and for each of the service
we saw how we can use them in Azure and
how we can deploy them as well alright
guys so with that I conclude today's
session thank you for attending today's
session I hope you learned something new
today
