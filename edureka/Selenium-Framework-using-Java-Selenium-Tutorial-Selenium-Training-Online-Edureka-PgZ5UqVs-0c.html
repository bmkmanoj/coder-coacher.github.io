that selenium is the most widely used
automation testing tool but you might
not be aware that you can use various
frameworks and selenium to optimize a
code structure so my name is Walden and
in today's session I'm going to talk
about what is a selenium framework
world's a need for it what are the
benefits that you'll get out of
implementing a selenium framework and of
course I'm going to talk about these
three types of selenium frameworks
data-driven testing framework
keyword-driven testing framework and
hybrid framework I hope the agenda was
clear you people so let me get started
we need to use a selenium framework
because finding and fixing a very small
part in a million line code is insanely
challenging and besides as a selenium
tester we need automation right we need
automation in places like fitting the
data to the data script because how many
times will you have a single data script
in which you will be manually changing
the data how many times will you feed
different data to your data script to
make sure that different test cases
succeed you need automation for that
reason and you need your code to be
simple you should be able to understand
your code and if you have a bug you
should be able to easily and efficiently
fix that bug right for these reasons you
need to use a selenium framework I'm
pretty sure I'm not making too much
sense right now so let me go forward and
explain what I'm talking about in more
detail but before I go forward let me
tell you what are the benefits of a
selenium framework first and foremost
when you implement a selenium framework
there is increased code reuse it which
is a very very good thing because if
your code is too big you will have a
problem understanding your code smaller
the code the better and when you say
code reuse a JIT means that you will
have a small piece of code for a
particular functionality and at a later
point of time if you need to use the
same functionality then it can call that
particular code instead of rewriting
that same code right you can reuse that
code which you've written earlier that's
the benefit the second benefit is that
there is improved code readability it
means that when your code is smaller and
it follows the framework pattern then
your code is more readable
there's unwanted complexity but for
every single functionality you will have
a small piece of code and if you want to
modify any functionality if you want to
modify that test for a particular
functionality you need to only modify a
small piece of code and modifying that
small piece of code will not have any
dependency on other parts if you are
having one single test script in mature
testing five different functionalities
then the code is going to be pretty huge
right by making changes to one part of
the code you might be affecting other
parts right the other functionalities so
you can avoid that by breaking the
entire hole into smaller parts of code
and then testing them the next benefit
is that with the help of a selenium
framework there is higher portability so
if you have a smaller piece of code that
code can be moved easily to another
package or to another project or if you
want to just use it later for some other
purpose you can do that there is no
stopping you and most of all your script
maintenance is going to be very very
simple because if there is something
that you want to change you'll be
changing only that part and that will
not affect anything else in your code
because it's going to be a very small
class or a small method in a small test
case which you will have to modify
nothing more nothing less right so these
are some of the benefits of a selenium
framework and now that you people have
understood this part let me go forward
and start off with our actual topics
okay let's start with what is a selenium
framework and as it says you're a
selenium framework is just a code
structure to make your code maintenance
simpler and to make your code
readability better and there are various
framework that we can use like I said
earlier we have something called as a
Durban framework we have a keyword
driven framework and we have a hybrid
framework so our D ragaman framework is
a technique wherein you would be
separating your test script and your
data set so whatever data you want to
feed that will be separated from your
actual test case okay and a keyword
driven framework is something similar
but yet different the difference is that
instead of separating the data set from
the test script we will be separating
the methods which need to be executed in
that same test script so you have a test
script and the methods which need to be
executed in this just stripped to make
sure you're testing the application
those methods will be stored separately
that's it that is the only difference
and then we have hybrid framework which
basically implements the best features
of both of these frameworks okay so
these are the types and let me get
started with explaining each of them one
after the other and of course I'm gonna
give you a demonstration okay so let's
start with a data driven framework a
data driven framework is a testing
strategy in which the data set under
test is stored separately from the desk
crypt let's take an example of me
logging into a web application and I
want to test that success okay and if I
want to basically achieve automation
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
separate the data set in my case the
radar set is gonna be the username and
the password fields correct these
details if I have let's say ten or five
sets of these login credentials I will
store them separately in a different
file in my case I'm gonna store it in an
excel file and basically my test script
will only contain the functionality to
test the web application and whenever it
needs data to enter into the login
button or into the password button then
it would fetch it from the excel file
and then feed it over there and then
continue with the execution of the test
okay so that's how simple that is
and the big benefit with implementing
this data-driven framework is that your
automation testing here is driven by
your data set so basically at the later
point of time if you want to change the
data set you can do it without affecting
your code okay you just need to go and
edit your excel file and nothing more
you can have but 50 credentials there
you can have hundred n chills there you
can have any number and that's all going
to impact your code here okay and the
best part is the same script is gonna be
used for n number of tests so having
said this let me go to the next slide
and ask you this question your can a
selenium webdriver read data from an
excel file for input because that would
be trying to achieve your correct and
the answer for this is no selenium
webdriver cannot on its own read data
from an excel file and then we'll come
the next question you can ask if it
cannot read then how will we feed the
data from the excel to the webdriver
correct that's a brilliant question and
the answer to that is we can use an
external tool called Apache Pui okay you
can use Apache
Pui for both reading and writing
operations on Microsoft files not just
Excel files
okay so Apache Pui is an open source
tool and it's a library which is nothing
but a set of programs or a set of
functions which allows us to really
create or edit these Microsoft documents
using Java ok so let me go forward and
get to more details this is gonna be the
demo that I'm going to show you okay I
have my excel file here something
similar to this in one column I have my
username credentials and in the other
column I have my password credentials
and these two need to be sent as a pair
to my program to execute my test and as
part of Apache 8py there is something
called as data provider function and
this data provide a function is what I'm
gonna use to basically read my data from
the excel file okay this is the method
which is going to do that for me let me
explain this code but before that let me
go and open up my Eclipse which is going
to be the IDE where I will be walking
and on this Eclipse IDE let me give you
more details so this is my Eclipse and I
have this project here right
selenium frameworks gem so this is my
project and inside this project I have
three packages one is Poddar driven the
other is keyword driven and the third is
hybrid framework so I will be showing
you a demonstration of these three okay
so let me open up data driven first and
open up these two classes which is going
to be my demo now that DDT Excel door
Java class right this is going to be my
main class or my main test case which is
going to do the functionality but just
to read data from an external excel file
I have written another class and you're
of use Apache API functionalities okay
so I've used as X SSF workbook and X as
a sheet now these two are very prominent
libraries or let's say functions that
come with Apache TOI I'm using them to
read my your excel sheet and then get
data from there let me first start off
by explaining this main class of mine
okay so here what I've done is I
importer these set of libraries these
are very simple and you should know why
I've imported them so let me just
minimize this and coming to my class so
basically the first thing I've done in
my classes have created a chrome driver
object and updated this outside because
I want to do it globally because all my
other functionalities all my other
methods which is containing the
functionality to perform the test they
all have ad rate tests annotations and
because I cannot have my chrome driver
inside one of these annotations I have
defined it globally outside and coming
to the next line I have an ad rate test
annotation to basically execute my
method your and my methodist demo
project okay and to this demo project
method I will have to provide my
username and password credentials so
I've used the driver dot find element
command to pass the username and the
password credentials to my web driver
okay I have got specified that I want to
perform the test on this particular URL
and I've of course set the system
property over here okay and most
importantly I have mentioned that the
data provided for this is test data so
what this means is there is an external
method and the method which has the
annotation name as eita provider will be
the method that will be passing the
username and password credentials to
this particular method of mine okay so
ad rate test is the annotation here and
if you come down I have another method
you're right public object so this
method has been annotated with data
provider so this means that the user
name and password credentials will be
read by this method and paused to this
particular method of mine
okay guys and basically everything else
is very simple so once I have passed it
to my web driver I'm just trying to log
in by pressing the click button and then
I'm waiting for some time till the
entire functionality takes place and I'm
verifying if my login is successful or
if it's not successful I am doing that
by getting the title of my webpage so
when I log in this is gonna be the title
okay this is supposed to be the title of
the webpage so what I obtain and
in this get title variable if that
matches this there my test is a pass
right if it does not then it's invalid
and after that I have another small
method which is basically to terminate
my session so I've used and after method
annotation for that let's say when all
the methods get completely executed data
in this will be executed and my program
will quit now let me go to this part of
my program which is nothing but the data
provider and explain you how I'm reading
data into this method so I've created
this method as an added ok and here what
I'm doing is I'm calling my second class
so the read excel file here right so
this is a class and as you can see this
is the same read excel file class and
I'm creating an object instance of that
class and as you know this is the rule
to create an object right and while
creating an object of this read X and
file class I am passing the place where
my login credentials are present so the
excel file is called as logon
credentials dot xlsx and it's present in
this path so i am just feeling the path
ok so basically when this class is
called from that matter
it's called along with the excel path
right it's passed with some parameters
and that is what is received over here
now the funny thing that you might
notice your is there's another method
that I've started with the same name as
the class so when you have a method in
your class which has the same name as
your class then that's called as a
constructor ok so it's not technically a
method it's basically a constructor
which has the same name as my class name
so this constructor has the pass through
my excel file is present ok and here on
this using a try-catch block to catch
any exception if it arises ok and what
I'm doing is as you can see there is
something called as X SSF workbook and X
s SF sheet right now these two are in
build libraries that come with Apache py
and I have created objects for those ok
objects with web and sheet so these are
the two one name so for access s
workbook which will help me deal with
the Excel workbook and this would help
me deal with
a particular sheet in that excel file
okay so the object name for that is
sheet and for this is WB and have this
initiated that process you're okay
so I've created a new fire and I've fed
the file name the file path over here
and again this file input stream is a
function that we get with our Apache API
library right so if there is any problem
here so ideally there should be no
problem okay but if there is ever any
problem in reading this excel file then
that would be thrown as an exception so
program termination would not hold but
it would be just thrown as an exception
at the end of the program whenever the
Year execution is something that I am
the exception will be thrown okay and it
would be thrown with the help of this
println statement that makes it
displayed but getting back to the main
method which actually does my reading
okay so that is done over here so I have
two methods which is string get data and
int get row count okay so two methods
get data and row count I am using the
gate a row count method to basically
find out how many rows are there in my
excel file because that would be used to
define the number of times I will read
my excel file because I will be running
a for loop right if you go back to here
you can see that I am running a for loop
to basically execute multiple login
credentials so how many our doggin
credentials are present in my excel file
that many times this follow-up would be
executed okay and then I have a get data
method which would basically take the
sheet number row and column as the
parameters and use that to read my data
inside the cell okay so this is to
basically read the data inside myself so
you not understand this method if I do
not go back to my main class file okay
so let me go here and explain every
single blind one after the other so I'm
creating a new object called Rose so
here I'm getting the value of my row
count okay but when I want to find out
the number of rows are all there after
also specify the sheet number so that is
why you can see a 0 over here correct so
if I go here you can see that this is
the login credentials and
the name over here is sheet one okay but
the index is ideally zero so this is the
sheet number zero right index right so
this is what I have passed as parameters
when I'm calling the getter method okay
and when I'm calling this method I would
come here and the same sheet number zero
would be rotten as the input okay so
I'll be using the sheet number to
identify how many rows are there in that
particular sheet so this is the logic
that I have used to find out the number
of rows so I've said in row is equal to
WB dot get a sheet at with this sweet
index
okay so WB has the path and the excel
file which has a credentials and it will
go to this particular sheet having index
number of zero and it would get the
number of the last row okay so get last
row number is again an inbuilt library
which would obtain what is the number of
the last row so if I go here the number
would be zero one two three and four
index wise it's zero to four and the
four is what would be present here and
what I'm doing is I'm saying Rho is
equal to Rho plus 1 which would make it
a Rho is equal to Phi because I have a
five Prudential I cannot give the entry
as four over there because index starts
from zero because it's as from zero I
have just appended one manually
okay and then I'm basically returning
this value of Rho so that value of Rho
would be stored in this particular
object okay now the next thing that we
are doing is we are creating another
object for storing the credentials I am
creating a two-dimensional array where
I'll be storing both the username and
the password as two-dimensional array
okay this is the name of the object so
the size of the object is going to be
controlled by this two dimensional array
right so the number of rows is going to
be the number of rows that is obtained
and present in this object and the
number of columns is going to be two
because if you go back to my excel of
course there are just two columns so
so that's gonna be the size of my
two-dimensional array okay
row size by column size and to basically
read the data from each and every single
cell I am writing a for loop where and I
am running a follow for the number of
rows that are present and I'm increasing
it every single time and every time I am
reading a particular cell I'm reading it
for the I throw and a zero column and I
throw an first column so when my I is
equal to zero it starts from I is equal
to zero right so at that time it would
pick up the value in cell number zero
and zero so index wise the value of this
cell is zero and zero right this is zero
and one so if I want to pick up the
reader in this cell then I would say get
me data which is present in I throw and
zero column and I throw and first column
and when I say first column it is this
right and this would be asked when this
gate data method is being called so the
gate data method is called with these
parameters which means that get the
radar that is present in this format
zero to sheet number I throw an 0th
column and again all your would be zero
with sheet number right column and first
row and first column and the credentials
here would be basically returned with
this particular data provider annotation
right this particular method it will be
returned so that's how it's going to
work but how is my get data here reading
the cell value present in this
particular cell that we can see from
here okay so get data method is there
here and it would receive three
parameters like I told you before sheet
number row and column and what I'm
saying here is I'm creating a new object
again sheet where and I'm gonna say get
the sheet number where I am saying axis
this particular sheet number using this
library WB which is my excel file get to
that sheet number and once have access
the sheet number I am saying create a
new object called data which is of type
string and store this data get the row
value of this row and what's posture and
get the cell value of this column okay
the column that is passed over here
right so get that value and return and
back you just
okay so and using returned data for that
and obviously the method whichever is
calling this one would get back the
values and since the method were just
calling this method this is my test data
feed this would get back the values and
it would sort in this two dimensional
credentials array and from the
credentials array it would go back to my
test annotation here which is my first
method called demo project once it's
received over here the username and
password it would basically be paused
whenever it's needed okay and my web
application would get the login and
password feels like that so that's how
my code is structured all right so let
me execute this program and show you how
the demo works so I'm just clicking on
this Run button here and let's just wait
for my chrome to open here we go chrome
robinson's waited and this is my first
test case right rose ed rekha and the
password was fed
Chrome browsers are closed and again my
Chrome browser is gonna reopen
and it's gonna basically check for every
single credential it's gonna check if I
can log-in or not if it logs and it
means that the credentials are valid
otherwise their credentials are invalid
okay so the first to succeed it I could
login but the next three I can however
not login right my login has failed over
here and that's what we would get in my
test result it would say that three
crown jewels failed so let's just wait
up for that
so there we go my five different test
cases successfully executed and if I
pull it up it shows that the number of
tests run there five and there were
three failures that's because I manually
gave wrong credentials over here so
these two are valid credentials and
these three are invalid so that is the
inference that we get from this
particular test okay so that is the demo
for my data-driven framework if you do
have any doubts please put them in
comment box and you can also look at the
description below because there's a link
to a blog where I explain the same
concept and if you want to pick up this
code you can pick up the code from that
particular blog of mine okay
so in the meanwhile let me just move on
to my next topic and my next topic is a
keyword driven framework we saw water
data-driven framework is and acumen
framework is slightly different in the
fact that you still have an excel file
but in the excel file you are not
feeling the data but you are feeling the
methods which need to be executed I
suppose let's say I have five different
methods in my test script okay and in
this test strip I don't want to execute
all five I can have a new excel and in
that excel I can say just the three
methods which I want to execute and when
I execute this test script then it would
only test those three methods which are
mentioned in this excel file okay so
that's how it works that's what a
keyboard events framework is it helps
you control the methods that you want to
execute in your test script again it's
very similar in the fashion that you
have an external file where it will be
stored and the excel file can be used or
you can have database or you can use an
XML file if you use one of these three
I have used an excel file for simplicity
and again the benefits and the features
are very similar if you want to contour
the number of methods you want to
execute you can easily do that by just
removing or adding those method names to
your excel file and this is how it looks
like so I have two columns one is
description and the other is keywords
and these actions keywords these are my
set of methods which I want to execute
now the same test that I performed some
time back right with radar even frame up
I'm gonna perform the same login test
so basically if I want to run a test
which is very similar to the test I
showed you some time back what are the
functionalities that I need to what test
right after first of all instantiate a
Chrome browser that's one functionality
I would have to write in my desk I would
have to specify the URL upon which I
want to perform the test after specified
the elements in my case it would be the
username field and the password field
and then I have to be able to click on
the login button I have to be able to
verify the login and then after close
the browser right so these are the
different functionalities I am going to
test and that's what I have done here so
instead of having one single test case
where I have written the entire code for
these things I have broken down that
into multiple methods okay and the
methods look like this and the methods I
can call from one more file over here so
I have the method names classified as
keywords here and these method names
have smaller functionalities for opening
or launch in my browser driver I have
the open browser method for navigating
to a particular web page I will have one
more method for the passing the user in
credentials there is one method and
similarly for each every functionality I
have a separate method and these methods
will be called from my main file from a
main class file okay and this is how it
looks like the method is the name of my
class where the functionality is present
okay
they have written the code to test it
and I'm basically calling these
functions with some parameters okay so
let me quickly go to my Eclipse and show
you a demonstration of this very same so
let me first close these two files which
I do not need these therefore determine
framework and now go to keyword driven
framework let me open up these three
files okay data script is going to be my
main file which will control the
execution but along with that I have a
methods class in which have specified
the different functionalities I am on a
test and I have a read axle data which
is again going to read my data from the
excel file which is the excel cells and
it would pass that back to my driver
script okay so this is my main file and
it's a very simple class that I have
created one variable and here of Ashdod
the path where my excel file is present
okay and my excel files data engine dot
xlsx let me just quickly open up that
file
this is my excel file like I told you
these are the methods which I want to
execute and this is just a small
description which is of course not
relevant or needed for my test it's just
for your understanding purpose I have
this said what each of these methods do
these will be the ones that will get
executed and the next thing I've done is
I have called the Reid Excel data class
ok so this is the Reid excel data class
and this has a couple of methods set
excel file is one method and get cell
data is one more method inside this
class ok and what I've done here is
while calling this class I've said
execute this set Excel method okay
calling this method with these
parameters s path and sheet 1 so sheet 1
is basically the name of my sheet number
ok and s path is the path so I'm setting
what I want to read ok when this is
basically executed then it would call
this method and this method will receive
the path of where my excel is present
and it would go to the sheet name so the
sheet name present over here is sheet 1
right so let me open up the excel and
show you that sheet 1 is the name so it
would straight away come to this
particular excel file and it would start
reading data or it will be ready to read
or write data in this particular excel
sheet ok and here again I've used
xsf workbook and axes of sheet right as
you can see here I have used them to
basically read my actual data so they
are the ones that contain the smaller
libraries which would do actions like
reading the cell and obtaining that cell
value on showing that cell in a
different variable ok
so I have created a separate static
objects for them and I am calling them
inside this particular excel file of
mine so how the logic works here is the
path and the sheet name comes in from
the calling method okay and when that
comes I am creating a new object called
excel file ok and the same file that is
mentioned over here that would be stored
in this object ok and in this excel file
I am using this as a base to create
another object which is Excel workbook
and here and thus saying I want to use
the access F book functionalities on
this particular excel file so that's why
I'm creating this particular of
okay so this acts as a class for this
particular object of mine and finally
updated one more object for which this
would act as the class okay so whatever
I'm saying here right there's Excel
workbook there's Excel W sweet so I'll
be using this excel abuse treat to write
the sheet name of this particular excel
file I'll be accessing this sheet name
in this excel workbook which is present
in this particular path so that is what
this piece of code does for me
okay this method which is setting the
excel file and getting my environment
ready for me that is about this method
so let me go back to the driver script
and continue with my explanation so
right after setting my your excel file I
am starting a for loop here and I'm
starting a for loop to basically read
all my excel columns contents so
whatever method I'll have specified in
my your column I want to read those
things right so for that I've created
off for loop and I have a hard coding
the value that run the for loop seven
times because if you look at my excel I
have seven entries you're correct
counter is seven so I've want around the
follow seven times but start the
execution from Row 1 because row zero is
not something I want to execute it's
just a head up so these are the ones
which I want to execute so this is row
number one so start executing from this
row understand I'm creating a new object
called s actions having get a type
spring and I'm again calling this same
read excel data file right this read
excel data class and from this class and
executing this method get cell data okay
and when I'm calling this get cell data
method I am passing the row number and
column number of the particular cell I
want to read so I want to read the cell
number which is executed as part of the
for loop so when the first time this for
loop is executed then I will be reading
row number one column number one okay
because row number is mentioned as one
over here that's where it starts of it
and the second time and this follow-up
is running I will be reading row number
two and column number one because if we
go back to my excel the call number is
the same and the row number is what
changes so 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7
that's how it goes okay and every time I
open this and every time I call this
particular method I am passing these
values right so this method would get
called and when this method is called
the same row number and column number is
received as parameters okay and these
are used to basically read the cell
contents but how am i doing it by
creating a new cell object and Here I am
saying the Excel worksheet choose this
worksheet and over here go to this
particular row because this worksheet
has this sheet name right so go to that
particular sheet name and sheet number
go to this particular row which is
nothing but row number 1 and go to this
column which is nothing but column
number 1 and once you're there have it
in the next line string cell data okay
so this is the next object which is of
type spring and here I'm saying cell dot
get string cell value so whatever value
is there in that part of yourself that
is obtained and stored in this
particular cell data object and then I'm
finally returning this cell data to the
calling object or the invoking method so
the method that is invoking this method
is this object right so that value would
come in here and every time the value is
returned here there's an if statement
which is executed okay and here we have
manually specified if the value that is
returned if it is equal to open browser
then execute the open browser method
which is present in the class called
methods so methods is this class of mind
so like I told you this is the place
where I define the web driver object
here so for open browser method I have
instantiated the browser driver okay and
this would be defined globally because
driver is again declared globally and
the next method over here is the
navigate so if I want to go to a
particular web page then I would say go
to this particular URL and that would be
inside this particular navigate method
and similarly I have another input
username method which is for passing the
user name field my credentials and
similarly for password field there is
one mode method and this is the
credentials which would be passed on and
then to click on the login button
there's another method click on ask or
login this would log in and click this
would basically login by clicking
finally it would verify if my login is
successful by analyzing the page title
so I'm saying get the page title and
store it in this particular variable
okay that is of type string and this is
evaluated with this find a flight Mach
unit tours because this is the page
title and this would be verified with
this and if it is matching then it
basically means that your test case pass
your login credentials is correct
otherwise it's invalid so that's the
logic here right that is what happens
your and then finally have one method
for closed browser which would just end
my browser instance so each of these are
separate methods and each of those
methods would be called via a for loop
over here so the first time the for loop
executes it would check if it is equal
to this open browser if it matches then
the open methods or open browser this
method would be executed and called and
the second time when the for loop is
being executed it would technically be
reading this cell right it would be
reading the Navigator cell and since
that is not equal to the open browser
the next if statement the else of
statement where I am saying if that
equals to navigate and if it's matching
with this navigate then it would execute
the next method and navigate inside this
class for methods okay so this class
contains all my methods like I told you
and this navigate method inside this
methods class would be executed and
similarly there is a for loop which
would execute each and every single
method which is present in the Etzel
file it would compare it with each of
these here and if there's a match then
that particular method will be executed
okay and then basically I'm just ending
this follow right over here only okay so
that's how this logic is that's how this
works
so let me quickly execute this driver
script file and then show you how this
demo works
so my chromedriver has opened up
so all my functionalities are being
tested right my driver open my username
credentials was passed
I've been logged in successfully and
then put up by now
retrieve the page title and it would
have analyzed so let me pull this up and
yes I've not got any error that means
that my test has successfully passed so
I do not have any test annotation here
to show you that if my test pass or if
my test failed correct so I did not have
that so that's why you don't see any
failure there so anyways that shows my
code is executed successfully and that's
how you perform keyword-driven testing
so guys I hope this was clear you people
and if you guys have any doubts then I
would request you to go back to the link
present in the description below to read
more about how this keyword run
framework works and also if you want to
get this code you can do so from the
same blog link and let me know in the
meanwhile go to the next slide and talk
about the next topic so the final topic
is a hybrid framework and the hybrid
framework is basically using a
combination of both the features of both
the data driven and keyword driven right
so let me quickly go to the
demonstration and show you how I'm going
to perform this hands-on so I have built
this hybrid driven framework in a way
which is very similar to the keyword
driven framework but I am passing the
method names by using the data driven
framework okay this might be a little
confusing to you so this listen again to
what I'm exactly saying what I'm exactly
doing is the same excel file that we saw
right the data engine excel file so we
have different methods so what I'm going
to do here is I am NOT going to write
if-else conditions every time to execute
each of these methods okay so on this
gonna write a for loop and I'm going to
use the data different frame of
technique to execute each of these
methods whenever there's a match so I
hope that made a little more sense to
you a combination of data-driven and
keyword-driven keyword driven because at
the end of the day my method names are
present in an external excel file and it
involves data-driven framework because
these method names are read from this
excel file by using the data driven
technique correct my excel file my class
file is reading this data with the aleph
data-driven framework
gays have not understood this then this
wait up till I bring up my Eclipse okay
over there I've experienced better but
before that I just want to tell you that
to achieve this I have used a Java
reflection class so a Java reflection
class is used to import your methods in
one class on to another class so I have
a class one which is my main class and
if I want to import the methods which
are there in class two onto my class one
then I can use the Java refraction class
alright and these are the two lines of
code which does it for me so actions is
the name of my class which contains the
list of methods right so it contains the
functionalities of different methods and
I'm importing these methods on to my new
object okay because I'm executing or
starting instance reading and object
instance of this particular class in my
second class okay so let me just open up
the Eclipse and explain this better so
this is my Eclipse just close all these
files here and this time let me open up
hybrid framework package and open the
three files your actions driver script
and read exit so very similar to keyword
driven framework we have JavaScript Java
file which is my main class which would
be doing all the functionalities okay my
actions is the one which is want to
contain all my methods again very
similar to my keyboard ribbon and the
read Excel will be the one which will be
reading the cell values from the excel
sheet the very minor difference that
this particular class file has when you
compare it to the keyword driven data
script file is that instead of me using
the if else to call the different
methods right I am using a for loop to
call those methods and since I am using
a for loop to access or get data from an
excel file the data double frame of
technique is implemented and/or since
the data which I am getting from the
excel file is the name of the method the
keyboard different framework is also if
you meant it okay so that's how things
work so I don't think I have to explain
new actions and rear-axle files again
okay because they are exactly the same
the only difference is over here and
what I've done here is
first of all use the Java reflection
class Azen so this actions which is
there or when you're right this class I
have created an object instance of this
particular actions class and this is
defined globally outside because it can
be used by even other methods in this
particular program so once I have
created an object of this particular
class I'm using the method variable or
the method object to get the class and
the methods which are there in this
particular action keywords okay so the
action keywords are refers to my action
class and in this action class whatever
methods are there that would be obtained
so get class dot get methods this is the
key term which is used for that purpose
okay and by now all the different
methods would be stored in this
particular method as added so if I go
back to actions you can see that the
different methods I have yours close
browser verify login click login input
password input username
I have navigate and open browser right
so all these methods would be stored in
this particular method object this Eric
and what I've done next is a sort of for
loop and this for loop would run as many
times as the number of methods are all
there in this particular object what is
the length let's say if there are seven
methods over here which are imported to
this particular object then the method
length would be seven right so this
follow foreign seven times basically the
number of methods that were imported
method dot length is a function for that
and it would start from zero and would
execute that will be number of times and
it would keep running and every time the
for loop runs it does one simple thing
and every time it would basically obtain
the method name and if it equals
whatever stored in s actions that would
be executed but if I have to explain
this let me first complete this part and
in this main function what I have is I
have first created a variable and here
the path of Maxell file would be present
this you of course not and of course the
sheet name is also a present and then
there's a for loop that gets executed
right and this for loop it would be
executed number of times
there is a row so for the number of rows
that are there laughter a number of
times the follow would be executed and
every time it gets executed it does one
simple thing okay
it reads the value by using the get cell
data method okay
inside the read Excel class get cell
data method is there here it would pass
the values the row number and column
values and it would read the cell value
and shorten s actions okay and after
storing it and s actions it would
execute this actions method so that's
when basically this method will be
executed okay so I explained this part
and getting back to what happens inside
the for loop and for every single method
that is present right so it would first
get the name of the method so from
method number zero it's gonna get the
name of the method and it's gonna check
if it is equal to what is there in
actions so in s actions the first time
the value that would be stored is open
browser okay and over here when we say
if method ID or get name then method
number zero would be compared with this
s actions so the first time I managed
compiling method number zero will be
open browser itself because if we go to
actions the first method is open browser
right so that would be compared over
your and if it is equal then this line
would be executed and the line here is
method i dot invoke actions keywords so
this basically means if it's a match
with respect to what is there in the
excel file then execute that particular
method it will execute that same action
keywords right and moment it's executed
it would break the functionality and
since there is no else part this if
method will be executed once again so
the next time this for loop gets
executed and then when this is called
write xq dashing is called that time
what happens is it would be basically
checking for navigate method so that i'm
for method number zero it will not match
s actions variable because the first
time is actions will not contain that so
for method 0 s actions will not match
because s actions contains navigate
right so that is what is obtained from
the excel file and navigate would be
present the second time this if method
execute and when it executes the
basically this method would be in the
and it would be executed right so just
like that every single time if loop runs
a particular method would be executed
and every time a method is executed the
functionality of the web application is
tested okay so I have the different
methods over here which would be
involved in this for loop or these very
same and these would be executed so let
me just run the sample program for you
and show you how this works so again
it's gonna be very similar my
chromedriver hasn't sent Shadid have
logged in
and once my login is verified my Chrome
browser suppose to close and that's what
has happened so let me just pull up the
results and show you what has happened
and yeah there are no errors which means
that my test is a success okay so that
is what I wanted to show you and that is
what I want tell you basically so that
is how I have built a hybrid driven
framework okay so if you guys again have
any doubts I would request you to please
go to the link present in the
description below that is the blog I've
written on the same their drivers so
that is the same blog I've written on
these frameworks and you can access this
same code from that particular web page
okay so yeah perfect so that brings an
