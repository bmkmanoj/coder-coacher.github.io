Rica and in today's session will be
learning Python programming language
thank you all the attendees for joining
today's session if we all can hear me
properly kindly drop me a quick
confirmation on the chat window so that
I can proceed
okay so Monica says yes
geography says yes so the Sarah and
David okay thank you guys so let us
start by looking at the agenda today at
first we'll see what our scripting
languages because python is widely used
as the scripting languages more than a
programming language so let us
understand that also first then we'll
take a brief overview of Python after
that I'll tell you how to install Python
in your system and also an IDE for
Python which is known as the PI charm
I'll also tell you how to install that
and after that this is the most
important part that we are going to
focus on today which is the Python
fundamentals and in the end we'll see
the opportunities that you can grab on
after learning Python we'll take a look
at the Python job trends for that so are
you all clear with the agenda for this
aisle she says yes and I've got a
confirmation from the others as well so
let's begin so let us first take a look
at what our scripting languages well
scripting languages are something that
supports script well this is a free
straightforward definition but in order
to understand scripting languages we
should first understand the difference
between a script and a program well a
program is just a bunch of statements to
execute a particular task it is a block
of statements together and scripts are
also used for the same purpose it's only
that you do not need any human operator
to run it if you want to automate
something you can use the script let me
show you with an example so here we have
got three programs and I want to run all
these programs one by one I want to run
program one first and after the
execution of program one then two and
finally three now if I don't have a
script and if I'm not working with a
script
language and if I want to do this task
what I'll do is that I need a human
operator for that this person will first
execute program one and after his
finished program one then he'll execute
program two and program three but when I
have caught scripts the benefit is that
I do not need a human operator I'll just
write down the executional statement of
program one two and three something like
run program one run program to run
program three according to the order
that I want to run them I'll just
mention that in a script and then I only
need to just run that script and after
that the script will take care of the
order the execution of the task so I'll
run that script and it will execute
program one first two and then three so
the benefit of using scripts is that you
do not need any human interference you
do not need to engage a person to do
this kind of things so you can just use
it for any automation purpose to
automate any of your tasks you can use
scripts for that and Python is actually
widely used as a scripting languages
well there are other scripting languages
as well you can see it right here it's
got pearls TCL but Python is the one
that has outshined amongst all the
spheres and it is the most popular
scripting language by now okay so Monica
has a question she is asking will we be
learning how to write scripts in Python
today well not not in this session
Monica because the name of this session
is Python programming language so we're
just going to focus on programming here
but scripting is also very similar
because scripting is just a subset of
the programming Python programming
language so if you learn programming
first and then move on to scripting so
if you just learn programming first then
you move on to Python scripting it will
be much easier for you so I hope that
you'll still be joining with us even
though we're not learning scripting so
Monique are you okay with that okay so
Monica says yes and another thing about
a python is that it is interpreted
rather than compiled it means that it
uses an interpreter that is used to
check the line
just cold one-by-one line by line not as
a whole like a compiler so any questions
on that
okay so no question so we'll move on and
now you are Python so python is a
high-level dynamic programming language
it's dynamic in nature so it can accept
user inputs during the runtime work on
that and give you an output first
dynamic and Python supports multiple
programming paradigms including
object-oriented it has got all the
object-oriented programming features
starting from classes and objects data
encapsulation a data abstraction then
inheritance and all of the features you
name it Python has got all the features
and it's also imperative in nature
imperative program is something that
uses to recommend something like a shell
program where you write just direct
amounts that can change the state of
your program or to change the state of
your system just write a simple one-line
command do something so that is a parity
program because in Python scripts you
use something like that you use your
read commands also and that's why it is
also imperative in nature and it also
supports functional programming and
procedural styles functional programming
something like where it works with
different functions to perform where it
works with different functions to
execute a particular task and procedural
style something like the language see
where it focuses on flow of the program
about how the program the kind of
procedure it is adopting to carry out
that task so Python has got all the
features of all these kind of
programming languages and chocolaty has
a question so she is asking that what is
the difference between oops and
procedure so procedural is the C
language that you might have heard and
C++ is object-oriented programming
language the only difference is that C++
which is an object-oriented program it
has got the feature of classes and
objects and other features that I was
talking about which is the data
abstraction and capsulation
and various others so the main
difference is that in object-oriented
programming every
entity is represented as an object with
object-oriented programming you can
actually model the real-world problems
because when you define objects every
object has a behavior a certain kind of
which you can define it by function so
that is the main difference between
object-oriented and procedural files in
procedural style you just work with a
simple variable and simple functions and
use flow control statements but in
object-oriented you work with the
objects you define a class first create
an object and we're going to do this in
this tutorial as well where I'll show
you how to create Python objects and
classes so you'll understand that but
you can say that a procedural is like a
subset of an object-oriented programming
language it's just a modification or a
new let's say a version that has got
added features so that is
object-oriented and procedural is the
older version so you can say that so
geography are you satisfied with the
answer okay so she says yes it is very
easy to learn I'm very sure that at the
end of this tutorial you'll all agree
with me that it is very easy to learn
because it's very simple and if you are
already familiar with other programming
language like C or C++ Java any of it
this is just going to be a piece of cake
for you and even though you have not
worked with any other programming
language and Python is your first one it
is still going to be easy for you do not
worry about that so it is easy to learn
and provides dynamic typing so by
dynamic typing it means that it is all
about when type information is acquired
during the compile time or the runtime
it means that the values of the
variables are checked during the
execution and it is used by vast
multitude of companies around the globe
and like you can see these are the
companies and there are others as well
they're using pythons the Dropbox NASA
Yahoo IBM Google Mozilla YouTube
Facebook everyone is using Python now
okay so Dave is asking can you tell me
some common applications of Python of
course sure I'll tell you
like Google is using Python for
extensive web searching and NASA is
using it for some kind of scientific
programming task so the applications are
different but most widely Python is used
to write scripts to automate your
infrastructure and it is also very
widely used for web development and be
like Google is using that and you can
use Python programming as well to
develop some kind of applications and
data analysis it can actually do a lot
of things and you can actually
incorporate Python with everything can
use it for testing as well you can use
it with tools like selenium it can get
incorporated with that also so it has a
very wide usage
okay so David says cool okay thank you
David for asking that question
so any more questions on this ok no
questions so now let us see the
simplicity of Python
first it's a very highly readable
language now it's very simple this is
pretty much something that you write the
logic that you just scratch down in your
notebook it's very similar to that it is
not very hard to understand it it's like
English and like very common shorthand
pseudocode kind of thing so you don't
have to put much effort in writing the
code as well so it is not just because
of the oops concept because C++ is also
an object-oriented programming language
but it is less readable than Python
Python is more highly readable but yeah
I would agree with you in the point that
since it is using classes and objects
and we are modeling the real world
problems with entities in here which are
called objects so it is making my
program more readable and more
manageable in a way you can say that so
I have you got your answer okay so she
says yes so and then again it has a very
clean visual layout and less than tactic
exceptions so unlike other programming
language like C or C++ where you have to
put a semicolon after each of the
statements and you have to worry about
the starting parenthesis and the ending
parenthesis and the syntax because even
like it is very taste n sitive with
single cab ation double quotations you
don't have to worry about that in Python
it is very simple the syntax is the
easiest syntax that I've ever seen in
any kind of programming language so you
don't have to remember a lot of things
you can just start coding it has very
less impacting exceptions and then it
has superior string manipulation you can
actually do a lot of things with the
strings you can play around with strings
in a lot of ways so I'll be showing you
that as well later in this tutorial and
it provides you with elegant and dynamic
typing so I already told you what that
is and it just interpreted in nature
like I told you it it uses an
interpreter instead of a compiler
because since
python is widely used for scripting it
is more advisable to use an interpreter
when you're using it for scripting
rather than a compiler and it is ideal
for script
doing a rapid application and it fit for
many platforms like I was telling you
Python is used as a scripting language
it is used as a programming language it
is used for testing and it is compatible
with a lot of tools that we use nowadays
so this is how simple python is and this
are all the features and add-ons that
you can get when you're using Python so
any questions on this
how can a questions so now let me tell
you how to install Python so if you want
install the latest version of Python
which is the three point 6.0 or even if
you want to install the older version
just go to this website which is wwii o
RG / download let me just take you there
assure you okay so this is the website
if you want to download you can see that
you can download the two versions this
is the older version people are still
using it but if you have started using
Python just now I would recommend that
you download the latest version there
are a few differences between the two
versions regarding some kind of syntax
but they're not very different you can
download any of this but I would
recommend that you download the latest
version so just go to this download tab
here and if you have a Windows platform
if you have a Mac or any other platform
just choose it from here now I have a
Windows so I'll just click on this and
this will download executable file for
you just run that so now I've already
downloaded Python in my system so I'm
not going to go ahead and reinstall it
I'm sure that you guys are pretty smart
enough you can do it yourself so I'm
just showing you the source from where
you can download let me tell you how to
install pycharm
ide so just go to this website over here
which is the jet prints comm flash
pycharm flash download just click on
there and you'll find this page
something like this and you just
download the community version because
you'll be working on that and five charm
is the most popular ID that is used for
in Python that is used for Python
programming so we'll be using that you
can use any other ideas that you like
but today we'll be working on Python
so if you want you can download that I
think there aren't going to be any
questions so I'm just going to move
forward so now this is the part that you
should be very attentive because we're
going to learn the most important things
the building blocks of Python which is
the Python fundamentals and be following
five fundamentals are the ones that you
need to know in and out if you want to
master Python that first we'll take a
look at the datatypes what kind of data
types python has it has got numbers
strings lists up close dictionaries
we'll take a look at all of them then
we'll take that how to define the flow
control advice on how to use different
loops and statements statements like if
else and then loops like for while and
then some kind of other statements like
continue break we'll learn all of that
then we'll learn how to write functions
in Python how to define a function I'll
call a function what is a dark string in
a function how to return values from a
function will also learn file handling
how to read a file right into it modify
it and finally this is the most
important thing which is we'll learn how
to create a class in Python and how to
create its objects and then use those
objects to actually represent real life
problems so these are the five
fundamental things that we're going to
learn today ok so Monica has a question
she is asking that why are we installing
the pycharm IDE
because Monica with pycharm it makes my
code more manageable because if I'm
writing a multiple code project the
pycharm ID will help me link those files
together and even though I'm actually
Python comes with its own default ID but
if you are writing multi code project if
you're working on a multi code project I
would actually recommend you to use a
pycharm ID and that is because it'll
make your code and make your project a
little bit more manager
than the default Python ID so that's why
you're using firearm for our own benefit
for our own ease of coding so Monica
have you got your answer okay so she
says yes
so let's move on and understand all of
this one by one but before that let us
first understand the characteristics of
the data types in Python so these are
the characteristics and the first one is
that you do not need to declare a
variable if you want to use it unlike in
other programming language like C C++
Java
you always have to declare a variable
first if you want to use it later in the
program in Python you do not have to
worry about that at all you can just
choose any kind of variable and start
using it at any point of the program and
after that it has got certain attributes
to define it and there are two kinds of
attributes the first one is mutable and
the other one is immutable so the
mutable are the ones that can be altered
and immutable are the ones that cannot
be altered and an example or immutable
attribute the data type that contains
mutable attribute is list and the data
type that contain the immutable
attribute are tuples and we're going to
learn about lists and tuples so don't
get nervous
if you are not understanding what a list
and tuples that I'm talking about
they'll understand that how attributes
define them and how they can change it
okay so after that and optech type also
better Minds the operation that it
supports for example if you're working
with numbers and let's say that you want
to use the plus operation what it will
do is that it will just sum up or just
add up those two numbers but if you're
dealing with strings and you want to
perform the same plus operation it will
not some of the strings it will just
concatenate the strings so you can say
that the data types also differentiate
on the same operations it will determine
that what a particular operation would
do to a certain kind of data type and
okay so David is asking is this operator
overloading yes you can actually think
of as an implicit operator overloading
that is happening in Python so okay
David so and after that pythons as I was
telling you Python actually supports all
object-oriented programming features
generally
everything advised on every entity in
Python is actually depicted as an object
so these are the characteristics of all
the data types that we'll be learning
now so any questions on this or going to
a question so let us take a look at the
data types in Python and the first one
is the boolean now you all know that
boolean are the data tiles that store
values in terms of true or false and it
is same in Python the boolean stores
values in terms of either true or false
like you have an example here if the
number is divisible by 2 it is true else
it's false so it's like that and then
numbers now Python supports and
primitive data guys like integers floats
and even fractions and complex number as
well like you can see here a equals 2 5
is an integer data type B is 7 point 3
which is float and sees 2 plus 3 J which
is a complex number so Python also
supports that and after that we have
caught strings and strings are nothing
but these are a sequence of characters
now in order to write a string or define
a string you can use either single
quotes or double quotes you can use any
of that it is the same in Python and
after that we have got bytes and byte
array and these are nothing but these
are just one byte of characters and byte
added is added of one byte of multiple
characters so this is bites and byte
edit so Python also supports that so let
me just show you of very few examples of
all this how I can work with strings and
numbers and boolean let me just go to
pycharm and show it to you one by one
okay so this is my PI chomp so if you
want to start a project just click on
new project here just create this
project and open current window ok so
this is your project so just right click
here and let's create a new Python file
so since I'm going to show you data type
so I'm just going to name it data type
click on OK and this is my python file
which is data type dot py
and ey is the extension of a Python file
so let me just show you boolean first
how you can work with boolean and by the
way this is the way to write comments in
Python if you want to write a single
line comment you can use the hash for
that and if you want to write multi-line
comment just use three single quotations
and you can write any kind of comments
like this multi-line comments so just
end start with three quotation single
quotes and end it with three single
quotes so let me just start with that so
so let's say that I have not explained
you about lists yet so don't worry I'm
just using it to explain you Julianne's
how it stores true or false values tell
you how to write lists and how to do
things with lists so don't worry about
that yet so it is just a list of values
okay for now so let's say that it
contains by it's a list of five numbers
like 1 2 3 4 5 ok then I'm taking
another variable let's say Y and I'll
just write a kind of condition here
let's say 3 in num and now I'll just
print Y so if you run this you will see
that since 3 is in the list so it is
showing true so like boolean only
returns value in terms of 2 and false so
that is why it is showing true and if it
was false let's say 6 and if you run it
you see it will return false so these
are boolean in Python now let me just
assure you numbers no ok so in numbers
you can do all kind of operations that
you do like add subtract multiply divide
you can do all of that and these are the
same operators for adding you just use
the plus Band for subtracting minus for
multiplication you use the asterisk and
for division you use the slash but since
you already know that but there are
a few more operators that you can use
you can use the power operator or the
operator that divides a number and just
takes the whole number questions so I'll
just show that you are already familiar
with addition subtraction and all of
those so let me just show you the ones
that bias on supports that is a little
bit different from other programming
languages now let's say that I want to
find the value of five cube so for that
so I'll just use this operator over here
which is the double Asterix and if I
want to use one to print 5 cube I'll use
it like that
and there is one more operator that you
can use in Python and that is the one
that gives you a whole question so let
me just show you to you so 32 divided by
3 okay but before that let me just
comment this okay so now if you would
run it you can see that 5 cubed is 125
and and 32 divided by 3 is something
like ten point six or something but it
will only return the whole number orphan
which is ten so these are the operators
that you can also use in Python apart
from the other operators and after that
let me show you strength and for that
I'll just create a new python file
so let's say that I have got a string
which is string 1 and I'm just writing
welcome and then I've got another string
and I'm just writing to Ed Eureka now
since I was telling you about adding
strings let us add these two strings so
we'll add these two strings and store it
and string 3 and we'll just go ahead and
print string 3 so just run it and you
can see that it has concatenating it so
the plus operator here is used for
concatenating those two strings and this
is the whole string that string 3
contains is welcome to Eddie rig and you
can actually do a lot of things with
that let's say that I just want to print
the first four letters in this string
which is welc and if you want to do that
you have to know the index and like any
other array or any of the strings in
other programming language it also
starts with an index 0 so W is at index
0 is at 1 l at 2 and C at 3 so I want to
print it until index 3 so if I want to
do that I just have to mention the range
I want to print it from the index 0 to
index 3 right but in Python you have to
write a number just bigger than the
index that you want to print and this is
a little bit like thing that is off
about Python it is a little bit strange
but I'm very sure that if you start like
working with Python and if you're using
Python very frequently this won't be a
problem for you to remember this now I'm
writing for year I want to print it till
index 3 and I will be mentioning 4 here
because the last index that you mention
here will not be printed so just keep in
mind when you are trying to print and
working with indexes ok so now if you
run it you can see that it has printed
the first four characters up till index
3 and
do some more things with that let's say
that okay let me just show you this
let's say that I just want to print the
last five characters okay so I'll just
keep it like that
and if I run it you can see it has
printed the last five characters and
similarly let's say that I want to print
the whole string except for the last
five characters I want to print del
welcome to it I want to just not include
the last five characters yudhiqa so if
you want to do that it's very similar to
that so just write minus five at the
right hand side of the colon so now if
you run it so you can see that last five
characters are not included here so
these are just a few things that you can
do with strings and you can do a lot
other things as well you can if you want
to run loops with strings you can do
that as well but we'll learn loops first
and then I'll show you so any questions
guys okay no questions okay so let's go
ahead and take a look at the other data
types so now we have got lists now lists
are just a list of values and it is a
very simple and a list is defined with
the square bracket and it can store any
kind of values in teacher float strings
it can be a list of any values and
tuples are also very similar to lists
the only difference is that once you
have defined a tuple you cannot change
it okay so Monika is asking can we store
different data types in one list yes of
course we can store any kind of data
type in one list you can see the example
here it is storing I integer like these
are numbers here to point to is a float
and Python is a string so we can store
different kind of data types in one list
so you've got your answer Monica okay
Monica says yes and tuples are also same
as lists and is defined by parentheses
and it can store any kind of data type
values only it cannot be changed once
you have defined at upper and after that
we have got sets and you can say that
sets and lists are saying they can be
actually changed but the only difference
between sets and lists is that obviously
when you define a set you actually
define it with a curly braces and unless
you do it with square brackets so this
is one difference and the other
difference is that in set you only have
got unique values so if you see here
we've got the days of the week Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday Sunday so we actually cannot
have multiple Mondays in a set whereas
in length we can have multiple number of
ones that we can even have three Python
strings over here but instead we have
got only unique values okay so geography
is asking sets are mutable
yes Jagr with these sets are mutable a
list and set they are mutable and tuples
are immutable so generally have you got
your answer okay so she says yes and
another data type are the dictionaries
now dictionaries are also mutable data
types and it is also defined by curly
brackets so the dictionaries have got a
key and a value to it and it is
represented with a colon in the middle
so in the left-hand side we have got the
key and in the right hand side we write
the value that maps to it and all of
these the lists tuples
sets and dictionaries every entity is
separated by a comma so let me just show
all of this to you one by one I'm going
to let me create another Python file and
I'll just say other data types okay so
I'll just call it other data type so let
me show you what our list first okay so
let me just say that I have a list
called night
now as I was telling you everything is a
list is represented by square brackets
so I'll write the list I'll mention all
the items in my list inside my square
brackets and let's say I've got strings
the name of the night let's say I've got
Sir Jamie and then I'm separating by
comma and let's say that I have got Sir
Barristan and let's say that I've got
another one sir Roderick so these are
the items in my list so if you want to
find the length of your list you can use
a function R if you want to print the
length of your list you can use a
function or a method which is known as
the length so let me just show it to you
you just use Len and the name of your
string which is nice so if you run it
you can see that I've got three items
and so that's why showing three now
let's say that you want to add more
items in your list since lists are
mutable you can alter them you can add
more you can delete from it so let's say
that I want to add and something else
some other names in my list so in order
to do that I will use a method which is
known as append and let's say that I
want to add Lady Brienne so now if you
run it and now let me just print my list
which is nice so now if you run it you
can see that it is printing my list and
Lady Brienne has been offended now the
append function what is does is that it
offended whatever you add here it will
just include it at the end of the list
it will just append it into the list now
let's say that you want to ask something
at a particular index let's say that I
want to include something after surging
I want to include some other name after
Sir Jaime okay so for that I'll use a
different method and that method is
called the insert method and here you
have two men
the index first so if I want to include
something up to sir Jamie that will be
in index one so one then comma and
whatever you want to mention let's see
under that Sir Patrick pain so now let
me just write the print so now if you
just run it you can see that sir Podrick
Payne has been added to the first index
over here after sergej me so this is how
you can add things in your list okay and
there are other functions as well you
can reverse your list you can sort your
list in different ways so there are
methods that you can read about and
Python so I'm just showing you a few
about inserting and so I'm just showing
you a few about inserting items into a
list so any questions on that okay no
questions okay now let me show you
tuples sorry so let's say that I have
got a couple called houses now since I
told you that at Apple starts with a
parenthesis so again I have let me
insert some items over here
God how start then house Tyrell and
Lannister so this is my topic now I have
defined my tuples first and now it is
immutable it means that I cannot make
changes to it so you cannot actually
append or add anything on to the list is
you just okay now even if you try to
actually append let's say the same using
the same function and let's say that I
want to add one more item into it and if
you try to run it you'll see that it is
showing an attribute error the double
objects has no attribute append because
it is immutable and that's why you
cannot make
so that how do I actually do it how do I
make change the setup would actually
wonder that tuples are of no use you can
actually consider tuples as a constant
but you can also actually change the
values in it let me show you how so
we've got houses as my tuple so what I
will do is that I will take a variable
called house 1 and I will just convert
it into a list and since I can make any
changes in list and what this will do is
that it will just take all the items in
houses in the couple houses and it will
make a list which is known as the house
1 and since now house 1 is a list that
contains all the items in the tupple
houses you can actually make changes in
house 1 because it's a list right so
let's add house Bolton in the list so
now I can use append and I'm pending say
folder now it will append Bolton at the
end of this list and if you want to
convert it into a tuple again we'll use
the same method so again as you use
houses and I'll mention the name of my
list and then let me just print it so if
we run it now yeah sorry I forgot to
comment this yeah because obviously this
won't work right and since it's an
interpreter you can actually see that it
has encountered the first error and an
interpreter actually stopped after
encountering the first error it won't
check the other lines even though they
are correct so that's why you should be
very careful with an interpreter so make
sure that you've cleared out all the
errors that is at the beginning or at
the end so that's why it was showing
errors and now let me actually run it
and so you can see that now it has been
modified and how
Boulton has been added so this is how
you can actually change topples so any
questions on tuples or lists or anything
okay so no question so thank you guys so
let me just create a new Python file
again and let me now show you
dictionaries and since I was telling you
like dictionaries are mapping so it will
have keys and values so let me say okay
so let's say that I have got a
dictionary called Westeros okay and as
you know that a dictionary actually is
represented by a curly braces so now we
just have to write some keys and map
values to it so let's say that I have
got my first key and the name of a
person Thursday and after : you just
write the value it maps to let's say it
maps to lannister and then let me just
similarly add more items
okay so these are the keys
Cersei Daenerys and Sons are my keys and
the values that in maps through
respectively our Lannister Targaryen and
Stark okay so now let us say that you
want to change a certain value of a
particular key in a dictionary so so if
you want to do that you just have to
write the name of your dictionary and
the key and then the name of the key
which in my case is Daenerys and then
you just write the name of the changed
value so let's say that now it's
Dothraki and let me just now print it
so if you run it and you see that now it
has changed the value mapping to the key
Daenerys has been changed so this is how
you can modify your dictionary and again
let's say that you just want to view the
values or just the keys let me just show
you how to just print just the keys in
the dictionary to identify it so these
are the methods which are known as the
keys and values in order to just list
out the keys and values so you can see
that the keys are Cersei Daenerys answer
and the values or Lannister Dothraki
start okay so geography is asking what
happens if I print the key it's just for
your purpose you know if you're working
with Python and let's say that you're
managing index okay so and if you want
to see just the names first of that
particular index or something this is
actually a useful when you're dealing
with a huge amount of items in a
particular Edition er when you're
mapping a lot of things together it can
be useful for you sometimes in this case
we do not need it obviously but I'm just
showing it to you
okay so jaga T is asking something she's
asking what happens if I write a print
of Westeros and then sir see what it
will print okay since you asked let us
see what it'll print let me just show it
to you okay sure you write in quotations
is that what you are asking geography oh
yeah yes okay so let us just run it yeah
so when you do that you get the values
map to it okay so yeah Charlie I'm very
glad to see that you are actually
getting curious and you are actually
wanting to know so what happens when we
do this or that's after installing a
pycharm in your system please go ahead
and try experimenting with lists and
dictionaries tuples whatever you want to
do and you'll get your answers yourself
so I'm just showing you the basic
methods and the basic operations that
you can do but you can do a lot more
other things as well so just keep that
curiosity up and start playing with them
and you'll get all your answers and I'm
pretty sure that you're going to have
fun playing around with dictionaries
lists and tuples
so the geography is there anything else
that you want me to do or you want to
ask okay so thank you jaga see
so yeah ants inside and show you how to
delete things or how to delete items
I'll also show you that as well now if
you want to delete some item just use
this keyword which is called de L del
okay and the name of my dictionary which
is Westeros and in square brackets just
write the key that just the key okay so
let me say that I want to delete some
sake so let's say I will delete salsa so
I'll do that and then I'll just go ahead
and print this and let's see that
whether it has to delete it or not you
can see that Santa is deleted so we have
just got two items in my dictionary 30
and danerys so this is how you can also
delete things from your dictionaries so
any questions on that okay no questions
thank you guys so we'll just go on with
the next topic now
so now let us understand the flow
control how to define so control in
Python so a flow control is the order in
which a program code executes so if you
see the diagram right here this is the
start and you can see this diamond shape
box and this is where it actually checks
for a condition so let's say that if the
condition is true it will execute this
particular task and then finally go to
task 4 and if it is false it will just
go to task two first then execute ops 3
and task 4 so basically it's starting
from the same position and ending at the
same position but the path that it
follows could be different so this is
how you define the flow control you
define that how your program should move
the head according to a particular
condition and if you want to model
real-life problems you have to use these
kind of conditions and the types of flow
control are if you use those if
statements we'll see how to use them
then you can use loops like for or while
you can use other statements like break
continued paths so we'll be taking a
look at all of this one by one so is
there any questions that you want to ask
me about what is so control and any kind
of queries that you might have
okay no questions so let us move ahead
and let us see the if statement first
now this if statement is also very
similar to other programming language
where you use if so there are three
kinds of if statements the first one is
the simplest you only write if the
expression or the condition and the
statement that it should execute if the
condition is true and there is another
one called
if and else that if you extension a
condition and if it's true it will
execute the block of statements after
that and if it's false it will execute a
default statements after else and there
is another one which is if-elsif-else
that is very common in other language
and in Python it's called as the if LS
LS else okay so you can actually check
multiple conditions or multiple
expressions together with if Elif and at
the end you just mentioned a default
statement if none of the conditions are
true if you just execute this it will
just execute this statement that is
after else which is the default
statement now if you also see this a
flow control you will understand it
again so this is the test expression so
if it was false it will just execute the
statement that is below if that means
this will not get executed any other
statement that is after that so in this
case this is the else one and if it's
true it will execute the body of F and
then we'll move out and execute the
statement below so this is how you
define flow control with if so let me
just show you a few examples
okay so again I'm creating a new Python
file just simply name it if so let's say
that I have got a variable X equal to 20
now if I'm just using the simple if
statement and I'm just going to check if
X is greater than 28 and after writing
that you just mention a colon and then
you just write any statement that you
want to let's say that I want to print
like
so on a friend it is greater than 28
okay so make sure that you take extra
care of the indentations because we are
not using parentheses in order to
understand that what is the block of
statements after if so if you mess up
with the indentations it is going to be
a problem for you because if you write
the print over here like this it will
not be treated as a statement that is
under if this will be a completely
independent statement that will get
executed after if anyhow this won't be
inside the body of its now make sure
that you take extra care in the
indentation okay this is a simple if
statement and if you want to include an
else which is the default statement so
just write anything so now if you run it
so it will print this statement because
this condition is clearly false because
X is equal to 20 so this is how you
check is else now if you want to check
multiple conditions so you can use the
LS so let's say that you want to check
if X is greater than 10 and X is less
than say 15 you want to print something
here or make sure
they don't mr. : after every condition
that you write okay I'll let us include
some more conditions so I'm just writing
like simple print values like that so
this is a block of statements so these
are a few conditions that I have
mentioned so now if you just run it so
you can see that so you can see that it
is printing it is smaller than 28
because it is not satisfying any of
these X's definitely greater than 15 but
it is not less than 20 so none of these
conditions are getting satisfied so
that's why this printing this last
default statement so but okay so let me
just change the value so that it
satisfied one of the conditions so now
if you just run it so you can see that
it lies between 10 to 50 so this
condition gets satisfied and that's what
this print statement is getting executed
okay so this is how you use if/elif/else
statements or any questions on that okay
no question so we'll move on okay so now
let us understand our real-life use it
or just try to model a real-life problem
with the if statement okay so let me
give you an example of Facebook about
how you actually log into Facebook okay
so it'll ask for your email or phone on
it laughs for your password right so it
will check if your password is correct
or not and if your password is wrong it
will show you something like this kind
of page where they'll ask you if you
forgot your password or something like
that and if your password is correct so
it will just log you in right so this is
a real-life usage of if statement so
this is just a real-life representation
of
if statement so moving ahead now let us
understand loop so let me first tell you
about the for loop so now let us take a
look at the for statement so this for
statement will help you in looping so
loops are nothing but a repeated
execution of a block of statements or a
single statement you can say and it is
advisable to use a for statement or a
for loop when you know the number of
iterations that it should perform
beforehand okay so you use a for
statement when you know the range of the
iterations so use the for statement when
you know the range of the iterations
that you want to perform beforehand so
let me just explain you this flowchart
over here so this is the start and this
is the expression initialization because
you will have a control variable a
variable that will change its values
throughout in the loop okay so this is
where the condition will be tested if
the condition is true only then the loop
body will be executed and if the
condition is false it will just execute
the loop and after executing the loop
body the expression would be updated and
the condition would be tested again and
as long as the condition is true the
loop will keep getting executed and once
it is false it will just move out of the
loop so this is the for loop okay let me
now just give you realize for loop
representation so again we're using the
example of Facebook and this is the
Facebook profile of my very good friend
Sandeep so this is some deeps profile
and he has got quite a lot of friends he
has got 962 friends and now he wants to
list out the names of all his friends so
now I know beforehand that he has got
962 friends so I need to run this loop
960 two times right and so that is why I
will use a for loop in this case
so for friendless not equal to null it
means that until there are names inside
his friend leaves until it's not null it
will keep executing so it will generate
the HTML for friendly so it will keep
listing out all his friend
until all his 962 friends are lifted out
so this is our real-life representation
of the for you so let me just show you
and PyCharm how the syntax of for loop
and how you can use for loop in Python
so I'm going to create a new python file
so I'm just going to name it for loop so
let's say that I want to print out all
the numbers starting from 0 to 10 okay
so let me just use variables then we
just initialize it with zero first and
then let me use the for loop okay so I'm
using the for then I have to mention the
range I want to print it from 0 to 10 so
I have to write 11 as my hired range
because it won't print it and after that
I'm just printing X so now if we just
run it you can see that it has printed
from 0 to 10 all the numbers so this is
how you use for loop when you know the
range okay so you can also use it with
lists also if you want to print from any
kind of list if let's say you have
mentioned a list of values here instead
of a range okay so let's say that you
have got a list so let me just mention a
list of any random numbers so now if you
would just run this so it will just
print out all the items in the list so
you can use a for loop for that also it
is just exactly the real-life
representation of Facebook friends that
I just showed you it has already got a
list and it will just print out that so
for that you can use the for loop like
this okay so any doubt okay no doubt
so let us move on now and let us take a
look at the wild statement now out with
a wild statement you can also use loops
like four and A one statement is
basically used when you do not know the
number of iterations beforehand
you only have a condition and it don't
know that how many iterations it will
take until the condition is going to be
true so in that case you use a wild
statement instead of a four statement
okay so this is the difference between
wild and a four loop if you just read it
out you can see that four loop is used
when we know the number of iterations
beforehand and a while loop is used when
we know the range of values but we do
not know the exact number of iterations
so this is when you should use four and
this is when you should use while okay
okay so Monica is asking can it give me
an example of course I'm Monica I'll
give you an example for that
so I'll just first explain you the
flowchart here and then I'll show you an
example so I've already shown you an
example for for loop where you know the
number of iterations like I was printing
from zero to ten and I was listing out
the numbers in list so I already know
the number of iterations and now I'll
also give you an example of wild
statement so just have patience for just
a few minutes okay Monica so this is the
flowchart of a wild statement so similar
to a for statement the test expression
is validated first and if it's true the
body of while loop will get executed and
after that let's check the test
expression again and if it's false it
will come out of the loop and executes
the statements that is after the while
loop and the loop will keep continuing
until the expect expression is true so
this is a very similar to the for one as
well so now let me give you an example
or Monica so again with the same
Facebook example that we're going on so
now somebody wants to view all the
stories till the end of the page now
here in this condition we do not know
when the end of the page will come in we
do not know how many stories are we
going to view okay so before that in for
loop we knew that how many friends we
have to list out because we can see the
number
of friends in the list already that he
had got 962 friends but now we do not
know how many stories are there at the
end of the page okay so now I know the
range but I don't know the number of
iterations okay so I know that I have to
load 10 more stories into the news feed
until the end of the page so I want to
load 10 more stories so I'm just running
the while loop and here my test
expression is that until the number of
stories is equals to 10 okay so so once
10 stories are completed the while loop
will stop running so Monica have you
understood this example and have you
understood the difference between a 4
and while now so Monica says yes Thank
You Monica
so now let me just show you how to use a
while loop in Python okay so let me just
go ahead and show you the while loop
right here for that I'll just comment it
so let's say that again I have got a
variable X with 1 let's say so now what
I'm actually going to do is that I am
going to use random numbers ok so and if
you want two random numbers you have to
import some kind of modules so for
random you have to import this module
which is called random because I'll be
using some kind of functions that can be
found in the random module these are
some kind of inbuilt functions that I'll
be using ok so that's why I'm importing
a random so I've got a variable X equal
to 1 now and now I'm going to use the Y
statement and I have to mention a test
expression okay so jagrata is asking why
are you importing random candy rupee
yeah geography because I'll be using
some inbuilt functions because this
example that I'm going to show you deals
with random numbers ok so I'm going to
generate random numbers using a function
that can be found in the random module
so I have to import the module if I want
to use those inbuilt functions and I
said ok geography ok so we're using Y
now so okay so now I have to
test condition now so let's say that I
want the text expression to be when X is
not equal to a particular number 23 and
until then this loop will keep on
running okay so now this is the body of
my while loop and and now I'm just going
to print X and now I also have to update
the expression so I'll update X and I'm
going to use a particular function which
is called as the rand range and where I
can actually mention the range of the
random numbers that I'm going to
generate and I'm going to mention that
so let's say that I just wanted from 1
to 35 okay so my random numbers that
will be generated will be in range 1 to
35 and that is why I have imported
random because I was going to use this
function again this is only available
inside the random module so this is my
while loop and so let's just go ahead
and execute it so you can see that it
has generated a number of random digits
and random numbers and it has only
stopped when 23 was encountered that
means that it was about to print 23 and
that is when it means that X was
assigned to 23 and it was about to print
it but since this condition became false
so that's why it came out of the loop
okay so this is the while loop any
questions on while loop okay so no
questions so this was a while loop and
we have used while loop here because
we're dealing with random numbers and we
do not know we cannot say that
beforehand then how many numbers it will
print it has actually printed quite a
number of digits in this range so we
cannot predict it beforehand the number
of iterations so this is why we used a
while loop here instead of fork okay so
these are the situations where you can
use while loop and I have told you the
other situations where you can use a for
loop okay so let us move on okay so now
let us understand the break statement so
when you're dealing with you you can use
these kind of statements like break so
let's say that if you want to use
conditions
Saida loop and if you want to do
something if this condition is satisfied
you can use break let me tell you what
at the break actually does so this is
the body of your loop entirely and this
is one test condition that is inside the
loop okay so if that test condition is
false it will keep on executing the loop
and once it is true and if you have
mentioned a break statement inside those
after that test condition it will break
it means that the loop will stop and it
will get terminated it will not run
again once this condition has been
satisfied okay so this is the purpose of
a break statement now let me just give
you a realized representation again of
our break statement let us take the
example of your alarm in your phone so
your alarm will keep on ringing from the
start to the end so we don't know the
time duration maybe it can be for two
minutes one minute or however time your
alarm actually rings so your alarm will
keep on ringing until you a snooze it or
just turn it off so it will keep on
ringing so now let's say that you get an
incoming call while your alarm was
ringing so what will happen obviously
your alarm will stop ringing and your
phone will start ringing with the
ringtones so it's not like that it's
going to ignore your incoming call and
keep on ringing the alarm right so this
is what happens so it means that these
loop the loop of ringing the alarm gets
braked because this condition comes out
if there is a call it should stop
ringing right so this is the purpose of
a break statement so any questions on
break statement okay so no questions
I'll be showing you how to use break
statements in Python as well so for now
I'll just continue to the continue
statement now so a continuous statement
is also similar to a break statement but
it is a little bit different okay so
what happens when you encounter a
continue inside a loop so if you place a
continue within the test condition what
it will do is that it will just stop the
execution of loop only when this test
condition is satisfied it will just come
out of the loop and this again a return
to the start of the loop and it will
execute it again this execution is only
going to stop only a particular
condition is getting satisfied the
execution of the loop is only going to
be stopped when a particular condition
is satisfied when you place a continue
so let me just actually show you the
difference between a break and continue
first let me create another Python file
so let's say that I have got our for
loop ok so again let me first initialize
a variable let's say X is equal to 40
and now I'm using the for loop again
let's see if for X now let me just
include a certain kind of condition over
here so let's say that if X is equal to
a particular number 45 it is going to
break the loop okay or else it will just
keep on printing X okay I forgot the
colon over here then I also have to
update the expression which is going to
update it by one and now if you run it
you can see that it has only printed
from 40 to 44 and since this condition
was satisfied the loop was broken okay
now if you see that if you use continue
instead of break here let us see what
happens okay
so now if you run it
you can see that it has printed all the
numbers except for 45 years it means
that whenever you use continue only for
that particular time when the condition
is true and you use a continue the loop
is not going to get executed but after
that once the condition is found a false
after the updation of your variable it
will again keep on continuing so have
you understood the difference between
break and continue okay so this was a
break and continue statements that you
can use inside a loop and with
conditions so now there is another
representation of the continue so let's
take the example of your phone again in
order to understand the continue
statement so let's say that your phone
has started ringing and it will keep on
ringing until the person who has called
you has disconnected it or it has been
cut off automatically okay but let's say
that while your phone was ringing your
alarm was scheduled at that time in
between the time when your phone was
ringing okay so let's say that an alarm
was scheduled in between the time when
your phone was ringing okay so what
happens it's not like your alarm starts
ringing and it will disconnect your call
right so your alarm will hold off it
will be on snooze automatically or
implicitly until your call is over once
it's over you alarm will start ringing
again so this is continuous so it will
just hold off for a particular condition
that is getting satisfied in this case
which is the ringing of your phone and
after that it will start doing the same
thing so is it clear okay so let us move
on and understand the past statement now
past statement is actually very simple
there is nothing much tell about the
past statement because a past statement
is nothing it is just a placeholder and
by placeholder I mean that if you want
to do nothing if a particular condition
is getting satisfied you just mention
the past here okay and you don't mention
any kind of processes here because you
don't want to make any changes when this
particular condition is getting
satisfied you just place the past there
and it will take care of and nothing
will happen and there will be no change
or no process
that will get executed it's just a
placeholder so if you can see in this
example over here so there are like
three conditions mentioned so if this
condition is true it relates to use
process 1 this condition is true I don't
want to do anything so just I have
mentioned off here and if this condition
is true you'll execute process 3 or else
the default one
so the path can be helpful when you
don't want to execute default statement
so that's when you can use path and it
will do nothing because if otherwise you
do not mention this condition because
you might be thinking that why should I
use path if I don't want to do if this
condition is getting satisfied I can
just simply remove this condition right
but wouldn't happen is that if none of
these conditions are getting satisfied
it will actually execute the default
statement and if you don't actually want
to execute the default statement as well
so just write the condition and right
path and it will just hold up and will
do nothing so have you understood path
ok so David has a question so what is
the purpose of us why do we use it so
it's a very good question David so if
you just take a look at this example
over here that you can see that I have
got three conditions and I've got the
default condition ok so let's say that I
have a situation in this condition you
might ask me that if I don't want to use
this condition if this condition is
getting satisfied and I don't want to
execute anything why - just right path I
can simply remove this condition right
you can think of it like that but what
happens is there when you're dealing
with conditional statements like if and
there is always a default condition so
if none of the conditions get satisfied
the default condition will execute some
kind of process okay so in that case
where you are not sure what to do or
what process that you should run our
maybe you don't want any kind of change
when a particular condition is getting
satisfied so then only mention passed
occurs after a particular condition you
have to mention some kind of process
that will grant price so if you don't
want any kind of change you can just
mention path okay so this was all about
Oh control so now let us go ahead and
understand how to write functions in
Python so functions are a block of
statements that is used to perform a
specific task and it is very advisable
to use functions in programming because
with functions you can actually manage
your code in a better way so that's why
you should use functions and functions
are always promoted so this is an
example of a function now function in
Python always starts with the keyword de
f and then the function name and in
phantasy if you mentioned the arguments
okay and you can see the triple double
quotations over here this is nothing but
the dog string and what do you write in
a dog string is just a description of
the function it is for your benefit so
that you can understand what your
function does and what is it going to be
used for okay for example the doc string
here says this function returns the
absolute value of the number okay so
this is the dog string giving me the
description of my function so this is my
function body inside where I have
written my code which is if num is
greater than equal to 0 return uhm else
return - num now it is going to give me
the absolute value not in sign so this
is the logic that I have written and
then in order to call a function I'll
just write the name of the function and
pass an argument so I have passed minus
200 so this will get passed in here and
we execute this function ok and if I
want to find out the dog string of a
particular function I'll use this the
name of my function dot and double
underscores dot and then after that
double underscores ok so since I'm
printing this this will return 200 the
absolute value and it is returning the
doctrine which is the dysfunction is
rigorous the absolute value of the
number so this is okay so Monika is
asking why this double underscores so
this is just the syntax of how to print
dog strings this is the default syntax
of Python Monica now let us understand
why to use function
so functions help encode reusability now
let us take this example over so if you
see this example here this is a program
which is used to reverse a string and
let's say that I want to reverse I want
to give another input I want to reverse
another string so what will happen what
I need to do then is that I need to run
that same program again but if I use it
as function all I have to do is that I
just have to call that function a couple
of more times I don't have to run the
entire program again right okay so Sarah
has a question she is asking that can I
use a function that is defined in a
different program can I import it
well of course Sarah can do that but
before that you have to convert your
code into a module and after that
whatever functions that are defined
inside that model whatever functions
that you have written inside the program
which is converted in your model you can
import them but make sure that at the
beginning of the program if you are
trying to import some other functions
from other modules make sure that you
mention or you import the name of the
module like I did while I was explaining
you the while statement because I was
using a particular function that was
actually mentioned inside the random
module so I used import random right so
this is how you can actually use
different functions from a different
program or modules so is that okay Sarah
okay fine so these are the users of
function it actually provides you with a
good organization of your code it
provides with abstraction it means that
you do not have to write that whole code
again you do not have to show everything
you can actually implement data hiding
with user functions as well it also
helps in extensibility because if you
want to add some new features to this
program you can just add it inside the
function you can add more lines or more
features into it so these are the users
of functions so any doubts in that okay
no doubt so okay so let me just go ahead
and show you how you can write functions
in Python
okay so I'm going to create a new Python
file I'm going to write let us create a
simple function that is going to add
numbers okay so as I told you a function
starts with DES keyword so I'm just
going to say the name of the function is
going to be add number okay and it is
just going to add two numbers so it is
going to accept two arguments so let's
call it num1 and num2 and now you can
just write the logic inside the body of
function where sum is equal to num 1
plus number 2 and just return the sum
right and yeah of course I mentioned the
dog string over here and the colon after
that so two numbers now how are you
going to call this function so let me
just directly print the answer to just
type in the name which is this is my
function name right ad number so I'm
just passing two values let's say 20 and
30 and now if you run it it is just
going to give me the answer and so this
is how you write a simple function you
can write any kind of functional just
write all the code inside the function
body and make sure of the indentation is
correct
now let me just go ahead and also show
you how to print the doc string that I
was just telling you about so again at
number
do you remember it is double underscore
TOC and then again double underscore so
this is the doc string over here so this
is how you write function so any
questions on functions okay no questions
so now let us go ahead and understand
file handling
how to read a file how to write a file
how to edit those file and make
modifications okay so the steps in order
to read or write a file first thing you
need to do is you need to open the file
and after that only you can either read
or write the file and after you're done
making the modifications or reading it
you have to go ahead and close the file
so these are the steps and this is how
you can perform file handling ok so in
order to open a file
Python has got an inbuilt function which
is called open okay so so this is the
function open you just mention the class
of your file that you just mentioned the
path of your file and will open your
file okay and similarly in order to
write a file all you have to do again is
if you want to read or write reading the
file and just mention it are here if you
want to write the file is the W and make
sure that you mentioned the encoding and
the default encoding is utf-8 so make
sure that you mentioned that and then
after that if you want to write
something use the write function this is
also an inbuilt function and this is my
first file and this is file contains
three lines so this is how you write
into a file okay but there is one thing
that you should keep in mind that if you
write a file it will erase whatever it
had previously and if you rewrite the
file actually but let's say that if you
want to add something else into the file
so for that use append so instead of W
here it append something you can use an
A over here okay so this is how you
write in a file and similarly if you
want to read a file so like I told you
instead of W just mentioned and R here
and you can use the function read over
here you can also mention the length
that you want to read or the length of
the lines that you want to list out so
if you just want to list out the first
four characters it will do that and
after that if you again read out four
character it will start from the point
where it ended where your cursor
actually ended so
this is how you can actually read from a
file and this is how you can read from a
file I'll show that to you how to do
that don't worry if you're not
understanding it now and finally after
you're done reading writing you make
sure that you close the file and closing
is very simple it is again using in this
function called close so just use that
function and that is it so let me just
now show you how to do that okay
some create another file which is called
files okay so the first thing that I
need to do is that I need to open my
file right so I have a file I have a
text file somewhere in C Drive so I'm
just going to mention that so I have to
use a variable okay and if I want to
open if I want to read or write if I
want to do anything I have to use a
variable for that so I'm just using F
here so now I'm using the function open
and I have to mention it's in my feed
drives out to mention the path
so I have to mention the part and the
name of my file is Ray one is a text
file and after a comma make sure that
what do you want it for the one is for
writing reading so let's say that I want
to write into the file so so I'll use a
W and then mention the encoding
which is by default UDF - eight so this
will open my file and let's say that I
want to write something so for that I'll
use the right function and just write
whatever you want to so again I'm going
to write welcome to edu raiga and after
you're done writing it so just make sure
that you close it okay and it's done so
you just run it now and it is showing
that process is finished it means that
it has successfully run so now let us
read it okay so for reading I have to do
the same thing again I have to open it
again okay so this was for right okay so
now let me write something for reading
it
okay I'll just go ahead I just have to
actually change this over here instead
of W I just have to write our that I
want to open the file for I want to open
it for reading mode okay so but before
that let me just go ahead and comment
this so that they don't interfere when I
run it so now let me just read it like I
told you that you can mention the length
with this function let's say that six
okay and then finally and if you want to
print it let's say print it so let's
store it in any kind of variable let me
just call it text okay if I wanted to
print it so I'll just go ahead and I'll
print text and make sure that you close
it right
so if you run it now you can see that it
has I've mentioned the length that I
want to read six characters so it has
just given me six characters now let's
say that I want to read the entire file
whatever there is so and I don't know
the length of it okay so for that I'll
use a function in build function again
which is called read lines and just
leave it empty so now if you run it it
will print the entire string or the
entire file whatever there is written in
it so this is how you read a file open a
file and write into it or read it so is
that clear to you guys any questions on
file handling okay no questions thank
you guys okay so now let us go ahead and
understand object and classes now python
is an object-oriented programming
language like I was telling you so it
deals with classes and objects so what
are classes and what are objects so you
can think of an object so if you refer
to this example over here you can think
of class as a blueprint and this is a
blueprint of a house and you can think
of the houses that are created from that
blueprint as objects okay and you can
say that these houses were and since
this is the same blueprint so the houses
that are going to be created from this
blueprint are all going to be similar so
like that all the objects of a same
class are also similar and objects are
nothing but they are just a collection
of data which are variables and there
are also functions and these variables
and functions are what define an object
okay and you mention all these variables
and this functions inside a class from
where the object is going to be
generated so objects are basically
instances of the class okay so Monica
has a very interesting question she is
asking that in int equal to 10 can we
consider int as a class and 10 as an
object obviously this can be a good
example but it's going to get a
confusing if you think of examples like
this
but yeah you can think of that like that
well Monica it can get confusing if you
start thinking of examples like that but
I can tell you that you are actually
correct you are getting the concept
right it's a blueprint int is and is
just a definition of something and an
example of that is an object so you are
right in a way so this is just a brief
idea about object and classes and
objects are used to model real life
problems because objects are also have
got a certain behavior like real life
objects and those behaviors are defined
by the functions and variables of the
class from where the object is generated
or created so any more questions on this
ok no questions let us go ahead and
learn more about objects and classes ok
so how do we define a class in Python so
you have to define it by using this
keyword known as class and after that
just write the name of your class which
is in this case it's my new class and
you can write the body or you can
mention the variables or anything after
that and this is the body of your class
and this is the dog string so the
doctoring is the same thing that we
learn in function it is a brief
description of the class whatever your
class is meant for using whatever your
objects will do or the kind of data that
are the kind of functions that your
class contains cigarette anything that
you want to okay add and how to create
an object for the class all you have to
do is write the name of the object and
equals to the name of the class so it's
simple as that so let me just go ahead
and show you in pycharm how to define a
class on how to create objects
so let's say that the name of my class
is called example okay I'm just going to
write a very simple class it has let's
say a variable let's say X is equal to
20 and another one Y is equal to 10 and
then it has also got a member function
let me just name a function or F UNC and
I'm using self over here it means that
the argument whatever will be passed it
will get only passed from the object
that will be created from this class
from the same class that an object will
be created okay so this is just going to
point to itself and it's very similar to
the disk pointer that you work on with
in C++ and C and let's say that it's
just going to print any kind of random
things like say I am and so let's say
that this is your entire class okay so
now if you want to create objects from
this class so let's say that I'm
creating my first object let's say it's
OB 1 and all you have to do is write the
name of your class which is example yeah
and similarly let me create another
object you can create as many objects
that you want to and the one thing that
you should know that you can only access
this variables and this functions only
with the objects okay you cannot
actually go ahead and let's say print X
it won't work so let me just give you an
example and show you
so you see the name X is not defined
because this is defined inside the class
okay but instead of just printing X if I
use the object and then the dot operator
and now if you run it it is going to
show 20 so the objects are the ways or
the keys in order to access the
variables and the functions that you use
inside a class okay well you can also
define constructors in python like how
you do in C++ so constructors are
nothing but they are also member
functions that get implicitly executed
when you create an instance of the class
or you create an object of the class so
let me just go ahead and show you how to
write constructors okay so let me just
include the constructor over here now
since constructor is a function again so
I have to start it with the keyword d EF
like how I write normal functions okay
so since it's a constructor you have to
write it like this double underscore
that in it again double underscore and
cells so I'm passing cells here because
my object that is going to get created
that is going to be passed as reference
or as an argument okay so whatever
object that I will be creating over here
this will get passed as an argument here
so now let me just initialize those
values let's say X is 45 and so dot Y is
60 so even though I have written this
values somewhat different what this
function is going to do is that this is
going to get executed and this will
initialize my variables or this will
give new values to the variables once my
object is created okay so now let us go
ahead and actually print this values now
let's see what does it print okay so you
can see that now it is showing 45 and 60
instead of 20 and 10 it is because what
I created this object this function got
automatically executed
and it has actually changed the value of
x into 45 and y to 60 so the constructor
is used to initialize your object or
initialize the variables in your class
so that is the purpose of a constructor
and this is run implicitly you do not
need to run this explicitly if we get
triggered once you create an object of
your class so this was about classes and
objects any questions on this one
okay no questions so now let us take a
look at the Python job trends so this is
a trend graph that has been collected
from indeed.com
and this is the data from 2012 to the
end of 2016 and this blue line over here
represents Python and you can see that
the job trends are people who know
Python are grabbing on to more
opportunities they are getting more
opportunities since Python is trending
and obviously it will since you have
seen that how much you can do with
Python it is very easy and you can
actually do a lot of things with Python
and that is the reason that it is
trending more than the other scripting
languages like Perl PHP Ruby and Django
so you can see from this graph that a
Python is really trending and it is very
popular so you can conclude from the
graph is that Python is the clear winner
here nothing is even close to that so it
is very trending and it is right now in
the top charts now since a lot of people
are using Python let us take a look at
the success stories now there's Google
Facebook Instagram Mozilla now Google is
saying that python has been an important
part of Google since the beginning and
the director of Google Peter Norvig says
that Python has been an important part
of Google since the beginning and remain
so as the system grows and evolves today
dozens of Google engineers use Python
and we're looking for more people with
skills in this language and so this is
what Facebook has got to say an
Instagram and Mozilla and I'm pretty
sure that not just these four there are
other big companies as well they are
using Python and are still using it
because they have acquired huge benefits
by using Python so this is a few of the
success stories of Python
and this is what we learned today we
have understood what our scripting
languages and what are they useful we
took a brief overview of Python about
the features of Python we'll learn how
to install Python and PyCharm in our
system we understood the Python
fundamentals the things that we need to
know in and out if you want to master
Python we have seen the job trends and
the success stories so this is the end
of today's tutorial if you have any
questions till now we can still ask me
