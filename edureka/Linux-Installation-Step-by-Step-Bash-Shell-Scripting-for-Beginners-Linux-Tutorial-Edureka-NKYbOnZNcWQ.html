installation over a virtual machine as
well as will see the process on how to
initiate a network based installation
you will see one based on that HTTP
service and another one is I'm going to
perform kickstart using a USB device
okay yeah so another point is in case if
you want to make your own boot boot CD
okay so with the bootable CD so I just
want to show you how to where to
download the ISO images so you can
download the ISO image and then you can
create your own bootable CD and you can
start installing on your own machine
there will be a slight difference
between installing on your machine and
installing on a virtual machine in a vm
today I will be showing you on a VMware
by default the partitions will be
created I will not be able to show you
how to create the partition but rest of
the process with respect to installing
the package is saluting with other
parameters would remain the same okay so
so we need a ISO image okay so my a
machine is it's about sixty could be dot
either okay so that's eight six and
let's go six four so you can visit this
link where you can get the ISO images
okay so here this is the country so if
you can see it there are two DVDs
available DVD one dot is Wendy view - 2
dot is low so it is sufficient if you
download DVD 1 dot are useful okay so
DVD do dot is - it contains some extra
files so other than the basic ones and
also it's like files that that
correspond to other languages other than
English those files are present and DVD
- so you can stick to DVD one dot is
book alright so once that is installed
you can you can you can burn it on a
disk
ok and come up with your own
Buddha will be will be using which we
can perform the installation today I'll
just show you in my virtual vision I
create a new new VM container here okay
I I'll just name it something okay so
here based on the operating system it
will show you the amount of support at a
minimum time that is needed all right
and we can go with creating a new disk
okay we create a virtual disk image okay
you can either go with fixed or dynamic
size allocation so whatever size the
disk space which is there so here you
can select your own question
or you can either say it has other Linux
since I'm just keeping it okay so this
is the minimum amount of RAM supported
Ram that it's necessary for installing
this I'm going to start with new hard
disk creating a new container and this
is a image file alright so you can
select if it is fixed or dynamically
either option is fine for testing
scenarios alright and so this is just
the process of creating their virtual
container itself okay so once it is done
okay I just creating in the container
now
yeah I have not specified the ISO file
so far I'm just creating the virtual
container give me a minute crashed
during the creation of the container
itself so so this is the location I've
kept the files on my desktop I will be
uploading from this location itself so
this is my USB device it has this you
can you can perform a manual
installation first and then you can take
this care store CFG configuration fight
I've simply renamed it whatever is there
under so if you take the other atom on
the machine there the center is the
nation the one which I used to show
every session in practice so that
whatever anaconda rotc people that got
generated I have renamed with bouquets
dot CMC and I have copied to my bootable
disk ok and in this instance I have I
have installed this HTTP service I'll
show you how I found that so and I have
kept a copy of the same place dots VLJ
pi in that location
ok so we have started with the
installation process
so here I'll show you this HTTP so these
are all different services other than
your normal installation process you can
also keep you cased or CFG file in any
of these services and we can make the
system install the packages or whatever
packages are one of configuration we
want to install it has to go and greet
the case dot CFG point and then we will
point out the repository so in my
machine it is like on my desktop I've
kept the image file from where the
packages will be fetched and then it
will read the configuration from them
they start CFG file which is present
either as a part of the HTTP HTTP
service or as apartment is a part of
mine that is present in my USB Drive so
it will place the completion from here
and it will install the packages for my
desktop so I will show you that
okay so so that is two different types
of installations that are not part of
this see there is a tool using which you
can generate this que amid case towards
the EPS in a file you can either use the
tool or by default whatever file by
default after you perform the
installation would also get to see that
and then we have shield there are
different types of shells out of which
you will not have to switch to other
tools mostly bash one is initialization
which which has all the properties so
regarding the properties we have feel
like auto-completion features remember
history and you can also use up and down
a dosing all of the go through them go
through the previous commands that we
have used people and there are some
other commands like and only a control
key which will be helpful for you in
order to move your cursor or you can
delete your word like that so these are
all the command and then regard we have
discussed about the file system
architecture the way in which the files
are distributed in different kinds of
files present and how they are
distributed functionality-wise under the
root the topmost directory that is the
slash detective tree and yeah and then
we have kinds different users
particularly a root user and non-routine
users so if you see here the root user
there is logged in as a booty is it here
look at www.sec.gov tree all day and
then so this is the you wrote is that so
you can see a dollar front over there
but non-root users
sorry hash from but non-root users you
can see a dollar prompt over there okay
CD by default it will take you to your
home directory which is slash root under
slash go to you will see there is a file
called anaconda open KS dot CFG that is
your kickstart point okay so whatever
options you have chosen as a part of the
installation if you go with installing
installing the same toys on a virtual
machine it has default configuration it
will install the default configuration
you will not get to select the options
by creating partitions and all alright
so this is the kickstart file that got
generated information all right so if
you have observed I am trying to switch
and I'm switching between users so you
can remember this command assume that
that is switching between the users you
can have multiple users in your system
you can see all the users in the file
called UTC password ok whenever you
create a user an entry will get
generated in this password file so there
are different different users present to
the system if you observe here even the
system processes will also have a user
that get generated ok so here you can
see the user plane and the user ID the
group ID are mentioned here the default
home directory and end of the line shows
the shell to which the user blocks in
the system generated the user doesn't
have the portion ok totals it is has
been no login folder so every time you
create a user so the user there will be
a home that if we that gets generated
and it will be present under slash home
it is only the loop user whose homely
the crease slash root ok so if you want
to switch between users you can use su
command so one thing that you can
observe here is then so PWD I'm here
under slash foot ok switch you to user
called sudden now see PWD so I'm in the
same directory but I do not have access
ok as this user I cannot access the root
directory content rather what you can do
is do su space hyphen space alright
automatically when you use a - the user
will be taken to his own home directory
where he has access to the content his
own content okay so you can use this
switch user command for now and I'll
tell you how to create super users and
other modules so basically as I saw
their user what you can do is you can
access the root folder as well so there
are a lot of admin operations which
route is it can only perform and a
normal user cannot perform for example
if you see this come on
disk hyponym see you can also see come
on not from there it is there all right
so you can search for this command very
sceptic okay tails has been folder yeah
where is disc okay so if the command is
not working for you you can make user
this particular command varies will help
you in locating the binary okay so you
can give the entire path has been kept
disk open tell okay so it's not
displaying any output because it is only
restricted to the root user so again
what I'll do is I'll switch as root
loser okay and again it has been like
this so this is the update basically it
will display the list of partitions that
are that that are created in your system
all right so this is /the
SDA one and then tier two are two
partitions in way the next instance okay
and yeah so another important thing here
so observe I have used the n-type path
slash as being /f disk
okay rather I don't want to keep using
the keep giving the n-type path every
time okay
so for that what you have to do is you
need to add the path to the n0 on one
variable so you can check the default
values and
using echo command echo dollar path it
will give you the list of paths that are
currently present and present in the
path variable for root user okay now
there are two different ways one is you
can export you can add the new part the
temporarily that is this way okay so
part is available the process is almost
the same so dollar path contains the
existing values
Hulan i'll give it's been okay so I have
added the path to the existing path
variable if you can see here slash has
been has been added to the ending now if
I do FDI the tab completion which will
press tab twice gets computer okay I
opinion so this is how you can export
the path temporarily when most of the
time when you the new access Linux
system you must be installing some
applications on doing some task okay
where you will get to where you might
have the need to add paths to the
variables like that so another important
thing how to make this change
permanently okay so here we WOD go to my
home did it okay so for every user in
his home there there are some important
configuration points okay so if you
observe these configuration files they
basically they start with the dot okay
here you can see a dot bash understood
profile and dot bash underscore RC you
can see the content of it alright some
variables are present here see here a
path is equal to dollar path : home
slash bin so and again the path has been
exported you can together you can split
it or use it as a single comment that is
export space part is equal to that
length okay so simply open this file and
here add dollar a spin or whatever
folder you want to add where your
binaries are present and automatically
that value will be pulled so what
happens is the moment you login
okay a user logins into the system so
all these dot files will be sourced
sourced in essence all these variables
will be loaded for that particularly in
sir okay so the moment you make the
changes here and do login so if you are
if you open the terminal and then you
have modified this simply close and
reopen the terminal automatically these
variables will get loaded for you okay
so similarly there is a command called
env which is English you can see all the
variables present in the system okay so
when you make a change automatically it
gets reflected in these variables but if
you just do it on the command line it
will be a temporary change you need to
make the entry in the corresponding - RC
or - and that's good profile
configuration file
alright then it will be permanently
reflected so another important thing
those files are not visible when you
will do unless those are hidden by its
files which are created with the dot
okay then you can even hide directly by
creating it like starting with the dot n
KD r dot press to the air okay so it is
not visible you to do LS - k in order to
see that hidden directory okay yeah so
you can see dot test day here okay so
next another thing you are exporting
those variables all right
and then we have seen a few comments I
will quickly show you all the comment ok
so we have started with all basic
comment like displaying files using cat
tag some file name and then that will
simply display the entire content of the
file on your screen if you if you want
to if you want to see the content page
by page you can use the command called
is more more installed the first page
you can keep pressing enter to see the
rest of the file Q to quit okay
and apart from this there is another
comment called as head ok you can pass
the number of blanks as an argument to
it and you can you can print it so it
will exactly display the number that you
have given head - 5 install not log so
it will display you the five lines ok so
just click head there is another command
called ice tail ok tail - 5 install dot
lock so it will display the last 5 lines
of particular point ok so these are also
pretty much handy tools that you can use
and the most important use of the tail
command is using - head
ok tail hyphen F particularly log by NC
so what happens is every time you must
be working on application and
application logs must be getting
generated
okay so parallely we want to see what
has happened in the application side and
also in the logs all day so pain - f
will display the instantaneous increase
that are getting generated in your logs
so that is the advantage of using tail
hyphen F so right now I have logged in
to run level 3 so I cannot open multiple
sessions here and log into G I would and
then I will show you an open multiple
sessions and I can show you how to
generate I'll go check using tail
heightmap syntax is very simple day in
space I even have space whatever log
we'll try something okay see the cursor
is stopped here so as the as this file
keeps getting updated this log file this
message is file automatically you can
observe the logs being generated on your
screen so that is the advantage of using
tail I can act okay yes then we have
seen LS the one so yes for every car I
recommend that we execute there are a
lot of arguments available all this
information is present as a part of the
man pages okay come on space command
will give you all the events and all the
information corresponding to that
particular command okay
now with with every command we'll see a
few options with LS we've seen a layered
th so which will give a long listing and
also the sorted list of all the files
present in that folder so the long
listing basically helps you to know what
kind of file it is and what are the
permissions associated with the file and
the next there are three types of
permissions the permission X which the
owner of the file bones and the
permissions that are applicable to the
corresponding group and the permission
it that are applicable to rest of the
users in the system ok so that is
something which you can see here so the
first place
indicates it is a directory or the
particular model time all normal files
are the placenta is the - and then you
can see the next three places are the
breaks are for the polar will that poses
all the three conditions 3 is right
aggregate and the next view is there
that is the group to which this
particular user pillock simply use it
when you create it will be part of the
group ok so we will see how to add users
to group and on so so what permissions
does the group has and last three places
is for others and then you can see the
owner
grouping what is the size of the fight
when was it created all this information
okay and yeah then we have seen other
simple commands like copy come on how
the copy finds how to rename the files
renaming is just like moving the point
from one one name moving it renaming it
moving from one place to another place
or you can even rename the files using
the Move command now the same syntax is
applicable for directories as well so
and the next thing is the excellent how
to delete the folder is delete files in
folders so by default out of some file
name will delete sorry will ask you for
the confirmation if you want to delete
it if you don't want the confirmation
you can simply say you can simply
mention - okay and similarly for
directories different access rmdir we
will delete RM the air is to delete
empty directrix okay see m'kay deer came
to the air
alright Adam I'm treating it so it's a
direction cannot remove it so our inner
tools are over the air okay so that is
helpful and then we have seen how to
delete directories that has content yeah
this the RM space save the test go to
text and that touches the command to
create sample files you can create
multiple files with in touch all right
so this directory has some content
I came back to my previous directory and
RM space recursively - far and
forcefully okay so this will delete the
directory as well as the contents of the
directory okay and then the other
commands we have seen
listing cat or we have covered head
command and the CD so
importance of seeley seeley by default
it will always take you to your home
directory CD space dot dot or your
previous directory and you think what
didn't mean you can keep using this
notation to keep going backwards
alright and another important one is CD
space - if you remember it will take you
to the previous directory in the sense
you say you are in two different
structures all together say my man / I
go to slash home
sorry okay so if I lose he leaves paste
or not I'll come to previous directory
what if I do CD space - it will take me
to roll director so this is the
importance of yeah the next thing
we seen operations on editors VI editors
so we editor basically helps you to edit
the content that you have so you can
open a file there and you can edit this
file so why why is the command to copy
it and peel is to print it you can do
10p as well to print it 10 times so
always remember the position of the
cursor is important within the editor
alright so from the position of the
cursor say if you want to delete file
ends you can do 5vd ok it will delete
all the pylons
similarly shift ok here the top shift
key will help you to the bottom he can
also find and replace okay we'll start
with find slash test you can set like
this and if you want to do a reverse
which you can do with the question mark
alright and the next one is replacing
the files
perfidious word 1/2 okay
like that you can find and replace
so there are some summer operations here
you can see how to perform those
commands inside here we are deter all
right then we have seen three more tools
of dependency dick that we have used to
know to pull specific strings to search
with a specific string inside a pipe it
will bring you all the corresponding
matches from that file similarly we have
seen the functionality of pop and xev as
well and then it is compression
techniques how to are kept the files so
there are different ways one is the
basic creating basic dot Tarpons is in
tariffs severe you can apply it on a
normal individual files and you can also
apply it on folders so here is the
syntax if you put pipe in cv g GF if you
add another argument called g you will
create a gun zipped file how it is easy
to find and if you put a j here you will
create a binary zip file all right
similarly instead of C means creation if
you put X you can extract both that as
well as gun zip as well as binary zip
along with the that extension ok so if
you want to apply guns if individually
without losing pad come on you can go
with the command called unzip or
similarly you have I think bu and zip
unzip for binary say ok you can apply
that individually and you can also apply
it you can combine with Twitter pair
command
