name is Verdun and I'm super excited to
be here on a during our life with you
guys
in my previous session on DevOps I
explained how to docker eyes an angular
application using git Jenkins and docker
so today's session is the next in that
same docker series and today I will show
you how to use docker compose to
container I is not just one angular
application but to continue eyes and
then diamine stack application so in
simple terms the difference between my
previous session and today's session is
that in my previous session I created
one talker container and hosted one
angler application inside that but this
time around I will be using docker
compose to create three different
containers for hosting the entire main
stack application angler will be hosted
in one container same as before
MongoDB will be hosted in another
container node.js and Express will be
hosted in the third container and that's
how I'm going to use docker compose to
containerize this entire application
alright
and guys if you get any doubt during the
session you can raise them by putting
them in the comment box and either my
team or I will myself answer them for
you so sit back relax and enjoy a drake
alive for the next 30 minutes to learn
how docker compose can be used to
containerize multi container
applications but before i get started
now i want to ask you all people a
couple of questions firstly are you all
aware of what docker is and secondly do
you all know what a mean stack
application is it's very important I
know what kind of audience are happily
so do dropper your questions sorry your
answers
okay so I expect a mixed response
anyways so some of you people might know
what they are and some of you might not
so don't worry guys as you can see from
the agenda
I will first introduce you to Daka I
will talk about what docker is and how
beneficial it is after which I will talk
about what exactly doctor composes all
right then I will tell you how to build
docker containers and how to get them to
interact with one another since I'm
container izing a mean stack application
I will also talk about what is a meatsac
application that'll be very brief and
finally I will give you a demonstration
of how to containerize this application
alright so enough talk let's get started
with our first topic for today and that
is what is darker so docker is a
container ization platform which
packages your application and all its
dependencies together the form of
containers so as to ensure that your
application works seamlessly in any
environment beat development environment
or testing environment or production
environment so as you can see from the
majori screen we have two different
containers here right so each of these
containers they have their own set of
applications running it contains its own
dependencies and packages and libraries
these are tightly packed together and
these containers are powered by the
underlying docker engine and this docker
engine is in turn hosted by the host
machine the host machine here can be
anything it can be Windows or Mac or
even Linux for that matter of fact
now in the industry what happens is
docker is hosted either on the servers
or inside a VM on the server all right
now in case if you have a big
application then in that case you will
need multiple servers for running the
different web services or probably run
multiple virtual machine inside that
server now keeping cost-cutting in mind
virtual machines are the way forward
right you'll be using virtual machines
for running and deploying these
applications or web services and then
you'll have to of course start multiple
VMs in that same server right and what
what would happen when that happens is
that you have a problem of memory
resources too much RAM will be consumed
from your host because BMC in-memory to
be pre-allocated but that's where
benefit that's where docker comes right
and the benefit but docker is that that
much RAM will not be consumed from the
host machine only the application and
its dependencies will be packaged
together and will be hosted on top of
the host machine and whenever that
container is active and running only
then the memory needed to it is
allocated to it and well there is no
wastage of memory resources as well when
you compare it with VMs so that's one
major benefit with docker and other
benefits with it are you know since
these containers are very lightweight
they can be easily spun into action
without much overhead and they can also
be shared with other collaborators
easily by uploading them to the docker
hub so these are the reasons why docker
is the way forward and why you have to
implement docker in space of virtual
machines okay so that's about docker and
now let's talk about docker containers
right because this is the actual deal
whatever we do whatever applications we
host we do it inside this so that's why
it's really important to know how to
first of all create a single docker
container and as the line you know says
docker files are used to build a docker
image okay so these darker files are
used to create a container and they are
raw these containers are spun by
building the docker image okay
and well this document will also contain
all the project codes and all its
dependencies and all these things so
that's what the docker image will have
and it's a simple process to just run
the docker image and you'll have a
running container okay just a running
version of
the image and the same topical image can
be used to spend n number of containers
and each of these containers will just
have you know slight modifications to
the underlying base image and by doing
this you say open a lot of memory space
it's not like you'll be having you'll be
downloading multiple docker images right
even if you have the same base image you
won't be doing it multiple time so you
will have an existing base image on top
of that you will have slight variations
and this is lot of memory and lot of
advantages come up with that and
whatever image you come up with at the
end it can also be uploaded to the
docker hub and it can be shared with
other collaborators for testing or
deployment or for production and all
these various reasons right and as you
can see from the image this is a
pictorial representation of what I just
said
right so you have the dropper container
over here so these are these are the
absolute deal this is where your
application or your web service is
actually hosted okay and these
containers are built with the help of
the docker image okay now docker
building the docker image is the
challenge and we can simply build a
docker image by writing a docker file
right now the raca file you will mention
which base image you want to use because
that base image would have to be pulled
for the first time from the docker hub
and then you would have your own
variations to that you would have to
install certain dependencies then you
have to install no copy or a project
code over there and there are so many
other things that you have to do that
docker image and when you've done
whatever you needed to do by simply
running that image you created docker
container okay so the docker container
is just a running instance of your
docker image and when you just have the
container up and active then you have
the service hosted so you're all good
and at the same time you have you can
share this docker image with other
people by just uploading that to the
docker hub and what happens usually in
the industry is that the image is
uploaded to the docker hub and at the
staging server or at the production
server over there the docker image is
pulled from the hub right and then it's
just straight away this run so that you
have a running instance of whatever you
built so this way there's also stability
because you're sure that the container
is going to host the application in
exactly the same way that it was built
in
okay so there's not gonna be any changes
with respect to performance so it's
gonna be very stable and it's very
reliable so these are the two big
benefits by creating with Auto
containers compared to any other VMs or
hosing them simply on the server so
that's the one thing and now that we've
spoken about how to create containers
it's time to go to the next topic and
that is what is docker compose right so
the definition says dr. Campos is used
to run multi container applications now
based on what I have recovered all this
time can anybody give a you know make a
guess as to what this means this line
multi container applications anybody
from the audience
you
okay so guys uh as I said earlier multi
containers right so well the thing is
you use one container usually to host
one service right now that's what we
discuss all this time now let's take a
case of a massive big application all
right and it has multiple services and
in fact there are multiple web servers
which need to be placed separately on a
particular server or on or in a
particular VM because it might cause an
overhead because maybe two-three service
cannot be hosted on the same same
machine so at that time what we usually
do is we uh we create we have a new VM
and we hosted there right or we have a
new server altogether for example if you
want to have if you want to monitor your
your application then you might probably
use now yours so Nagios you may have
there will be times that you'll have to
host it separately in a different
machine and similarly you will have mean
very other video of various servers like
Jenkins and many web services so at that
time you instead of having a different
machine or how many different VM we can
simply have a different container okay
you can have these multiple services
hosted in these multiple containers so
each container will be hosting one
service and then these containers would
be who run such that they can be
interact with one another okay exactly
how it works in the you know in case of
servers or VM so it's exactly the same
way but it's just that it's gonna be one
command very simple command which is
going to you don't get your docker
compose up and this dr. Campos up it's
like a grid right so it'll run all three
containers at the same time it will host
all these and it will get them to
interact with one another so that's what
that's the benefit with the docker
compose and that's the whole point of
today's session right I want to show you
how awesome docker compose is this way
so yeah moving on to what I'm actually
going to show you in today's session I'm
going to show you how to set up a mean
stack application like I mentioned
earlier so first of all the mean in the
mean stack has four different things so
the M stands for
MongoDB which is the database and E
stands for express a stands for angle
and n stands for node.js now together
they are this is a full-stack
application okay now since we are using
a combination of these four tools we a
condiment to a mean slack application
okay that's what it's acronym - so this
full sock application is again a web
service so such that you know you have a
front end client and you have a back-end
server and then you have a database so
whenever you have your clients or your
customers interacting with your web
server it would it would be would be
interacting with the client okay
the client of your thing a front-end
client so the data that they pass over
there right whatever actions they
perform or whatever requests they make
that would go to the client sorry that
would go to the server and the server
would you know do the necessary function
so it would have to sometimes need to
fetch the data from the database so in
that case it would fetch the data and
provide a response or sometimes it might
have to do various other function so the
actual functionality would be done by
the server and the displaying part would
be done by the client and the actual
data would be stored inside the database
so that's how the food sack application
works it's combination of for these
three services the front-end client a
back-end server and a database and
that's what I'm gonna use right so if I
want to have these three services then I
would have to create three different
containers right so I have container
number one which I can use for body B
which would be my database half
container number two which I can use for
my back in server I'm going to use
Express and node.js in combination and
the third service that I'm gonna use is
my front end client okay so I'm gonna
use angular for that purpose now I'll be
hosting these three services inside
these three containers and each of these
three containers would be kind be built
from their respective docker files ok as
you can see there's docker file one
daughter file - and docker file 3 now in
the same way that I explained in the
previous slide we have a docker file
should build the image first and then
that would be spun into a container the
same process follows here also ok it's
just that for each of these containers
separately we would be built if we would
be using a docker file and each of these
darker files would be called you know
one after the other with the help of our
docker compose file
so compose is what is the key term that
you need to note here and the compose
file is it's a Yaman file basically okay
yet another markup language and in the
ml file you fire you specify the
location where your doc file is present
and then you also specify the port
numbers that container needs to use to
interact with the other container okay
and at times if you have a database in
place you might also have to specify the
link of the database server and the
database need to be connected so for
that purpose you do that so that's how
the docker compose works and that's the
overview that I've given you right three
containers you know built from three
docker files which would be called by
the docker compose file which is a yamen
file and there you go you will have web
application hosting that's up and
running all right so I hope the slide is
clear and I hope everyone here has got
Gordon what I wanted to put forward to
you all and for those of you who still
have a slight bit of doubt over what I
mean APIs and what exactly I mean Zach
application does I'm gonna give you a
brief over here okay so I mean is
nothing but a full stack application
that that involves the combination of
these four technologies angular and
node.js and Express and MooMoo dB okay
so the three services that my mean suck
application involves are primarily they
are the front-end client the backend web
server and the database so this is the
same thing that I explained a couple of
minutes earlier but since you have a
pictorial representation I hope this can
now you can relate to this better right
and my friend and client is going to be
my angler and the backend server would
be node.js and Express and database is
going to be MongoDB okay so you guys
should have any problems now and these
three services would be hosted
separately in the three different
containers okay and that would be built
from my docker compose file so that's
what I'm going to do now now let's see
how to container eyes and deploy a mean
app by using docker compose great so
first of all let me open my virtual
machine so guys can you please confirm
if you cannot see my screen my virtual
machine here can you give me a
confirmation guys
okay great so first of all I have my
tumblr and I want to show you my project
okay so this is my main stack app is the
folder where I have my project present
so what you can see there is one angular
app folder which is basically containing
all the codes of my of forma for my
client for the front-end this is the
backend server where all my codes are
present again and this is the compose
file which I've written and this docker
compose file is what is going to do all
the work for us ok its really simple
work and one thing you might notice here
is that I don't have a docker file for
my MongoDB right so I mentioned earlier
that I would be using a docker file for
creating without container but in this
case I don't really need to do that ok
so a docker file is a little complicated
procedure but for my database I don't
need to build something from scratch and
I don't need something customized so I
can just simply use an existing MongoDB
image which is there on the docker hub I
can use that and link that with my
back-end server so that's why I don't
have that but instead have directly
called that MongoDB image over here okay
so this is the yamen file and if you
guys are watching this video at later
point of time you can also relate and
you can understand what I've specified
here because I've mentioned the in
comments I've mentioned what each every
line does ok so it'd be helpful for you
people do come back and have a look at
this later if you are having any problem
but in the meanwhile let me explain each
line here so in the first line we are
saying the version to be used is 3.0 ok
so you have to install a version of
docker compose separately and dr. HTML
anyways be there right and you have to
download a version of docker compose
which matches your docker engine version
ok because certain versions of compose
is not compatible with certain versions
of engine so you have to just look up
the right version and I am using version
3.0 of compos and I have version 1.1 six
of my docker engine ok so just make make
note of that and yeah you wanna specify
the version that's gonna be your first
line and after that you simply specify
the different services that you want to
run ok you the command the keyword
falada is our services and you give a
corner and you specify
the three different container names okay
and each of these containers will
contain the actual services so in case
of my angler there's gonna be the name
of my container number one right and
here I'm saying build this container
from the docker image that is present in
this particular folder in this
particular path okay
similarly Express is the name of the
second container and I'm asking it to
build this container from the docker
file that's present in this particular
path Express so in case of my MongoDB
image I'm creating the container with
the name of database and I'm not giving
a talk of file here I'm just saying
pull the image from the docker hub okay
so it would use a image that is the
Mongo image with the latest tag and it
would use that okay so let me just
quickly go to my folder and show you
where the raca files are present so this
is the angular app now since my compost
file is your from my compost file this
is the pathway my talk a file will be
present right so this is that docker
file so let me just open this doc file
and keep it here and similarly you can
if I could just go back there's Xpress
server folder right so this is the code
where my codes for server side is
present and my daugher file for that is
present over here so now coming back to
my Yama file after specifying the path
of each of these docker files specifying
the port numbers on which they should be
running inside my you know where the
port mapping how the port mapping
happens so whatever application you're
hosting inside the docker container
right that would be hosted in one
particular port number of your docker
you have to map it to one of your port
numbers of your local host machine if
you want to see the UI if you want to
interact with your web browser then you
have to map it with the particular port
number okay so I said this is going to
be the local machine port number on
which it would be visible and this is
the port number on docker where the
application is going to be running okay
similarly for Xpress its 3000 : 3000 and
from ODB it's 2 7 0 1 7 : two seven zero
one seven so each of these port numbers
are default for these applications okay
so I haven't done much of
deal over here let me just since I've
explained the yamen file in a decent
fashion okay there's one more thing left
there is links okay
now this line if you see I'm linking my
server site to my database okay now
since I have a database where it needs
to fetch data from on a regular basis we
have to give the keyword links with a
colon and just specify the container
name so that's why my third container is
going to be the MongoDB container it's
gonna have the container name of
database and I'm linking that over here
alright so it's pretty simple and now
that I have explained each of these
Campos files it's time I explain the
docker files so this is the first jakka
file which I created for my front-end
and it's very similar to the docker file
that I use for my previous session if
you people remember if any of you are
aware there in that session you might
realize that first of all I'm using our
from command to pull the node image okay
with the version six I'm doing this from
the block Rob and inside this image I am
creating a new directory okay main
directory is the Linux command that you
use I'm doing that with the PFLAG I'm
creating this path okay so I'm using the
PFLAG so that I'm creating the entire
path the parent path also slash user
slash SRC okay so I'm creating this
folder inside my docker image and I'm
changing the working directory to the
newly created folder or a newly created
path okay project path and what we need
to do is we have to copy all your
dependencies you have to copy all your
power or your project codes and all
these things right so that's what I
mentioned when I was delivering the
slides all your project codes or your
applications codes the dependencies
libraries will all be packaged together
so that's what we are doing here am
first thing copy the package or JSON
file to the project path okay now if you
can let me just show you the package of
yousuf right so this is the packet or
Dusen file first of all I'm copying this
one inside my docker container docker
image now that's because this file is
the most important file which has
details about which version of
dependencies are needed for your code so
for my angular code which is
present over here but if all my Angela
code would be present in SRC / app path
so whatever I would need the versions of
that dependencies would be have to would
have to be mentioned in the package or
decent file okay so I'm copying this
file inside my cut image first and after
I copy it I am running an NPM cache
clean command okay so NPM stands for
node package manager it manages your
application here and caching is on this
am I'm just removing the cache or it's
not a very important command but the
important commanders NPM install so when
you give the NPM install command what
this does is it would first of all look
for the package.json file okay the NPM
which is node package manager would look
for the package dot JSON file and
whatever versions of dependencies are
mentioned inside it those would be
downloaded okay and they would be
present inside a new folder called nodes
underscore modules okay so that would be
created and it would have to be moved to
this particular path inside your it
should be moved inside your dock remains
right so that command is what I am doing
next so after downloading the node
underscore modules all the actual
dependencies that along with the actual
project codes so those also am copying
by giving the dot command here okay so
when I say dot whatever is present in
the host machine everything in that
particular path would be copied to my
docker container path of this and then
I'm simply doing an expose photo double
zero indicating the fact that I want
this container to have an open port at
this photo double zero okay and the same
for double 0 is what I am using over
here since photo 0 is where angler is
hosted I am mapping that to my host
machines port of photo double 0 okay
this I do in the yamen file but anyways
when I specify the port number where
it's running I can simply do a NPM start
command ok and when you run an NPM start
it's you're signing a node package
manager but would straightaway look for
your codes so your codes would be
present inside the SRC folder okay
you have another folder called app so it
would look for everything here and
whatever
it would start executing them and yeah
that's how of course the dependencies
would be present inside the same image
so your application would be
successfully hosted in that way okay and
similarly going to the third docker or
second docker file this is for creating
the the server-side okay and if you can
notice there's not much of a difference
so the almost every step is the same
except for me exposing the port number
here so I'm saying my server would be
hosted at port number 3,000 of my docker
container okay and the second I'm
mapping in the ML file to the host
machine port number 3000 okay so that's
the only difference this is the only
difference in both the docker files and
now that I've also mentioned where these
files are present inside my ml file I
can simply execute this docker compose
file to have my so what we are having
but to have my service hosted so the
command for that is let me check where
am i right now
okay home slash it rekha I'm going to CD
to the folder and here we have the same
set of files and photos right so this is
the file that we want to execute and the
command to execute the docker compose
file is darker - compose space up okay
there's a very simple command and your
docker file would basically be executed
as you can see it's starting the angular
1 container database 1 container and the
server-side container great so guys this
is going to take a minute and I would
suggest that if you guys have any doubt
so far do drop them in the chat box cuz
I would have a minute look at your
questions let's just wait for our for
three of a source to get hosted all
right
you
okay the ng Labs well the development
server is listening on localhost for
double zero great this is the this is
indication of my client side
you
okay so it says webpack compiled
successfully that's great my web
services hosted now what I can do is I
can open my web browser here and go to
those particular port numbers and see if
my service is up and running so if you
remember my client is hosted at pod
number 400 double zero right so that's
it
enter I can either give local host or I
can come 0.0.0.0 either of that will do
and as you can see my angular client is
up and ready and my app is simply about
having a forum page okay so I can add
details here my first name last name
phone number ADL's and I can just click
on add to get the details and that
digits would go to my database so that
it's a very simple application which we
have created and similarly you can
verify if the client if the server is
running by going to the port number
where it was hosted and you can recall
this was the port ahmed was hosted on
phobar great so this was the
authentication that I needed and
localhost two seven zero one seven is
when MongoDB is hosted so from over to
be container we get a message like this
it looks like you are trying to access
MongoDB over HTTP on the native driver
port and if you get this message it
means your continuous operating very
good all right so we can just test our
web application by giving the name video
okay so the first name let me say I'm
gonna give my own name I'm going to save
pardon
all right last name I'll go badness
phone number I can just give a random
number you're okay and if I say add this
data would go into my database that's my
MongoDB container all right great
so it shows that already I have these
radials present okay so I have this one
record and now this record has been
added
okay now let's verify that by making an
API call now I've only explained the
client aspect the source head aspect is
something that I don't explain right you
guys might you guys should know by now
that the client will take the request
from the sorry the server would take the
request from the client and query on
that right
if it if there's a you know if there is
if there's a request to access the
database then it would fetch it from the
database and respond to the client so
let's do that now this of course is the
UI that I created which shows my
database but anyways to verify if the
same thing has gone into my database
actually we can do that by going to the
server here and going to this particular
URL okay there's a /tph slash contacts
right so this is basically a API call
that my server is making and at this URL
@ / EP / contacts it can view what data
is present inside my container so it's
it says that the first record that is
present is this one it has an ID of this
which was generated automatically and of
course the first name last name and the
phone number was what was given okay and
this was now this was the record that I
created recently and as you can see when
this is present so if you want a little
it won't appear on a little bit you can
do that and let me just do that by
deleting one of these records okay
I'm going to delete the first record and
now if I just go back and refresh this
page you can see that the first record
is gone okay so we have this version we
have NS and the phone number now that's
because we deleted that from the reader
base itself and I made a call from my
server from a client sorry so I hit a
delete button from my client that quest
went to my server first and the server
would indirectly go to the database and
delete that particular record and since
I did a /ap slash contacts i since i
refresh this this would return whatever
is present in the database so it's
that's what is visible here right so
currently this is the only record that
is present in my container in my did
MongoDB database right so that's what's
missing here and similarly these are
just two functionalities I showed you
there are a couple of more
functionalities and you know that we can
do with this image you can retrieve one
particular record if you want to you can
do all these things ok and this is just
my application you can come up with your
own customizations you can
your application in your own way correct
and you can do all these and of course I
cannot go into depth like on teach you
in detail what what different parts of
this application is but instead I can
point you to one of the videos which is
you know you drink a video which has a
company tutorial on how to create a mean
stack application okay
so let me just give you the link of that
video and some time but before that I
just want to quickly show you that this
was the Express server page and again we
have the packet or diesel failure the
app got juice which is basically the
entry point into my server and in this
app load J's file we would have details
about what API is there what functions
function calls can be made and whenever
that particular function call is made by
the client then it would be routed to
this route dot J's file inside the
routes folder okay so the definition of
those functionalities would be present
here so whatever actions needs to be
performed when clicked on that the rules
would be specified here so that's how
the server communicates with the reader
base and forth right so that's how it
works
and yeah that's the explanation of both
the mean stack the company explanation
right the angular app and the Express
server so now that I've explained
everything here let me just quickly go
to the go to the video that I was
talking about right the tutorial about a
main stack application so if you just
ugh youtube means a cat or a car you'll
get this video okay I mean Zach
application tutorial and this is a very
good video and it explains everything
that you need to know about a means like
application on how to create one okay
you can get started with creating one
and especially for those aspiring to be
front-end web developers right those are
starting to be full stack developers
it's mass watch video right it's a
brilliant video I suggest you watch this
video and you can throw in your comments
if you have any problems okay but
anyways getting back to my session
that's it from my side this is what I
showed you have shown you how to add and
delete records and I'll show you
time that the reader gets database gets
updated right so that's the end of my
demonstration and that brings us to the
