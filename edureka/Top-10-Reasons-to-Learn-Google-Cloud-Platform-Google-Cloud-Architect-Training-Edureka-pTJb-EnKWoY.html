Eureka and in today's session I'll be
talking about the top ten reasons to
learn the Google cloud platform so
starting at number 10 we have simplicity
now Google has made setting up an
account and using the Google cloud
services very easy just by creating a
Google account you can access the whole
Google cloud platform now if you already
have a Google account which I think most
of you might be having just go to
cloud.google.com and tap on the try for
free button and you'll have the freedom
to choose any of the services of the
Google cloud platform there are no
upfront costs required to use these
services you get a $300 worth credit
which you can use over a time period of
12 months now for startups it's
beneficial to work play around and get
to know the Google cloud platform
services before investing heavily in it
as they provide $100,000 worth credit
for startups and $500 in credit for
developers as well
coming up to reason number nine we have
variety and versatility so once you get
started on the Google cloud platform
there are tools for everyone and for
everything in the IT industry now you
can use all these products for
development like the developers console
web UI and the command-line interface
tools to work for the command-line be it
the Windows Mac or the Linux environment
now you also have the option to use the
restful api is now Google has its own
set of manage API is that can be used in
different application for different
purposes now needless to say that these
API are very easy to work with coming up
to reason number 8 we have the Google
cloud which is the G cloud the Qi card
is basically the set of Google services
that can be integrated with one another
to create applications and run websites
now they are very easy to work with you
can use them separately as well as
together for different types of
applications according to your needs
now Hookah stands out when compared to
other cloud providers here as they
specialized in modularity now can use
these different pieces of the Google
cloud into various products and you can
mix and match these pieces according to
your requirements
the Act number seven we have the
flexibility so custom machine types is a
feature of Google compute engine that
lets you easily create a machine type
customized to your needs with custom
machine types you can create virtual
machines with the optimal aunt of CPU
and after amount of memory required for
your workloads now you can create a
machine type with as little as one
virtual CPU to as much as 64 virtual
CPUs with compute engine you are getting
infrastructure as a service and with App
Engine you getting platform as a service
all under one roof of Google Cloud now
the flexibility of the compute and the
App Engine allows to create a fully
managed customizable machine which can
be scaled up or down according to the
traffic it receives or according to iron
requirements so we can say that they are
breaking down the barriers of the
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service by bringing them together all
along making things simpler for us as
well
now coming to number six we have the Big
Data machine learning and the artificial
intelligence services a cool cloud
platform provides fully managed data
warehousing facility with batch and
stream processing along with added
Hadoop as specific configurations
now GCP has an IOT specific intelligent
platform that unlocks business insights
from your global device Network Google
clouds artificial intelligence provides
modern machine learning services with
pre-teen models and a service to
generate your own tailored models as
well the neural net based machine
learning service has better training
performance and increased accuracy as
compared to other large-scale deep
learning system and with the
introduction of tensorflow
everything we do on the machine learning
engine is taken up to a whole another
level their services are fast scalable
and very easy to use now major google
applications use cloud machine learning
including the photos we have image
search the Google F which is the voice
search we have translate and inbox reply
which is the smart reply
now coming up to reason number five we
have storage and database option now
Google Cloud Storage is a set of various
tourist services offered by Google for
different domains scenarios it allows
worldwide storage and retrieval of any
amount of data at any time they can use
this cloud storage services for a range
of scenarios including serving website
content storing data for archival and
disaster recovery or distributing glass
data objects to users via direct
download now here we have so many
options like the cloud sequel the cloud
BigTable cloud datastore persistent disk
cloud bigquery and there are many other
more options the cloud sequel is used
for my sequel and Posey is equal
BigTable is used for scalable no sequel
databases our data stores is the
document oriented database as a service
persistent disk is a high-performance
block storage which is very suitable for
the virtual machines and the container
storage now bigquery is Google's fully
managed low cost analytics data
warehouse so you can see here that
Google has mastered this storage domain
and no one can defeat them here
now reason number four
is pricing this is another domain where
Google is way ahead than other cloud
providers they have no offer and cost
required to set up an account or use
these services they also provide lots of
free credits to explore these services
on an average it is sixty percent
cheaper as compared to the other cloud
providers plus if you use the services
for a longer period of time Google also
provides discounts the billing is done
on a per second basis which is how a
cloud service should work now finally
the most amazing feature is the price
calculator which you can use to find out
the estimate of the services that you
are going to use so that they aren't any
shocking bills or invoices later so
coming down to the top three reasons at
number three we have scalability you can
easily scale up or down your machines
depending upon your requirements
everything is made simpler by google
plus the Google viens are auto scalable
they have auto scalar which scales up or
down your instances according to the
traffic it receives all along saving
money for you and making tasks simpler
as well now this is really a cool
feature as it decreases the overhead and
also the engagement effort required for
this job
at number 2 we have the certifications
now Google provides lots of
certifications that are very important
and very useful if you are looking for a
good certification in the cloud
department they provide four types of
cloud certification which are the
professional flower architect the
professional data engineer the g-suit
administrator and the g-suit now these
certifications are very good for people
who are working in the cloud industry
apart from these certifications they
also provide the Google qualified
developer certifications so in order to
get certified you need to clear these
four exams which are the app engine exam
the cloud storage exam the compute
engine exam now clearing all these exams
will certainly provide you with an upper
hand over the others while applying for
a job anywhere now coming down to our
top reason come on it's Google we all
know how big is the database of Gmail
YouTube and the Google search and I
don't think in the recent years who a
server has ever gone down it is one of
the biggest company in the world and the
world wide network is phenomenal you get
everything you expect from Google its
reliability scalability the
infrastructure and lots more
you get everything under one roof and
managing services is really really easy
you can think of it as working alongside
the world leaders in innovation and
technology so as I mentioned earlier
they are so cost effective and reliable
and also their server list which means
you do not need to manage the servers
everything is taken care of by Google
and most importantly being a little new
to this cloud market the annual growth
rate are off charts already it is over
100 percent now you can also relate it
to the amount of services provided by
Google forest or multi male uses which
is YouTube the Google Mail the Google
Drive we have maps sheets translates
hangouts and the list goes on and on so
you're not worried about the quality of
the services provided by Google so guys
I hope these reasons are enough for you
to get started with the Google
platform and I'm sure you guys will
start working on it as soon as possible
thank you I hope you have enjoyed
