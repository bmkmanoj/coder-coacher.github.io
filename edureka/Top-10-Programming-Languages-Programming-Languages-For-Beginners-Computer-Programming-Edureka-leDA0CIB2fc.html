I'm going to talk about top ten
programming languages let me move it
very clear that this list is based on my
opinion only and they are entitled to
have a completely different opinion so
if you don't have a different opinion
and let me know about your list in the
comment section below now I will be
starting things off with the programming
language that is built on my list and
then I would gradually disinterment
number one week so let us get started in
end of this list is so Swift is an
object-oriented and block structured
programming language it has taken huge
strides in the last couple of years
Apple is moving from Objective C to suit
and there are millions for it should use
a better readability and it is faster of
the TV on the other hand has had issues
with apps crashing constantly since
fifth grade she manipulates extrinsic
data it is less error-prone another
important feature of Swift is dynamic
library these can be linked to shift
applications directly and since they're
uploaded directly to the memory there is
application size and improve performance
right we'll talk about its applications
Swift was basically designed to work on
cocuwa and go forwards framework and the
develop mainly for Mac watch TV and iOS
applications that is my application
development is at its center so if you
wanna learn a programming language that
would help you with application
development Swift is a very good option
as far as the rankings are concerned you
can see that it's lacks any go on get up
but that is understandable it has been
only three years that this programming
language was introduced and I am surfer
rankings will change in near future so
all in all it's a very good programming
language and it takes
exporting my list moving further with
the list ninth on my list is Ruby it is
an object-oriented functional and
reflective programming language it has
dynamic badge system one of its best
features is this syntax it is very
readable and very English way that is a
ruby it's very easy to learn it also has
a package manager quality items
it lets you install or remove software
independently if your talk about which
frameworks it has quite a few frameworks
the
Ninomiya Sinatra real in itself is a gym
to be honest this brings in the modular
of course when it comes to web
development and that is what is so
popular if you talk about its
applications it's used almost everywhere
and they're very good applications where
you cannot use ruby it's used in web
development scripting application
development and so on now if you talk
about its ranking it's fairly stable it
finds itself a fixed position when you
talk about getter rankings or pushes and
also for the positives but I understand
that it's community has been down in
recent times a little bit that X nothing
electron bluey all in all a very good
programming language moving for the
eight on this list
C C++ and it is an object-oriented and
generic programming language one of its
key strengths is software infrastructure
now when they power some of the biggest
end domestic ones in the market it would
always give you high performance it is
highly portable and it has a very rich
function battery is mostly used for
software development already games it's
famous for building Vegas to dmpd games
if you talk about it still works
it has frameworks and updates with its
which is a cross-platform geo advocate
and it also has a variable every record
is Boost one of the important features
of this programming languages it was
used to conceptualize the first
distributed blockchain that is it was
used to build surface core base map you
know what is Bitcoin you'd understand
what an important role C++ has made in
developing it and I aside the rankings
attention it's gotta be very important
programming languages and it's going to
say that for a long time
seventh on this list is a programming
language that might suffice with you
it's a now these days data center
analytics help build the talking points
and it's very difficult to imagine
analytics without that one important
reason for it is statistical computing
now is very strong when it comes to
statistical computing it has very simple
syntax and it is very easy to learn and
it has great graphical capabilities that
is right over powering some of the other
tools in analytical market like we have
sass we have Python which are very good
but is very good when it comes to
graphical capabilities as silent
immediate users concerned it is mostly
used for statistics and analytics and it
has recently founded smaller and it is
understandable analytics market is doing
very well these days and is a very good
tool for analytics
it uses an idea called as our studio
using which you can type all kinds of
our programs you can do analytics you
can do visualization you can do machine
learning and so many other things as
well as the rankings are concerned these
rankings are going to improve with time
because analytics is also you have to
stay and with that a programming
language would also say it powers some
of the biggest search engine from the
market and Google to uses it for its
analytics so it finds seventh spot in my
list next on this list is one of my
favorite languages it is scallop it is a
hi-low programming language it is thirst
efficient and it is very effective it is
a multiplier in programming language and
it is known for its concurrency it is
faster than Java and there are reasons
why it is fast it is this a multi-core
architecture and the number of course
used if they increase it gets faster
another reason for it being faster is it
has a very concise or I should say it
has a very nice syntax and great
vocabulary and that is what makes it
faster it was actually designed it and
gave the streamlined object-oriented
coding if you talk about its
applications it's used in various
applications its use for web development
it's used for distributed systems its
use application development as well and
it has various frameworks it has a craft
space character we play and most of
these are popular again pinnacle in
particular them known for the
concurrency Finnegan is used to build
content servers and that is a very good
feature as far as the guitar banking
attention it is fairly low but these
rankings will also improve because Scala
is variable programming language and it
is making its mark in the programming
code moving for the fifth on this list
is PHP
it's primarily design for web
development it is a general-purpose
programming language and it is used
widely it's not quite server-side
scripting and it's very easy to deploy
as well if you talk about ease of
learning it is very easy to learn yeah
this can be a problem at times because
what these easy to learn programming
languages do is they let people get away
with sloppy code that may not be good
always but all in all it's available
programming language and it is very easy
to learn it's mostly useful development
and web applications it has powerful
frameworks like a PHP code ignitor and
as well now coding matter is a must when
it comes to learning MVC now that is
highly respected and it's very popular
for algorithm as far as its applications
are concerned it's mostly used for
developing ecommerce websites because
confusing ecommerce applications or
websites at a very low cost and in very
less time the name of you we have
Magento we have Zen craft as far as its
popularity is concerned it's loved by
many and get a ranking speak for its
fifth place there because it has so many
repositories and pushes on get a better
so all in all it's a very good
programming language moving further with
the list we have C sharp or C hash on
this leaf and it is that even death and
thousand programming language it was
build by Microsoft under its dotnet
initiative
it's again an object-oriented
programming language and it lets you
write a reusable code it has a very rich
functionality as far as its applications
are concerned it is very widely used
it's used in web development it is used
for ad that is rapid application
development it's used on client side and
server side as well as far as its
frameworks are consent for examining and
dotted they speak for themselves they're
very popular and they used by many
people it powers one of the famous game
engine that is Unity game engine and it
is used to develop various 2d and 3d
games so all in all it's available
programming language and the fact that
Microsoft has made it open-source now it
has become more popular I'm sure that
more people are going to use it
you may see it rank higher in coming
years now third on this list is a
programming language that many love its
Java
just cannot deny the fact how popular
this programming languages
it's a general-purpose programming
language and it is small parts rich API
and this cross-platform that means the
core that is written once you can elect
code on almost any platform it is
multi-paradigm and it's highly
concurrent and that makes it very
flexible it has a very healthy job
market and it is understandable it is
used very widely and it is used in
almost every application that is there
talking about it here's the result it's
used everywhere it's integral
development its entire application
development suicide planned site
programming it's into game development
it's into mobile applications every risk
to talk about it's free works it has
popular frameworks like stretch we have
given it which are very popular and it's
a very wide uses the game now it is a
mainstream programming language and it's
useful almost all the fortune 500
companies as AI has its Giza rankings
are concerned it sits at a very tough
question that is at second position and
the reason is simple it has a huge
community and there are a lot of
repositories and pushes on get up so it
takes third spot in my list and to be
honest a very or almost no reasons to
put it low on this list but the other
2/9 datatype it had an edge in recent
times so second of my list is Python I
have been using Python recently and I am
in love with this programming language
it is an open-source programming
language and the best thing about it is
it is very easy to use and very easy to
learn as it I already mentioned that
when programming language this are easy
they can be a problem but as far as
python is concerned it actually takes
programming to a very new level it is
very English like and it's syntax is
very easy and you can do so much with
very less code that is why many people
are using Python these days and it is
getting more and more popular with the
advent or the addition of new libraries
to its use as far as applications are
concerned it is to all like use almost
everywhere and it's there in application
development is there in scripting web
development and yes even in analytics it
has other counterparts all
predators like our and SAS which are
very popular but times to advent of
luxuries like we have find as we have
number and that has led to growth of
Python and analytics market as well and
it has become very popular there as far
as its frameworks are concerned we have
mass we have Django and they are very
popular general itself are as you said
Django is very known as well as their
beloved difficult an answer Vita banging
second set it's almost there there in
the cream and you would always find it
in the top list as far as Python is
concerned it is here to stay and give us
the fact or the progress which it is
making in recent times this programming
language is going to get more popular as
or a key and enter finds second spot in
my list
now it is time to move to a top mistake
or to my Kokomo speakership first on my
list is dour flute and it has to be here
it is popularly known as the language of
the web and there is a reason for it it
is very difficult to find a web page
that does not have JavaScript on it and
hence it is rightly quite as the
language of the world it is also one of
the most sort of the skills in recent
times and that is why we find a lot of
job opportunities in JavaScript you this
even if we check the recent records the
job postings for JavaScript having
proven last one year or two it is also
known for mobile development because
more than 50% of mobile applications to
have the a script in them and with its
newer versions like es6 and ESL its
popularity is raising immediate use well
as I mentioned it's used everywhere is
there a web development it's there in
plain sight server-side its use on
servers robotics video games databases
mobile applications almost everywhere
and it has very powerful frameworks
which are popular on their own say for
example angularjs the end days they just
speak for themselves they're so popular
as Jeter rankings are concerned it
leaves out the programming language
being behind them it has so many
repositories and position get-ups so yes
it takes the population as far as
mileage this concern now as I've
mentioned it at the start that this is
my opinion only you people are entitled
to have a different opinion all together
and as far as I am concerned all of the
top-flight programming languages are
there there and they are very good and
it is very difficult to pick at all
amongst them so all I can say is it all
depends on your perspective what are you
using those programming languages for
and what suits your leave all of these
programming languages are winners in my
friends and I have ranked them as per my
opinion I hope you are like my video do
let me know how you create how this
video was and let me know about it in
the comment section below if you do have
me a list then leave that list in the
comment section below so others can also
take a look at it that is from my thank
