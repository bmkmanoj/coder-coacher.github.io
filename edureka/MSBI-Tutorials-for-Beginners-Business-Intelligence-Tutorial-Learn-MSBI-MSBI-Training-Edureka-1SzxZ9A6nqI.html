for msbi tutorial I hope that all of you
can hear me and see my screen thank you
for responding so shall we get started
with a tutorial for msbi all right so
let us get started and see what we have
in a plate for our hemisphere tutorial
today
so the agenda for today is why business
intelligence why do we need this
what is BA what we mean by business
intelligence what are the BI tools are
available in the market why should we
use Microsoft bi what is Microsoft bi we
will then look into the architectures of
the micro bi what are the different
tools and utilities available in
Microsoft bi and we'll have a demo on
the complete Microsoft bi soon so let's
get started why business intelligence
this is the question of the our so let's
take a look why do we need business
intelligence you see some of the issues
that we faced over time is that we have
large amount of data in front of us
which is scattered across the sources
because you see if you're working in a
data warehouse or in a data related
environment there are lot of data that
those comes from different sources and
all these sources are different external
sources so for a scenario you can see
that if you work in an organization if
you are working in a project all this
data comes from different sources like
Oracle like they can come from flat
files they can come from Excel and all
these Thetas are skated like flat files
can have a different set of data
Oracle source can have a different set
of data dealings poorly documented what
happens in this data since their raw
data they are not well documented so if
you try to analyze those data you will
have a tough time to do that monitor the
dynamics of the changing trains in a
live business scenario every day the
scenario is changing so if you have to
be you know have an edge on top of the
peers you have to monitor the situation
how it's going through in insights from
the data or predict the future only once
if you can analyze your data then you
can take business decisions and you can
do the predictive analysis how your
business is going to take shape going
forward so all these scenarios gets you
the field why do you need business
intelligence because you have to analyze
the data once you have problems and you
use business intelligence and you have
the solution to do your business one
step further let's take a look what is
business intelligence actually
business intelligence it's a process
that transform your data into
information or knowledge using a
computer-based technique that enables
user to take effective decision based on
facts so you see you have your data
coming from different sources raw data
which you have to analyze on top of
those data you perform your knowledge
analysis you gain the information then
you can make your business decisions so
that your business will take a leap
forward but how do you get started with
bi it's very simple you can start in
five simple steps first identify the
problems or the opportunities that you
have what is the problem that is making
you take this decision gather the
required data whatever data you can
gather gather all then no data is enough
explore the alternatives once you've
gathered your data try to exclude the
alternatives what you can do what are
the alternative options those are
available for you try to gather those
then analyze your data and perform QA
operation once you have got your data in
source analyze those data once your
analysis is complete QA perform quality
and assurance on that and once that is
done you can finalize a here this is a
chain now let's talk about some BI tools
but before I talk about some BI tools
just I'm going to have a quick check are
we clear with the concepts of BI or do I
have any questions all right thank you
guys for responding so now let's take a
look into some BI tools so if you go
into the market you will find a lot of
BI tools available in front of you you
have Oracle bi you have SP Bo you have
large analytics you have tableau
MicroStrategy QlikView everything is
there in front of you but out of which
which bi tool is actually going to suit
you which is the thing that's going to
take your business forward
Microsoft bi maestro business
intelligence is the tool that we will be
talking about here
we will also explain why we are talking
about Microsoft be Ike what advantage
does it hold our over its peers look
into that why Microsoft bi msbi is more
responsive to the dynamic business
trends if you do any kind of business
analysis mspi is the most responsive one
to any business trends its support for
historical data and summarized data
it supports large amount of data if
you're working in a data warehouse you
can perform historical analysis and
summarize the data it eliminates the
instinctive or declining decisions if
you working in a business if you are the
decision maker you cannot take a
decision based on your instinct or that
you have to take business decisions
based on an analysis and that has been
done by some tool it minimizes the error
prone manual work if you're doing
anything manual it's bound to give you
some epic because humans are built in
that way so that's why if you work with
a tool you're reducing the manual work
error mechanism it supports very rich
advanced analysis SSIS SSAS or SSRS
these are the three components of mspi
if you use these components it supports
a very advanced level of analysis and
then finally you can make effective
decisions based on your analysis so this
is a Gartner 2006 take Magic Quadrant so
if you look at this one the x axis we
have the completeness of vision and in
the y axis we have the ability to
execute if you look into this chart this
is gotten up there one of the leaders in
market research analysis according to
their result set in 2016 February
Microsoft is a leader in both
completeness of vision and ability to
execute so we have only tableau and
click view but still if you look into
that Microsoft is a big leap ahead apart
from all of their peers to see all the
other companies all the other products
they are lying in a different quadrant
Microsoft is leading the chart when it
comes to PII and analysis so let's take
a look into
but MSB is different with other tools
let's take a look into this example we
have three different systems we have a
Microsoft System which consists of
sequel server we have Oracle system
pl/sql and IBM's db2 the total cost of
just this error is $25,000 for IBM and
Microsoft product for Oracle is $40,000
let's see what on top of we require for
our BI analysis we now talking to the
onset of manageability so if the
manageability comes in the picture
if you're using an Oracle system or an
IBM system you have to do a lot of
manageability for that first you do
partitioning for Oracle system that will
include more $10,000 you diagnose the
Oracle system another $50,000 you tune
the database $3,000 more same thing for
the IBM systems if you don't performance
monitoring at a performance improvement
$10,000 for but in case of our Microsoft
sequel server everything is included now
let's see what else can we do now you
have finally got your database setup
everything done you want to do bi so
what's going to happen in case of Oracle
and IBM you have to again go for another
suit because Oracle only comes with
their own database no other tools
included same case on IBM also they have
given you only their database if you
want to perform any bi activity you have
to go for other tools so Oracle if you
go for bi bundle twenty thousand dollars
more you want to do data mining on that
more twenty thousand dollars
if you want to do OLAP if you want to
perform a cube related operation again
twenty thousand dollars in things for
IBM cube $20,000 more db2 warehouse 75
thousand dollars more db2 cube services
db2 OLAP services 31 thousand dollars
more but in case of Microsoft SQL Server
everything comes included you don't have
to do anything
high availability if you want to use
availability the always-on availability
it's a property of the sequel server by
default it comes with it you just have
to enable it and you're always on but in
case of Oracle you have
use data guard which is pretty expensive
stands at $115,000 if you want to use
IBM's always availability you have to
use recovery expert which stands at ten
thousand dollars so the cost you can see
it's piling up multi-core by default
sequel servers supports multi code if
you want to use multiple cores in sequel
server you're free to do that that comes
part of the sequel server installation
but in case of Oracle
it's toots another one hundred and
sixteen to two hundred thirty two
thousand dollars for IBM it's 160
$265,000 so you see the cost is again
building up going on and on and on the
cost is building up so you can see in
this slide what is the difference why
people will go for Microsoft sequel
server over an Oracle TV or an IBM db2
the cost is huge for other places but in
case of Microsoft SQL Server you're
getting the same functionality sometimes
more functionality more features
robustness scalability everything and a
very competitive price so that's why MSV
FAS has gained a lot of market share
over the time this is the salary
composition when it comes to BI
professionals and other professionals so
if you see a data scientist
the average salary will be around in the
range of 120 thousand if you talk about
the be a manager it comes around one
hundred five thousand if you talk about
the data architect it comes around one
hundred thousand so you see people who
are working with data you just talk
about the lower quadrant of the chart
data analyst 62 thousand bi analyst 71
thousand and this is not something that
we are made up this is a national
average salary from class store so there
are a lot of advantages if you work in
bi now let's talk about what is
Microsoft bi so before I move to
Microsoft bi do I have any questions
from a previous slide all right you are
getting a question how is Mike Strobl
different from Tangier okay so W it's
another organization they make a
reporting tool so tableau supports
reporting but in case of Microsoft bi we
have a complete suit it starts from
detail analytics and reporting so you
see tableau has only one product to
offer in case of msbi we have a complete
suit is that hell alright do I have any
other questions from anybody or shall we
proceed all right people are cleared so
let's proceed then now let's talk about
what is Microsoft pa Microsoft bi and we
call it as M s VI acronym it stands for
Microsoft business intelligence this is
a very powerful suit which composed of
tools which help you in providing best
solutions for business intelligence and
data mining queries this tool uses
visual studio along with sequel server
so you see when you install sequel
server you get Microsoft bi suit as part
of a sequel server installation you
don't have to buy a separate license for
MSBA okay now how it differs from a
traditional process why are you
emphasizing so much on MSBA so you see
what happens in the traditionals process
is that we have data scattered across
all the networks but in case of msbi
we can manage the data it is a
traditional process we don't insure the
ROI which is the return on investment
but if you use msbi
you can perform business analytics and
it's very high on return of investments
in traditional process is we don't
interpret the raw data we don't have a
mechanism to interpret the raw data if
you're working in a traditional process
if you're not using bi you don't have a
process how you can interpret the raw
data which is coming from different
sources but if you're using a bi tool
especially mspi you can discover the
data you can use machine learning and
take business decisions now again if you
have a traditional system where there is
no bi it's very difficult to share and
understand what kind of data you're
working on what will be a business
decision but if you're using
mspi you can visualize the data and you
can prove from reporting on the data so
that the business users will have a
clear visibility and they can take the
business decisions so tools and utility
so what are the tools and utilities
those are available in MSP R so we have
three different components in msbi we
have sequel server integration services
sequel server analysis services and
sequel server reporting services so if
we talk about msbi at a core what
happens is you have sequel server at the
heart on top of it you have the ETL tool
extraction transformation and load that
tool is called a sequel server
integration services from which you can
perform eat a loaf addition once your
ETL operation is complete your data is
loaded into a sequel server you want to
perform analysis right so in that case
you will leverage sequel server analysis
services on which you can make your
cubes and analyze the data so once your
analysis is complete of the data you use
sequel server reporting services it
helps you in creating reports and share
it across the board people who are
required to use the report let's look at
- V architecture how the architecture of
hemisphere is distributed this is how
your MSP architecture is distributed if
you come here at the bottom on trend we
have all our external data sources you
see here Oracle can be an Oracle source
can be a flat file source can be a
sequel server source so once your data
source is there you use SSIDs or sequel
server integration services to load your
data into your data warehouse so your
data waves can be sequel server can be
anything else
so emphasize supports multiple data
sources it does not depend on you can
have only one kind of data source you
can have multiple data sources and it
supports in performing that eat a la
position so ETL and the names of this
you can extract the data transform the
data and then load the data so there are
lot of transformations which are
available in SSIS so once your data is
loaded into a sequel server you want to
analyze how you do that using sequel
server analysis services you create your
Kube and it has all the analyzed data
now one should analysis
is complete final step will be the
reports because if you're making any
business situations the best way to
visualize anything is creating a report
use sequel server reporting services you
have your reports created now in case of
reports it's very flexible and very
powerful you can have reports in Excel
you can have your reports in power bi
you can have your teleports in
SharePoint all these things so getting a
question what is accu okay so whenever
you create your sequel server analysis
services project you don't use you
sequel server database data you create a
cube in the analysis services project
which holds all the pre aggregated data
which you require for your analysis so
this is a different concept in normally
databases we have our DBMS those are
relational data but when you analyze the
data you need the performance of the
analysis right so in sequence level
analysis services cube we have data
stored in multi-dimensional way so
that's a different way of representing
your data why we represent in a tube
because it's base after than a
traditional DBMS system because all the
data here are pre calculated that's part
of cube does that make sense
we will have a demo on this and I can
explain more on that all right so now
once your data is analyzed and you
created your report you can publish your
reports you can create dashboards and
you can publish the report with the
whole team who are required that
performance is also available in SSRS
right let's see what else can we do now
let's talk about a little bit of SSIS
excercises stands for sequel server
integration services this is the tool
that helps in performing the e-tail
operation before I move into SSI is just
one I have a quick check are we all
clear with the concepts or any questions
alright we are clear so let's take a
look what SSIS can perform why SSIS so
see whenever you're a business developer
whenever your business manager you have
this question coming into mind how to
process the data into a warehouse how to
migrate the applications how to manage
the sequel server objects and other
updates
so the ice kinds of question bug you how
can you build your data warehouse
how will you process your data your data
is coming from external different
sources how can you build it in loaded
into a data warehouse if you have to
migrate an application how can I do that
if you want to manage a sequence of
objects how can I do that in this case
the only thing that helps you is that if
you can only get integration services
all these problems can be solved using
sequel server integration services so
sequin server integration services or
better known as SSIS is a component of
our sequence of a database software that
performs and you can be used in a broad
range of data integration and data
transformation tasks so you can
integrate your data as well as you can
transform your data integration means
merging of data from different stores
that is it can be from fat files it can
be from Excel it can be from SP or kill
anything
SSIS supports all these different data
sources so you ingest your data from
there based on your business requirement
you transform the data now what do I
mean by transforming the data it can be
a simple data conversion may be your
source data is coming as a string you to
load it in your data warehouse in a date
format you can perform that what else
can you do in the transformation you can
perform business logic also if you want
to you know use a CD slowly changing
dimension you can do that what do I mean
I slowly changing dimension this is a
concept of data warehouse what happens
here is that you want to perform an
historical analysis you want to keep a
history data so you can perform that all
these functionalities are available SSIS
ok so what is data transformation it
combines the data residing in different
sources and provides users with an
unified view of this data so you see
data might be coming from external
different sources different different
sources you can have any unified view of
all these external data sources
workflow it can also be used to automate
maintenance of sequels of database and
update to multi-dimensional analytical
data
you see here from SSIS you can perform
sequel servers related jobs also so if
you want to backup a database if you
want to clear an index on a sequence of
a database these options are also
available from here on top of it what we
can do if you want to use something from
an analysis services perspective that's
also possible you can call an sss cube
you can process that you can perform
other things also from SSIS so this is
how an SSIS looks internally so you have
your operational data which is coming
from different sources you perform the
ETL operations on top of your
operational data and then you load it
into your data warehouse this is how you
can perform a tail operation using SSIS
so what is an odious or an operational
data an operational data store or ODS is
a database designed to integrate data
from multiple sources for additional
operation of the data it is not
something different from a database it
is a database but it's designed in a
different approach this is the place
where most of the data used in current
operation is housed before it's
transferred to the data warehouse for
longest term for storage or archiving so
what happens whenever you loading the
data from different external sources if
they're sending a raw data so what
happens we keep a dump of the data into
an odious system so that we don't lose
it
because your external sources can be
lost if you're using a flat file those
sax cells can be deleted if you use an
oracle table the table can be truncated
so what will happen to your raw data
obviously if you are loading into a data
warehouse you're keeping historical data
but what happens if you want to take
something on your raw data we keep a
dump in the system called as ODS ok so
let's take a look how the ETL process
works so getting a question wouldn't
there be inconsistencies
if we combine data from different
sources yes that is a good question so
that can happen so if you're saying that
if we have three different systems where
data is coming if we try to combine them
there can be in consistencies but it all
depends you know how the business wants
to perform the logic and how your data
warehouse is created in a general
scenario obviously we will not try to
combine data from different you know
different group so maybe one data is
coming from account one date is coming
from customer we don't want to group
them but in a large system what happens
same kind of data comes from different
vendors so if you let's say that it's a
banking application in a banking
application customer related information
comes from different different system
but if you want to keep it in a unified
list we use this process to unify the
data and keep it so there is obviously
we have to keep grouping of the same
kind of data but yes in that scenario
when different sources send you the data
you unify it and load it into a data
warehouse does that help so one more
question I am getting where is odious
located so odious as I said it's a
logical representation of a physical
database so depends on the design or the
modeling of your data warehouse widdy's
will be there in sequel server once you
load your data from different sources
into a dump that will be loaded into
odious okay that help answer the
question all right great so let's see
how an ETL process works
ETL as the name suggests extract
transform and load it the process of
extracting the data from various sources
transforming this data to meet your
requirement and then loading into a
target data warehouse so you see we have
all these different sources coming
we have XML source we have COBOL we have
flash file database everything you
transform the data apply your business
logic and then finally load it into your
data warehouse so this is the process
that we use in ETL okay now while
playing as data warehouse data warehouse
what is the data warehouse so in this
slide you will have an understanding the
difference between your operational data
and a data warehouse so operational data
is some
thing that is loaded every day so let's
talk about a business scenario so we can
have a better understanding let's talk
about a banking system whenever you go
and swipe your card you get a text that
this much of amount has been david from
your account so in getting a question
what are the transformations available
in exercises just give me a sec I will
have a demo on exercises how to explain
what are the different types of
transformations available necessary is
that fine all right
so just explaining let's talk about a
banking scenario you swipe your card and
you get a text immediately this much of
amount has been evicted from your
account so what happens in do scenario
the banks keep a track of your account
and this into your data they get the
data updated India systems immediately
and the send you a text those kinds of
things happen in an operational data
source or known as OLTP online
transactional processing now being you a
customer you have been associated with
the bank for let's say 10 past years so
what will happen they will not have your
history data yes of course they will
have that so if you perform any
transactions over a month that depends
on a scenario where you want to load
your data into your history OLAP systems
can be a week can be a month data can be
three months data in this scenario let's
say that the bank loads the data from
their OLTP systems to their Ola
the data warehouse every month so every
month after every month whatever
transactions you have done based on your
account they will load it into their
OLAP systems so that they can have and
history for you and how do they do that
by using extraction transformation and
load may be the history data does not
require all may be they don't require
all the hourly related activity they
need a summarized data they can do that
using ETL they load it into their data
warehouse and finally they create their
tubes those are bullet cubes now once
your cube is created you perform your
analysis it is then you send your data
to the business user so you see banks
we'll give you different kinds of
scenario if you take this kinds of loan
you will have this much of attractive
inter-district how do they do that is
that they have their historical data
they analyze that and they perform the
BI one question that I got here is how
is data warehouse different from our
normal database so physically they are
both sequence our databases logically if
you say that data modeling will be
different for an LTP system and an OLAP
system so welding systems normally will
be very normalized because they will
have transactional data but OLAP systems
since they will have historical data you
have to perform analysis we have to
write a lot of queries so those systems
will be denormalized there are different
kinds of systems that you can make if
you want to created OLAP cubes then your
data warehouse must be in
multi-dimensional model but in case of a
will TP system your data base can be an
ID BMS is a relational model so there
are fundamental differences between OLTP
and OLAP systems but physically they're
both sequel server databases there that
help
alright let's proceed let's see what
else can we do
talk about an exercise package what is
an SSI package what all things it has so
an exercise package comes consists of
mainly two parts the control flow and
the data flow now inside the control
flow we have our control flow elements
we have our connections we have other
things and data flow we have all our
data related activities so if you want
to perform any operation which deals
with data if you want to do that you use
it a flow apart from that we have
connections what are connections these
are nothing but your connection managers
whenever you creating a connection to
any source or destination you have to
create a connection so let's for an
example you are using an oracle DB as a
source and sequel server as a
destination so you have to connect to
that oracle source and sequel server
destination so in those case we use
connection managers to set a connection
between your source and destinations
these other drivers which come default
part of SSIS installation so you don't
have to do anything you know difficult
to get it corrected but if of course
SSIS is flexible if you want to use any
different sources which are not natively
available from SSIS you can invoke that
and connect to them control elements
data flow elements I just talked about
apart from that you have other things
like it event handlers variables
parameters and configurations even
unless world is this main event handlers
talks about what happens if something
happens in your package any kinds of
event that is fired for an example you
running your package and maybe because
of some scenario your package failed so
how will you get to know if it's running
from you know a live system from a
production environment you set up some
event handlers what will happen if your
package phase SSIS package will trigger
an event and it will let other people
know that the package has failed now
don't get confused and don't think that
even handler only works for failures it
works on numerous other occasions also
so reading question can be connected to
cloud source okay
starting with sequel server 2016 Nexus
is 2016 Michael
soft has enabled connection to the cloud
so you can connect to Microsoft Azure
systems and you can use them as source
data okay
does that help all right what else we
have we have variables we have
parameters and configurations let's talk
about configurations first so if you
have developed your package in a dev
system and if you want to deploy it into
some different systems obviously that's
going to happen because if you have
developed it in your dev - package will
eventually be deployed into production
or a live system so how things will
change for an example if you're using a
flat file source to load it into a
database your flat file source will be
coming from somewhere which is your
local Drive but in production
environment the path will be different
right the server that you are using to
load your data and perform your
development that server is your dev
server in production that server is
definitely going to change so how will
you let the SSIS package know that when
you will be deployed in production
change all these things
use for figurations this will tell the
SSIS package on which environment which
will be the value which will be the
value for the shared path for the flag
file which will be the value to connect
to the server which will do the value to
connect to the database all these things
you can look into and both one figure in
the package and it will be taken at the
runtime variables and parameters what
happens in SSIS if you want to perform
something using values which are coming
at runtime so you can use variables and
parameters and you can pass the values
and perform operations on that ok let's
see what else we have before we go into
SSS I just want to have a quick check
are we all clear
do we have any questions on exercise or
we can get started and see a demo on SAS
how is this is works all right how about
others are we good so now let's take a
look how SSIS words
how it works is that you have to have
your sequel server and Visual Studio
installed so once you have your sequel
server installed go to Microsoft sequel
server 2014 then you will have an option
called as sequel server data tools for
Visual Studio 2013 so what are the tools
that we require you require sequel
server and you require Visual Studio so
in our demo we are using sequel server
2014 and Visual Studio 2013 so open this
this opens up a window of Visual Studio
how you can create your MSP a project is
go to file go to new good project so
this opens a new project window if you
go here in the left hand side you see
business intelligence this gives you the
option to create what are the project
that you want to create do you want to
use analysis services integration
services or reporting services you see
you have all these options so in our
case we are creating an integration
services project so let's create an
integration services project now let's
try to save it somewhere here let's go
here and save it in the demo part select
this folder let's name the solution as
SSIS project this is flexible if you
want to name this on anything you are
free to name this click on OK
so now SSIS is opened
what other things can you see here let's
try to explain one by one let's start
with this this is called as the solution
exploded this is the main part of your
SSI solution you have your solution name
you have your project name you have your
parameters what are the connections that
you will be using in your package and by
default it creates a default package for
this package for DTS 6 this is the
solution extruder part if you come here
this is the SSIS toolbox what are the
tools these are called as tasks in
exercise world what are the different
tasks that you can use in SSIS you see
here we have plethora of tasks a lot of
tasks available here if you want to use
an SDP task if you want to connect to an
FTP system if you want to send a file if
you want to download a file you can use
FTP tasks if you want to execute an SQL
task connect it into a database you can
use that this is the tasks window so you
can use all these kinds of tasks
now you remember we were talking about
sequence of a performance task right you
see here we can perform CDC change data
capture we can use execute sequel server
agent job so you can run a job from here
if you want to string a database if you
want to reorganize and index if you want
to backup a database all these things
are available from here so these things
are there toward you to use this is our
SAS tool box looks like this is our
package the base of a package currently
we don't have anything in here so that
is why this is looking at glad this is
our package if you come down here we
have our control flow then we have a
data flow so this window is actually
called as a control show what we can do
here this actually tells the SSIS
package which path to follow which will
be the flow if you execute your package
this is your data flow where all your
data related activity happens now just
keep a look at the left hand side what
all tasks we have here I am clicking on
data flow task you see all this tasks
let me show you again control flow we
have all these tasks data flow all the
tasks are changed what it means is that
if you're in the control flow if you
want your SSIS to Europe let the
internet package know that which path to
follow these other tasks which will it
help you to do that if you go inside the
data flow what's going to happen is that
these other tasks which help you in
either creating a source or destination
or transformation okay if you go to
parameters you can set your parameters
which will act as your variables and you
can perform operations on top of it
event handlers as I was explaining what
will happen in case any a that happens
on your package you can perform an even
handling operation here if you go to
package Explorer this will tell you what
are the things which are there in your
package what are the things these are
your system level variables okay this is
how an SSIS package looks and feels like
are we clear with this as a second shall
we go ahead and create a new exercise
package and explain any question Scylla
alright so let's try to create an
exercise package and let's see how an
exercise package works so what I'm going
to do is I am going to load a strat file
this flux I'll into a sequel table okay
this sack file has is an employee ID we
have the employee name and the
department okay
we will try to load this flag file into
a sequel server data warehouse and we'll
see how best can we load it and what are
the things we can perform here so let's
create let me pull up the sequel server
magical studio
right let it open up and I'm connecting
to localhost
let's connect there let me create I have
already created a database okay so let
me try to load the data okay let's see
do I have any tables so let me create
good one you query and let the create a
table so that we can store the data is
it opening in a different window all
right so it's opening a different window
fine on an issue please connect here
okay so we have a database a sample
database for this msbi so we are going
to create a table here so if you see
here this is how much slack file looks
like so I have created my table same
like that we have an employee ID which
is an integer type employee name which
is a worker and we have a department
this is also an integer okay so let us
create the table
so we have created a table and currently
it's coming as blank all right so let's
go back to our SSIS package and let's
see how we can do that so let me explain
what the business scenario we are going
to do here so what we're going to do
here maybe this is a live system in this
system what is happening is that you are
a developer your task is check if the
file is present so what happens this
file is an external file which comes
from an external vendor they are
responsible to send you this file and
you being a developer your task is to
process this file transform this file
use the transformation and load it into
a data warehouse so there is an SLA that
the file will be coming every day at 7
a.m. in the morning so what you have to
do when your SSI this package will run
you have your SSI is package scheduled
to be run at 7 a.m. in the morning
you're in size package we'll take a look
if the file is present or not there can
be a scenario where the vendor has
missed to send the file so you have to
check if the file is present or not if
the file is not present then you should
stop execution of your SSI package if
the file is present then you should load
it ok that's we're trying to do here now
once your execution is complete you have
to archive the file because next day the
same file is going to come with the
updated data right so let us create a
folder called archive here and after the
processing is complete we have to move
this file from our source folder to the
archive folder and let's see how we can
do that using a slice so the scenario is
clear what we are trying to do we will
check if the file is present the vendor
has send the file if the file is present
we will load the file if the file is not
present we will stop the package
execution once the file is loaded into
our data warehouse using transformations
we will archive the file so that next
day again the first set of file can
arrive this is something what we are
trying to achieve
using SAS are we clear with the
requirements alright so let's go ahead
and let's see how we can do that
so first thing what I said I have to
check if the file is present in not if
you go to the census is good works I
don't see any native task which you know
looks and feels like can be check if the
file present or not
so in that case Microsoft has given you
the flexibility to use script just drag
this script task this is how you work in
SSIS let me delete this whichever task
you want to use just drag it and work on
it so if you look at the script ask what
it does is that double-click on this it
has option which language you want to
use do you want to see chart or do your
Deus VB you are free to use the choice
of your language okay so let's say that
we are using C sharp and to check if the
file is present in the path or not now I
am starting that we have variables in
write in package so how we can use
variable saves right click on the
highest package click on this variables
so let me create two variables B file
path the data type of this variable is
string okay let me create one more
variable B file name this will also be
of string now what will you a value for
my V file path this will be the value
for my V Piper why because here only my
source file is and what will be the name
for my file name this will be the name
for my file ok let me copy this
this will be the name okay
okay so Neely's asking are these two
only scripting languages supported yes
in SSIS you are to use either C sharp or
VB these are the only two languages
which is supported in SSIS okay alright
so we have created our variables well we
have our file path and the filename now
let us double click on the script I'll
be creating my script using c-sharp
ok click on this read-only variables ok
click on here you see here we have our
system level variables which you can use
and we have a user table variables also
so let's select the user level variables
why am i selecting is because I will be
creating this to check if my file is
present or not right click on OK click
on OK
but we have to check one more thing is
my file is present we have to proceed
this is a data flow task this tag this
yes ok what happens in your data flow
task you will be actually performing the
data load operation okay so my logic is
that if my file is present then I should
execute the data flow task light you see
this green color arrow drag this and
connect it here now you see this is a
unidirectional atom it's starting from
the strip tasks and going to the data
flow task which means is that first you
script task is going to run this green
means is that if it's successful it is
going to pass the control to your data
flow task ok
is how this word and this is called
enough incidence concision okay so I
have to execute a data flow task based
on the script asked if the script task
is successful right in the script ask
what I'm going to do I am going to check
if the file exists or not after the data
flow task is successful if the data is
loaded successfully I will archive a
task how will i authorize a task I will
come to that in just a sec so I have to
send you know somewhere somehow I have
to send an information to the data flow
task to update him if the file is a
present or not right how we can do that
let us take a look how we can do that
let me create one more variable saying
name as the file exists and let me name
it as integer let's go to the task
instead of going to my read-only
variables read only variable means these
are only readable you cannot write on
anything if you go to read write
variable you can use a variable on which
you can write okay let's take this one
and take this one click on OK now go to
this edit script and here actually we
will be writing our script to check if
the file is present or not okay so how
we can change if the file is present or
not let's go here into the name space
this name space is actually all the
header files which contains all the
classes and methods required for the
script a student for see shutaura so in
order for us to work with the files we
have to use a namespace called system
dot IO use this this is a namespace
which contains all the files rated
classes and variable under methods so
let's write here what I'm doing is if
file dot exists
the file exists or not we're in my path
so add this file that exists this
actually takes the complete path okay so
how we can assign the XY as variables
this is the process DTS dot variables
you really named dot value dot to string
this gives me the path right but it
needs the complete path so what we do
here
we're concatenating and what we are
going to do here now we need a final a
because it needs the complete path to
check same thing
DTS variables
dot value dot to string so this code
actually what it does it if the file is
present what I'm going to do I am going
to say that
again we're using the NCAA's variable
so what are essentially saying saying is
that if the file is present this is a
file that exists method it determines
whether the specified file exists so in
the complete path you have to get the
complete path if the file is present set
the value of this variable as one else
what I'm going to do I'm going to say
that set the value of this variable as
zero okay this is the code and writing
for a sanity check just build it so that
we see that everything is fine we'll
succeeded so our code is fine okay
now in the script ask I am checking if
the file is present or not
how will I pass the control if the file
is present double-click on this
precedence constraint go to this
expression and constraint go here and
select it from here all the variables so
I am saying that if the value of this
variable is 1 then only pass the control
that means the file is present right
click on OK now you see we have created
a princess constraint if the value of
this output variable is 1 then only it's
going to pass the control to my data
flow task okay clear on this what we
just did now we'll go to the data flow
task and see how the DFT works
all right so let's go into the data flow
task and let's try to load the data just
W is given in Theta flow task and you
see all these things are here so pull in
this source assistant this L asks you
how what kind of source you want to
create I want to create a flat file
source click on new click on OK where is
my flat side file browse here is my flat
file
if I go to my brows select the flag file
which is on Flag files go to columns and
we see you have a file populated ok
click on OK and you see we have the flat
file source and the connection manager
automatically populated now what are
these tasks these are all the
transformation tasks if you want to use
a lookup if you want to use and will
atiba command all these things are
available Union and union all all these
things so let's say that in our business
requirement what the business want is
that they want to load the data by
sorting the employee ID you see here
this is not sorted they want to sort the
employee ID and load the data ok this is
a business requirement how we can do
that come here you see there is a
transformation called sort again drag it
here create the connection from flag
file the backlink of the sort I think
that's how you want to sort so what by
Bishan see comment is that I want to
sort on employee ID select this how you
want to sort ascending yes I want to
sort on ascending click on OK now you
are not suppose you know you're not
bound to use only one transformation if
your business requires you to use
multiple transformation you can use all
those transformations for our scenario
we just need to use one transformation
we have done that now let me click a
destination assistant we want to load it
into our sequel server click on you
click on OK it's asking me where do you
want to connect I want to connect to
localhost
what is the database that you want to
connect I want to connect to MSB I this
is how you create a connection manager
in SSIS test connection succeeded click
on OK and my connection manager is
already created now what we have to do
we have to load the data right so we
have to create a mapping if you
double-click on here this window opens
where you have to map it to your table
so we map it to our employ table go to
mappings you see automatically SSI is
created the mapping if you want to
change it manually you can change it it
created the mapping click on OK and our
data flow task is done
okay now the third option that I said is
that after my data flow task is done I
want to archive the file right how we
can do that we have a file system task
drag this this file system task actually
helps you in operating with files so
again I am dragging this precedence
constraint here which means is that once
my data flow task completes I want to
pass the control device file system task
double click on this file system task
what is the operation that you want to
perform I want to name my file okay it's
saying that what is your source
connection which is your source file
click on here click on new connection is
it an existing file
yes it's an existing file click on here
select this package sorry select this
file click on ok now cygnus what is the
destination why do you want to keep it
again create a new connection here let's
select that it's an existing folder
because we want to pass a control into
where we want to pass the control into
archive select ok click OK what we're
saying is that select this file and push
it to this folder this is what our
business scenario looks like
are we clear with the business scenario
shall we execute and try to take a look
what how it works all right so let me
execute this package how you execute it
write it click execute package
so you see my script art grant it
successful okay so getting a question in
case of failure how do we know so let me
just run this package and fail it
explicitly so that we get to know okay
what our friend
let me first me my data is loaded
and yes we have loaded the data and see
it's sorted the data also now let meet
my file is archived you see here there
is no file here if I go to my archive it
archives the file ok now let's do a
sanity check if my script is working
fine because now I don't have a file so
if I run this package now you see it did
not pass the control here you see here
so this is how exercise works the script
asked told checked if the file is
present in vs load the data is the
latest loaded successfully archives of
file if the file is not present I don't
want to pass the control the data flow
task itself because what's going to
happen the data flow task is going to
fail so let me show you how it fails
I'm just eliminating this constraint so
what will happen if the file is present
or not it is going to pass the control
to my data flow task if I execute this
package you see my data flow task fade
if I go to this progress bar here it
says that cannot open the data file
employee data dot txt ok this is how if
an error happens you get to see the
error if I go to my data flow task now
you see if failed while creating trying
to open the source ok does that help you
with the errors alright so this is how
we can work in SSIS there are a lot of
other features which are available we
can use it to leverage in our business
needs ok clear on the inside part any
questions or shall we proceed all right
so let's proceed then let's see what
else do we have in our slides
ok let me go to my SSS now so let's look
into the SSH part what we have in
emphasis right let's look into SSS so
once the data is loaded into your data
warehouse the next step that you want to
do this you want to analyze the data
right so how you can analyze the data it
has to be stored in a centralized system
which is your data warehouse we
is divided into data marts now what do I
mean by data Mart data Mart let me give
a realized value if you go to a
supermarket you go in the supermarket
and see that all these supermarket items
are stacked into multiple marks if you
go to the grocery you will find only
grocery if you go to the hardware part
you will find the hardware items you
will not find that some hardware items
are there with the grocery and some
groceries are there with the hardware
they're not mixed up that's how we
organize the data in our data warehouse
also if you have customer related data
those will have only customer related
data so that's a customer data Mart if
you have accounts listed data those will
have only account related data that's in
the account data Mart in creating our
data creating different groups those are
called as data Mart okay now once a data
Mart is created in this a s uses OLAP
components and data mining capabilities
which are a result of a
multi-dimensional structure called cubes
which is precalculus and store complex
aggregations to build mining models okay
here you can use your cube and you can
build your data mining operations now
what is a cube that consists of cubes
are multi-dimensional data sources it
constitutes of dimensions and measures
water dimensions and water measures
dimensions will have the master data
like employee name employer address
geography or pin codes and state names
and all the things those will be part of
your dimension data this is part of your
data modeling which is a multi
dimensional modeling measures will have
the aggregations what do you mean by
aggregations is that they will only have
quantifiable components so for an
example your sales amount for an example
you loan amount all these things will be
there in your measures which you can
quantify and constituting dimensions and
measures you get your cube okay
this is how a tube looks like so let me
show you how to create a cube and how
you can work in a cube okay
so let me explain what we are trying to
do here in sequence server 2014 we have
a sample database called adventureworks
TW 2014 this is a model word database
which is provided by Microsoft free of
cost here if you go to the tables you
have your data stored in two dimensions
and measures fact are nothing but your
measures dimensions are your din tables
so we will leverage the same thing and
we will try to create how a cube looks
like okay same thing we are going to do
here let me close all this because I am
done with my SSIS work again we are
going to go to sequence our data tools
go to the same path file new project but
instead of selecting integration
services we will go to analysis services
and select analysis services
multi-dimensional data mining okay let
me name it as is this is what can be
named it as is a underscore project okay
click on OK and this is the window that
comes here since we don't have any s s
is related things here so this is is
toolbox coming as black let me close
this now means once we have our SS guess
project what are things we can do here
first you have to go to your data source
and create the data source that you want
to connect to right click new data
source this wizard opens in this wizard
it tells you which is the data source
that you want to connect click on new
here is saying what is the server that
you want to connect localhost what is
the database that you want to connect
adventureworks GW 2014 test connection
succeeded click on OK click on next how
do you want to connect there are
different options let's select the
service account click on next click on
finish this is a name that is asking so
let us keep this name for the time being
keep us finish now we have the data
source created called as DES next thing
is that what we have to do is we have to
our data source views how to do that
click on this click on next
it's saying that which is the data so
that you are do connect to I am saying
that this is my existing data source
connect to my existing data source only
click on next now I have all the tables
which are required for me to perform my
analysis which will tableside acquire
what are the factor bills and water
dimension tables are required so let's
say that for our scenario we want to
perform an analysis where how much was
the sales how much was the internet
sales for some customer for a specific
product so how we can do that select fad
internet sales select dim product and
select Tim customer ok so what I'm
saying is that this is a business
scenario on which how you want to
perform in analyzes my business scenario
saying means that you have to perform an
analysis on for certain products for
certain customers how much was the sales
for a specific period see if you come to
period then we need something you know
something kind of a data so how we can
get the data
let's select something called as dim
date there is my dim date let me just
try to find out here is my dim date
select this so product dim product will
have the product related information dim
customer will have the customer related
information date will give me the date
parameters and fact internet sales this
is a measure this will actually give me
all the information how my sales has
happened click on next it's saying that
these are the tables that you have
selected we want to finish it yes click
on finish and now you see it created my
data source view what are the tables we
have selected now you might be asking
why this kind of picture came what are
these arrows these arrows actually mean
is back how this table is connected to
the other table now when we talk about
this fact tables and dimension tables we
are talking about multi-dimensional
arrays so multi dimensions more
what will happen is that we will have
our data stored in different
organizations fact tables will have our
quantifiable information and dimension
tables will have our property and they
will be connected using a primary key
foreign key relationship this is how a
dimensional model works that's why you
see all these arrows are coming ok this
is how you create your data source and
data source view so what are the
differences between them data source is
actually you're creating a connection to
the server and the database in the data
source view you're actually selecting
the tables which are required all right
now the next and the most important
thing is creating a cube how you create
a cube right click click on new cube
this wizard opens click on next it's
saying that we want to use the existing
tables gives I want to use the existing
tables click on next in saying that for
the major groups which are tables you
want to use this is my measure group so
I will select fact in details click on
next so what are the properties you want
select from the measure group let's
select all these properties click on
next now it's saying what the dimension
tables that you want to use I want to
use steam date correct name customer
correct name product I do not want to
use back table for my dimension so thus
deselect that click on next are these
the properties that you want to select
yes what is the name for your cube this
ok click on finish and now you see we
get our you created ok we get our cue
created all these things are here now
these are the different different
options that you can perform on your
cube to analyze your data ok now what
will happen how you can see this cube
let us try to deploy our cube and let's
see how we can work on this cube just
right click and click on this deploy
switch step knowing it
but successfully let's go back to our
management studio let's connect to our
cube services and let's see how my cube
looks like so this is the tube that we
created go to the data base
you see NSA's project if I scroll this
cube right click on this cube and click
on browse you see we have all our
measures here tach internet sales and we
have all our data related to dementia
years so let's say that if I want to
select the sales amount so let's select
internet sales amount
let's select sales and let's exhale
someone from here and if I want to see
based on which date my date is coming
like this so you see we can select it
here for 2010 let's select one more
customer also here so for this customer
for this date this was a total sales
amount that we can have and now coming
back to a tube if you want to perform
other operations you if you want to
perform any new actions if you want to
perform any aggregations all these
things you can perform from here by
going into the cube and analyzing and
creating you business intelligence here
ok this is how you create your cube you
deploy and you browse your cubes are we
good
any questions all right we are good so
let's go back to a slide and let's see
what else in do we have so now let's
talk about SSRS if the Paris it stands
for sequence of reporting services it is
used to gain insights about the analysis
so now we have analyzed our data right
the final step is creating the reports
submitting a question how does SSIS
differ from DTS didn't transformation
service X ok so let me give you a little
bit of background about how SSIS came
into the picture so sequel server 2000
when we were working with sequence of a
2000 at that time we had data
transformation services known as DTS
with the release of sequel server 2005
assured a new era of ET leur
applications called SSI years
DTS was very much you know feature not
very much feature-rich it had very basic
functionalities in 2005 Microsoft came
up with SSIS that had a lot of feature
compared to DTS DTS whatever things were
not there si has had all on top with
certain more advantageous things so this
is the new way of working with the ETL
this is called as the pesticides and in
2005 going forward they have gradually
added features to SSIS details
development is now completely dead we
have moved to SSIS and this is the kind
of difference between DTS and sis the
battle alright so once we have created
our cubes and we have created our works
and everything how we can work with that
is if we only can create a report so our
business users are going to look into
the reports and they can perform their
analysis they can perform their business
scenarios and they can take the
decisions so reports are something that
is very good for visualization so we can
create our reports using sequence of
your reporting services and we can
publish them in dashboards Excel
sharepoint all these places ok so what
are the difference between reports
scorecards and dashboard to analyze the
data it makes no sense which
visualization so you can create charts
you can create drill down drill through
reports interactive sorts and all these
things you can perform if sequence of a
reporting services if you want to
perform all these things the sequel
server reporting services comes handy
further the back we can deploy the
report over the web for greater
accessibility you can deploy the reports
over the web sequel server touch
function support tag and anybody who has
permission to go they can go and access
that these reports you can publish in
SharePoint also so that if you want to
share it with a complete team they can
go ahead and take a look into the report
okay before we move in let me share take
a look and let me explain how a
reporting services works and how a
report looks like okay so let me pull up
my trusty sequel server data tools and
this time let's create a new project but
this time what we'll be creating
we will be creating a reporting services
okay so let me create a report server
project let me name it as is RS
underscore reports click on OK and this
opens up another window for us what is
saying is that data sources data sets
and report data sources as the name
suggests this is something that you can
connect to your server right click here
add new data source ok where you want to
connect I can connect to all this places
let me connect to sequel server where I
want to connect localhost
what is the database let's connect to
our
msbi vertex connection succeeded click
on ok click on ok now you see we have
our data source created let's go to
reports add new item select a report and
let's create a report so let me name
this as employee underscore report ok
and it opens a new report window ok this
is how you work with her the reported
data all right so you see here in the
report I have data source on the
solution I have data source on the
report I have data set on the solution
also have data set why they are
repeating to answer to that question is
that if you go to the solution they are
called as share data sources and share
dataset share data source and share data
set means whatever data source or data
set that you create here these will be
shared across all the reports in your
solution but if you create it here at
the reports level those will be only for
the reports now you will ask me the
question what is the difference
data source and data set so to answer
that question let me do something in the
report and let me explain so I have
created an here data source you are very
okay to use an embedded data source also
but what's going to happen if you create
a shared data source it will have an
advantage when you deploy this okay so
let me try to create a data source here
I go ahead and create a data source here
I say that use the share data source
reference because I have already have a
share data source select this click on
OK now what is this data set data set
will actually give you the output of the
query so what I'm going to do is we are
we just loaded this table we are going
to select from this table and create a
report based on that okay click on this
data set a data set it saying that do
you want to use a shared data set or an
embedded one I am saying that use an
embedded one what is the data source
that you are using I am using this data
source in this window you can either
write your sequel queries or stored
procedures I am writing my sequel query
just pinch it here very fresh fields go
to the fields and you see we have what
our piece populated ok click on OK now
we have a data source and data set so
data source will actually connect to the
server in the rate of the place and data
set will actually fetch the actual data
for you now once we have our data source
and data set populated how we can
display the report very simple right
click here insert table ok and what are
the things we want to is display we want
to display employee ID we want to
display employee name and we want to
display Department okay and let's first
take a look how this looks like this
report go to this preview
and this is how my report is looking
like okay now this report looks very
dull I don't like it
let's say that I want to do something
let me do one thing let me insert a page
header okay so let me insert a text box
in the page header and let me say that
this report is called as employee report
okay let's say that this is called as
employee report okay and I am saying
that this should come in bold
this should be a little bigger you see
all these things I can do from here okay
now I'm saying that this is not looking
good
let me change something here this is not
looking that great so how I can do that
let me show you how we can do that let's
say that I want this to come in bold
select the whole window make it at board
I say that let me see the background
color as you go to the background color
select this color and the background
color changes okay you see now if I try
to look at the report let's see how my
report looks like I am just removing all
the white spaces if they are there so
remove all the white spaces now if I go
to the preview you see now my report is
looking something like this
now if so the business says that okay so
you see the employee ID is coming as the
right aligned I don't want that I want
to employ area to be left aligned I said
okay how I can do that right click on
this go to the textbox properties go to
the alignment change this to left click
on okay cool preview you see now it's
looking as good now they are saying that
okay so the Department is coming like
this so what we can do see the data is
coming as 1 2 3 5 8 9 it's sorted by
employee ID but how about can be sorted
by Department is that possible my data
is coming from the table which is sorted
from here but a businesses that can be
sorted by Department
I say that okay let's see how we can do
that go to the table properties go to
the sorting add a sort here sort by
Department how a to z click on OK go to
preview and you see now my data is
sorted by my department so you see these
adjust the certain functionalities that
we can perform in SSRS there are a lot
of functionalities more that we can
perform in accessories this is how a
simple report looks like
are you clear with the report
development any questions alright so now
we have done our report we have
developed our report the next thing
would be to deploy the reports right so
that our users can see the reports
correct how we can do that let's go to
the solution Explorer go to the
properties here
so getting a question what are the
different reports we can create in SS
eries okay so that's a very good
question so I have just shown you what
kind of reports we can create we can
create a tabular report this is a
tabular report so let's say that if you
want to create some other report so if I
go here you see we have different types
of reports available if you want to use
at a matrix you can use a matrix if you
want to use a chart let me show you
using a chart so if you click on this
chart it opens all these kinds of
options you have column charts line
charts shape bar area and all links let
me select a column chart click on OK and
it opens a column chart like this
alright so how you can assign the values
here if you go to the values select
let's say I'm selecting employee ID here
let's look in the category groups I am
selecting Department ok this is a simple
chart report so let's try to see how
this chart now looks like if I go to
preview you see along with my employee
ID employee name and Department this is
showing me in a chart ok let's say that
I'm not sure I'm not liking quite that
is his chart title let me name it as
employee chart ok it's saying that axis
title this is actually department
and this axis ideal no this is not
looking good let me Neary name this to
EMP ID all right let's go back in a
preview and you see this is how it looks
like okay looks good alright
okay so let me save this okay now let me
show you how our deployment works okay
so let me do one thing let me go to the
report manager and let me explain what
is report manager so if I go to Internet
Explorer
this is how my report manager looks like
now you will come and ask me what is a
report manager right a report manager is
something where you publish and host Pio
report so let me open the solution
the SSR is one
okay this is how my report man looks
like let me pull up the solution
demo SSRS reports all right we have open
this this is my report manager there is
one more thing called as report server
okay now what are the differences
between report server and report manager
report server is actually the whole
server so when a service gets installed
into a system it installs the report
server what is a report server where the
report our report metadata are going to
be stored report manager is mostly used
by users or let's say some admins to
perform certain activities so this looks
better server is just a plain simple
thing it just hosts everything so what
we are going to do is let's try to
deploy the reports here and see how they
looks like go to the properties of the
report and if you see here is saying
that what is the target data set folder
data source folder report folder and all
these things so if you don't have
anything created here currently it's
black it's saying that the report
manager is going to create all these
things okay but it's asking is what is
the target server URL just be the target
server URL click on OK we'll just hit on
deploy if you hit on deploy it's
deploying all these things soldier
stupid for a sec so
government is complete if I go ahead and
refresh this you see now we have all
these things in our report manager we
have our data sources automatically
created we have our reports
automatically created if I go ahead and
you see it's executing the reports and
it will give the report see in case
report so now you don't have to rely on
your development activities you just
publish your reports and that report
will be published in a web portal that
is your report manager and anybody who
has access can go ahead and stick in the
report okay this is how our SSRS works
all right any questions on SSRS parts
alright so this was a quick overview of
our msbi part how our ssi ESS SS and SS
Alice works and how we can leverage the
power of mspi
to implement our work the BI performance
so that's pretty much that we had for us
today please let me know if you guys
have any questions okay I'm getting
question how is mspi different from
power VA okay so mspi stands for
Microsoft bi this is something that we
just discussed it constitutes of SSIS
essays and SSRS power bi is an online
portal only dedicated for reporting
that's something that Microsoft has come
up with
that's called as power bi but it only
has reporting capabilities it does not
have ETL does not have analytics you can
only create reports using RBA okay all
right
how about others are we all good or do I
have some questions from anybody alright
people are clear and I get some
responses from everybody so that we are
good all right
you guys I hope that I was able to share
some knowledge with you I had a good
time sharing with you I hope that all of
you had a good time thank you all for
