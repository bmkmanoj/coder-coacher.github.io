important in terms of Android
application development which is the
manifest file right it's supposed to
fall talked about the manifest file all
right so what I necessarily mean is that
this particular manifest file that I
have for my application is the file that
contains admitted in of the application
that is information about the
application information about the
information itself right so the manifest
presents essential information about the
application to the Android system it
tells you about the complete application
to the Android system information the
system must have just remember the lines
here all right aleem are says what is
made a dinner I mean it's like when I
say metadata I mean information about
information or say data about data for
example I say I'm having ten activities
all right I'm having all those ten
activities included inside my manifest
so what I'm having is and having data
about all the data that I have inside my
application study manifest can't file
contains the various elements the
attributes the class names in that
values resource values and the string
values let's take a look at the manifest
and they have created the add
application if you go here on to the
manifest or XML first of all I'll let
you all take a look at it here everybody
just give it a good look from top to
bottom all right so what am I having is
it is this schema first of all the
manifest file has got a schema for
Android then we have a package so the
package name is the one that we decided
when we were creating the application
everybody remembers this when we were
creating this application we decided on
the package then the version code
alright so let's take an example I
created my application uploaded it onto
the Google Play now I am creating or
working on another application
version so what is going to happen in
this case well I mean cremate
implementing my version here or not all
right so this is the first version so I
keep it as version one but if I try to
create another installation or say I
want to upload another version of the
application I just mark this version
home code as too so that the Google Play
knows that I have got another update for
this particular apk all right was your
name again
the version and version code and the
version name go side-by-side so the
version code if it is one the version
name will be 1.0 if it is one point if
it is 2 it will be 2.0 something like
that you remember we set ups few
parameters the main SDK version and the
target SDK version when we were creating
this project everybody remembers that so
the main version is API version 8 the
target wasn't is the API version 16
alright Rowell says version name changed
when we have smaller patching I would
see when I would say it when we have
some enhancements done and we have
created another set of a version of the
application
Rahul then it changes then we finally
come to the application tag right then
we come to the application tag what it
says is that the application can be
allowed as a backup to true so whenever
app user for example user what a user
does is he purchases or buys another
form alright when he buys another phone
he tries to use the same gmail account
and this will actually ask for the user
that this application is installed on
your device do you want to have this
application installed on the same device
again all right then why not version 2
at present our Rahul this is the first
version of the application that we have
created so we have Margaret as version 1
if we'll be creating another version of
enhancements and uploading it onto the
google play then we'll be marking the
version as two and the version name has
to consider let me know if this is clear
do you we see some versions as 1.2 so
they are all right there the minor
versions Rahul
they are the minor versions right so
here you will be using one person one
instant right you'll be using one point
one instant so it is like a minor
version and a major version release that
you have to take care of then you see an
application launcher icon the label of
the application what is the application
name so if you see first Android is my
application name this even that applies
to the application we chose a black hole
o light theme so that is what applies to
the complete application now you see an
activity everybody remembers that I
created a single activity inside my
application package can everybody
remember that now see here something
which is very different here what am I
having here I call this intent filters I
call this particular section intent
filters Gousha can you just tell me
about what exactly is the process of
using a public static void main in java
applications why we have a PS vm in
every java application Musha this is a
question for you
everybody can also respond that if
everyone knows about it they can also
give it a try not specific to OSHA
public static void main starts executing
from that method can I call this an
entry point to the application Cuccia
that's correct aleem i know i know you
understand this but i am just asking for
to everyone right so when i say it is
the starting point of the application
similarly I need a single activity to be
shown as the startup of the application
am i right here am I wrong here if I'm
having ten activities in my application
I'll need to have a single activity as
the launcher activity for my application
I'm not right here am I wrong here and
similarly if I say and if I say I have I
need to have multiple activities that
starting points can I think about it
like that
all right so just wanted to tell you all
that whenever I have an active
application wherein I'm having thin
activities all right so I'll be helpful
in just one single intent filter which
contains these following parameters the
reason I was telling you about this is I
need only one intent filter that has to
be associated with an activity right so
you see our intent filter with the named
name and the launcher so let us say I
call an activity in a launcher what I
mean is that this is the first one that
gets launched and also the main one I
hope everybody in stands what is this
intent filter doing here specifying
which activity has to be the launcher
and the main one so this in this
particular manifest file if you all
remember I quoted a point here which
said that this file is the one that is
getting red even before the application
gets installed onto the device get
anybody think about all these from all
these parameters hold on parameters
might be read before the application
file gets installed
you all have access to all the manifest
parameters here can you tell me what all
parameters will be checked up before the
even visible before the installation
what is in this file that might be
checked up before the installation it
all says the version is very good Rowell
that is one of the parts
and he says the OS that's correct the
monastic aversion and the target SDK
version all right let me tell you about
in terms of precedence I would first of
all say check the monastic a version
whether my application supports or say
whether my application has got support
for the OS Dundas and s being installed
on all right I hope everybody
understands what I'm saying here so that
is what is being done here as I said
manifest gets read for the very first
time before even before the installation
and solid wire that's getting done is
just to check the US waters all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
