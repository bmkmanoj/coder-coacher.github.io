files that are available so if you can
see you're alright so we have our other
folders like slash dev and /proc okay so
there you can get to see some other
types of files I will show you now my VM
is starting so there you can get to see
block block files or block device files
we can see other pipes other types of
files as well like pi put files and
character device files like that so
there are different different types of
files in fact every device you know
every device is represented as a file
there is a corresponding configuration
file so while interacting with that
device the corresponding configuration
file has to be modified the
corresponding private file will come
into the picture and that will try to
act on them interface in between the U
and the device itself alright so one
second I'll show you those files so here
itself you can if you can see I hope I'm
audible to everyone can just one of us
can you please confirm ok thank you I
got it alright so here if you can see
there is a long listing of the files
under the directory called slash them ok
so here there are multiple device files
that are being listed here you can see
the file that starts with C there is a
character file alright and you can see
linker finds small L they are length L
files and then you can you can see B
that represents the block points alright
so mostly all your disc related files
are represented as block points all
right and there is another kind of files
called as pipe ends all right so these
pipe piles they act as an interface
between two terminals that
you can assign the message from one
terminal and it gets broadcasted in the
other terminal we'll see that as an
example see most of the time other than
you're normally PI's text files scripts
decreased and then Lincoln points so
these are primarily are the kinds of
files will mostly be working on all
right
so rest of the rest of the file types
are just for the sake of understanding
so if you take device by block device
file so the best example is your desk
related files that handle blocks of data
chunks of data so they have a present in
different notation for this block points
all right when you try to interact with
the disk automatically the corresponding
driver will come into the picture
all right so similarly there are for
every driver for every driver there is a
separate block file associated with them
one second I'll show you an example here
about one of the type of the file called
piped file all right TTY is your
terminal
so just this is a very basic example of
you know I created a 5-foot file for you
testing
okay so if you observe here right so
it's almost like whatever content that
you pass it to this type of file you can
you can observe this splashed in by pipe
I mean I've just given the general pipe
as the notation so so here this is a
pipe put kind of pile all right so this
is the file I created I mean usually we
don't create such kind of piles so there
is a different example altogether here
here what he has done is he has we could
do something called slash the PP might
even that is one kind of it's a
character fight okay so basically
whatever content that you pass it to
these kinds of files what it does is
it's it's like temporary little it will
keep the content and if you try to
access the same thing again from a
different location it will try to give
you all those control so these are like
special kinds of files and then you can
you can see here how it works here from
this terminal when we pass a message to
this character file automatically the
same message will be broadcasted in the
other terminal when you try to access
that okay so these are like this is how
they handle the data they handle the
chunks of data as well meat you can pass
it consider a human you can make this
file as an interface and you can pass it
from 120y to another terminal as well
but mostly we will be making use of
these files but just for your
understanding there are other types of
files
other than normal files we have block
files we have character files we have
piped files and dot okay so these are
some of the examples it's like blob
device files like /dev HD in my system
if I do have this l okay so here slash
though is da one and then you have s da
poo okay so these are block points like
that we can we can see other files so
for every for every device that we
create in our system there is no there
may be a corresponding file that gets
generated okay so whenever we have we
try to save something in the disk that
will be interfaced to this particular
file which will be which will help in
saving the data to the corresponding
index okay here if you see there is
something called slash the MV 0 + MD 1
so these are related to logical volume
that we create in the system alright so
either logical volumes or something here
one one second well I'll just finish and
then I am you - all right so here if you
see there is a concept called LVM
logical volume manager we will see how
to create logical volumes so basically
you can imagine it like a container
alright so so far you have seen that in
Linux there are there are partitions
just like in Windows it is a CD and all
those droids even in Linux we have
partitions so this is the command deff
disk - l is the command is in which you
can see the partitions
okay so here / - SDA one is one
partition and splash them SDA - is
considered as another partition but if
you observe here it is called as linux l
vm so it's a logical volume manager so
you can consider this as a container
that host sub partitions alright
so there is some respect
- the number of partitions that we make
so rather than limiting ourselves to the
number of partitions what we do is so we
create one primary partition and then we
go on with the LVM concept so which
we'll see later when we create a
container inside which we can create n
number of partitions sub partitions okay
so these partitions so these kind of
piles are you know represented a is
empty 0 1 like that okay and then these
are terminals you can you can open in
the UI you can open n number of
terminals and simply type tty command
and see see what see these this list of
terms that get created and another one
called as slash dev slash none usually
this is this is like a black box okay so
we're in even if this is news
applications where whatever output that
comes right parallel you want to save at
some place or you want to completely
delete it from the system
redirecting that output to slash dev
slash null okay we will we'll completely
what is it deleted completely from the
system it's like a black box so what
happens is when when running some
applications the output there are three
kinds of messages that came generated so
standard input standard output and
standard error these are three how do
you say notations that are available so
we usually whatever we give us an input
it is the stdin so when you execute the
command I will give you a quick example
to understand this alright so when we
are running something wait so whatever
output comes when it is displayed to
your screen so that is your standard
output okay and apart from this if there
is an error associated when you execute
a script or a command that is called as
the standard error that comes to the
screen okay so the reason why I'm
talking about please prepare a little
since what happens is when running some
scripts or applications so whatever that
comes to the screen rather than
displaying that output on the screen we
redirect that content to slash develop
so that it is completely lost so there
are two ways so when executing scripts
okay so you might want to log the output
whatever comes
so among that they can be standard
output
there can be standard error has been
alright so you might want to redirect
standard error to a point and whatever
standard output comes that is something
you are already aware of so what you do
do do is you redirect slash there slash
now so that won't be lost
okay so so that is one kind of file okay
so like that we have different different
types of devices available in the system
and regarding /dev sessional usage of
this I will I will show you how you come
up in scripting topic so I will I'll
write a script where and we can see that
the standard output or file we can store
that just like creating blocks would
also redirect the country to slash they
will not hold it so after going through
the files which are present under slash
tab I the next one we will recover is
slash slash proc will come to the slash
diversity of part later so if you
observe /proc you can here and you can
see this on the screen there are lot of
folders particularly marked in blue
right let me tell you I will give you an
example of this so all process related
slash croc stands for process related
points okay so so I'm just I will
explain this command letter what I'm
trying to do number I am trying to
generate I'm trying to list set of
processes in the system and I will show
you the corresponding process IDs
alright so what happens is for every
process there is an Associated process
ID and for every process ID there are
certain parameters okay so those
parameters are present in a text by and
there is a under the slash block which
is the process created directly under
that
under that directory so with so whatever
process ID which is there so it did with
the name of the process ID holder gets
generated the moment you run the process
there is a folder that gets okay I'm
sorry okay so so I'm talking about slash
rock okay - see all this yeah
so under slash provost of stalking about
the folders which are present under the
slash slash rock is the process related
information so if I PS - area and just
this comely stone is the processes you
use go further okay so if you can see
this is the corresponding process ID
that got generated okay so here if you
observe it corresponding to this process
ID there will be a folder okay you can
observe this rate so whatever command
that that we have used it runs as a
process so bash is running as a process
so there will be a corresponding folder
that gets created under slash block and
then that all the parameters are
whatever value is that that represent
that particular process they will be
stored inside that inside this
particular folder okay so this is what I
wanted to show you with respect to slash
all the process clinical information so
how does it get the updated where does
it get stored so this is where it gets
stored the moment you start a process
automatically it gets generated here
yeah so among all these files I just
want to show you the output of this file
/ work
okay so so this particular smile it
defines the limits for that particular
process okay some of the hard limits and
soft limits are present here usually if
he if you are running the particular
application okay so there will be limits
that are being set from that application
the number of files that you can use the
maximum number of files miniature amount
space that you can use like that you
have all the parameter this here say if
you want to you know modify any of those
parameters we need to make the changes
here alright so this is by these spines
are important so this is the one of the
important use case not going deep into
all the other files that are present in
the /ba but how they are get how they
are generated so the moment the process
gets started there will be a folder with
the process ID under slash rock you can
go to the inside that folder you can see
all the parameters depend on the
different different files inside the
inside that folder which is generated
with the process ID okay
if you can see here in this example
slash rock / 1 1 is the body say ID
process ID per unit user the grandparent
of all the users in the system so that
is the example that has been taken here
similarly some of the other files which
are present under slash rock are them in
PO you can see CPU info information
about the memory CPU and on but usually
usually we don't go and check these
files by the information there are some
tools available some commands available
handy so we use post comments but for
the information sake
so we can also open a slash problem info
where we can get to see all the amount
of you know space total memory that has
been allocated in the free space buffers
and not so
so this /proc slash version so the one
we have seen we we can also get this
question using the command we have used
before that is you name space hyphen e
it's the same way same output that you
name gives alright and this is CPU info
okay
so there is another command that I'll
show you that is called as top that
gives the instantaneous you know status
of the processes that are running in
your system it also shows you the memory
information and also the CPU information
so basically this this particular file
say you have dual-core or quad-core CPU
right so all the information about the
CPU will be displayed here the number of
course if you want to quickly check the
number of cores of your system you can
come and open this file and check the
course you can also check using the top
command level I will show you that in
somewhere okay the next one is /proc
/ partitions so let's see that in my
system
okay so if you see here so these are the
partitions as da one is da - alright and
then you have BM 0 DM 1 ok so there is
something called major number and the
minor number here okay so this major
number corresponds to the type of
partition so this is is da partition
alright and among is the the order
starts with 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 alright so it
represents the kind of partition and
then 0 1 to represent the order of the
partitions is da is d1 plus d2 similarly
if you observe here so this is one kind
of partition and among these two
partitions this is zero and if you
create another LVM here it will be DM -
2 and then the major number will remain
the same and the minor number will be 2
for it so here it's just the SD in my
machine there is LVM as well which I've
installed before alright so here some
other files if you see here /proc
scratch success scratch that
ipv4 IP underscore power so under /proc
you would also get to see files
containing parameters which are which
are directly related to kernel okay so
the settings so the set of variables or
the arguments which we can pass directly
to the kernel and make changes during
the runtime alright so these are the
files which are present I mean the files
which are present under the frock so if
you make changes to these points to
change the signs to say for example IP
address the power in the example here so
0 is to enable 1 is to disable all right
so if we make changes here in these
files automatically
we'll get reflected during the runtime
so automatically the current
corresponding functionality would get
enabled or disabled alright so that is
the importance of these points like that
see other examples say we have hostname
parameter here so there is a
configuration file called slash UTC 681
then you can we can also even make the
changes which would be permanent so
there are always two different ways of
making changes to your system temporary
as well as the permanent changes
