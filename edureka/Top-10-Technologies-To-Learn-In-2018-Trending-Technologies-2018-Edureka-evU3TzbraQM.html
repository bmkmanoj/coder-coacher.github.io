Your one stop solution for learning the most trending technologies.
My name is SAURABH, and today I will be discussing
the 10 most trending technologies, that everyone
is talking about and will acquire a huge market
in 2018.
So u can make this as your resolution to master
any one of these in next Year.
So, let's look at what we have first in our
list.
So, let's begin with RPA, &quot;Robotic Process
Automation&quot;.
Generally any test job in any industry involves
tasks, that are repetitive in nature and can
be automated.
RPA or Robotic process Automation allows you
to automate such routine and repetitive tasks,
and RPA can boost the overall productivity
of companies, by saving their time and money
and it has lot of cool features guys.
For example, No coding skills is required,
RPA comes with simple drag and drop tool,
and you can automate any repetitive task without
changing the underline technologies.
RPA technology can be implemented using various
tools.
The top three tools include; UIPATH, BLUEPRISM
and AUTOMATION Anywhere, that you can see
it in the slides as well.
Let's see what we have next?
Now, we are going to talk about INTELLIGENT
APPs, popularly known as I-Apps. I-Apps are
pieces of software written for mobile devices
based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine-
Learning technology, for making the everyday
task easier.
This involves tasks like Organizing, prioritizing
Emails, Scheduling Meetings, Logging Interactions
and content etc, etc.
Some examples would be Chat Bots and Virtual
Assistance that you can see in the slides
as well.
So, let's move forward and see which technology
we are going to discuss next.
Now, it's the time to talk about INTERNET
OF THINGS {IoT}.
As the name suggests IoT is about connecting
different objects in your environment via
Intelligent sensors enabling them to send
and receive data.
This includes everything from your mobile
phones, Refrigerators, Washing machine to
almost everything that you can think of.
With the IoT we can have smart cities with
optimized traffic system, efficient waste
Management and energy use.
So, start thinking of some new excuse for
coming late to office other than traffic guys
IoT is basically a giant network of connected
devices all of which gather and share data
about How they are used, and the Environment
in which they are operating and by doing so,
each of your device will be learning from
the experience of other devices, as humans
do.
IoT is trying to expand the Interdependence
in human, that is, Interact, contribute and
collaborate to things, this is all about IoT.
Let's see what we have next in our list.
Now, we are going to talk about DEVOPS.
Now, before I explain this, let me tell you
Guys, DEVOPS is not a Technology; it is a
Methodology, that ensures, that both the development
and operations go hand-in-hand.
DEVOPS life cycle is picturized as infinite
loop representing Integration of developers
and operations team by Automating Infrastructure,
work flows, and continuously measuring Application
Performance.
It is basically the process of continual Improvement.
So, Why not start with yourself?
You can even see the companies that are using
DEVOPS right now.
We have Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and the
most of the companies out there in the market
are using DEVOPS.
Why are they using DEVOPS?
Because of its Advantages.
It provides you shorter, software development
life- cycles.
The quality of software that is produced is
way better than the previous Waterfall model.
It also gives you, Improved work environment.
There are many DEVOPS tools available in the
market.
The most popular tools are; GIT, JENKINS,
PUPPET, CHEF, DOCKER, ELK and there are many
other many tools as well.
So, let's move forward Guys, this was all
about DEVOPS.
Now, we are going to talk about; ANGULAR and
REACT.
So, these are the most popular Java Script
based frameworks for creating Modern Web applications.
Using REACT and ANGULAR, you can create highly
Modular Web Applications.
So, when I say modular, you don't need to
go through a lot of changes in your code-base
for adding a new feature.
ANGULAR and REACT also allows you to create
native mobile applications with the same Javascript,
CSS and HTML knowledge.
And the best part of ANGULAR and REACT, it
is open source with highly active communities.
Let's see what we have next Guys,
Now we are going to talk about CLOUD COMPUTING,
and I believe a lot of you already know about
it, because it is a buzzword in the IT Industry
right now.
CLOUD COMPUTING is one of the most trending
technology Guys.
This is because it allows companies to save
a lot of money and simplifies the life of
users.
Day-by-day, more and more companies are shifting
their Infrastructure in the Cloud.
What are the reasons for that?
First of all, it is fast and Scalable, it
can be Accessed from anywhere there is no
upfront cost, and it provides better security.
Now there are a lot of cloud provider out
there in the market.
For example, Amazon Web services, Microsoft
Azure, Salesforce, IBM, Goggle, there's even
digital oceans.
There a lot of competition out there in the
market.
But Amazon web services is a clear winner
based in the market share.
Let's see what we are going to discuss next.
Now is a time about BIG-DATA.
Every one of you would have come across the
term BIG-DATA, right?
Big-data has affected the IT landscape beyond
imagination.
BIG-DATA refers to problems, that are associated
with processing and storing different types
of Data.
Most of the companies today rely on BIG-DATA
analytics to gain huge insight about their
customer, product research, Marketing Initiatives
and many more.
For your surprise, BIG-DATA led Germany to
win the world cup as well.
Now, It can be used in various domains, it
can be used in Retail, Insurance, Healthcare,
Banking and Finance and I've listed only four
of those domains guys.
There are many many more domains in which
BIG-DATA finds its importance.
Now, we are going to talk about VIRTUAL REALITY
and AUGMENTED REALITY; Let's discuss VIRTUAL
REALITY first.
VIRTUAL REALITY is when you use ARTIFICAL
Environment, that is created with software
and presented to the user in such a way that
the user suspense belief and accepts it as
a real Environment.
Have you watched the movie MATRIX?
Well, that is what VR does.
VR is a computer Simulated environment that
you can walk around and interact with.
We can see a lot of examples in the slides
as well.
Let's see What is AUGMENTED REALITY?
Now, augmented reality combines Virtual reality
with the real world in the form of a live
video Imagery.
Both of these AR and VR have numerous real-life
Applications.
For example, Medical students use AR Technology
to practice Surgery in a controlled environment.
AR is extensively used in mobile gaming and
Apps, which work on real life video feed,
or games like POKEMON GO Guys, you know that
POKEMON GO, delivered 600 million Dollars
in mobile AR revenue and its first three months
alone.
Imagine the future prospect and if you have
something in your mind, let us know, in the
comment section.
I know the list is becoming quite interesting
Guys, Right?
Let's see what we have next?
,
Now we are going to discuss about BLOCKCHAIN.
So, People who already have invested in BITCOINS,
know, what exactly BLOCKCHAIN is?
BLOCKCHAIN is basically the technology that
runs BITCOIN.
And BITCOIN is world's first digital Cryptocurrency
and that is the future of the economy Guys,
&quot;Crypto Currency&quot;.
So, even if BLOCKCHAIN doesn't exist after
a couple of years, you will have some Cryptocurrency
that is based on BLOCKCHAIN.
So, let's see what is the last technology
that we have in our list.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
But before I begin Guys, let me tell you ARTIFICAL
INTELLIGENCE is not something new alright?
It was first coined in the year 1952 by John McCarthy, But, due to lack of data and computing
power, it wasn't feasible at that time.
But now with the enormous amount of data and
huge computing power, AI is possible and specially
with the advent of technologies like DEEP
LEARNING and MACHINE LEARNING.
Artificial Intelligence is basically creating
intelligent software, making a machine that
is smart, a machine that has the to power
to think, analyze and make decisions based
on the huge amount of Data that we have.
Hence, the phrase goes &quot;Data is the new oil
of 21st century&quot;.
And surely the race among big IT giants to
dominate the field of AI has begun.
Let us know your opinion on different AI Initiatives
and, who do you think will be the winner in
the Comment section below.
So by this, we come to the end of this particular
video.
If you are looking for online structured training
on any of these technologies, you can let
us know in the comments section below, we
will reply you back ASAP with the detailed
course content.
