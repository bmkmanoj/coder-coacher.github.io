initialization
all right yesterday I will
I mean at the end of the session I have
started something about the system
initialization files and then levels and
on so today we will see more about all
this initialization file regarding the
drug okay so so the moment when you
study your system okay so when you power
on your system there are set of
operations that could happen so starting
from by use okay so just having great
understanding of this process is very
important so your system process I mean
this flow that will start from by used
so the moment you switch on you have
something or less than vehicle you start
from BIOS which is your basic input and
output system so what happens is so then
the BIOS process starts it will quickly
check for all the devices that are being
connected your system so CPU looks for
instructions starting at a specific
address which happens to be a BIOS
precise happens and then we have post
power on self test the test BIOS
performs very basic functioning of the
attached hard one that's what this
shaking happens
okay so the next one is the bootloader
so your grub is the brute book load of
impact where the unified bootloader okay
so here there is something called the
specialized software that is installed
to the MDF is your master boot record of
the boot partition with senex and loads
the permanent so so what happens is so
once this is done okay the initial
texting is done the control will be
passed over to the bootloader so you can
you can imagine your disc hard disk over
it is very poor sectors okay and on the
first sector that if still further it
has been split into some other levels
I'm Amanda remember that word I let you
know but it's your first sector on which
here and the other sides alright always
a system when it starts and you
typically first go and check on the
first partition yeah it's the first
partition and the first sector where
your envy other sites Master Boot Record
alright so that is where the BIOS will
transfer the control group so gang gear
will start it will go it will perform X
operation and then what happens is
expecting software installed with an
Liam boot partition are going to a very
small size which salads and loads the
kernel so the next step what happens is
it will load the kernel in fact what
happens is your internal will be loaded
into the van first ok so that is how
there are a couple of sticks involved
during the initialization process so if
you can see here so whatever MBR you are
referring to a drop here so this page
refers to that right this is your drop
peach I will show you the corresponding
configuration and altitude
bergdorf on alright where whatever
content you are seeing here right so all
these information is defined in your
crop
one five all right so the drug is
responsible for the initial foreign
unloading at the boot and it loads the
kernel in Vietnam
all right so then so using there is a
lot of importance to this drop page
impact so we'll see we will come to the
grub page I restart my system and show
you how to come to the blog page so
regarding the levels I have exerted
yesterday but on a level zero to six
okay there is something called run a
level-1 okay so what we can do is we can
restart the system and log into the
wrong level one where we can we can
perform some tasks I'll show you them
okay so using drug administrator can
control okay what kernel is loaded okay
and what options are positive to the
kernel as well as initial ramdisk on to
the region so you if you get a chance we
start your system try to stop here okay
so if you have both windows and linux
installed you dig in there to see this
page where you would see here you fields
in st. OST right what he can lose
fixated he the option here then you will
see the colonel so I hope you're aware
of a structure of the next operating
system kernel is the cool part which is
responsible for handling all the
operations in your system and on top of
the kernel you have your interface and
you have all the applications and the
next year and on please go to that
architecture if possible it will give
you a better understanding as well so
here what happens since here you can see
the colonel agile the RAM disk files
that are displayed here so here it says
that we can select the type of kernel
that we want which means in a single
operating system you can even you can
have two kernels okay so we will see
that later
so say I'm running a specific ocean of
operating system
which wants to assist the colonel and
there is a new release of Colonel okay
if you want to take that colonel what I
can do that and download that colonel
okay and at the time I start my system I
can use third color okay to start the
operating system like that we can we can
download latest version of colonel you
can also try loading that colonel along
with the current operating system like
that we can have multiple Colonels not
available so this is where we can get
its either colonel as we need to define
that each one of you grew up dot-com so
you will see those options so okay so
when you come to this front so here you
can see there are some instructions here
is in which you can I did this had given
this line you will get with the other
options here and you can also pass some
arguments here okay so I will show you
that so once you are good arguments one
of the concurrent you can log into
single user put okay so I would think
less example saying you have forgot your
root password or if you have a single
user in your system that is a big user
you forgot your tooth that's poor
alright so there is no other option but
you need to come to this shrub page
alright and pass an are given to the
grub telling the grub that let me login
to the single user
all right then you will land up without
asking any password you will land up at
a shell from all right has the duty that
you'll have access where you can simply
type and things at your booth password
okay so for now I'll just give you one
example one of the feature where you can
make use of this drug page alright and
once you have reset the root password
you can again restart your system you
can use it the reboot command or you can
go for in it eight six to restart you
can put into your default on level
all right so this is about your drug dot
one fine
so you will get to see to his options
and the rock on
alright so these are the definitions
this is what is the information that you
can see here alright so that is the
version number and you can you can
define the time or blending that means
once the girl web page comes how long
the web page has to wait before
proceeding to the default institution
say you have three operating systems all
right
so always it would be one which is the
department so when you start your system
the default of it OS would get started
to be the windows or you might have
multiple the next questions all right so
we can we can declare those this values
here you have fun you can say that I
want Windows to be my default or the
next to be 94 so it's the order that it
funnels you can also say that I want to
have my have the grub page wait for few
seconds before it starts the default
operating system alright so like that
this is the image of that particular
page currently this is showing a single
operating system this is the version
number and this is the partition that it
is pointing and this is the kernel we
have and then we have something called
in the target image all right see these
options again so the kernel loads and
initializes the device drivers are
loaded and we initialize and the basic
hardware checks at Port 1 all right so
the first process that is created then
during the system initialization is the
the net process so system initialization
process remember in it is considered as
the parent process of all the processors
in the system alright so if you remember
what I said unit you can have multiple
processes in your system and have you
processes associated with the process
like all right given every file will
have a process ID so I just
okay so if you observe here so for the
process I'm just where we have seen the
grip command right so I have used some
some come out here and then followed by
a pipe and then I did a grip
looking for this particular process
called let's connect so this is running
in the system and if you observe here
this particular field e stands for cross
this I need so and the first ideal unit
is one so so this is the first process
that starts in your system this process
is for the bare spot and it will help in
generating the other process okay so in
it it loads the init tab specifying what
the default one level 50 and then
additional configuration files all right
whatever which is there and then drop
your pond all right and we'll follow
that and it starts running all the
specified startup scripts at this point
okay
now I will show you what these startup
scripts are okay so this started stop it
is there I'll explain that later so for
now just remember that as a part of the
initialization process so what happens
in it will try to find all the scripts
that are responsible for starting your
system that means there is a default
wrong level it will try to land you in
that particular one level it will try to
start that system in that one level and
corresponding to that one level there
are a set of scripts that will trigger
all the processes corresponding to that
one level so in general these are all
the processes that are being started
writing it like a little configuration
so each window next always all your GUI
part network services databases if you
have installed etc alright so with this
you're booting process will get finished
all right so this particular in it both
within the UPC folder
files in this directory so I'll show you
all these files as well
we have multiple targets and we'll go
through this part for the configuration
right ok so these are the run levels
that I have shown yesterday so 0 to 6
starting from shutdown simply use it
more so this is where you can do the
Victorian maintenance part this is a
real user may poo is multi-user without
their cooking and GUI and then you have
multi-user fit networking this is what
we will be locking it throttle up in 3
and then you will be easier to get on
level 3 or not 11 fight ok ok then this
is the comment we have seen yesterday
ton level and now put a granny level it
will give you the default run level you
are currently in and there is something
called N and it stands for the previous
run level that means say your run level
5 and what you did is you have done hit
command in its space 3 and you have both
round up to fight ok but it is not your
default under for you then you come back
to run level 5 a game and use this
command it will show you the previous
run level s1 ok so this is how you go
into different levels so all this
information will be present and the PC
that they've tapped by B okay so this is
ok if you can see you sure it is clear
or not so this is an entry where run
level 5 has been given so this is the
default run
okay so the next one is how to service
comer that's a very important one so the
Phillies come and basically helps you to
start and stop different services in
your system start and stop the services
or you can restart the services it also
helps you to reload the services there
are multiple options so so the service
could either be a network related
service or the HTTP service or next
episode it's like five times a protocol
or it could be a DNS of this all
services that are in your system wins
you will see the corresponding command
that would list all the submissions that
are currently installed in that system
okay so every service in order to make
changes to the service you use the
service command this is a quick example
to restarting your network service so
what another will stop the network if it
will try to you know set the IP address
again in this example this is another
service externally it's related to Samba
if you have heard about this service so
if you want to enable access and the
next good having a shared folder so this
is helpful in that so we'll see all
services and the importance yes I will
talk about in it dot deep folder there
is a folder under ATC faulting it dot B
I'm coming to that topic so here another
thing so as I've said we can start and
stop the service using service command
ok so another way of starting and
stopping the services is using this part
ok if you see here
okay annette don'ti okay so these are
all the services that are present in
your system so all the services are
present and they need not be pulled so
the initialization of service that we
have referred depot it we pull all the
services from this folder and it will
start him stop stop the services when
you use the service command
so these network status all right so it
will show the current status when I pull
some other service from the best
okay so these are some of the dependent
services so what we can do is here
just remember this you will see this
rotation and igby
okay I'll be using it with some other
scripts so these stands for Damon okay
so a demon basically runs in the
background so when a particular service
is installed and it is up and running
there will be a level okay
so that will take care of all the
features or anything related to that
particular service and even is
responsible so we would always be either
stopping that vegan or starting then
demon alright so like this we have an
offense Network file system we have
cuffs see ups this this that is your
printing service c-cups deep so most of
the services will be anything with deep
and we have something called 4d is
running now what I will do is quickly
put some operations hungry okay
another important thing this here the
user is who am i users are not allowed
to stop the service but I'm allowed to
check the status of the service
alright so okay so here I'll show you
another thing
a net dot beam alright so here the same
grandi status so there are two different
ways of checking the status there you go
with the service command or do you go
with the /tp field or dig under these
fitness okay
similarly this is not possible to
perform any other operations so normally
weather is not a load to it
hey then this user should have
sufficient privileges with respect to
starting and stopping the services or it
should be a routine all right what is
always it could be
log into the system as a root user I'll
show you how to switch between the users
okay
currently over my and the root user all
right now I'll use
so this first so these from D it's
running stop yes successfully I lose on
the way key to the door D Ronde okay so
the it's the same you can you can do it
as I've said before every are you think
you can do but it is operation in
multiple use okay so you can start and
stop the studies or you can restart the
star restart the service so it will show
you both the things stopping in starting
the service okay yes and you're right
might have a question or all these files
under ATC you get dirty shell scripts
okay now I will tell you how to check I
think I've shown you come on yesterday
there is a command called that's a text
so this command is very helpful we are
not aware of what particular finally you
can use the file command okay
you can also yeah in fact you can
directly open the file the reason why I
have started with the file commanders
there are some binary executables if
which if you start right so there will
be lot of finishes special characters
and all the files are very big and what
it will do is it will you you tend to
lose your prompt it will display all the
special character
so it's better if you Oh test using the
file command and then open the
corresponding trick okay so in it dot d
yes there are shell scripts okay so this
is how we check the status okay so the
particular user should have sufficient
right you know only duty with sudo do
have the access to services and yes this
is a graphical B so anything systemic
manage is the services in the current
one level alright so if you remember if
there are hundred services around you an
example you expert a hundred services
all right
so imagine that there are seven copies
or six copies okay six folders of all
these services okay and every folder it
points to one one level okay so there
are six copies of all the hundred
services that you have installed in your
system and each folder points to one
particular service when you run your
system and Wrangler will find the box
that corresponds to run a level five
they come into the picture
alright so in it what it does is it
which in the B port on eleven and it
will go to the corresponding box it will
check the solutions which are present in
that box
so you you might have enabled some
services and run level five and disabled
at this so what it does is it will read
what services are enabled if you go to
that particular box and then pick them
installed all those services so it will
start all those sentences okay so when
you are in a particular run level when
you use this particular form it will
open all the sad business in that run so
services which I look at the box that
corresponds to that level
okay so here what you can do is take
your ground level file you can run this
command and even know manually select
the services that you want it's
or if you want to modify the services
that belong to other turn levels simply
provide it as an argument then what it
does is it will pull all the services
data point into other run records then
you can even modify them settle business
for other other modification the sense
you can simply enable or disable the
service okay so this is another this is
a graphical way of doing things right
using the GUI then you are run level 5
you can make use of this comment but so
the next topic is how to do it on the
command line so this is the important
part here ok so here now I have randomly
said that there are rising there are 6
boxes and a copy of all these hundred
files is present each every there is
copied in each of these six folders 5 so
I'm sure that there are such folders ok
so these are the ones I please needle up
C 1 C 2 C 3 which correspond to the run
levels so these folders have a copy of
all the finishes that are installed in
your system
ok so what happens is during
initialization when you have specified
account level the initialization process
will you go and fetch the processes
which are present in that particular
directory all right so typically the
content which is present and arceneaux
deep looks like this ok if you observe
closely you can categorize all these
files once that start with key and
others that start with S ok so when you
start your system all these services are
gonna get started so method we should
fear starting with S we will get started
when we start your system and when you
shut down your system all the services
that are starting with him it's like the
same service that starts with SS for
this will automatically it will it will
run always in it we fill the
corresponding services so this is how
the system started
start you can start all this in that
particular run level when we shut down
people pull all these services let me
stop one of the temples this is what you
observe and you shut down you can see
all the processes run off to the
elevator
along with the status you know you can
imagine that internally that service
command is being executed so service
this particular networking stop then
successfully yes it has stopped you you
you would see all the skaters messing
yourself even if a service is has been
shutting down properly it will display
all those countries when you when you
shut down or even when you start your
system okay so this is how the processes
would get started the files in it if you
are exporting to the police facility X
or Cape followed by a two digit number
has mean start the service kafir kill
the service and the two digit number
after XOR K it is denotes the order in
which the services have to be things
with you so there is some priority
husband that is being said okay yeah so
when they're in process in terms of
ever-lovin with the steps are run all of
the things clips in order
let's top as an argument run all of the
scripts in order with started an
argument okay so the next one is if you
look closely here you will see that this
particular directory holds a collection
of symbolic links okay so another new
word here so Lincoln points alright
so based on the color you know we can do
an LS - L on this particular folder and
see take one example
RC very dirty
okay so this is a better view so this
file is linked to some other time okay
this particular file is linked with to
some other file
okay so that is why these files are
termed as Lincoln fines
alright and there are two types of links
so symbolic link soft link and hard
length and that topic will be covered
later okay so for now you can you can
see that this fine sir they could do
some other files okay so the main reason
for this day for that there is only one
copy of each script reducing the chance
that a script change will be reflected
in all the run levels okay so I hope you
have understood the concept here so all
the it's listed to all the services if
there is a single copy hard copy of
these files the configuration files in a
folder and rest of all the boxes that
are present corresponding to the gun
levels so soft links that means like in
Windows just imagine like the shortcut
points that we create okay so when we
install right-click you create a
shortcut on the desktop quickly and
which in turn will figure the service
rate similarly as you met here also
there will be a single copy of the
scripts of the services and the
corresponding link and files are present
in all the boxes so when you run a
particular run level the link and file
will in turn trigger the actual script
okay and the reason for this is just to
ensure that there won't be any okay the
main deal is there will be only a single
copy of each group release you the
chance that a strip change on the drip
picture so in case if someone has broken
little ooh alright so that way you need
to be careful as an administrator so
there is a possibility of such things
happening in the system so so that way
the linked file
you can run scripts directly or use the
service comment to start and stop the
native services okay the next one is chk
convict okay
so this is the command that would help
you to list all the services in your
defense you can start and stop the
services okay you can do all the other
things within this so this command will
modify the configuration chk punted for
a particular service setting into an
order for a particular turn 11
okay I hope now you have a basic
understanding of what our unload list
multiple done little stunning in the
system what happens and here the moment
he'll let's take the existing services
that are already in okay so using fear
to take on config command you can list
all the statistics that are already
installed in our system
okay so chk config - - list let's see
that
okay so I'll just go ahead running these
commands to the to feel good okay so but
normal user should not be able to run
unless they have the permission
statistical weather when you run this
coming if you are a little if you're a
non-believer you may not be able to and
one more thing so one of the features of
Bastion all right
as I've said say unless it's a double
press the tab okay so these are all the
friends endless space if they are Auto
completion feature right so pressing the
tab will finish finish it similarly if
you have not a zero covenant but you
know that I think it starts something
like CH okay I can fix tab twice it
really did we leave me all the commands
present in the system that start with CH
okay if you have already given the
command LS okay mes s then the argument
will be chipped in the current directory
okay
but in the beginning itself I mean the
place where you would provide the
command C or if you want to exclude all
the commands that are present in your
system you can you can chase on anything
X so these are all the commands that
start with this okay similarly yeah you
even try like that okay give one or two
alphabets first double tap it will show
you there are too many comments so now
chk
just go with more if you remember what
come on so I don't want to get a total
list but rather page my bill
okay let's see so starting from zero you
have all the run levels here these are
all the services that are installed in
our system okay so what we can do is we
can choose the particular service and we
can say so this is the status so what
you do is so this is the current status
field so next time when you install a
service all right so you have installed
it you have started the service but when
you restart your system
sorry small get started so you need to
ensure that that service leaves on in
the corresponding done so here this is
on ok so when I start the system then it
will start this service has been ok like
that we need to enable that's the link
that can be done using CHP so for the
the existing services educator or if you
have any for real phone users you can
enable or disable them like we have seen
and this is the cover you can give the
run level of an argument and you can
modify the services similarly here we
can also mention the ground level and
modify the
ok ok so this is a CHP one thing I can
have no three in this one level I want
this service very this as well as this
both the run levels I want this to be or
you can check the status again similarly
by default when you see on the current
in the current ground level that service
will be on up ok it's pretty much about
the CHP come all right
so chk convict space type in - list will
this Q how all the services that are
installed in your system and ever you
install in new service so you need to
remember that you have to enable service
level so then the next time you started
system automatically service will be up
and running
ok so next it's a former here making
service on or off
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
