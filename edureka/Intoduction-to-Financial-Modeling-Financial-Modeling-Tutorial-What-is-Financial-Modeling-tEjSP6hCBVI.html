on introduction to financial modeling
and yeah
so before I start today's session just
wanted to check are you able to see my
screen and am i audible so before I
start let me just introduce myself
when I'm the course creator as well an
instructor for financial modeling
regarding my background
you know I'm uncle Kapur by
qualification I have done my masters of
economics I'm a CFA charterholders from
CFA Institute US and also a CFP that
stands for certified financial planner
anyone in the field of wealth management
of financial planning would then well I
started my career 12 years back with a
company called American Express I joined
their investment management group
working out of Minneapolis office in the
US I stayed there for three years
welcome lot of portfolio management
stuff with them moved on to a company
called McKinsey &amp;amp; Company their
valuations as well as corporate finance
team which deals with valuations and in
am an M&amp;amp;A a lot of people know McKenzie
as a management consulting group but
they also specialize in you know various
engagements on corporate finance so I
was part of that specialized consulting
group of McKinsey and company used to
travel a lot on various clients you know
studies and all primarily around any
invoices an acquisition any corporate
finance issues any CFO related
challenges I travel a lot to help them
and for a very short stank I was with
Ernst in
it's a it's a big fall but I was not
part of the accounting team I was again
part of the management consulting group
and used to work with top management in
solving their finance issues basically
and I was responsible for setting up
their finance and strategy team in India
after that I three years back I moved
into full time management role because
that always excited me and I always
wanted to help people manage their money
and grow it so for the last three years
at running my own portfolio management
company and I specialized and you know
kind of focus I have is on directing D
picking up stocks somewhat of
derivatives where ever I see Miss
pricing but not trading the same goes
with direct equity not trading but
mostly focused on fundamentals well
there would be you know some technical
opportunities also but major focus would
be on fundamentals and fixed income that
is on bond side I have my specialization
and obviously combining them all
together is portfolio management so that
is what I do I do not deal with you know
private equity or private transactions
although in in my experience have done a
lot of those studies but I am NOT a big
fan of those kind of investments I don't
see there is a lot of opportunity there
so much it majorly you know focused on
traditional investments so that is about
me and four good five years I think I'm
training people in financial modeling
the training of financial modelling I
would say was given by McKenzie and I
was a faculty within McKenzie also for
training a lot of consultants and you
know when I left there and I just
extended that interest in training
financial modeling to everyone you know
cyber is interested so that's about me
coming to you know what we will be
covering today is you know why financial
modeling is important what is this you
know course objective what I've created
what will you benefit out of it we
should take this course and you know a
case study on meet our calculation basic
one not a very detailed so let me just
introduce financial modeling lot of
people feel that you know financial
modeling is all about Excel I strongly
feel financial modeling is less about
Excel and more about your content you
know because whatever input you punch
and that you know accordingly the output
would be the problem is lot of people
get driven into Excel based analysis but
I strongly feel that Excel is very very
important but you need to clean the
Excel to fit your requirement if you
have to just know the you know how to
use Excel that's about it and know for
the knowledge then probably you'll land
up working in some kind of KP ole you
know working on some data analytics
maximum and you know just calling out
data and so on so you have to build
understanding of what those financial
models you have to create so this
training is all about creating that
baseline as well as creating further you
know how to do the modeling part because
you know this is a tool that will stay
with you for life you know Excel I think
is used by everyone well NASA still uses
excel nothing else so Excel is extremely
important to be hands-on and apart from
that a lot more focus
on the underlying valuations and M&amp;amp;A
that is very very critical by ending
this course what we will get is
basically an in-depth understanding of
Excel hands-on with Excel in terms of
the modeling which is I think critical
to any job irrespective of whatever
level you are on secondly it will
definitely help you build a lot of the
in-depth analysis of valuation a lot
more than theory because theoretically
you know there are lot of things which
you can tend to actually look into
practically you have to have other means
of sourcing data as well as analyzing it
so all the practical perspective it's
like you know today if you have to
analyze a company without any - without
any you know software what all the
information can you call out from which
all sources and how can that help you
create models and you know what kind of
analytics you have to run all that
in-depth analysis you will do in this
well you will refocus and we learn a lot
of your financial Theory well we will
definitely touch on a lot of academic
stuff a lot of theoretical stuff on the
accounting side on financial analysis
corporate finance side and you know you
just refresh your memory there you will
also further understand you know how to
apply whatever it skills you learn and
what kind of mistakes to avoid
so all those kind of things you will
learn you know in this and pretty much
you know you know I was involved in CFA
research I was training now here on
these issues so basically you know this
training is will also include equity
research you know very popularly known
as you know a lot of you know how to
basically do equity research so all
those skills you will put you know how
to
value any merger and acquisition you
will be and a lot of other analysis you
know credit analysis and so on who
should have in this course
well a CA candidate a CFA candidate a
charter holder commerce graduates
you know fresh graduates based B MBA
students Financial Controller managers
modular CFO's managers treasury managers
middle office staff general managers fee
fund managers so pretty much you know
whatever I have written these are all
the students you know train more than
five hundred participants now I think
close to 600 but there has been a
variety of you know students that have
enrolled and engaged on this you know
this stuff with me and these are pretty
much you know all the people the reason
you know you might be thinking that you
know why a CFO would be doing this you
know he can simply delete it that by a
fund manager would do this the thing is
a lot of these people rise up the ranks
and you know they are at times in those
situations where they have to do a lot
of modeling for example fumé few weeks
back only I trained one of the CFO's in
a solar energy startup so now he was
planning to raise funding and when it
comes to funding your evaluation thing
comes as well as you know a lot of Excel
modeling thing comes he is an engineer
he doesn't know anything about finance
MBA as well but doesn't know anything
about finance so refreshing and really
getting the practical application how to
value a company how you know be
realistic about its funding estimates
and monies arguing or having debates
with the investors you know what kind of
argument he can bring in and how we can
overall value add even as CFO so just to
give you an example and I need let me
not talk about you know fresh graduates
or MBA graduates or then it's very
critical because getting into job well
it's a requirement and you know
in this hands-on makes it easy for you
to get into job provided it you know
it's a related job if you're getting
into sales when some bit of modeling
skills will be required but if you're
getting into finance kind of role well
you cannot really let what are the
course content well the course content
would be around Excel will start with
Excel training and then we'll focus a
lot on financial statements we'll move
our attention to how to analyze that
financial statement do valuation when
DCF modeling how to value a private
company and pose the Mac position so all
these topics we'll be covering well
before I actually move to the beta
calculation well any question you have
please posted under questions so that I
can answer to you right now I'll just
give you like a minute in case you have
any question just write to me I'll be
happy to answer them
all right the first question I have got
is CS to range wanting to build a career
in finance so well as I said C a CFA
anyone who wants to build their career
in finance
it's inevitable to have Excel skills so
it depends on which field or finance but
frankly speaking most of the fields
within finance would require a lot of
in-depth understanding of Excel and lot
of modeling skills so this course will
basically help you understand what
practically you have to do in terms of
the job alright the other question I
have is you know a non finance
background person wanting to build
finance skills who does not have no no
finance background only programming
skills are there well as I said you know
excel on its own does not really need
financial theory so that is why the way
I have structured the program is you
know I kept Excel separate and I have
kept the theories
so that you know if you have to
independently apply Excel you're able to
do that and with respect to the
financial scale it starts from the basic
and it builds on there would be well as
I often tell my students also that being
a chartered accountant is not a
prerequisite for becoming a financial
analyst in fact most of these CAS would
fail in doing that because they are too
much into accounting too much into law
but practically what happens is
analyzing the numbers analyzing the
annual report requires common sense
building that common sense does not
really relate to any background things
in fact I personally feel that whatever
you have studied in the field of Finance
academically you know what I've seen
mostly unless you are a CFA and you
might have read some relevant stuff but
with most of the other you know the
graduate level information you might
have gathered is something which is more
relevant you know like 40 years back
right now it's not that relevant and
what we will do is we'll bring that lens
into the picture in understanding
financial statements rather than the
accounting part to it I will not lie if
you do not have even the basic level of
understanding that there is something
called P&amp;amp;L there is something called
income statement what all is included in
that we'll touch upon that at a very
basic level but will not go in-depth
into that you know will not go to a very
school level information to do that but
as I said even I don't know debit and
credit an account could be very honest I
just know that if and will report is
given to me what to look for a way to
question the management and you know
what kind of decision-making should be
done so yes at that level it will be
covered and I don't see that as a big
challenge just remember one thing that
Warren Buffett was
I should design was is not chartered
accountant or CPA right he is an
economics graduate and similarly there
are a lot of fun managers in India who
are not CS who are not mba finance also
at times they are just journalists
there's Kenneth and Ravi who just left i
DSC he was a journalist in financial
space and he just became one of the star
fund managers in India he is left
industry now for his personal reasons
but yes there is a lot that goes beyond
academics that goes beyond you know
textbook wave of operation so bringing
that practical lens into picture is very
very very important and that is what we
will do I can challenge no other you
know platform could provide you that
because I have personally worked on
these to use and personally worked on
these you know with lot of clients
across various geography so I know
exactly how it works
and you know it's it's way beyond that
and I would say I've never been trained
formally on financial modeling by any
Institute for me the Institute was
McKinsey &amp;amp; Company and I was trained
there for good two weeks on this and
that was paying in but gradually so I
used to work on those kind of engagement
so bringing that practical inside was a
very important probably I missed out one
thing on that there is a very popular
book by McKinsey and company on
valuation which is written by Tim
Koehler Timothy Kohler so when I was at
McKenzie he was my partner for three and
a half years I was under his fixed to be
trained on these matters it's a very
very popular guy in the field of
corporate finance and his book is
actually recommended in Harvard Business
School and that is my Bible as well
apart from Benjamin Graham security
analysis all right so as I said for
commerce graduates
who want to build their scale into
financial space this is very very
relevant course because it gives you a
kickstart process in terms of how to
think and trust me even cracking
interviews will get little easy because
you'll talk back pickle stuff not theory
so keep pouring all these questions as
you know I'll move to the calculation
part
don't worry whatever comes in your mind
just write keep writing it down I will
answer that you know as we end this
before we end session I'll I'll answer
everything so how many of you have
actually heard about term called beta
unsure personal finance or commerce
might at word but not sure of others but
have you heard about this term called
beta all right so you know when we are
learning deaths as per the economic form
yes it is a sense so just to cover up to
be six here well of beta is basically a
measure of how a company's stock moves
vis-a-vis market the market would be
your index right so basically it's a
comparison of how your stock is moving
with the market so more the movement
more the sensitivity it is considered to
be more risky less the sensitivity it is
considered to be less risky our stock so
for example if beta of market has won
and the company in question is more than
one let's say the beta calculation comes
to be 1.3 then we are basically saying
that the stock price movement of a
company in question is higher than the
market which means that the volatility
is more indicating more riskiness in the
company well the different thing that
you know there are other factors also to
assess when you talk about the riskiness
but ignoring all those elements when we
calculate cost of a
the basis capital asset pricing model
which is risk-free rate plus be Dominic
blind away hoodie risk premium that is
the beta I'm actually referring to which
goes into the cost of equity calculation
it is very critical both at a global
level or at a particular domestic
geography level to know how to calculate
beta what we have you know understood is
okay it's slated basically a sensitivity
but how do you calculate that
sensitivity and if I give you a company
can you do that so beta is extremely
important because it is part of
assessing the risk and it is part of
assessing capital you know cost of
equity to capital asset pricing model
you may be questioning why I have been a
surprising model because it's the only
model available which is tried and
tested it is somewhere they are not the
perfect model but it is somewhere there
give you an indicator results and how do
you calculate it well theoretically as I
said it is just a sensitivity but how
many you calculate that well the way it
is calculated is you will regress share
price of a company with the market index
right I'll repeat you will regress share
price of the company with market index
what you have considered is you need to
have at least 60 monthly data points you
have to ignore any time period so it's
60 monthly data points is basically five
years you have to ignore any period
where where the market has crashed say
in 2008 it crash in 2001 at crash so you
have to ignore that period and you have
to make sure that you are regressing it
basis the geography or basis the the
comparison should make logical for
example if you are regressing an Indian
company taking a sense X is fine you
you're regressing a us-based company
then a 7500 would be a better choice if
if you are comparing an Indian company
with S&amp;amp;P 500 is not the correct choice
or if you are comparing us-based company
with an Indian Sensex or nifty is not
the right choice so you have to make
sure that this thing makes sense so let
me just so which company do we want to
regress let's say they add you let's say
Apple all right so this is a poor so we
will get so I'm just going on yahoo
finance and within that there is Apple
it's a nasdaq listed company and you
don't say about everyone home said
everyone knows about it and they have
done tremendously well over the last
decade or so and it is the world's most
valued company profitable as well so you
go on historical prices you go on
monthly tab here let's say you want it
from November 3rd year 2010 right can
try this
okay I found it and download this on a
spreadsheet let me just look at the data
here and just a close all right this is
now I want SNP 500 because that's the
relevant yeah oh yeah the same thing if
you're welding some Indian company there
are other about from Yahoo Finance and
Google Finance there is a company a
website called screener dot in even that
it's very nice Yahoo Finance is I mean
historical data let me just see how many
data points we've got 62 that's fine
okay November 3rd year 2000 SN P 500 all
right so let's do a little modeling here
let's start from sorting here sort by
date from oldest to newest all right
excellent
let's do formatting of cells
I like this format probably yes
well I think that was better
alright and now we need to just some
indication of what this is this is
prices and this is return so these are
16 data that's delete probably one line
good so we need to calculate return now
we have to calculate beta P times by
slope there is a formula slope you
regress this eight-six excellent well
this basically means that the movement
of Apple stock is less sensitive the
volatility is less in comparison with
the market so I will repeat what we have
done in the
just as a recap well we took Apple as
the company we went on equal finance
took out all the historical numbers and
we also took SNP 500 we took the return
which is you know the number we have to
regress if you regress absolute number
with this you not get the right number
you need to have a common denominator
which is in the form of a percentage and
that is return so this is a price return
if I may I say so
price return and then you know these are
60 data points so I have regressed Apple
share price movement with SNT 500 in
order to get the value of beta this is
called brick rest meter and we call in
detail what progressed and unreal quest
and everything is but this is a
regressed beta where this is helpful as
as I said it's capam which is for a far
plus beta x market risk premium if I
assume on a far to B which is risk-free
rate to be 2.2 percent and MRP which is
market risk premium to be equal to 5
percent then my cost of equity is
basically equal to 2 percent plus 2.2
percent plus Phi plus you know B term x
so we are getting cost of equity to be
around 6.5 percent well on the face of
it this looks fine but I was expecting
somewhere around 7 percent but this is
fine maybe we need to just get hold of
unrest beta but I am fine with the
calculation part so the point which I
wanted to make here was you know
you know whatever you have learned
practically you might not have studied
how to calculate beta so this is just a
flavor of you know one aspect of things
which we cover and practically how you
know how it needs to be handled and as I
said this is just one aspect of things
there are a lot many other aspects which
will be covered in the course okay so
there are a lot of other aspects you
know the practical language the industry
language which is used I think that is a
very very critical aspect of whenever we
are you know studying these analysis
because whenever you are talking to
someone who is in this field of
financial analysis they would be able to
connect with you very quickly if you're
using the right words so throughout the
you know course you will be able to
build that language also that language
as we progress and various aspects
you'll understand that how that language
is spelled and as I said you know the
Excel analysis so when its basis my
experience now after coaching like more
than 600 participants what I have found
is if you really divide the Excel and
the content separately and what we have
done is we start with Excel training so
the first session the first module is
actually itself which includes
sensitivity and everything is included
including running macros and everything
so that once we are on the course you
know working way on various contents you
there is no back and forth happening
between you know use this as the
formatting this is the way formula is
used and everything so there is one side
of training which is given at the start
and throughout a bit rest of the modules
will be practicing those so at the end
of eighth module basically you will
have a lot of experience of Excel based
modeling as well I think that is a very
very critical thing to have an earlier I
used to see that people were struggling
between the content on one side and
Excel on the other side that is why I
just decided to you know have a
segregated view there and it has created
better results all right so so the batch
is starting this weekend from 5th
December the timings would be lighting
timings are incorrectly mentioned here
it should be 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. but I
think that can be communicated better by
air and rekha people I don't think these
timings are correct I only made this
slide and made few changes so I think
this is incorrectly mentioned at my end
what we will be working on as I said
everything will you know is one you know
when you're working on some practical
study I think that is the best level of
knowledge you can create and that is
also better because you can test your
knowledge practically you know you can
actually see that come in life I don't
like working on America's I like working
with the wheel because and you know when
really it has no speed excited about
things you know if you are running
numbers if you're running you have
yourself what is the analysis and how it
really bears with the market and you
know it really provides in one more
thing before I forget that in this I'll
be sharing with you
the model you know which I created and
this is a feed thing you know there is a
charge of two hundred dollars on
something just for this if you buy a
book called valuation by Mackenzie M
company on Miley publication dollars but
I will be sharing this you know model
with you anymore
Mackenzie because I've made lot of
changes in that but it is a very that is
part of the study process and other than
that as I said you know the focus will
be on Excel and yeah and the course will
be you know it's in a record form so you
will be here in my sessions with me you
can ask questions whatever you have on
the session and you will get recordings
as well which you can really and I think
so any other question you have on this
pretty much I have covered you know what
I'll be you know covering in this course
and I have given you a flavor of the
calculations that it's a very basic one
I could have complicated it further by
you know giving you a favor of how to
you know Cal pick a sec beat out of it
but that is for the course but that
could
you know that would have given you basic
flavor
you know practically have a well run
into numbers and everything without even
access to thee so as I said you know I'm
just getting this questionnaire so
throughout the course will be working on
a real company right and even from an
assignment point of view we'll be on
real company understanding analyzing the
data coming up with the result is all
pieces the real company and there is no
dummy data so each and every source of
information which you will use or
extract data from or analyze from or
look into the annual report will be
practically based on a real company so
tomorrow you know it basically equips
you to and then if you know if you're
given one company to analyze so you know
you you will know how to hand man is
that data and everything
however you know it will not train you
on managing each and every company
because for example and will report of
each and every company is very different
right so you need to be sure of you know
how to work around company how to read a
report so what this training will equip
you is understand give you an
understanding how to read a report what
kind of information to extract on how to
assess quality of management to those
kind of things
but as I said each and every company is
different so you will have to look into
the reports come out of data and more so
you know it requires lot of experience
and practice to really do the analysis
the right way so yes this provides you a
platform to know exactly what you do in
fact when I started off I was really you
know for good five six years I didn't
know how exactly it is until the pain
you know I was trained to on various
aspects and probably I read more
twenty-one books on just valuations and
research and M&amp;amp;A and all to understand
you know how this thing works and have
just concentrated all that information
into this course to practically help you
from the start but you know investments
and valuations and all these financial
analysis is not a one-time task it's an
ongoing task and it requires good
comfort and skill to reach that level it
takes a while to reach that level any
question you have I'll be more than
happy to answer while course fee I think
Erika would be able to tell you that you
know thanks they're running few
discounts and all so they can just share
that information in more detail with you
because there would be some dollar
denomination and or indium currency that
is what they have to do better so
they'll be able to get in touch with you
tell you the course fee offer discounts
usually you know the I sessions help you
because you can come on call you can ask
questions you can share your screen I
can help you fix up a lot of Excel based
you know concerns if you have so from
that perspective you know these live
trainings really help you with respect
to you know recordings you know that
stays with you for any form of reference
while it's also 80 percent of the issue
but there are times you will want
handlings than hand-holding can be done
well the main focus as I said is
primarily on the you know how to
practically do things rather than just
the theory element so valuation equity
research margin an acquisition financial
modeling you know how it is actually
done and make you basically job ready
whether you are in a job right now it
prepares you for the nature of job you
want to get into or if you're a fresher
it really prepares you to
handle lot of interview related
questions and I can tell you that you
would even have information which is
more than what at times interviewer
would in case you have any question you
can ask me right now or you know for any
fees related information you can reach
out to a Drake I think it reca will also
reach out to you to explain further and
in case you know you have any question
in terms of the pattern we would be
following and the focus will have any
specific question you have like if you
want to get into a particular role will
this help you or not you can ask me
right now well the kind of field you
will get into well it's it's like before
off auctions so anything you can think
within the field of Finance say creditor
analyst equity research branch of
modeling even accounting related jobs
budgeting kind of jobs modeling is
really helpful M&amp;amp;A modeling Moses an
acquisition modeling any kpo BPO equity
research rules would be suitable a lot
of brokerages brokerage houses financial
services companies would be more than
interested in taking you any financial
planning organization would be happy to
take you
so whatever field of study you know feel
the career you can think of in the field
of Finance it will help you unless you
just want to be in core accounting area
probably in that case some bit of excel
is used but that excel I think you can
learn on the job as well but apart from
that you know the focus on financial
analysis and the focus on
other things beyond just the accounting
is our main key area so that is where
you know but this is different
so well I D parameters I you know if
they understand the business better I
think they can add a lot of value and
I'm also seeing one of my participants
move from you know typical of their
programming skills and moved into
actually financial analysis rules within
the same of your outside where you know
they were able to bring that keen
interest passion for the field as well
it's a lot of knowledge they the and
these the you know the financial
modeling part will help you build that
knowledge but it will be incorrect to
say that in just few days you will be
exported out to challenge everyone
that's not going to happen but what
really prepares you it we you know if
you only passionate about moving into
more advanced business roles within the
financial services industry
it will provide you that understanding
of what aspects to fail in okay do you
know what this guy who's sitting at the
hatch langoustine does so from that
point of view it will help you and you
know it it really helps a lot of people
to shift careers actually and as I said
you know irrespective of the level in
the company business site knowledge so
this is that business I acknowledge the
financial services so in the past I
trained of Goldman Sachs programmers
credits which programmers so
and these people are only business
cycles now know as I said you know lack
of accounting knowledge is not a
deterrent at all because what I want
because they carry their accounting
knowledge may do strong and they tend to
ignore that they are who you learn a lot
more when it comes to financial
statement analysis then what they
already know in fact you read a lot of
records from what goofy which he likes
to share although and he say that he
doesn't understand accounting a lot but
he does understand to challenge
accounting from a perspective from
common sense or a ship so that does not
really require a lot of legal aspects of
it so the way it is structured and it
starts from the basic and it builds on
that obviously if you have no you
whatsoever in the past you might have to
put in that extra photo knowing the
basics and moving but we will be
covering Basics in the course itself
so no MBA or no accounting background is
not a drawback alright in case you do
not have any question for me you can
actually look welcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
