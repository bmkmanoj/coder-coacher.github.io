okay so thanks for the generous
introduction
Rakesh and I would like to once again
welcome all of you on behalf of data for
this power-packed
course on salesforce right so like
Rakesh mentioned you know I have around
70 plus years of experience in IT
industry and then I've been adding the
Salesforce practice for almost like for
furn of years in Infosys so we are
handle several multi customers across
different verticals beat banking
insurance telecom manufacturing and
different kinds of manufacturing
customers beat high-tech manufacturing
more depth moving equipment
manufacturers like say caterpillar right
or Motorola for the red zone right or
beat Nissan right automobile and actual
so and also of course retail in a big
customer so and far more as well right
so 100 different customers different
engagements on the Salesforce platform
and I'm very glad to be part of this
session today sharing my experience as
well as helping you guys enable on
Salesforce and help you folks in your
career right they've taken the right
patient in terms of joining this course
and there is huge demand in the market
for Salesforce folks both in the u.s. in
the UK you know across the geography so
I'm sure all of you would have done the
groundwork depth analysis so I will not
try to sell too much on that so what I
will do is I'll just show you a before I
get into the more you will spend what
this course is about I'll just show you
a quick window right so I'm assuming
you're able to see my the slide but I
showing you at two slides so this is
typically the certification roadmap
right for Salesforce and what we have
done us right I'm sure there will be a
diverse set of people who take this
course right at the beginning and we
would like to give them a flavor of the
multiple tracks that are available in
Salesforce so we have designed this
power-packed course wherein we bring in
a comprehensive view right across
multiple tracks right you have the
administrator track you have the
implementation expert tracking our
developer track what we have done is we
have ensured there is a decent coverage
across all these areas and they come
with this course right wherein you get a
good view of different areas both the
foundation and advanced and insights
into the advanced right and then you
take your first step as a you know
administrator or as a certified
developer till last month it was called
as a Salesforce come developer right
devil 401 was the exam recently there
made us a few changes they're calling it
up build up but the content wise it's
all 85% it will just say not much of
difference so what we have done is just
give me a much over your bones don't
yeah so so how we have structured this
course right just to give you a view
right the content wise right so we
picked up different percentages from
different areas right and the reason we
are giving more weight edge to the
foundation level the first two is just
to ensure that everyone has a strong
foundation on the platform and then you
branch out into the advanced terms you
want to become an implementation expert
you will sales cloud service called
certifications or you want
became a developer you are a hardcore
Java person stuff like that you branch
out to one platform developer so there
is huge scope for multiple set of folks
right different tracks so we brought the
best out of all these certifications
into this particular course right and I
would like to do one quick thing maybe
you know I think it may be a bit
difficult for us to go around the table
and interview each one of us it could
take a little bit of time what I will do
is I request you to just type in some
quick introduction about yourself right
I can see your names just you know your
overall experience if you're working on
know dotnet I think I just see that mr.
M e RK Prasad is working on dotnet and
c-sharp that's great
so Salesforce also has an object
oriented programming language pretty
much similar to Java and you know the
c-sharp right so it's a great space to
move into I'd sale so people you have
excellent experience on dotnet and
shisha right so you can definitely
realize that here and it's going to be a
fantastic experience for you and maybe I
request all of you to just give a quick
introduction on the window it will be
useful for me to just understand your
total experience and idea experience
yeah say let's say you were Java JT like
I think I see something right now saying
he's been in Java to you JPS adÃ¨le in
junk or Java and get e2e right around 10
years of experience so that's great to
know and maybe your location and maybe a
quick expectations from this goes right
I'll just take a look at them as I go
along right and then it will be easy for
me to you know understand but know more
about you guys are you're not strengths
and areas where probably you may need
some
support and you know if I may provide
you some additional support I will be
more than happy to do that
not at all a problem I think there is
someone who says I've been on mainframe
and I have no journalism no issues
sadita very good evening to you
so definitely there are a good number of
people or moving in from legacy
technologies you know they easily catch
up salesperson and there is a very good
demand for folks as long as we are smart
you're ready you have the right attitude
you how the energy to learn and
demonstrate you know you're going to be
successful right just yesterday I was
reading a blog on on the Salesforce
website I will share that to report
sometime
it's IDC report in the next three years
they just projected the number of jobs
that cloud computing platforms would
generate and particularly sales both
right so huge number right I'll just
shout that number sometime I think I
picked up by infographic from that blog
so I'll share that with you folks it
just shows how much scope is there right
so good to see I think there are a good
number of people from different areas
I think money's good to see that you
know say sa PC Adam you're in the US
great the page being with bit in the
telecom domain C C++ and Java excellent
and I think we have Balaji use an Oracle
apps ERP developer or you been on order
management and yeah that's really great
and so someone is been in yeah you've
been in telecom that's deep page and
then yeah I think we are some addict
someone audited are so you have been
working as a regional sales manager
managing spec platform for English
so Salesforce does have a out-of-the-box
sales and marketing and service modules
but it's typically started off as a CRM
product so when I talk about it you will
understand that so definitely there is
something for each and every role that
we typically play like the industry
right so beat an administrator developer
designer or if you want to become a
functional consultant or an
implementation gun expert or you want to
become an architect so there is
something for everyone right there is a
lot of demand for all of these roles so
I think that was a nice introduction
that I got from a good number of you
thanks for that in case you're not
typing please feel free to type in
because it'll just help me
you know just understand you folks a
little bit and then more and then any
support additional support or guidance
we want to take I will be more than
happy to move it right while we cover
the core course content during the these
sessions you know in case you want me to
do something specific for some duration
part of this you know the 40 42 hours
you are going to spend off something you
traditionally I will be more than happy
to help you guys we'll be sharing lots
of information to make you you know
successful Salesforce professional
that's my full intention right it's not
just we are just helping you with the
course and then investing all right so
we'll definitely help you succeed to the
extent that's possible right okay so
with this I'll jump into the course
right the course module so you can
access this module from the
you know once you log into a director
website you will see this in the my
courses' window and then you can take it
up from there and of course I'm going to
share my screen so you can look at my
screen phone off and then you can refer
these slides later right so I think the
good number of people have given the
details great to know that really a very
diverse set of folks and great to see so
many experienced people right looking to
really make a change that's really
positive sign that I see because I'm
sure all of us would like to be staying
relevant and competitive in this
industry right so absolutely this is a
great place to be in in terms of
Salesforce right so let's more just give
me amount
okay
so I will what I will do is I will just
show you a high-level overview of these
modules right so we will be cowering
around a total of 20 modules right and
we'll be starting off with cloud
computing and what's a supposed us in
that space back then we looking we'll
start looking at the building blocks of
the platform and then we will also use a
particular use case simple use case it's
basically the student master app and
it's basically we're assuming that for a
university write a hypothetical annuity
cloud university building a simple very
simple app the reason as I kept it
simple as we want to ensure we define
different requirements and cover all the
different features that we can explore
in Salesforce and at the same time you
know we don't want to keep the time
frame in my embed we can't do it like a
long project but of course if you are
interested even pick few more use cases
and you know after the first student
master app there are other use cases
that you can pick up and I will be more
than happy book idea so what we do is we
kind of take a approach where we not
just show you modules and say okay this
is a future this is a feature in
Salesforce this is a lab in parallel we
will be making you think like say a
business user right you have different
hats who think like a business user is
spell out requirements right then you
see how those requirements can be met
using Salesforce what are the
limitations of the platform right what
can be done what cannot be done with
declarative programming and other
options right what are the various
options available in Salesforce and then
slowly make you think like an
administrator and as a and the developer
because in Salesforce typically the
administrator is not someone who simply
does password research
you know basic things reduce recreations
unlike other platforms here the
Salesforce administrator is expected to
do a lot of stuff declaratively right so
he is the first point of contact for the
business folks he works very closely
with the business and he knows the
limitations of the declarative options
that are available and space where he
cannot do he cannot meet the requirement
he will go to the IT team when I say IT
team the developers right the developers
and the technical guys who can write
lots of heavyweight code so having said
that it doesn't mean Salesforce is
purely declarative I give you certain
examples so I think there is a very
strong developer community say for
example they go as in-depth as talking
about design patterns just like you
discuss in Java write a singleton
pattern or any of the other design
patterns you know all the stuff you do
in Java right advanced programming a
synchronous calls Web Services API soap
APA REST API and how you publish other
servers and if you are a web developer
right you are good in JavaScript or an
HTML and CSS right there is so much for
you to do in Salesforce and Salesforce
supports all the JavaScript libraries so
it's not that it's purely a non
developer kind of a package right it's
got a excellent business orientation
that's why they push a lot of things to
the user business user and the
administrator but they know that they
cannot achieve everything with the non
developers right so a big number of
requirements will be met only by a
hardcore developer and de architect so
just to give you an idea right
Salesforce has this architect course
certified technical architect there are
only around 100 or 150 certified
Ericsson
ecosystem of Salesforce in the whole
world right us and all regions put other
so you can imagine how many how
difficult it is to become a Dakar and
it's got all the features that any state
of the art you know platform will have
so that's the power of the you know the
platform it has so much scope right for
different people
so with that I'll get into the slides
I'll talk a little bit about cloud
computing and then we will you know keep
moving
any any questions before I start you can
feel free to type in anything you want
to know or anything that you have in
mind that you want to ask at this point
of time okay great so just give me a
minute
sorry I'm back we just had a small
distance okay so this would be the list
of objectives for this particular module
right so we'll try to understand what is
cloud computing then what is SAS pass
IAS I'm sure some of you have heard
about it and what is public cloud
private cloud hybrid cloud and all that
what is Salesforce right what is
Salesforce doing in this market and sure
thanks thanks are they there for the
feedback I made it fullscreen
hope it's for fun million now so we will
try to understand a bit about Salesforce
then what I can do with the platform and
then how do we develop apps what is
meant by multi-tenant architecture
metadata driven architecture these are
very basic high level stuff and then we
will get into the real one right we will
see this system we create an environment
for each one of you and we will start
doing different stuff right so let me
just move on so I think we have a good
number of people with lots of experience
I am sure all of you would appreciate
the fact that customers have to purchase
hardware software licenses then they
have to form a IT team which will do the
design development architecture testing
in all of them right and apart from that
the infrastructure itself has several
layers right and you need to have your
own data centers you're going to have
you know lots of you know expenditure in
maintaining the data center right and
then also running all updates all sorts
of upgrades you know all all that stuff
right so typical all IT infrastructure
related challenges and
when sales so started I think they start
off in 9899 I mentioned us 98 but of
course I think it was 98 99 when they
started off so if you look at it right
they start off way back in the y2k era
and they have the vision of going
completely on the cloud right so cloud
is just a metaphor right for Internet
and what they have done is they have
deployed the complete infrastructure
right meet the serves the the database
part application servers the business
logic this off the front end everything
right they just cool down the cloud they
hire the vision in those days when I
think it was probably the y2k peak of
y2k and then you had a calm boom then
there was a loud boom bust right so this
chart of long time bus right and it's
our way over the two thousand seven and
eight in fact I would not say they
survived they were the de facto choice
after the 2008 meltdown right that in
all customers started realizing okay
let's think about cloud right we don't
think they can afford to have our own
data centers how projects which run for
18 months 20 miles we don't see anything
for 18 months right after 18 months I
see some product that is coming from the
IT team so Salesforce broke all these
myths I one same it's like these these
are not real problems they broke all
these problems one by one and when the
2008 happened right they were the one
who stood strong and they survived that
article was and I said we were always
making fun of sales
alright Michael stovic they never
thought about cloud the way sales was
caught right and today you see Oracle is
pushing cloud sales
sfe is pushing clouds in my craw
of is now talking to Salesforce right
they are the in fact they see you are
tender to the Salesforce conference very
recently read wrinkles so tracs whose is
the leader right and they start off with
a CRM it just as a CRM platform right
not as a platform where even do
everything so they start off as a CRM
product customer relationship management
typically you do sales service and
marketing right to do campaigns to keep
track of your customers you maintain the
relationships and get more business they
do to cross-selling upselling all that
and then they also have this platform
right so where you can develop custom
maps so just to give you an example
right Facebook uses Salesforce for their
HR process internally HR process higher
purity Groupon uses it for their return
purposes so there are different
organization Google user Salesforce so
they're all top are message like I gave
some names in the earlier part of the
session
it's very wise okay is everyone facing
the problem like is a is there a problem
in my voice I think I saw that Smitha
has ila to that my voice is breaking
okay I think that you are looking okay
so feel free
okay so because I am on a LAN cable
right I just wanted to avoid being on a
Wi-Fi and just did a quick check of my
speed as well and I was quite good in
terms of you better than there is any
specific issue let me just do a picture
because I don't want these problems to
trouble you guys right there is a
problem on my side I'll ensure it's
fixed looks good I have a pretty fast
shin right now let's wait for some time
and then probably I think Smitha you
want to just check your connection as
well so coming back to the point right
that we were talking so different
companies who are startups right
startups in India they're using sales
was like I cannot take names because of
certain reasons but trust me some of the
very hot startups they are using
Salesforce okay the online marketplaces
of the world and they are using for
different purposes not just for their
not for their e-commerce sites right
using for different folks but they are
big customers of sales which they're all
implementing sensors so there is a
question from Aditya right so some
customers prefer to keep data in their
own control example ministries and
government sector yeah that's a very
good question so if you look at it so
there are there is definitely a lot of
operation about public cloud right in
the last several years but slowly that
apprehensions are dying them the reason
I am saying this is if you look at the
customer count of Salesforce right it's
just around 10k and 20k
and India they have huge customer base
and there are a good number of public
sector companies which are implementing
sales having said that even today I
think 70 personal retailers are many big
bands right so they still run on
mainframes right the core banking core
retail operations right they are still
online flames right but if you see the
war'll opportunity that is there for
Salesforce right so typically all
customer facing apps right b2b b2c
partners suppliers where are we have
touch point where you want to be easily
talk to different
we provide a community to the people
same source is the choice right and
there are different horizontal functions
HR functions internal for professional
services automation and multiple things
right so there there is a huge go for
sales for maker a lot of applications
which are cloud ready and Salesforce
does meet all the cloud or security
standards right laid out by different
standards right I just show you a site
where they display all those things
right and they're moving their data
centers throughout the world right Sonia
not leaving restricting it to only the
US two years back most of the data
centers working us today they've opened
up data center in the Europe they have
three data centers in Europe they have
one in Japan tip expanding all regions
so that the customers are people in that
regions don't feel that data is
completely outside the country but of
course it's still in the public space
right but Salesforce provides all the
later best-in-class security definitely
not every business case will suit
Salesforce there may be some very very
confidential stuff that you don't want
to put'em you know the club but having
said that if you see what has happened
last year right target they hacked into
their data centers right target
completely was hacked and the see you
lost his job they were not on globe they
were mostly on data centers their own
captives interns and several other data
breaches have a point where everything
is there on the premise right within the
data centers so I think that's
definitely a passive concern but yes
Salesforce is moving ahead so we look at
some statistics there right so so these
are typically the models right you have
which is software-as-a-service the bass
platform-as-a-service in our
infrastructure as a service ie w8 s so
simple examples that we all use day in
day out
Dropbox Gmail Facebook all those stuff
is basically software server way is
there on the cloud and you use it as end
user then platform as a service right
you have force.com which is again from
Salesforce so Salesforce asked offerings
on the platform layer as well as the
Sask layer and then of course you have
infrastructure as a service which does
not have anything on there on that layer
but I'll give you an example it will
just give you a very good idea this is
just a simple analogy right so you know
this picked up from a blog which was
written sometime recently maybe a less
than a year ago like someone compared
the software as a service or whatever
has a service right they have everything
else as well as it be ordering some food
like these as a service so if you look
at the left hand side right you have the
block which shows everything is made at
home right you just do everything at
home right you have your own kitchen you
have a new table your soil like gas flow
and fire
whatever you need is there at home you
don't go out of course you buy the raw
materials the ingredients from the
nearby shop but you do everything on
your own then infrastructure as a
service so you can see the blue boxes
and the green boxes late in the second
hour so you just like take and bake
right so where it you kind of get few
things from outside and do some things
yourself right your infrastructure is
there so maybe you know you go to a
service department right or some of
these studio apartments in your life so
that you have certain things ready
available but you just buy a few other
things right but then go for
platform-as-a-service right so here you
get the piece of deliver all right
everything is done outside and this just
sit at home or the last option unique
out completely right so of course this
is just an analogy but if you look at it
it's not like the way we have you know
the all the pros and cons with eating
out rights of course today there is so
much talk about why you should eat out
you cook food at home or meta food is
better blah blah blah but it terms of IT
infrastructure let me tell you the way
forward is cloud because it is not just
cloud right
it is mobility it's you know analytics
social all those things are commonplace
right I have some slides to talk about
it but it is just an analogy which will
give you an idea to differentiate
between on pretty nice infrastructure as
a service platform as a service and
software as a service right so now let's
get into the IT world okay so here if
you look at it you know everything
managed on-premise on the left extreme
right and then you have the bottom layer
right which is managed by someone so
here when you say manage right it is not
that it is out sourced it is not that
you have your data center and you just
outsource it here it means someone
provides this networking storage
services servers and virtualization
layer you decide what is your operating
system you design the middle you beside
runtime and data and applications you
warn the boxes at the top then if you
look at platform as a service right we
have
even the middle where the operating
system and runtime manage Vega when done
right so that's basically the
platformers essence then you go to
software SSI so here everything is built
by someone you just use it you subscribe
to it and use it so it's like you know
paper use right so it's like if you look
at it like certain public infrastructure
that you cannot have it for to have it
you just call a user service that's half
provided by the government right you
take a public transport or you fly you
don't have your own charter flights
right of course some people can afford
it but most of us can't afford it right
so it's like that right so you use the
service pay for it and that's it you
don't worry about who maintains the
infrastructure who maintains the flights
or the transports all you care is I pay
for my ticket I get in at a place get on
at another place I did some so so much
similar to that right to software as a
service and of course the vendors Koide
all the commitments to their cell ace
and you know all that stuff right so
this is basically to give you an idea
what different layers and different
models that are available today in that
market and now you know also heard about
public cloud private cloud hybrid cloud
and all that right so what happens there
as I think the question that I think we
had right about data being not safe you
know I don't want to put my database on
the cloud I'm okay to how my other layer
of the cloud that I want to keep my
database on the provides something like
right so there you go for three options
one is you go for a public cloud which
everything
right it is managed by a third-party
vendor hosted and managed not just
managed you don't care about anything
whereas you go for a private key of the
thing as it is again not managed for you
it is a separate data center everything
is separate but you get some exclusivity
right you are the only tenant in that
particular infrastructure so it's a
private club right and then you have
hybrid cloud
you know Guerra me you have something on
your premises and something on the view
so these are the three four options that
you have and you have this community
care community or is nothing but you are
the communities right where you
collaboration with your partner see the
employees with your customers lately to
be be to see in all that so there you
have certain things on the grout and
certain things on the fitness right so
asset sales force is purely publicly but
I think they were very clear about their
strategy they believed it the fact that
they can provide the best in class
security all that and then they go
public so if you see initially an
article came with a lot of other options
right hyper cloud private clear all that
but today if you see there kind of move
out slowly they're giving top right into
the public cloud based options so it's I
think it's a slow even evolution that
will happen wherein all customers will
move a lot of the first maybe the
non-core functions right and then
probably the core will stay on premise
because I think it will take probably
some more time before I don't think a
mainframe can be so easily replaced
right but of course from IT professional
personal to the jobs are all getting
automated I know in Russia everything is
getting automated idea how bogus are
automated stuff replacing and then as DQ
Ola
you do have the pressure of cost and all
that so all of us definitely would have
standing of that so definitely for an
individual it makes sense to be on the
club right on the cloud happening space
and customers they take a call on a
case-to-case basis right so this is just
err we want the market share that sales
those words
okay think there is a question I put it
nothing but co-hosted yeah so see hybrid
what happens is right you can also have
some moment of coasting there but it is
not as much as the public curb it so ha
you can have certain layers inside the
premises where like we want the database
all that you know to be save the data to
be safe you can have a rap layers and
other stuff from the public flow right
so in this sales first ride a small
experiment two years back where they can
with an option where you can keep your
data based on the prevents right they
call it I think
DRO or something data residency option i
if i'm not wrong but a few customers
tried it but the thing is i think there
are lot of other security and latency
issues and all that so salesforce also
dropped that option right so they
decided to open data centers in all
these countries right because you know
penny near or even I think in the Middle
East I remember there was a bank which
did not want to go to sales plus because
of the public third option okay are the
fear there is a question from Allah T
one of the main differences that
Salesforce cut a comfort to escape yeah
from a ac/dc I think I will I will take
this question a little later but I will
keep a lot of this definitely I will
come back on this I will give you
certain functional as well as properly
technical differences right definitely
we do that there is a person from Sakia
it's a static oh no this is not disaster
recovery it's data residency option so
what they did was they give an option of
having it
on the ribbons then everything else on
the globe it dro is as not disaster
recovery it's more of data residency
option yeah that's a advance for the
question it's a good question in fact
many people live here about BR the first
thing comes to your mind because of our
experiences is our story goes right
there is so much that happens but that
has happened in the past in which we
want to hand him so I want so this trial
is just to show the crm market share
right in sales so it's a little dated
probably one two years old but still
Salesforce is continuing to gather more
momentum and their market share is
definitely going up weightages into
overall crm space and then if you see
the disaster sorry I'm sorry I just
looking at the Pinterest or unique ocean
okay so the Sierra got no magic quadrant
right so this is a pattern that is
released by Gartner right every year for
different services and with different
products right so if you see a say our
sales force is clearly in the gear
despondent and of course followed by
Microsoft Dynamics here on Microsoft
Dynamics CRM if you see other vendors
are way behind back then on almost left
out in the race and this is a very
recent one I think even this year
Salesforce continues to be the leader
there is no absolutely no doubt and this
is for the pass market right so the
earlier one is more for the CRM right
more of the SAS part right this is the
past part so even this pass but if you
see they have very clear leadership it's
like they've a hide right the race so
this is just some idea just for you to
this publicly ordered information I just
gave the one to this so let's try to
understand
the Salesforce platform has right so you
hear about salesforce.com wet SLBC
salesforce.com or SF one of Salesforce
one or you will also have a good
force.com platform right so let's see
what each one is right so if you look at
this diagram so this is where everything
started all right then
salesforce cable to the market these are
the areas where they started off all
right so almost like this is the core
right
this was their core these are this
continues to be the core right core
areas so sales cloud answer is clear are
the two functional modules right which
basically represents the CRM customer
relationship models this is the SAS
layer right right at the top and then
the force.com platform or the layer wait
for that come layer is where you can
build a custom apps you can have your
own app like the recruiting app that we
are sorry not the recruiting up we are
going to build a student app right the
student app properly when we create it
it's going to sit here right so we will
be printing an app on top of the
force.com platform and once you get it
ready it is basically you can draw a
diagram like this of course slightly
better on it doesn't look great where
you can say no I have a student right
master app you can publish it on the app
exchange which is similar to the Google
store and whatever you have Apple Store
and all the great GU will play store and
all that so you can publish it on the
App Store right operation and you can
sell it as a offering from yourself
right as I went up so there are
different options of course customers
also use sales cloud service for their
customize it or they build their own
like I said about Facebook read Facebook
as they are
hire to retire process entire HR process
built on top of the first come layer
weights tell me I will put our box here
right so Facebook right sorry about that
it's not very clear but so this is a
layer of just an app that is built which
is sitting on the sass layer and they
are not providing it to other vendors
but they're using for their own purpose
right if you want to provide it to many
customers you can put it on the Apple
change and we will talk about that a
little bit how app exchange can be
leveraged
what is there in an app exchange and all
that and if you look at the boxes in
between net sales was one app says one
platform a PA and you know the hero COO
and then said target so what sales was
dead was or a period of time there are
quite a few more platforms right one is
the hero COO platform and then the exact
target fuel right so this is basically
the exact target marketing clover they
acquired recently won one of years back
they have to integrate it because this
is slightly running on a different
technology right and you should have COO
the good thing as hero kusa allows you
to pour to your other technology apps
right I think mainly the Java EE
platform right and I think you can also
do Gartner and I'll confirm that you can
pour their apps without rewriting a lot
into hello Pooh whatever you are doing
new are if you think your code is
completely outdated junk you don't think
it makes sense to just lift and shift to
the cloud right you can use the
force.com platform we'll see what are
the options that are available in the
for shotgun platform right so the API
layer right provides you options wherein
you can write programs in say climbs or
programs in dotnet of Java or any
technology which kind of supports web
services web which can Poli APs
and access the Salesforce platform right
the data or the platform so Salesforce
provides support for web services and
ApS
the publisher functionality as a pas our
web services and other platforms can
access it or you can build your own
Salesforce one app which basically the
reason why they put it as a separate
boxes the Salesforce own app they coined
this term to represent the complete set
of things right the force comm hero who
and ExactTarget
plus the mobility services they are
launched so we the mobility services e
which they launched revamp it and
launched it right recently that maybe
one out of two years back the good thing
is you develop some say small app on the
Salesforce platform you can just see it
on a mobile device beat iOS or the
Android platform report having to write
specific you know code for the iOS on
the Android platform but you are to
maintain two separate source codes you
will do all that stuff but of course
there are certain limitations so it
depends on the use case which you want
to go for right and of course they
provide all mobile SDKs wherein you can
do you know you can build a native iOS
app or Android app I have a question
from one each the question says is exact
target fuel the marketing solution to a
sales force or it already hired a
mounting solutions okay that's a good
question so they tried to fill the gap
right particularly the marketing area
right so there are a few other products
which were probably doing better in the
marketing space right of course the
sales module does how the ability to run
campaigns
track the campaign
outcome right or the return on
investment from the campaigns to the
opportunities and leaves that you get
right but there were a few things which
were lacking particularly mass email
marketing campaigns and there are a few
other products in the market like market
oh and I think there was one more which
is with Oracle I think marketers require
a good soak they wanted to fill that gap
so they picked up this product right so
exact target fuel is a full-blown
marketing cloud offering from Salesforce
this is available as a you know a
separate product house so if you want to
have a full-fledged marketing solution
you can move for example there is one
more question from Argentina line is
there a specific use of these three
platforms or any can be used for any
purpose yeah
so if you look at it right so first
outcome platform then you if you want to
do something new
typically they recommend that the
customer go for the four second platform
right build everything from scratch or
you think your legacy apps which are
probably running on you know any of the
legacy platform right
you think it's two completely gone right
it's kind of unmaintainable the other
point right you feel you just by just
moving the Java program from my data
center to Salesforce server doesn't make
a big difference
well I want to do some transformation
what you gotta go full circle so they
give you this as an interim option right
where you say the helpline can be only
on the channel or on the you're going to
want to get it to the custom Salesforce
platform so there are customers who are
using both what they do is they want to
take a step one move to here oku use it
so they've moved to the cloud right
so they started getting the benefit of
moving to the flower and then slowly
salesforce will you know convert them to
us your posture
customer are they let them be happy on
the hero click platform so it's kind of
a transition that you can take are you
can just be on the go platform also so
the different situations probably will
need a different type of solution right
anything new typically go for the
further com platform right that's how
they sell it and I think it makes a lot
of sense to for the customers to do it
that way right because this has several
inbuilt features including security
workflows automations approvals the
codes all that stuff ID mobility support
I think you better completely fully
fledged the platform if you want to go
for this right so that's more so let's
look at some of the declarative and
programmatic options available imposed
on comm right so you can create your
data model or you can create their
objects right the database objects which
are nothing but your tables right in the
Salesforce work or sorry not EMS work
your tables and your data records your
fields and all that it supports all the
our DBMS constraints are the rules like
you have much a little relationship you
can do whatever relationships all that
and it is so easy to create the data
model with just point-and-click
stuff and of course you can automatic
also with if you are a heavyweight
techie right I don't want to do this
using point-and-click I want to just
automate it yes you do have options to
automate it right so just like any other
platform you can put in a lot of
business logic you can do cross or
automations approvals or flows they have
a very rich UI options very diverse UA
options you can completely do JavaScript
HTML CSS all the letters web
technologies write JavaScript libraries
if someone has used the JavaScript
lab-based ignore dot J's or bootstrap
you know jQuery and all that or you want
to just use the appropriately UI yes you
can do it when you have a very good
support for reports and nice dashboards
and all that and you have mobile access
right you can quickly access your app or
move in mobile device that's one very
good thing about it you don't have to do
too much of coding quickly you see it on
the mobile you can do certain
administrative activities your mobile
and then slowly you greater the expanded
application and if you want to know
heavyweight programming yes like I said
in the beginning they have the property
language program fix it is a completely
opposite very difficult of learning
language looks like Java of speech are
so those of you who are on those areas
you will know to spend time yeah
and of course we see some use cases
where you know you cannot use
declarative options you will go over
programmatic options only right in this
course and of course visual force is
there appropriately uie
scripting languages similar to HTML
it has tabs and outer the good thing is
visual first doesn't force you to learn
something completely if you know HTML
it's very easy even if you don't know
HTML you can learn this and you don't
have to worry too much about loving this
if you go if you are not a hard word
programmer or even if you are into some
other technology right I am a JavaScript
I usually learn something yes you can
use very minimal visual force and go for
heavyweight HTML javascript right then
similar to the database at article or
sequel server or any s AP database net
which runs on Sybase or whatever they
have this query language right the
Pollack's soql it soccer structures so
SQL stands for structured query language
so a circle stands for salesforce object
query language right and SSL is this
a search language right Salesforce
object search and even search for
certain text across multiple objects
right soql is pretty much the similar
version of SQL I have a very firm will
eat yeah so believe me I think you know
the way we have structured is closed
right like I said at the beginning it is
a foundation post right for both you
know not even both admin and developer
it's a course for even functional folks
right so what we have done is we have
picked up the worst of all these areas
and you can go lightweight on technical
stuff if you think you are not too
comfortable but what we are going to
cover is very very simple stuff on the
technology side then we provide you a
roadmap and there is a scope and we
provide use cases where it if you want
to go end up yes you can go end up so
this course is a very balanced mix of
all these trunks right and then this
helps you plan your first level right
it's step one you have to know the
declarative options you ought to know
the platform be it
you're a functional consultant be it
your technical developer or designer
architect without knowing this you
cannot take the next steps right so I
give you an example right Salesforce if
people join in Salesforce right so I
have quite a few friends or join
Salesforce directly the professional
services and all that the first target
they are given us they have to complete
the form - levels or deviations right
the admin certification the developer
certification then go for sales cloud
service klore and then act with advanced
admin then only they are asked to do a
pet sandwich all the reason is they're
asked to do this in the first three to
six months window the reason is they
want to ensure everyone understands the
basics of the platform you
not say that you know I don't care about
the platform all I will do is write code
right or you cannot say that I don't
care about what's functionality easier
what I can do with the platform
out-of-the-box
I will only do one thing so the
foundation is very easy for all the
people they've kept it that way
to do the foundation you have a strong
footing on the platform then you kind of
branch out right like I said this tech
arts hardly 150 people are there in the
whole work there's so much demand
photographs they are the highest fail
functional consultants also there is
very good different but administrators
are in very good demand so it's a very
good starting place to administrate
track over so so that way you don't have
to go to depth right this course has
been designed in keeping in mind and we
plan it in certain custom way also I
know there are a few people who want to
jump in or I will definitely probably
more directions on that there is a
question from mafia soql full-form means
yeah so SMP all right it stands for
Salesforce object very language right so
it's basically Salesforce object and
query language so so SOS L right so SOS
LS same right there is no big difference
Salesforce object first two words are
same right it's such language okay so
what are the main difference right so
what you can do with this okay learn
what you can do with this verse and what
are the difference so S sub ql right it
allows you to query data from specific
tables or objects i'd say in oracle or
sequence array right select star from
table student right or select star from
table contact something other right or
even join two tables and trick leave
some rows so you will retrieve records
on the database
using SQL or SOP well as in SSL so I
want to search for a particular text
some keyword right so then you use s o s
M you search it's basically free text
search right you search for a particular
text from the across the database right
you can you need not give any structure
way of doing it I will look at some
examples when we do the modules right it
helps you search across multiple tables
because you do not know where that text
is present right you search it across
multiple fields and multiple objects or
tables right so I hope it was useful
I will will any will be seeing some more
a circulant social action in some of the
modules right so that time I'm sure you
will be appreciate this much right
and apart from this right you can also
write a lot of API is read even
published web services and the perf
services can be consumed by external
applications right so that also can be
done using appids and we show those you
can do bad jobs a synchronous calls you
know bulk data loads right you want to
bear load 1 million records in the first
time before go live you have options for
all of that right so if you want to say
display Maps Google Maps you know you
have options so you want to integrate it
two different things right so you can
also use sales versus an identity
provider right
so several things can be done using
Salesforce programmatically and declare
it
so we'll go on so this is what I was
talking about right so you have support
for XML JSON HTML Javascript right
ability to do data loads and you have
apps available on the App exchange which
are already developed by many people you
can reuse them some are free some are
paid we'll see some examples as Ebola
long and there are a few tools apart
from what is available in sales
overnight there are a few external tools
which can also be used like if you have
used some of your Java programmers I'm
sure you would have used Eclipse ID that
you can also use Eclipse in Salesforce
to store all your class files schema and
all that right so Salesforce provides
support to the Eclipse ID right so they
have their own force.com ID which is a
plug-in to install it inside the Eclipse
and you can integrate it with your
github
mavens of CVS and all the code
repositories right so just like whatever
you do in Java you can do in any Java
program it you can do like test
automations you can do devups best
practices you can do continuous
integration testing like that is anyway
part of DevOps you can automate a lot of
testing you can do a lot of regression
testing Salesforce has a built in code
coverage criteria right so these are all
for strong technical folks you want to
explore more of it they're not going to
cover these things in the course in
depth but we'll be talking about
touching up on them and the reason I'm
highlighting does this it's absolutely
you know exciting for all roles right
you have something for every role and
it's so exciting and there are all the
stuff this I put all the latest stuff
which is there in the market right
so we just trying to understand this
little bit now but I will come back to
this slide later for those of you are
not completely technical right don't
worry about it you can just time being
ignore it all so don't worry over it
okay so and so what happens is right in
any system with any application you how
the database layer where you store the
data right you store all your customer
data concentrator orders invoices
whatever right in the ditch system and
at the same time you also store some
data about the data structure of the
database you know all that stuff right
so Salesforce has these three layers
it's logical and not like it's very
physical and it's not that you use a
shard database right this is not
technically a hundred percent correct
don't misinterpret this it's not that
they provide you one database where our
customers are going to sit right
internally how they implement it it's
their own problem but you get dedicated
resources you get everything that you
need and some of you have heard about
virtualization which was very popular
even now I think it's still there in
many places right so when you share
multiple app share the same servers same
hardware and all that and here it's
simple at the logical layer it's not of
the hardware layer then you store the
data about data that is called metadata
so they split the data about data and
metadata into group was one it's a
common metadata other written on
specific mobility so I will come to this
again right once we create some
Salesforce objects we see what is
Salesforce is revisit this don't worry
too much about this right on this point
of time right but just remember that
there is something called data and there
is something else for metadata
so that's something you need to
understand if I have a given example
right we live in a an apartment right so
let's say there are 30 flats right
most of the flats will have a common
structure right you'll have three
bedrooms you'll have a kitchen you have
a few pilots you'll have some pooja
rooms and what all right
typical you have a TV room living room
dining room that's the template that
common template for all the houses right
but some people would customize their
specific rooms right they will want to
put some false ceiling they want to put
some things internally right so they
don't damage the external template the
structure of the building they are hired
to them if you look at it from outside
yeah this is a creepy HK plant there are
30
t3c black 3 BHK flats they all look same
but you're getting side there are
certain specific customization the pipe
color may be different you may have a
different flooring yeah even the rooms
may be slightly bigger smaller you may
do certain stuffs like your wash through
and all that right so that's denim
specific dinner right metadata common
name metadata is like if you see all
your kitchens are going to be at the
same side of the building right so one
tenant cannot have the picture in one
corner and another tenant cannot have
the kitchen you know that is going to
create a big problem for the guys who
are laying the pipes right
infrastructure so you found deviate
everything right but still we stick to a
common template and then you go for a
specific term wherever you will
customize your customers so just keep
this on og in mind
I'll come back again to explain from a
technical Salesforce prescriptive also
data right so I think I already talked
about this multi done anything just know
so if you are living in an apartment
apart from the common rules right so you
cannot sell how much each n right in the
middle of the flat right you have to
have it at one side because the piping
infrastructure is going to be run
commonly for all the people right the
you cannot be a deviated there there are
other rooms you can deviate like
something like that or you have certain
shadow sources right your elevator of
the lift or your parking parking of
course within the parking you have you
don't dedicate apparently right water
supply you may have to share so things
like that right so there are few things
which are exclusive with in your flat
everything is exclusive for you the
power supply probably is exclusive to
you you don't have to worry about
sharing it right you pay for your bill
but maybe they'll lift and other things
right there sharp right there may be
certain other things which you need to
share so
listen I just looked and looking at your
question can we get presentation copies
is that your question yeah yeah so so
see I will just show you this module
right so if you look at this when you
log into the a director website why you
will go to my courses I'll show you that
after I close this slide right I'll just
show you you get the presentation you
get the video recording of this entire
session so you can look at it any number
of times it's available for you right
yeah
presentation also presentation as well
as the video work they're available
separately so looking at this
multi-tenant right so there are certain
things you cannot misuse right resources
how to be shared there are certain
things you can have some Liberty right
for example if you are having a printer
right it's a filter shared between 50
people typically they put in a limit of
number of pages each person can drink
right you can't just keep printing 2,000
pages throughout the day one person
right there is a limit that is in post
only ten pages a day or 50 wittle'
something so there are certain limits so
the call has governor elements it
doesn't mean this platform is not having
enough power okay platform provides you
enough power just that you have to
respect some of the limits and having
said that it's a shared platform you
have to attend even in your dedicated
data centers and other platform right
I'm sure your Java memory space right
the JVM space it's not a little bit of a
glue for you get max of 4 GB and in
depth you have 2gb for Java and TP for
them see
a heap right and 1gb for the core and
all that it's not that you are unlimited
space there right so everywhere there is
a limitation right it's smart that the
data or the data base which is there on
your premise as something which is
completely unlimited it's so basic you
have to use the resources optimally
that's the whole point here right so one
of the business and IT benefits right so
I think we have seen a few things
already we all appreciate it I'm sure so
if you look at one key point right so
Salesforce has this option very it's not
an option every year there are three
product releases right the point which
is there here right earlier there are
three releases so what it means is
unlike other products where there could
be multiple releases Yatim product
upgrade right the product upgrade
project will run for 18 months two years
you have to do everything change the
complete platform talk to bottom where
as the sales was releases happen
seamlessly and absolutely there is no
voltage right you can selectively apply
the features and they with the doodle he
says they take her of all the testing
for you right we will see how they do
that but it's an amazing thing they do
absolutely knowledge when you do new
release and it's up to you if you want
to use the new features you use it or
you do not use it they're not going to
charge you anything extra you can't able
to pay the same license fee right and
need to provide something very unique
completely new feature of course even
have a pace
doing extra pipe it's up to you you want
to be pay for it or you do not of you
decide it's not like you know you buy a
new version and you have to pay for it
then you price it so those are certain
advantages and it's available both on
the browser as well as your smartphone
so today with the mobile space exploding
so much right in terms of the usage and
adoption so Salesforce is already there
on the milk back we see more about these
things as we look at different features
of the platform right
so I touched upon these so I will just
skip this light right so of course you
don't have to do the survey now towards
the end after we complete our class you
can take a quick survey it just comes
off that every module but don't worry
just do it once hardly there are two
three questions
it will be very valuable for us if you
want to plow in any descriptive feedback
also it will be really useful for me to
make this thing better right so we're
just completing the initial first module
right so I switch to the next one right
we quickly move to the platform and see
how it looks because I'm sure all of
your bigger Lea waiting to see how
Salesforce will read I have been talking
about it for the past one on the front
so any questions before I go to the next
one so I think there was one question
about the presentation right so you can
see that when you log in into this
course right you get this presentation
here you can view it here that is a
model level quiz for each model it's a
very simple object - multiple choice
question right just for each model we
have put in some 10 to 12 15 questions
and you have the answers also you can
just review yourself please do take this
quiz it's quite handy
maybe some questions which exactly don't
come exactly from the slides just test
your overall knowledge don't worry about
that we can discuss later also if you
have any issues and after the course is
over I think the video will also appear
here or somewhere here right you can see
the video of this entire session
recording rather than aquatic not so
we'll get that so we go to the second
module don't worry about this tick mark
I was just reviewing the contents so I
think it just stigma is not a problem
for you it will show it in a different
way so we switch to the second model I
think there is a question okay I think
it was for their label yeah so let us
look at the building blocks of the grant
for right I will continue with this
light to do type in any questions you
know how but just I will keep moving
right so let's look at some other
building blocks of the platform that
will be our model too right
we look at the following objectives
right so how to build a custom app on
the force.com platform how do you just
get started there and then understand
certain things about the platform you
know don't worry about after you I am
NOT going to read it one by one I will
probably come to the objectives after we
look at this mics because I'm sure then
only you'll be able to relate one higher
type right now it may all be sounding
completely new to you folks right
so I'll go to the next slide so let's
see how we can sign up for a mirror
neuron right so this is the real stuff
right because you getting into the
environment so in Salesforce typically
we don't call it an environment we call
it an organization or a Ark orgy right
or a sandbox we usually don't say in
Iran what our instance which is used in
other areas ik but now it's all say
interchangeably used it just means
that's your development environment or
production interim right or quasi so the
good thing that Salesforce does is they
provide you a free lifetime environment
right you just sign up for it there's
just like signing up for the Gmail or
Facebook you gotta come sign up for it
they give you all the user ID details
and then the environment has a built-in
database it's got a user friendly UI we
do lots of stuff there and like I said
in the earlier session for in the
earlier module not just that you
everything from the environment type the
UI you can use eclipse you can use other
tools to do different things right if
you are a hardcore programmer so you
have both options right but some of the
basic things they provide you the UI
administrator and creating second um so
we will go through the UI we will see
all the foundation level then when you
become an expert it's up to you how much
you want to use them you are right but
the building blocks are all same right
so it's pretty much like Oracle like I
said earlier it supports most of the our
DBMS things concepts that you may be
aware of anyway cover for the benefit of
some of you who may not understand the
concepts and if you think you need some
additional pointers I will be more than
happy to help you out right don't worry
about it I'll take care of that
so we'll go to the real thing right so
let me just from now I think I use more
of the system than so this is where you
sign up right
it just is a great window so this is the
URL right developer Docs
salesforce.com and just type it just
give me and just looking out for the
screen
question window right I thought I just
tried okay great I got the yeah that's
that I think and just giving her this
URL just typing it for all the people I
hope everyone got everything they'll
just send ball yeah so you can click on
the URL right on the window if you have
any issue in clicking on the URL you can
just type developer of salesforce.com
slash sign up right just type this URL
and press ENTER will help you create a
new environment
so once you've done this when you get
this window to type in your name provide
a working email ID right because you get
emails on this even ad then you type in
your role you provide some company name
so provide some name don't worry about
the company name know you can just
provide a few name itself doesn't matter
right and then provide a location
whatever then this one is important
right it can be same as an email ID if
you not use your email ad earlier for
registering your Salesforce environment
you can use the email ID and the user
IDs same if you used it before you
registered before right some of you
probably would have give it a shot just
type something which will make this
unique right of course you it will give
an error if it's not unique then you can
make some small changes and just make it
unique just like you register for user
ID right so do this and then select this
checkbox just do sign me up so I am also
going to do this now so
you should get your mail quickly all
right you can just open your mailbox and
look for that email usually comes within
a few minutes now you should see the
screen and then just wait for that email
I think probably we are all registering
all at the same time so it's probably
taking some time yeah I got my email you
guys sure about your email it's okay if
you are not got it
we wait for a few minutes so I'll just
click on this link which is given in the
email and this is my user ID so what
I'll do is I'll just store my email ID
it's anywhere there in your email but
still just for quick reference right you
you have an issue in last one so you
mean in the the username
I think oddity okay so is it like saying
it's already being used or something you
can just try to make it unique because
maybe there is someone who's all I was
having the same type of user ID right I
don't know if you are given a email id
I'm sure unless you have not used it
before you should not be given this
problem but you feel register to before
with the same email id maybe just make a
small change right just add some number
something that will make it look like
even I have the same problem so I
already have a ID card or you know they
were on their sub DC so I just included
their one s of ec2 right just to make it
unique but my email ID remains the same
okay so I will just do this for my
sister my environment so so just
so just type in a password that you can
easily remember just view this that's
okay if you want to put in your right
details feel free to do because this
would be a question right if you forgot
your password done but that's what they
mean
just remember the question secret
security question that you're given
right that's more important
okay great I think more detail also
through so just do this you should have
got the email by now all of you and do
to say a change password just note down
your user ID and password somewhere in
mod Parador know whatever tools that you
use regularly right so this is your
Salesforce screen okay so we'll take
some quick tour of the inner of the
Salesforce and around one right the
first time we are seeing it I will say
show me later to this particular screen
pop-up that I have we will do our on to
write so this is how the Salesforce
cream looks for some people who are
doing swinging for the first time right
so we'll see what are the different
areas that we should be aware of so
right at the top right you see the
Salesforce logo of course then you see
this mug coffee mug or or my guide with
sugar cubes and all that so this is
basically the icon they use to show
which release they are in right okay
sure I'll wait I think we need to on
saucer language once you have the
environment ready I would suggest
for time being you just don't do don't
play around at this point of mine but
once you get the registration done that
sometimes are a bit challenging for
sometimes so once you get in in logging
in you know I would suggest just look at
the screen that I am showing then you
can do this yourself later but ensure
that you have the inner onward ready
because for all the other things we need
a tournament in place right we can't
post it without their normal so give it
a few moments while we wait if there are
any questions from anyone you can just
type in there sure sure take your time
unit no problem I hope others are all
able to make progress there is an issue
let me know I'll help you out but it's
relatively easy process is this a 30 day
norm this is not a 30 day free trial
this is a different one so the teddy day
of free trial you get it from a
different you are right I think if you
go to salesforce.com
directly right so there they give you a
30 day trial which is more for a
business user they don't give you
options to do development and all that
they mostly they help you just play
around with a neuron but this one is
life kind you just use it and I've never
seen the sales horse get rid off any
developer I don't know that's another
great thing about them
I'm sure thousands and thousands of
people are signing up and I'm amazed how
they are able to provide a free
development environment on the cloud in
just two minutes right it's just
unbelievable right it's not just like a
Gmail or Facebook right
you just use it as a user but this one
you do development it's there on the
cloud and it's there forever it's
available for differ by seven and if
there is an outage they view but there
is an outage that's the great thing it's
asked if stated line of production and
run one right and they give you out edge
window of just five minutes I've seen
outages window for developer a
tournament and it's just five minutes
that's it sometimes maybe half not a few
of us and they do it pretty much in the
night midnight PST
right so that's the unbelievable part of
this product good I think everyone's
ready I'll warn so this is your screen
okay this is where you're going to do
all your stuff and if you will take one
by one right so this is the logo
Salesforce logo with the cloud lobe and
all that this shows that the latest logo
for the release so this basically
represents winter 16 release right I
will show you how you can verify that
what are the latest release and all that
there is wonderful wonderful
communications there to the
over-communicate right Salesforce about
the releases and all that so for time
being just assume that you are on winter
16 okay so they have three releases like
a stag night winter summer and it's big
yeah so this is a global search window
we will look at this later don't worry
okay then this is my profile right this
is my user ID that I were used
so whatever usually overused it's going
to display here right click on this you
have my profiles my settings a developer
console and logout time being I'm not
going to do anything here just leave it
as this then you know setup window then
you our help and then this is an
interesting piece how some apps and I
will just click on it if they'll just
observe what happens right going to
click on it
you can see some things are changing
here right just just make a note of this
right I will pick up another app I'll
pick up all Center right
so you know observe that there are some
changes coming in when you contact the
tabs are changing here right so these
are tabs basically these are links this
is your Home tab right then this is your
shaft our window we see about shattering
all the amount of scatter is a
collaboration pool which is similar to
Facebook and you can call it Facebook
for the enterprise right
just keeping all these claims which are
popping up you just ignore them for time
being right then go to sales you will
see more terms right so let's try to
understand what these are right so when
I click on say outcomes right of leaves
let's see what comes up I click on use
our ones so then I click on accounts
before then what I will do is I will
just erase this I also do one more thing
I just close this particular window okay
so basically you can download the
Salesforce um app on your mobile device
if you have a smartphone on Android or
on iOS right I think they are to provide
a support for Windows platform I think
they will do it probably pretty so you
can download it and just install it
don't do it now we have a separate
module to just tell you how to do all
that but probably after the session you
can just try downloading I'm sure you
have installed several apps no harm and
you can use the same user ID password
and just player right I'll close this
just to create some space click on
accounts sorry contacts so if you look
at the contacts it shows certain things
right so there is a list here it shows
all
and acts then you have some other
filters right
so these are some contacts which are
available in the system there are twenty
part X right one to YT so they provided
you some sample data like sample records
and let's click on a contact right Tim
bar become name is Grand Hotel's
and so there are some data is visible
right so this is your screen write
default screen that's available
it shows the contact detail you start
taking bar it shows this you know all
these Facebook Twitter and all these
handles I'm not going to click on
anything now you can do it later
it's just that they show you if you
provide the right details they will pick
up these things then we just look at
this contact be denied so you have cause
back wall I am unable to see
come come okay can you just see which
are your selected here
you just select sales and I think you
should see that phone tap or other tabs
if you're selected some other app
probably it will show something else
let's say if I select this right it
probably may not show you the opponent
up right because icon tap is not part of
the town so just take a look and okay
thanks finish so I will come back to
this red contacts and one just a like I
said earlier don't worry about lying
around right now you just look at what I
am doing because I will be highlighting
a lot of important stuff that you need
to understand right so this is a filter
right you can create new filters also
say for example my contacts right it
will show you only your contacts will
show you new this week right we said
preview the contacts I think we just
sorting bound all contacts stuff London
you can create your own filters here
where I filled up right I will say else
here I will select all contacts we just
do some filtering here right and put in
some condition maybe I don't know what
we can cook right so maybe we can try
something
let's just say maybe country right
hoping country has some data now to look
at the data right before I put them to
fill top maybe I'll just do this very
easy one select the filter here yeah
facts and numbers yeah I'll just pick up
some flavor yeah so I'll just say mister
and maybe I want to see our adopt us I
don't want to be something biased so I
just ship doctor and professes right
let's see if you have any doctors and
purposes who has this validation so you
can use any field okay it just sucked
you set the filter looks like there are
no drug person so that's okay yeah so do
you want us to do right now there is a
question yeah better you just watch what
I'm doing and then you have some labs
where you will be asked to do some of
these things plus you can always watch
the demo for exploring these things that
it will be good if you can just watch so
that it's easy for you because you can
focus on what I am saying right and then
you can play so we will remove this
salvation maybe I think I will have to
go with
there's a bit of a delay he usually
doesn't come so slow so I'll just go
with mr. means missus of the house and
be sure most people be there yeah
so there are 19 people right so we are
19 people so we have filter of what of
you right so you can add different
filters here right different statuses
say different countries and stuff like
that you can see different details let
us click a customer a particular contact
and look at some details it so this is
the contact Warner name so it is going
to show your name here because what they
do is they just go over the data for you
in your name so when you create the
environment whatever name you are given
and logged in with whatever who is
logged in here they show all the records
in their name so they show you the all
the details right then and then these
are certain opportunities which are
against this particular case or contact
right there are no approach of this but
there are some cases related to this
particular person right remaining things
are not there as you go along you can
create more things right you can create
a say a new task follow say a and say
and see I give a date that I will say
followed by number v so I will get an
alert right it will put it on your
calendar then you can set up status for
that asks you know even powers something
like and you can put it on meeting our
comments right follow on the previous
meeting water or it just put some tasks
chattering lined up and all that right
these are very simple things right so
this is very useful for active device
because you can put in all the details
that you have about the contact and you
will get the remainders
you can do open activities within logger
call you can send an email the question
of bed you can do some campaigns you can
put in some modes and add some files
write all that stuff so what we have
seen here is right you have seen a
particular contact detail this is a
record in the database you just be
displayed here and it also shows you
opportunities cases and open activities
these are some more related records
right we can see that you have
opportunities here
yeah yeah I'll Aditya I will come to
your question it's a good question I
will come to that right so let's look at
opportunities right this is another tab
so these are all standard tabs and
standard out stuff that is available
right so contacts is stored in probably
an object called contacts or a table
right or say opportunities are stored in
a you know just show you for the benefit
of some of you right I'm sure all of you
are familiar with using an excel and
looking at in the table of formats right
so if if someone is not sure about what
I am talking about in terms of records
and tables right we'll just give you a
quick analogy here so so this is a list
of opportunities here right so there are
31 opportunities right there in
different stages and we will study about
opportunities accounts contacts all that
right so we have a model dedicated for
sales cloud in our module dedicated for
service code which is basically the call
center right so we'll understand more
about these accounts contacts you know
and few other things that cases
opportunities and all these the
contracts you'll see them more form from
a functional point of view right we have
two modules which talk about functional
aspects in sales cloud and sales car but
here we are just trying to understand
that you know I have accounts that click
on accounts tab it shows me account
details right
so this is similar to what you have in a
spreadsheet right say I have one sheet
called accounts they may have one mo
sheet for contacts right I can have one
more shade called opportunities away so
here I will type in some details right
so each row represents one particular
account right each if I go to contact
each row is a contact without
opportunity feature is a option so you
can type in more details here all right
you can add some fields like what we see
here right so I'm sure all of you would
be able to appreciate this in case you
our problem let me know I'll explain
this right so these are basically tabs
right
where the question from one is the
changes done here will you also be
covering those changes available own way
you mean if I make changes on the mobile
app will they be visible here a
vice-versa
is that the question okay yeah so you
can see the same content of course the
layout will look a little different but
yes you can see the same data of them
available so right you can see some of
these tabs you may not see all the tops
or if they show it in a slightly
different way the UI is slightly
different but yes you can see the same
data okay so these are some records
right so when I click on the tab it
shows the records inside that particular
top or inside that write this line your
tabs or excel sheets right different
sheets
so just remember that the tabs are like
your sheets in the Excel right click on
them you show glowing records now one
level further right this is stored
somewhere right so in the excel sheet we
know that we very well know not in the
excel sheet that they are stored inside
the excel sheet in the form of it's a
file right on your hard disk you can go
to the hard disk double click that and
open but it has certain limits yeah
so you I'm sure many of you would have
seen database also so these are all
called database objects or tables right
so tables are objects represent the
storage space or the logical storage
unit so you will have different objects
that you have account object will have a
contact object you have opportunity
objects and you store accounts in
Arkansas object user context and content
of the something right and of course the
tab is the visual element right so those
of you have worked in Java or.net
c-sharp I object-oriented programming
and even other three tier architecture
and all of it but ever heard about MVC
right MVC Model View controller so I'll
talk about in a little later
just remember this word MVC Model View
controller so salesforce supports this
MVC basic pattern so any application
right I always look at it this way I can
do only four things in a system it
doesn't mean it doesn't I don't care oh
that is my new frame s4 under SAV Oracle
whatever doesn't matter anything you can
do only for functions right
and data you can modify data you can
read the data or you can then you can
add or modify delete and dream or in
technical terms it's called as curve
let's see are you be crud right create
vexy are you denied create read update
delete or I always say add modify 10
each pain I don't there is nothing else
you can do in a system right and the way
you store things right just like you
store it in an axle you type things and
soidier you use database because Excel
sheets have limitations you can store
too much data then you can't link up
columns or contacts and opportunities
beyond a point it becomes a big mess let
Excel sheets are always troublesome
beyond the point of course finally many
customers can use Excel sheets for many
purposes it's always handy but still
Salesforce is definitely flexible
compared to other systems and people
have a higher adoption risk
I will tell you why write how they
manage to do that so but coming to this
you can only do this right add modify
delete only that's it just remember this
and then the other thing I told you is
MVC right I do have a slide for this but
I'm just typing in this okay Model View
controller what it means is right again
Model View and controller it's nothing
but model is nothing but data or the
data model where you have this structure
right for our phones I have a structure
I have contacts because if I store say
account one then I show contact one
right and I store opportunity one
everything in one sheet it becomes a
thickness right logically we always even
when you use excel sheet what I do I'd
say
account one upon two accounts three
accord for I want to store similar and
data similar records in sorry to the
wrong sheet that's okay so it is one two
stores
rated things in a same you know table
right say contact one contact to like
this right so similarly in database also
you create storage structure or the
table or the objects in the US so in
such a way that you store similar things
in the same thing right so that it's
optimized the storage is optimized right
so that's what it is right then you
store it right like I said you do add a
modified element right and reader so I
need to present it on the screen right
for the end user because the end user
there is no other way he can now see the
data or edited right so this is my end
user view I do not care where the data
is stored I don't care about our DBMS
DBMS I don't care what it is I don't
know what it is
it'll ease for all I see is a table I
see some data and click on it and I'll
edit it right I'm leaves bothered where
the data comes now when I am an end user
I just want to see the view maybe I
change something here and change it make
some changes and just feel I don't care
what happens when I click sale when I
open it again I want to ensure whatever
I say it has changed I mean whatever I
changed is same
that's all I'm moving over so this is a
view layer but some presentation layer
right how you present things is a
front-end right so like your car
dashboard right you you press some
buttons or you turn on your ignition key
the car engine starts you don't care
what happens inside of the engine under
the hood I turned on the key the car
started I switch to my automatic gear or
especially first gear second gear and
press the axle with my car moves those
are the visual elements but I don't care
what happens inside but something is
going to take care of moving things
between the database is climbed on the
screen accepting the user changes
stirring it back at available right
there is someone in between who does all
this dirty job that's the controller
with a controller takes care of all your
logic it has a certain validations right
so for example phone number means you
should only type number it should be
kept digital on data but means it should
be of some format you cannot put clear
up with us put it right here to put some
other date the past or you should have
an age of 30 or 20 right or things like
that right so validations and all that
right business logic the controller
layer takes care of that so typically
Salesforce when I have picked this right
when I click Saviour several things have
happened in the background which I am
least bothered about as an end-user but
as a developer or the even as an admin
as an IT guy I need to understand
something is happening behind the
screens just displaying data and storing
it right so that's about your MVC
and crud right so Salesforce supports
all this good stuff that you would have
heard in your other technology right so
let's look at some of the building
blocks right so we saw some apps we saw
some we when we just discussed about
objects I get into the object it show
you what is an object in action right so
what I am seeing here is a developer
view right
I usually suggest is you go to set up
right you just right-click this open it
in a new tab just keep these two tabs
side two next to each other the reason I
do this is just for saving time ease of
use nothing else there is nothing else
about it
this is my user of you right I don't
want to see anything technical here
right I just want to see data business
you this one when I click on setup menu
right this takes you to the
administrator or developer mode right so
this is available only to that system
under sugar not all users can see this
view right
so if you observe the left hand side the
menu options which are there here you
have force.com home we have some more
options we will see these things later
so the most important thing that you do
from your discourse perspective is this
area right you do a lot of
administration stuff you do lot of build
build is nothing but you create our
develop right you play it upwards
classes triggers and all that you
customize existing objects right
existing functionality you create apps
objects and all that so we will look at
all of these one by one because this is
our play area but you can do deployments
you can monitor things and don't think
you do everything from the factor like I
said at the beginning you can use rasca
ID of course you have a developer
console also we will see these things
towards the later part of their course
right so initial power of the course
would be more declarative right that's
how the certification also structured in
Salesforce it's very important to
understand the
building moves so we saw taps we saw
some apps list of apps the question in
your mind will be how will I create my
own taps family create my own apps how
do I do it right and we'll see how to do
that right so click on setup here okay
and then go to
we'll go to customize and just show you
a few things if you remember we looked
at account object right so let's see
find the amount of the so this is a
developer town administrator view okay
it's about more of a developer view but
yes administrator can also see this
functional guys can also see this right
so these have a feels in the account
object right you knock on name number
one our site let's see how it looks here
on the front end right click on this
account okay so this is basically the
account from our user will get account
Warner name phone number type in this
311 new billing address so you can see
all these fields are available here
right so all the fields are some data
types standard data tiles like it can be
name it can be text I will tell you
waters look up later you have thick list
until you give an example currency
address you know long text number
decreased again fax hierarchy for right
all of these types right so URL you know
you can ask you also have email data
types right so you have some ready-made
fields available in the system already
so account is a standard object okay
account is a standard object and it has
some standard fields okay then you can
also create some custom fields ibaka
suppose you do an analysis of your
requirements as a functional consultant
the first thing you have to do is come
here and see can I map the requirements
to the fields available here right so
that's why it is important for the
functional consultant as well as a
developer to understand right as well as
an administrator because arbitrator
would be doing lot of stuff
so I see that we are I need something
new I don't think I can manage my
requirements with this fear I want to
create a new field or a condo object go
ahead and click click it here and people
okay then I want to set some validation
rules so what are they so what are
validation rules very simple validation
rules just perform validations your data
like I said it for mark it's not about
date format it's more of say age should
be greater than 30 right or age or say
your salary
minimum number of years of experience
you know things like that should be 510
so some basic violations that you went
to right I'm sure who someone who had an
UI in JavaScript or if you used any
package you know Graham violation expect
for a fee then you can do so many other
things will come to these later
you see what is a page layout right so
there are different page layouts here
will click on one page layout that's
available here we see why you need
multiple page layouts later so this is
my page layout as the name says it is a
visual thing right it's a layout it's a
visual thing so if you look at this
right does it look familiar does these
things look familiar to this right
account on our account name whatever you
see here right it's basically picked up
from here right there are some sections
account information header account on
trust additional information so you see
some of the things that maybe this is a
different layout which is big discredit
but we come to them
so these are some of the fields which
are available on the page layout so if
you look at them view right this is the
template for your page layout right and
this is what is displayed here on the
screen okay this is all the data that is
available in the system okay so we'll go
back we'll come to this later we have a
good number of things to understand from
here we'll picked up a bit later you
just click on one more layout right but
just see if this little symbol is the
page layer VCR
looks like at least a dance sequence
right so we have ways to find out which
page load is getting the spread we will
talk about those topics a little bit
later right so if you see these are some
of the later things contacts
opportunities also this clean what you
see here is basically from one of these
page layouts okay so page layout is that
form on the screen which kind of man
eclipses all the things which are
Bisquick so it links what is there in
the excel sheet or in the sorry at the
table and displays it on the screen
right that's the sequence right there is
a logical relationship now let's see
some I think we saw the account object
and the fields right then we saw the
damps then we look at some tabs also
length so I think more than the tab here
we see some more objects like okay we
have contact object right so just like
you are the contacts here we have a
contact object their fields validation
rule page layouts you know and some more
things we understand all of this in the
discourse now I don't want these objects
all I want to do is how my one object
and my own arms right so we see how to
do this right so we will just go to this
slide just for the sake of ensuring we
unpack right to do so
the most important building block is the
app right then you know the tab in the
off page layout right then you have
objects so you have standard objects
like accounts contacts and all the other
stuff and of course you also have custom
objects right I want to create my own
custom object how do I do it
they go to setup build create an objects
click on custom object here new custom
object I'll say my first object where
I'm just giving some name which I just
put in the same name here okay and put
in some description go with all the
default options which are here don't
worry about changing them now and you
can have a data type selector for this
particular field right so the there is a
field which is created which is called
the name right name field which is a
field which is available in all the
objects you can select it as a text or
auto number and auto number is just
something like this right say if you do
it like this you will start with the a
zero zero one zero zero two as you
create more records we will see this in
action you will understand it better I
leave the remaining things unchecked I
will not do any changes here will this
view will see all these options in
detail okay just I am quickly creating
an object right so I better my first
object right that's a great thing
very simple object so this is my first
object this is a custom object so when
you say custom object what it means is I
have created an object myself
okay screener swing so is are you saying
that I should go a bit slow but if they
are is it like you have some mister ones
advancing we want me to go slow
I'm a gripping too fast cocaine sorry
we'll go slow sorry about that I will
come back I created my first custom
object I clicked on setup okay I'll just
go back again then I could build then
objects way under create I see my first
object right this is my object that I
have later just now I click on this
object right so this is my first object
okay so my first object underscore
underscore
you
my first object underscore underscore C
so if I look at my object which is a
standard object right account now come
to object will not have this underscore
underscore C okay so that is one
important point you need to
differentiate between account object or
a standard object and a custom object
okay so you just try to understand this
menu it will take some time don't worry
you just play around click around here
and there
so when you see customize you see all
standard objects that can be customized
right these are standard objects
available in the system already created
for you each have their own fields you
can go ahead and customize them okay
whereas when you do create you creating
your own custom objects you will see
list of custom objects when you click on
this create and then go to objects so
you should know where to look for
standard objects you should know where
to look for custom objects so this
custom objects are available here under
customize build the customers then start
objects are available here in create 10
objects so go to my first object it has
a name right which is being displayed
here plus an underscore underscore see
what this means is it's a custom of the
tips more of a programmatic or APA name
right which is referred internally
within Salesforce we'll see these things
later what are the different fields
Wrightson we'll look at standard fields
right so any object will have these
standard fields created by last modified
by name right or with an auto number
then one let's just go back to
one sample record here right so if you
look at this you have an account owner
right so like this you have Warner for
this object but who is the owner of this
record right that's what it shows then
it has created by large mode available
you look at this here
created by last modified way it shows
some auditing data basic data right so
then you have a name field here I think
they are having our core name just a
text whereas in our custom object we
have used a automatic number okay
so these are some standard fields
available in the system you can also add
some custom fields so the point to
remember here is standard objects will
have standard fields and custom fields
what is the question here we believe
you're not done that why is it showing
you then you mean this data that we have
created there is a question from beneath
he says okay what is he cooking boggling
to knock on wood yeah yeah so you're
asking why it is showing my name right
yeah
the reason is like a I think I highlight
at this point when you create your
sample and run with or developer
environment Salesforce creates some data
for you right and since I have given my
name yeah when you register for the in
the wrong right
it has used that username because it is
the only username available and it has
created to the Warner US my name so even
though I did not create this it has
given me sample data right it has border
sample data at the time of loading
sample data it has used the one-and-only
username that is available in this
environment if you go to your
environment
right you go to your everyone mind you
will see your name you will see that the
same Burlington tech sales of America is
available in each and every environment
it will show your name right and yes you
can change the known you can change the
owner of a record right
say for example I can click here and
click on change I can change the owner
you know at this point of time I don't
think there are any users the system we
are not crater in users right so you can
once you have new users created you can
change the ownership of the records you
can change the ownership to other people
right yeah that can be done and it's a
very important question that you asked
it's a good question because
a lot of things negative security right
is different on this particular field so
that way it's a great question
it will sets a base for us to do more
important to this field right the wound
up and created or by and modified by and
all that right so that's a great
question okay it doesn't show this
sample data I think see you if you just
click on I think I have a question from
Smith on just answering that so if you
click on accounts right and I think you
just have to select the filter and just
click on go right sometimes it up it
picks up the data automatically in
certain sequence and I think in certain
zeros you have to click on the pool once
you click on go you will see all these
records it's standard stuff any
developer environment will have this
data right just for our understand so
the point to remember here is the
original point I was highlighting is
standard object standard fields and
custom beams right so these are some
standard objects accounts or leads or
campaigns and contacts so these are the
standard objects in the standard or
sorry these are standard fields in the
standard object called upon right then
you also have custom fields on the
standard object at the same time you
also have
custom objects that will have standard
fields and custom fees okay
so just remember this these are certain
things which will be useful right okay
how the message is my screen stock let
me just click on something else I don't
know if my screen a stock if you have a
problem let me know if there is nothing
visible on your screen right okay so so
we're just looking at them building
blocks right absolutely from showing
some of the window so yeah I'll go to
the slide again right so we looked at a
page layout we looked at an app we
looked at some objects we quickly look
at tab how do I create my time because
without having a tab I cannot see my
data on the screen way so once again go
to setup go to the left hand side go to
build create terms
okay so we have apps you have to label
see how objects and tabs so we quickly
see how I can create a tab and then I
will also create a app right so these
are the key building blocks right I
click on custom object tab okay we will
see these other tabs later we'll be
talking about them but just remember
there are four types of tabs that have
been cleared and there is some
information about each okay I am
creating a custom object
so when I click on a custom object tab
it says link to a an object so the only
object is there is my first object that
I created right this is only custom
objects ok and then I select tab style
yeah so there is a question there is a
tab related to the Excel table yes for
understanding point of view definitely
yes it's an easy way to remember right
that it is similar to the Excel tab
right when you click on a tab or the
worksheet here right you see the Pacific
data that way you can say this is
similar to the worksheet in itself so I
click on some style this is just you I
think there is nothing great here it
will just show you some logo or some
icon that you say right select something
okay stamp style and don't do anything
else just leave it as is click on next
leave the all the default where don't
worry about this right now I will
explain this later when we talk about
security and all that and then okay this
one right so I'll just give you a minute
just to see the screen okay does this
make any sense to anyone of you platform
sales call center marketing have you
seen this anywhere
yes yeah I think I saw a response from
quite a few lugar great so these are
apps okay so what you are being asked
difference do you want to associate
disturb to the following apps
okay so since this is a custom app or
custom tab that I have created I would
just leave it I'll probably uncheck
against a few things okay I will remove
it from here here here you know I don't
want to see it everywhere probably want
to see it in a few places just for my
understanding later I will create my own
app and link it to the app that I want
to create okay no I have big data now
okay so let's see if it's visible
anywhere call center at least it doesn't
show up here right it doesn't show up in
the tabs here let me check on sales I
think we are having too many tabs here
but if you see here it shows my first
object right we selected the tab to be
visible on that my first object will
also see how I can bring this to the
friend later but their's are all basic
things very simple simple things don't
worry about them you can you rearrange
the tabs and all visually we can do a
lot of stuff which I will not be worried
too much about at this point of time
okay as you play around you will find
out yourself a lot of these basic things
okay so I don't think I will see it here
on content right I don't see it so I
have associated on my tab to some apps
and this associated from
some other dubs right some other apps
okay so I have successfully grated on my
first tab I've associated a custom
object to a custom pan okay I will go to
setup again develop and one more thing I
need to do is so I not develop
I will go to create I have to create an
app that's one more thing which is
pending right I'll click on app so these
are the list of apps right I'll talk
about sub tab apps and kinda wraps later
we don't worry about them more click new
okay I am going to create a new create a
custom app just go with the default
options for now so let's say my first
custom app okay
I will click on next you can have your
own logo and all that stuff these are
visual things not going to worry about
this now go with default custom is these
stuff later
see now this is the interesting part
right so earlier you only created a tab
and linked it to a now you can you
create an app you decide the tabs that
you want to see right every app will
have a hometown let me add a few tabs
I want accounts I want maybe contacts
there is my first object yeah this is my
first object compact I'll link it here
I'll just keep four tabs
I can change my landing tab I'll just
keep it as my home tab I don't want to
worry too much about it so I am just
changing my security right don't worry
about this now this is a security
feature just select visible to all
profiles okay we will see to this later
time being we will skip this this is
module four and five security right so
now I have created a map okay let me
come to my user window try to use these
two windows so that you can just
differentiate between user window I'm
the developer window right can you see
it my custom my first customer right so
I have successfully created an app let
me click on an app let me see what
happens
great so I see the tabs that I selected
right so I click on accounts I click on
my first object you are not going to
have any records here right because this
is your crashing option say you're
supposed to did not create it and I do
my new first object there are no fields
because we are not worried about adding
any custom fields right click on sale
let's see your arms
so even though you did not have any
custom fields you did have some standard
fields right so I created a new record
so I've created a new record on the
custom object and this custom of the
does not have any custom fields but it
has some standard fields the first
standard field is is 0 0 1 if you
remember bird objects go to first object
I hope I'm going slow and sorry if I'm
clicking fast I try to be slow if you
remember this Auto number right name
field every object standard and custom
of the will have a field called name
field which is a standard field again it
will be of type texture auto number here
we give a format a 0 0 0 and auto number
and we said it should be starting with 1
right so that's what has come that right
this is the auto number 1 right so it
has created a record with standard
fields right owner all this is showing
my name because I am the owner I think
of it right and it it doesn't make any
sense because there is no field that you
can indeed right just click on cancer
and click on my first object again I'll
show you one more record because I want
to show you how the auto number works
right just clicking on sale I'm braiding
one more recording that's it a is zero
zero two interesting right so it creates
the auto number which is not a great
thing there are many wonderful products
which to this sales force it's this is a
very pretty feature in changeless but
the thing is are
marissa the number it's right it's an
auto number it's on the name field right
so this is the name field that is being
this barrier and it just keeps creating
records you don't have custom fields on
the record Rick so we create a rap you
created a tab associated with the tab to
the app and also the associate of the
tab to the object right and then we
created some networks just to show a few
things let us just create one week
custom field right you just want to show
one field so click on new and we create
a very very simple field maybe a phone
number right you are also many options
here we'll understand these options
later but I am just creating a phone
number field okay
customer phone can put in description if
you want L say always repair a field
right with this a mandatory field
don't worry about default value and all
that no go with this step three don't
worry about it now right when you do the
labs also don't worry important then we
will click on save
I have created a custom field right so
standard fields are listed here and then
you have custom fields okay
this is our object definition under
objects you have this screen now let's
go to this window I will just refresh
this once so that it picks up the
changes we have done quickly right I'll
open existing record okay I'll open a
zero zero one click on edit
okay let me click on sale what happens
it says there is an error right because
customer phone we said it is on a degree
field so let me enter some number could
I select a cell phone number field or I
don't know I don't know the validations
that are there but we worry about the
validations data I just have to type in
some number just type in a number click
on save great so we have graded a a
custom field right and you put in some
number it is safe okay so we have
created one custom object crater one
custom field on the custom object okay
let's just go to the slide and see if
you can make sense of this right so we
created our vacated tab we did a page
layout
we created a record we graded a field we
created object right so these are the
building blocks which are related to
each other so I have also given you
where each stands in the MVC layer right
model-view-controller that I showed here
right so trying to understand this this
is very important to understand whatever
appears we surely right it's the view
layer right app is visual tab is visual
beige layer this visual web object is
nothing but this storage space right
I've given you some comparisons right
which will make you understand this
better what is an object I just go
through this if your our doubts we can
always discuss then we looked at fields
we have not greater relationships we
will come to that later the crater
records and we have not graded we shall
first page and all these things the last
three we are not done we'll come to them
later right I have given some
descriptions and all this year okay I
will leave it to you to read okay leave
it for you to read for now but the new
out routes do not hesitate when you read
it you want to come back to me in the
next session I will be more than happy
to explain again okay because the video
should be available for you within
anything five to six hours then also the
slides are available right away so you
can always play out right when if you
have free time so go to the next slide I
will skip this for now okay I will come
to this slide later nothing very great
about this just general knowledge it
will come to this later we covered this
with some example model view controller
so model stands for the data the objects
right database as RTC object and record
elements
we use the user interface the controller
is the one which controls everything
right and these are the examples they
talked about a few things from Java word
also just to give you an idea I hope
this information is useful so any any
value of alright any you will be asked
this basic question whether you say your
refresher where you say your advanced
java guy right the period question that
is asked is what is MVC and there are
many people trust me they can explain
this it's very simple concept just give
examples like I gave you are creating a
good fast equation but many people fail
me recently I interview someone in I'd
like to have someone who was an
architect also with me just hire this
person was at our experience puzzling
this equation was algae's can you tell
me MVC and Mark is maybe some example
they could not explain so please
understand this is very important and
very easy also I would say very easy to
spend nothing there it's not rocket
science
wait and it looks scary but it can be
explained by anyone you can be a
technical rare you can be a functional
value even the admin just remember the
examples I gave you
MVC right add modify delete right just
remember this just remember these things
that's it there is nothing so great
about it
move to the next slide so what we are
going to do is right we are going to
create a student app by student master
ah we define our own requirements I we
will try to see how we can build it up
ah okay
so this is simple use case that we are
given for time being I'll let you folks
read through these slides okay
very basic thing nothing very difficult
we will be talking about the student app
in detail in the next session time being
just imagine you are in a college or
university or in your school you are
using some student app your professors
or your principal is tracking student
details you know basic information about
student when Department their email ID
name phone number whatever the marks the
grades their requests for leave or
stationery whatever right you want to
automate a college or a university or
school right whatever you call it
depending on very odd right you can
define your own requirements you can
make it as it operate as you want like I
said in the beginning we will keep it
simple
we just do five or six objects then
create them play all the logic here
right so the security model will come to
the security model slide when we talk
about security model time being you may
not understand this but I think those of
you who have experience in other
technologies you have done many projects
I am sure you will understand this and
you will probably come with more
challenging and complex requirements
than what I have given here right those
of you are new don't worry we'll be
going in detail we be going doing this
and we make it as easy as possible for
you so don't worry about that okay just
think what you will do if you are
running a college yourself when if you
are the senior management of the college
if you are the principal I want
agreement I want to automate things I
want to do it online don't even worry
about Salesforce but you are not an IT
guy for time being you're a business
owner you will start your spell out
whatever comes to your mind right put it
in a simple notepad
just spell out what you want right then
we will discuss that in the next session
indeed it ok I do I think at this point
of time I do not want to get into the
requirements definition and it's almost
like you're coming to the close of the
3-hour window so I will quickly spend
some time on the assignments right so
you can download the assignments or you
can also see it here on the window right
so against each and every module apart
from the first module first module is
pure Theory module 2 has a assignment
right you can download this file also I
think it is available as a separate link
I am sure all of you have done the task
one you signed up for a free environment
and we will do this ok you can just do
this on yours by yourself you can read
the instruction and do this I'll be an
idiot talking about this you know I
created a different app I said I created
a my custom app you can create a student
master app and try creating some tabs
all that right I showed you some good
amount of demos they create a custom
object understand page layout we have
not done search layout we'll do that
tomorrow don't worry about it so some of
the things if they are not very clear
don't worry you can come back after we
cover certain things tomorrow you can do
it but I think we simply straight
forward stuff that we have given four or
five tasks which will cover whatever we
have done so far right we also have our
document let me just click on this
I think some you sure this uploader
don't worry about this I show you this
document I will get it uploaded properly
a some minor issue on the website but I
think we'll take care of that so excuse
me so so what we have done is we are
providing a simple Excel shade right it
is partially filled okay it is partially
filled augment and you just use it as a
reference
okay so we have defined some
requirements okay so we I have removed
it deliberately from this sheet the
reason is I will just want people to
think on their own to type in your
account like I said you think you are
the management right you're running a
college you're running a university what
will you expect
what will you capture and students I eat
what I do usually is I take an excel
sheet right all of us are very familiar
with in Sochi this is what I usually do
if I want to capture student detail what
do I need to do right I will skip first
name last name email for city department
maybe Adam heart I mean the terms of
fathers mean water right email ID so
but can we find this document so this is
basically available under the modules
right if you go to my courses you should
see this but I think there is some small
glitch here right I think we are able to
see the document here but I will sort
this or we'll get this sorted out and
ensure you guys don't have a problem all
right if there is an issue I will fill
anyway I think we will find out a way to
share this with you guys right that
should not be an issue don't worry but
if you see the excel sheet it's pretty
simple
yeah they will tell you what we need to
do for tomorrow so you can finish it
those tasks that we are given write four
or five I already you're done creating
the login app login in the run window on
that so thing to write think through the
objects or the tables that you will
create that is basically your data model
for your student app so I am showing you
some samples here so this is the object
or the table i grade these are the field
names so student master will have email
ID the name Department they are joining
get over the edge status whole number
total box
average number of subjects passed number
of sub just fade you will don't have to
create these now so what I suggest as
thing to don't have to create these
fields in the database in the system if
you want to play it go ahead and clear
no issues we will do it any number of
times because these environments are
very flexible you have enough Headroom
I'm not stopping you from doing anything
between now or tomorrow just thing to
like more than creating something here
right just think through as a you order
as a designer and you will get familiar
with these things within a week or two
right
all these menu options and all this
anyway you have the recordings available
you have very detailed labs which we
have you the assignments we will tell
you click on setup click on the click on
all of them you will get friendlier
right just like you're driving a car
maybe we should few days you don't know
where your controls aren't right but you
will get the more picky it ask you moron
so think through great feelings that you
think are learned then think about marks
right so those of you who are familiar
with data modeling I'm sure you can do a
lot of stuff yeah just feel free and
others don't worry don't get bogged down
that you are new to this just think in
excel sheet right think in an excel
sheet
what will I capture it's your
imagination I leave it to you you don't
worry about this file right you do it in
your own format later I'll share this
this is not a showstopper for you go
ahead and create certain things right
certain data if you want put in some
software data so just let's create a
simple excel sheet first because that's
the starting point I would usually use
right then slowly we will see how this
application can be developed in
Salesforce right so that would be the
approach because it makes it easy I'm
sure all of us are quite familiar with
Excel sheets so I always prefer to do it
that way what we will do is we will
spend more time on the
we do grading Lots define little bit on
historic top application so I will
probably take in some inputs from you
folks tomorrow right
and then also we'll take some questions
we'll do some of the fish what we have
done then we look into them next set of
modules we will look at how to create
data or lo2 create the objects
relationships and fields put in more
type of fields that what are the
different relationship which are
available but we will talk a little bit
more on those in the tomorrow's session
all right so basically these two three
models will give you a nice foundation
to start with then if you look at it be
how models four and five which are
security related right there are a lot
of things related to security and then
security is a very very important topic
we will spend a lot of time of us we
keep revisiting this multiple times then
you have business logic business process
automation then we have some functional
motives right and then if you see we
have a good number of modules or app its
programming inception hardening triggers
BML visualforce and all that so this is
a very very good foundation right this
serves as a very good foundation for
people who want to become advanced
developers and the initial modules are
all thought all the people because
everyone has to know like I said anyone
joining Salesforce as an employee is
expected to clear the four
certifications four or five
certifications no matter what role
you're been your architect your designer
you are a manager your sales engineer
your solution architect they don't care
everyone has to go through the
foundation
right so that's why we've designed this
course this way because they expect that
people know these basic things and then
it's up to you you do what at once
things you you know want to do right so
I will take a pause here I will just see
if there are any questions and I would
like to hear or you know look at your
feedback in terms of are you okay with
this approach in terms of what I am
doing showing you some demos then
showing you the BPD's so from now on it
will be more of PPT
sorry more of demo you know we'll be
starting more time on the screen system
I'll limit myself to the PPT just to
ensure I not missed you know any topic
right and I always like to look at the
objectives towards the end once more
right beginning you don't know what
you're doing this will gues give us okay
you know I have covered all these right
that's what it shows so I know there are
some things I am not covered and I am
not covered point number five oh sorry
one two three five year not covered
about object limit I are not covered
scourge the Earth's not covered about
0.3 so two and three but I will do it
there tomorrow right so if you just
gives me a map that what how much I'm
sticking to the agenda but if there is
any specific feedback and the way I am
doing if you think I am too fast let me
know if you think I should be more
interactive if you think you need a
small break in between maybe a five
minute break because we have lots of
things to cover so think we don't want
to take a long break because it kind of
deviates takes away the focus but feel
free we'll try to make it as interesting
as possible like as if we are all
sitting in a classroom right I know we
are all virtually connected to each
other on the cloud but
assume that you're sitting in a room all
of us and see what we can make it to
make it better like if you want to talk
it will be happy to any of you guys
maybe you will be happy to talk right
the rather than just typing on the
question I'm more than happy to on you
