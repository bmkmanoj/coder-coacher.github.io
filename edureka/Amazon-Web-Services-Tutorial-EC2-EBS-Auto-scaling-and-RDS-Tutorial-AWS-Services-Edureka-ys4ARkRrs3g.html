webinar on cloud computing we are going
to talk about architecting in the cloud
specifically around AWS which is Amazon
Web Services so my name is savithri Roy
and I be your instructor tonight let me
just give you a quick introduction about
myself so I have about 15 years of
technology experience and I've been
using AWS for about six years now and
one of the things that I was involved in
was the design build and maintenance of
a AWS infrastructure supporting a SAS
business a software the sir as a service
business and I was also managing the PNL
of a technology products business and in
that role I had to grapple with cost
optimization of the AWS infrastructure
this was for a product which was one of
the largest databases of its kind and we
had a very large cost problem with both
the compute and the storage side right
so that's a lot of the things I did so
as you know this is a short webinar on
cloud computing and this is the agenda
what we will do is we will talk about
the basic cloud computing definitions
and concepts we'll talk about attributes
such as pay as you go
service models such as platform of the
service all right so this is general
cloud computing and that will spend
about 10 to 15 minutes on on these ideas
in the second section we'll look at
Amazon Web Services and we will
especially focus on a demonstration of
the AWS console all right AWS console is
where is the is the thing that you use
to manage your your infrastructure and
we will look at four key features of key
services of AWS so these are ec2 elastic
cloud compute which is
essentially the server's we look at EBS
elastic block store which is very
similar to hard disk volumes we will
also look at auto scaling this is a
really cool capability and using this
you can build a fleet of servers which
expand dynamically on their own and also
shrink on the world based on the
criteria that you specify okay and then
finally we will look at RDS this is the
relational database service which allows
you to manage your databases on on on
either place all right so I expect that
the demo will take about 30 to 40
minutes and we'll hopefully have about
10 minutes for questions and answers
but please note that please feel free to
ask questions during the webinar as well
again using the questions section of
your very knock panel all right okay so
let's go ahead I'm going to start with
the first section of our webinar which
is cloud computing so there's a bunch of
definitions out there and this is
Forrester Research definition as you can
see this is there's a lot of information
packed here I'm going to try and
highlight a few key ideas here so first
of all this is standardized right which
means there's no customization you use
what's available it's the same for it's
the same service that's available to
everybody
secondly you can see here that these
services are internet-based so you
access these services over the Internet
it's available from any computer which
is essentially the same thing it's since
it's available on the Internet
it's it's accessible from anywhere this
is important it's always available 24/7
365 days it scales automatically right
so actually you can scale it manually as
well but
scaling is where is a cool feature and
remember that you can scale up or down
automatically and you can also scale
horizontally which which is you can go
from one server to 210 or from 10 200
horizontally as well alright and a
couple of other things paper use this is
a really important paper use means that
you will be billed the way you were
billed for your electricity at home
right also your mobile song usage right
so this essentially means the more you
use the more you pay or the less you use
the less you pay all right
and finally this also means self service
so there's no intermediary here you have
your own account your own console and
you can request services on on your own
alright so this is a very good
definition very comprehensive definition
of cloud computing and when you try to
understand this when you try to digest
the various terms that we've covered
please try and compare cloud computing
to traditional hardware purchases right
so I don't know what your experience has
been with hardware purchases but in my
experience what we used to do is spec
out the hardware create a request or an
RFP in white tenders or bids then there
will be negotiation and you place the
order and then you'd get the hardware in
a few weeks time right so there
certainly weren't things like a peruse
right you would in a traditional
hardware purchase you a a lot of money
upfront and sometimes you pay an annual
maintenance fee which is typically
upfront as well right so you can see
from this definition that cloud
computing is very very different from
traditional
hardware purchases okay again let me
remind you please feel free to ask me
any questions I'll try my best to answer
them all right
let me move on to the next slide this is
basically we are diving a little deeper
into cloud concepts and end definitions
there's a lot of information here and
let's start with with the top we talked
about attributes or characteristics of
cloud computing so essentially the way
this works is there's a pool of
resources all right and the resources
can be compute resources or storage
resources or network resources and now
these are seemingly seemingly infinite
resources right so no matter how much
storage you want AWS will be able to
provide it no matter how many servers
you want a disk will be able to provide
it all right so it is seemingly infinite
and and then this pool of resources is
shared across many developers many
startups and many other companies right
and and let's look at the attributes now
so these resources are first of all
available broadly over the network over
the internet right so anybody anywhere
in the world can access these a second
thing is rapid elasticity which means
you can go from a small server to a very
large server right say a server which
has half a GB of RAM you can with the
click of a button change it to a server
which has 128 GB of RAM also
horizontally you can go from one server
to a thousand service if you like like
and it also works in the other way if
you need if you don't need the capacity
that you have you can shed that capacity
with just a few clicks of the mouse and
so this is this is rapid elasticity also
it's a measured service and you pay as
you go right again like utility pricing
in your electricity bill you are
measured in kilowatt hours right
similarly in your mobile bill you are
measured in minutes of talk time right
and in cloud computing you are measured
in
metrics such as server arts right so you
pay for on an hourly basis for service
that you're running if you shut down the
server right then you're not paid okay
similarly for storage you pay on the
basis of GB ox okay one GB one are you
pay a certain amount all right so this
is passive you are typically a it was
measures your usage and then builds you
on a monthly basis that's typically how
you have a and finally a this is on
demand and self service it so first of
all you have your own console there's no
intermediary and you can just sign on to
your console and request a server and
it's on demand because you get the
server immediately like in a few seconds
you can have a server up and running all
right so this is this is basically the
key attributes and again when you think
about these things please try and
compare cloud computing to traditional
hardware purchases and you will see that
cloud computing is much much better
right and this is a reason why it is
such a big trend and it's widespread
adoption is is almost a given all right
any questions on on cloud computing at
roots alright so I've got a question
here from Pavan and Rajiv and what
you're essentially saying it's what's
what's different between vertical and
horizontal scaling right okay that's a
good question so what happens is a
vertical scaling typically means you go
from a smaller server to a larger server
right so for example in AWS ec2 like
these are elastic lab compute servers
you have a choice of several server
sizes and also server server types right
so you could choose for instance a micro
instance and this has in some cases
about 2.6 GB of RAM right
and I think one CPU and but but then you
could easily switch to something much
larger right you could take a double
extra-large server and that probably has
128 GB of RAM and probably eight CPUs
right so you can just switch very
quickly the size of the server so that's
that's vertical scaling because you're
going up in terms of resources all right
and horizontal scaling is essentially
where you increase a number of servers
so you can you know say you're in the
development stage of a test stage you
may have one server or two servers and
then you you go live you still have
maybe two or three servers and then if
your application becomes popular and you
need to go to one hundred servers like
you can you can do that you can sort of
set up a hundred servers running behind
a load balancer typically you will need
a load balancer to distribute the load
across this fleet of server set your own
all right so does that answer your
question yes I explained a difference
between vertical and horizontal all
right so so let me go ahead any other
questions on attribute so you're right I
mean see elasticity the way key feature
and then pay as you go either way key
feature right and these are the two key
differences from traditional traditional
hosting all right so now let's turn our
attention to the second section of this
slide right and you will find terms like
SAS pass and IAS and these have you know
being very confusing a lot of people on
YouTube cloud computing don't really see
the difference between these terms so
let's let's cover this a little bit so
first of all SAS
right so this is software as a service
and what this really means is it's it's
targeted at end users so for example if
you are in the HR department of a
company or the finance department and
you need to use a
counting package or an HR package so you
would typically buy nowadays at least a
software-as-a-service right so what you
are interested in is in using the
software right you DV features on the
software you don't really care what goes
on behind the scenes right so you don't
care whether the application is built in
Java or in groovy
you don't care where the servers are or
how many the servers are right so so
that is software-as-a-service
essentially the users are given a
software to use they don't know anything
else about it and they are typically
build on a per user basis or per side
pieces and they build on a monthly basis
to be a and and users can consume this
on other SAS offering and then they can
stop using it as well and they can and
then they are not built right so that's
that's essentially SAS it's very
different from the traditional software
purchases if you if you are familiar
with that traditional software purchases
were license based you had to be a lot
of money up front SAS is different in
that you don't have capital expenditure
up front you have operational
expenditure on an ongoing monthly basis
alright so that is that is SAS now let's
talk about pass and pass is one of the
more confusing items actually this is
essentially platform-as-a-service
and this is one layer below SAS ok what
this means is it is targeted at
developers or technology companies who
are building their own applications or
building their own software and they
don't really want to bother with the
infrastructure side of things right so
they don't want to bother about how to
scale up these servers how to do load
balancing for instance right or how to
manage database replication how to do
backups of the database so if you don't
want to do all these things there are
service providers who will take care of
this for you and you as a technology
provider you as a developer can focus on
your on your application okay so that is
platform as a service
and finally you have infrastructure
other service so this is the lowest
layer I would say because you are
actually requesting raw infrastructure
so this could be computing capacity
right or it could be storage capacity
right so so it's basically
infrastructure blocks that you are that
you are requesting so that is
infrastructure and service right so
please let me know if you have any
questions on on these aspects because
they've historically made refusing
confusing terms okay so I've got a
couple of questions here one is from
subject lotta and he says can you
explain a broad network access okay and
then I have another question here which
talks about the how the data will be
secured for sensitive databases like
financial databases on on paths alright
so let me take septa with us question
first
so broad network access is basically
it's you know those resources right
cloud computing is essentially resources
which are shared across many customers
okay so these are compute resources
network resources and storage resources
and they are excessively you can access
these resources no matter where you are
as long as you have an internet
connection right so these are not stored
in some in a server room that only a
certain company can access they are not
stored in data centers where you have to
open up firewall code strikes is your
servers right so it's very self-service
no matter where you are you can access
these resources all right so that's
that's basically whatever it means okay
so that's broad network access the next
question is on data
I guess data privacy how to protect data
on on pass so look you know we talked
about this wheel in the next section
then the bottom half of this slide we
are going to talk about deployment
models and there is something called
private cloud right and this is this is
a new well a newish term that has come
about in the industry and what has
happened is they used to be public cloud
right a public cloud essentially means
the infrastructure shared across any
customer you may have two or three
companies running the application of the
same physical Hardware in some data
center right so that's public cloud and
that is very good because the costs of
the infrastructure are shared widely so
the so the cost of the infrastructure
per customer comes down a lot like what
mclubbe is very cheap but there are
certain industries say the financial
services industry or the healthcare
industry where there's data which is
very sensitive right and there are a lot
of regulations government regulations
which prevent you from sort of keeping
that data in non secure locations so
first of all not to say that public
cloud is not secure right is pretty
secure and we should read about the
security practices of AWS you'll find
that it's pretty pretty secure this
virtually no chance of slow data getting
lost unless you make a mistake right on
the on the application side or in your
security practices but there is this
idea of private cloud which specifically
applies to industries like financial
services where the infrastructure is
single tenant
all right so you have say a set of
servers or a pool of resources which are
used only by one customer say say City
Bank right and the difference is this
private infrastructure is ringing fast
as in the the firewalls and the security
practices are put in place in such a way
that this virtually no chance there's no
chance that anybody else can access this
infrastructure other than the particular
customer all right so the answer really
is in cloud computing if you are very
sensitive to data privacy and data
protection then private cloud is
something that you should definitely
look at all right
and while I'm on this topic let me just
talk about hybrid as well so what
happens is you know these are cloud
computing as it has a as an industry and
sector is evolving very rapidly right
and private cloud is a gives a newish
idea and hybrid cloud is also very new
as an idea and what this means is you
have a combination of public and private
right because you want to use public
because it's cheaper because the
infrastructure share widely so the cost
per unit is pretty low right so even a
bank has applications has data which is
not very sensitive right so for example
you may have a bank may have a learning
management system so that application
and that type of data can be public
cloud whereas a account data which is
very sensitive or credit history data
which is very very sensitive from a
privacy point of view can be on the
private cloud right so there are
offerings where you have some some
applications in somebody down private
someone public and that's that's what
hybrid cloud is all right so let me see
if I if you have more questions here all
right so so no more questions I'm moving
ahead guys if you want to come back to
the slide please let me know this is a
really important really important slide
ok let's now talk about Amazon Web
Services so first of all let me ask you
guys right what do you think AWS is is
it a sass pass or is it infrastructure
the service what do you think ok so
so she my saying its infrastructure and
service Raji is saying it is all right
it's all three anybody else have any
ideas is AWS infrastructure service is
it science or pass okay something summer
saying combination of all problem is
saying combination certified Ising
combination so several people think it's
it's all or some sort of combination
play with any things it's it's past all
right so so what like here's what I
think right
so essentially I think it's closest to
being an infrastructure in the service
okay because you you are getting
infrastructure like you know computing
resources and storage alright
but in the recent past what a degrees
has been doing is has been expanding its
suite of services right so you now see
for example here on my dashboard you can
see the full suite of a tablet services
right so definitely things like ec2 I
would say our infrastructure in the
service because these are essentially
servers like you get the raw server and
then you can build your own server you
have you know you can set up a token to
server for instance and build up from
scratch and also storage like s3 is
definitely infrastructure in the service
but then if you look at things like RDS
relational database service right so
this is something where you you leave
the management of the database database
backup or database replication to a SS
right so I would say something like RDS
is closer to pass whereas a lot of the
other features are definitely
infrastructure as a service right I
wouldn't call AWS software as a service
definitely that it's more on the
infrastructure side more on the platform
side
alright okay let me just go back to one
more
that I've missed here this is from giant
agua and the question is can any
production database be on the cloud or
it can only be a development test or all
paint okay so the well the answer is
certainly anything you know definitely
definitely production there are
thousands and thousands and thousands of
companies running production
environments on AWS and on other cloud
platforms all right so there's no reason
why you should not have production
databases on on cloud platforms and I
know aw is pretty well and I can tell
you these security practices are
fantastic like you should just look at
the security certifications that AWS has
and there have been no no major security
breaches with AWS and I would I would
say that there's no reason why
definitely production is possible and
certainly you know development and tests
are easily possible as well especially
the flexibility that you need with say
test environments right test
environments are environments where you
need them off and on right you need them
now and then ten days later you don't
really need them so the elasticity that
cloud provides is definitely helpful and
comes from development in test
environments but I will say the security
is fantastic so there's no reason why
you should not use it so production as
well all right okay guys so let me just
move ahead let's look at AWS and like I
said it's I would say a mixture of
infrastructure and servicing and
platform as a service and I was showing
you the this this particular dashboard
of mine right and and let's look at this
a little bit so there are a computing
related services right there are storage
related services s3 is definitely a
place that you should consider if you if
your application has a lot of storage
requirements it's a useful video if you
store images right log files
anything where you need a lot of TVs of
data storage right sv is fantastic for
that cloud front for example is a is a
content delivery network if your
application has users around the world
and you want to deliver a heavy content
video files or audio files to them then
something like Qantas is fantastic
there are database related services so
this is a relational database my sequel
in a sequel Oracle no sequel is an
option DynamoDB there are caching
servers and there's also data
warehousing right so all these options
are covered in the database section and
then let's look at one more thing here
so management tools right so you have
cloud watch which is essentially a way
for you to monitor your infrastructure
right so if you've been on the
infrastructure side you know you need to
watch for disk space getting getting a
full unit you know you need to watch for
servers where the memory threshold is
being it right so all these things can
be monitored very well with cloud watch
and this Club which will send you alarms
or notifications if those conditions are
being met okay there's also security and
identity right there is a question on
production environments so something
like Identity and Access Management this
is a service where you can control who
has access and exactly what kind of
access they have where they should have
to factor authentication before they
need to log in right so the security and
identity native this is just top top
notch and I am plays a key role right so
this is something that you probably
wanna master if you guys are working on
the analytics side right big data is a
big thing now so you have something like
EMR which is a group infrastructure
that's available on tap for you right so
you could have a hundred infrastructure
already you know in a matter of seconds
all right so there's a bunch of AWS
services here
and one important thing that I want to
point out is there's something called
free tier right so and most of these
services for example ec2 has a free tier
and what this means is you can use a
small server for free right you can use
it for free for a period of one year
right so this gives you ample time to
experiment with with some of the AWS
services right so if you guys don't have
any interviews account I I would
definitely encourage you to sign up you
just have to sign up and then you have
to enter a credit card
all right that's mandatory but you will
not be billed you not be charged as long
as you make sure that you are using the
free tier services all right so this is
a great way to get started with AWS and
to start and start experimenting with
needles okay let me see there any
further questions yeah yeah so Pankaj
your your question is can we use Hadoop
in need of this so the answer is yes
definitely like I showed you on this on
this screen right here this in fact a
specific service called EMR elastic
MapReduce which is a Hadoop framework
right it's basically a Hadoop
infrastructure and and the other way of
looking at it is you know AWS gives you
servers right so if you can run Hadoop
on a server in your company or in your
own data center you can run Hadoop on
any server in either place as well right
but what AWS has done is has made it
easier to set up a loop framework easier
than setting up second setting it up
yourself on on ec2 servers all right
okay
so let me just go ahead this is the this
is an interesting slide just wanna cover
it quickly it gives you a good reason as
to why why a SS and focuses on the
elasticity aspect and the pay-per-use
aspect of the infrastructure okay so
what this is is the red line the red
solid line is the actual demand and
usage right so if you are say a red bus
or a Flipkart
you probably have this kind of usage
sense ups and downs and then the there's
a general trend of increased usage right
and what used to happen with traditional
hardware purchases was it followed this
stepladder pattern right where you
normally overestimate the demand right
because you wanted to be sales you never
wanted to have less capacity so you
would pay a lot of money and have more
capacity in you than you need right and
then once you see that you need more you
again have another step up well so this
is basically wasted money but sometimes
if you were slow or if your procurement
cycle was too slow right and your usage
would become more than what you had
capacity for all right so then you would
run into problems where you have service
issues your site is slow for example
right so this was the problem with the
traditional purchases and if you see the
golden line right this is the AWS line
if you will and you can see it closely
tracks the actual demand and this is
because of the elasticity of a SS but
you can quickly change the size of the
server vertically or you can quickly
change it horizontally right in all
layers by the way so whether it's your
web server layer or application layer or
your database layer you can change the
configuration of the servers way very
quickly with just a few clicks of the
the button okay so this you know you can
review this again later this is a really
good slide which explains why cloud
computing is is better than traditional
hardware again please let me
you have any questions right please feel
free to send in your questions okay
let's talk about regions and zones and
edge locations so way alw works you know
although this is cloud computing in
abuse has data centers right and these
are the locations of these data centers
definitely concentrated in the US
because it's probably their biggest
market but also available in Europe and
also available importantly for us here
in India in the asia-pacific region
right so there's a region in Singapore
there's also Tokyo available and if you
like against Australian sway right and
the reason this is important is if your
users are in India you should choose a
region which is closest to you so that
the network latency is less right so in
my case if I have Indian users I
definitely choose Singapore okay now
within regions right so it's Singapore
is a region within Singapore there are
what is called availability zones okay
you can look at Singapore here and V
bottom right side and you can see there
are two zones a and B and what these
zones are are simply data centers okay
zone a is one data centers OMB is
another data center and they are they
make sure that these two data centers
are physically far away from each other
okay and the reason is if there's a
problem say there's a flood a you know
this earthquake or tsunami right
hopefully only one zone will be impacted
the other will be running right so your
application or your infrastructure will
not be impacted okay and and this gives
you an idea right what you should do
when you use AWS especially in a
production environment in a serious so
if you have a serious application you
should put your servers in multiple
zones right a half in zone a in this
case and half of Zone B right and then
you have load balancer which distributes
low at this way your uptime will be
okay so this is regions and zones and
also there is something called edge
locations so this is relevant for a
content distribution networks right so
if you have applications which are
content heavy say a YouTube like
application right or a ganar like
application by the streaming video or
audio then you need to have edge
locations which are close to your users
right so depending on your application
if you have a global audience where you
Amazon can help you serve to that way
because it has edge locations around the
world if you have Asian Canadian
audience you can choose to have only
Asian edge locations serve your content
right so you get built less but still
are able to serve your customers your
content really fast okay so this is
regions zones and edge locations any
questions okay so
question raju has is what is what is it
elastic right where you where do we use
this term a lot now elastic you know it
is stretchable right so that's what
elastic means and in this in the case of
AWS what it means is you can you can
stretch it you can either increase your
capacity or decrease the capacity right
very very easily right in a way that was
not possible earlier right so that's why
it is it is called elastic all right so
I hope there's region zones and edge
locations are clear right let me go
ahead let's now talk about specific
services we have just about 20 minutes
so I'll try and rush this a little bit
so ec2 is essentially servers okay
elastic cloud computer it's basically
servers and again these are these come
in various sizes from very small to very
large right and of course you can also
choose to have one server or many
servers okay this is what easy to is a
related concept is EBS elastic block
store so this is the easiest way to
understand EBS is to think of it as a
hard disk alright but it is better than
a than a normal hard disk because it is
highly reliable ok it's very unlikely
that you lose your data with the EBS ok
and just like a hard disk you can attach
an EPS to any BS volume to any server
you can take it off from one one server
and put it into another server you can
have multiple volumes or multiple EP EBS
volumes attached to a single server and
also you can take a snapshot which is
basically a copy of the volume so that
you can you can have a back alright so
let me show you this I'm going to show
you ec2 can ETS really pick on the AWS
console so you have a good idea all
right so I'm going to go into ec2
so this is my ec2 dashboard and you can
see I have chosen the Singapore region
okay because we are here in India and
you can see here down below that there
are two zones available it is own 1a and
1b okay I'm going to try and launch new
instance a new server instance so the
first thing I do is to select an Amazon
machine image okay so what does nami
mean this is basically a bundle of
software ok typically includes the
operating system but can also include
other packages right can you can also
include your own application ok
so for instance if you are a lamp
personal Linux Apache MySQL PHP person
right then you can have a say an Ubuntu
server rating system and then lamp
packages so you link the apache 8
packages and the my sequel packages and
PHP packages right so you can select an
ami like that so that you don't have to
do the work of installing everything
from scratch right so that's what in am
i means what i will do is i will try and
find an ubuntu am i here
ok I'm looking for 14.0 for those of you
who are familiar with the Ubuntu will
know this is this is like a stable
version right I'm going to trusty it is
called and I'm going to go ahead and
select this one here ok so by selecting
an ami basically I'll get a server with
Ubuntu pre-installed right I don't have
to worry about installing it ok the next
thing I will do is select an instance
type now this is a size that we were
talking about right so there's
everything from micro to very very large
servers right and you can see like micro
has one virtual CPU and over 0.6 GB of
RAM whereas there are ones there's some
which are very large like this one here
has 36 V CPUs and 244 GB of RAM right so
the whole you know is like a very wide
set of choices for you please also
notice that this there's a green sign
here which says is three-tier right so
use this I will not be billed okay so
I'm going to select this one for now
let's go heavier okay the next thing is
the storage right so this is your hard
disk volume and this is the EBS that we
talked spoke about right you can see the
size is 8gb right so the disk is of 8gb
side I can always change it to something
much larger say 500 GB if I want okay
but remember that you get billed the
more you use the more you get built
right so I'm going to keep it at 8 which
is the minimum here okay let's go to the
next step
there's something else security group so
this is essentially a firewall okay
around this particular server and you
can see my default
AWS is allowing SSH access right on port
22 but if I wanted other things say I
want HTTP access right because this is
going to a twitch or web application I
can do that I may also want HTTPS right
so I'll add that normally you don't want
to do this right you don't want to say
that you can access the server from
anywhere normally you want to give an IP
address or a range of IP so that it's
more secure especially for the SSH port
all right okay so so that's it you can
see that you can preview this it's in
one - server it's a small it's a micro
server with just point 6 GB of RAM and
it allows inward traffic on SSH HTTP and
HTTPS right and there's a storage volume
of 8g okay so that's it I can just click
on launch again this is a security
feature AWS works with public and
private keys right so you need to have a
private key
download and this is a one-time download
only right so if you lose this key you
lose access to the server right but this
is you know a security best practice all
right I have an existing key I'm going
to use that
so that's it you know you can see the
log that server has is coming up and if
I click on this server ID you can see
right here that the server is in the
process of of launching all right let me
know please let me know if you have any
questions on ec2 let me just give you a
little more information you can see in
the bottom panel here that there's a
public IP address right so if you want
to access this server you can you'll be
using this particular IP you can see
that this has been launched in the 1a
availability zone right you can take a
look at the firewall rules here okay you
know that the it's an Ubuntu trusty
image okay and the key pair is key pair
is lamp there's some information here as
well it's a micro instance okay any
questions on ec2 okay so two questions
here one is from Jyoti and the question
is if I provision many instances then
what about storage allocation for each
one of them okay so well we the answer
is you know sure if you're launching
many instances for example if you see
here the screen right
it says launch more like this so I'm
going to launch more of the exact same
configuration right so this particular
server has one volume one storage volume
right of 8gb so if you launch many the
other servers will be exactly like this
so they'll all have 8gb volumes attached
to them all right the next question is
from sub-sahara he says what is elastic
IP alright so this is a very good
question actually okay it's a very good
question I'm happy that you noticed it
so what happens is this is a public IP
address which is tempo
rarely assigned to the server okay what
that means is if you shut down this
server then and then you bring it up
again and the same IP will not be
available okay so this is a temporary IP
address if you want something permanent
right and there are good reasons why you
must have a permanent IP address for
example if you if you change your
servers right or if you change your
platform then it's very hard to change
your DNS rules right so your company's
website will be pointing to an IP
address so they had very hard to change
the DNS because it takes a long time to
propagate it and you can have downtime
right so it is better to buy an elastic
IP address and then associate it with a
server and then tomorrow if you want to
change the server you can just allocate
that it associate that elastic IP to the
new so so it makes it easy to manage the
infrastructure okay so that's the
difference between elastic again public
elastic is a permanent IP address all
right and you get it billed if you don't
use it if you are associated with the
server then there's no no billing for me
lastic IP address okay so
there's one question from Raji about
submit and there's one question from
duty about elastic ip3 in in 3tf okay
now Rajeev I think subnet is something
that would leave for the moment because
we have to talk about things like
virtual private cloud BBC it's a
different service from Amazon and it's a
longer discussion we can talk about this
perhaps after this session right if you
if you hang around Jyoti elastic IP
address is free infinity or also yes as
long as you attached it to a instance
okay so what happens really is elastic
IDs are not freely away or not are not
unlimited okay so what Amazon does is it
penalizes you if you're not using it
okay and and there are good reasons to
not use it for example if your servers
are not being used in the night
you typically want to be shut down right
and then when you shut down the server
because check IP gets disassociated and
it is not used so when it is not being
used as disassociated there is a small
charge it's not a very significant
charge but there is a small hourly
charge then applies I don't think that
will be free right so so you may be
using a server in the free tier but if
you have an unattached elastic IP I
don't think that'll be free okay all
right now let me just quickly go to EBS
so this is the volume now you know I
have some volumes of my own but you can
see that there is this particular volume
I think which is which is attached to
the server we just created right and you
can see this the size is 8 GB and what
you can typically do with these volumes
is create a snapshot right so for
example if you're running a database on
this machine you can create a snapshot
every night so that you have a complete
picture a complete backup of your of
this particular value for you you
from the snapshot you can do something
more interesting which is you can create
an image an Amazon machine image right
and that image can then be used to
launch more servers with all your
software packages already installed
right so typically what you do is you
have a server and you have a volume you
install your application on your
packages you take a snapshot of that
volume and then from the snapshot you
create machine images which can be used
for testing my language development
environments and also for production
environments all right okay now let me
just talk about something very
interesting which is auto scaling and
load balancer okay now this is something
you know which most people don't use I
think most people use AWS or ec2 and s3
and perhaps EBS but something that's
really interesting is of the scale and
the way this works is if your
application is has spikes in usage right
so for example I've been involved in
applications where in the evening around
5 o'clock
most of the usage is to happen between
5:00 and 7:00 in the evening right and
then the rest of the day it used to be
pretty unused to infrastructure was
unused ok but then you were also not
sure sometimes during the day also they
could be a spike in the usage right so
how do we tackle such a situation we
don't want to keep too much of spare
capacity because the cost will be too
high right so what you can do is you can
create a fleet of servers ok so you can
you can say it's a group of servers you
can have a minimum number of servers
which could be 1 and then you can have a
maximum number of servers right
depending on your needs and your budget
it could be say trendy right so minimum
1 server
maximum 20 servers and then you can have
conditions you can say if the average
CPU usage goes beyond 80% add one server
right so
happens is as the usage increases the
system automatically detects that these
the system is overloaded and it will add
more servers as required right and then
also the reverse once the usage drops
off the system automatically detects
that the load is very less and it starts
shedding these herbs it strands
terminating the servers so that you're
you're not billed for those servers okay
another benefit another very important
benefit of auto scaling is it can detect
if a server is is dead
and so like in my experience I've seen
servers which have maxed out on memory
and they are no longer plumb so the
server is not really responding so auto
scaling will detect that a once that one
server is not really functioning right
and it will create a replacement on its
own okay so basically auto scaling is
very good for responsiveness right so
your users have fantastic response from
your application and it is also very
good for uptime because it can detect
bad cells all right so let me know if
you have questions I'm going to show you
a very quick demo as well okay
trick question Athena and I have a
question here says in case of auto
scaling will there be a request delay to
the user as it takes
Bank launcher instance ok so that's a
very good that's a very good question
and it is true you know it's you know
the system detects that the overall
system is overloaded and it takes time
to start an instance right because you
need to put the operating system and
they take any other services that need
to be brought up it could take a few
seconds right so the answer is what you
can do is you can make you can set up a
lower threshold right so instead of
saying that you know when my CPU reaches
90% start a server you can say when my
CPU reaches 70% start a self right so
then you can you can act faster alright
so there are ways of ways of managing it
and what typically happens in my
experience what has happened is you try
a certain configuration right and then
if it doesn't work perfectly you sort of
tweak it you you keep improving it in
incremental e till you get something
that that users are happy all right okay
so let me really quickly show you how to
set up an auto scaling group so the
first step is creating a launch
configuration and this basically you
know you tell the system what is the
software what is he ami that you will
use what is the size of the server that
you will use okay that's the first step
let's do that so again it's you have to
select me am I going to go for one two
again 14.04 know depending on my
application I find that micro instances
is fine okay all right let's give it a
good name okay so this storage is fine
let's go ahead
so this is my launch configuration
basically and selected what is the ami
what is the type of the instance okay
and also the key pair as usual okay now
it's time to create the auto scaling
group so we have to give it a good name
and these are the important things here
right the group size how many instances
do you want to start with this is the
minimum number of instances right so you
can have one or perhaps two like depends
on your typical load it's good to have
the infrastructure in multiple
availability zones for uptime right so
I'm going to select to availability
zones okay now this is the key thing
right how do you want to scale this up
so I'm going to say use scaling policies
to adjust the capacity of this group
okay and we say here scale between two
and let's say 20 right so minimum two
servers maximum petty surface now you
must set a maximum right which is small
enough because you don't want to be
surprised but you can get build very
horribly right if you're not watching
the infrastructure so I'm going to set a
limit of say 20 okay and now here how do
you increase the group size what are the
conditions for increase so what you do
is essentially set up an alarm like this
you say something like high CPU okay and
what I'm saying here is the average CPU
utilization if it goes above 80% right
so this is the alarm and if that
condition occurs and one instance so
every time that the average CPU goes
above 80% one instance will be added so
what will happen is typically you have
you'll add one instance again it may go
up above 80% so another instance would
be added till it reaches 20 all right so
that's how the servers are added
automatically it's very important to set
a reverse topic as well okay
what you would say here is if load is
dropping off right if the average CPU
utilization goes below say 40% then
remove one instance okay so the system
will automatically stop your instances
and terminate them so that your cost is
under control all right so this is what
I wanted to show you I hope you
understood auto-scaling as a concept any
questions okay
so guys I am afraid we're out of time if
you guys want to hang around I can show
you a relational database service as
well
right please let me know I can I can
cover this in any case you can take 10
more minutes and cover this all right so
so let me just quickly show you
relational database service as well so
this is essentially a service which lets
you manage your relational database
right typically my sequel or Postgres
sequel or oracle or brown or microsoft
as well and the advantage right and the
first of all you must know that you can
create an ec2 server right it's a
regular server it could be say in a boon
to server or Debian server or a sent to
a server and you can install your my
sequel on that right so you could use my
sequel for a sequel on on a regular easy
to machine definitely and that is
cheaper right RDS is more expensive but
but then why use RDS that is the
question so what happens is if you
manage databases right you will know
that you have to watch disk space very
closely because it keeps getting full
right you know you have to worry about a
backup
but you need to make sure that backups
are coming out on time that you're able
to restore them right and then if you're
doing something more complex like
database replication but if you have a
high availability infrastructure and you
need to worry about database replication
across data centers right that's a real
nightmare right so this is a very
difficult job and for many companies you
know small startups for example this
this is something that's too complex
right so what you can do is use RDS and
Amazon will take care of those things so
that you don't have to worry too much
about it so it does things like
automatic batching the spilling of this
software right security patches and
upgrades it can do the backup for you
and you set the policies for example you
want backups
every night I want it to be retain for
seven days right so you set the policies
and then everything is taken care of
automatically right in other things like
point in time recovery right so if you
if you've done an upgrade to your
application something has gone wrong
horribly and you want to go back in time
all right these things can be done or
you can do it manually right but it's
difficult it's complex but AWS makes it
easy so you just say look I want to go
back one hour before or one day before
and just a click of the mouse and you're
in you're back in time okay and one very
important thing that's not covered here
is you can easily do database
replication and multiple data center
type of configurations with RDS okay so
let me just quickly show you so we go
back to the dashboard and go to RDS here
okay let's get started so I'm going to
go with my sequel I'm familiar with it
okay so the first question it says is do
you want a multi availability zone
deployment this typically means database
replication right so you have a primary
database and then you have the database
being replicated on to the other
availability zone and RDS can switch
automatically like
so if it sees a problem in one
availability zone it will switch
automatically to the other one right so
that your application continues okay so
I'm not going to do this now because
let's say I'm just interested in a
development environment so there's no
need for this sort of thing okay
these are things like you know depending
on an application for most people this
doesn't matter the version of the
database engine okay this is the size
just like ec2 you can choose from a wide
set of sizes here so micro to something
which is much large or something like
this right which is 8 X large this is 32
CPUs it's 240 4gb RAM and I'm sure there
are certain applications which require
this kind of database all right storage
also you know depending on your eye or
requirements you can choose whether it
should be a general purpose or
provisioned IOPS this means it
guarantees you a certain performance of
input ok and provision is obviously more
expensive right so normally you would
choose a general purpose and then of
course the storage right so you will
know your application you will know how
much your database means or you can
start with something small like 5 GB you
can change this very easily but once you
have your database running if you
increase storage it's just a few clicks
of the mouse
all right and here you give it a name
say something like this this is your
database instance name now you have a
root user right I'm just going to give
some password here okay
the next step let's not
we see for the moment we have to give it
a database name write so this instance
can have multiple databases but this is
just a starting database if you will
okay and down here you can see the
backup policies right so you want a
retention of seven days or more you can
also give it a backup window you know if
you don't want any impact to your
application you should normally select a
window where there is no usage typically
after midnight all right so these are
some of the things that you would choose
here
all right so this is this is something
that
to sort of troubleshoot but I hope
you've got an idea of how to create a
RDS RDS instance please let me know if
you have any questions on RDS okay glad
I'm seeing a lot of questions here let
me just run through them quickly right
okay so there's one from Raji he says
what about a load balancer so yes you're
right I mean that's a good question
again you know you noticed that when I
was sick setting of the AWS the load I'm
sorry the auto scaling group I had not
specified a load balancer right so
you're absolutely right
normally and auto scaling group would
require a load balancer and this auto
scaling group would run behind the load
balancer right so it's called that
particular service is called an elastic
load balancer or EMP and there was an
option which I didn't you show you guys
but I think a toughness allows you to
create the auto scaling group and then
associate an a load balancer later okay
so definitely you're right you need a
load balancer but it can be configured
with the auto scaling group a little
later as well okay certain error has
question is in I guess this is about
auto scaling his question is is there an
option for vertical scaling in the auto
scaling group okay so well the answer is
no right so a auto scaling is horizontal
scaling only but if you remember when
you're setting up an auto scaling group
what happens is you specify the size of
the server that you being in that auto
scaling group right and in my
demonstration I showed you that we
selected a micro instance okay what you
can do of course is you can select a
bigger server right so you can change
your auto scaling group you can instead
of a micro instance you can choose a
large instance right and then
reconfigure our rail launch
you know scale it group so then you'll
have the same kind of horizontal scaling
but with larger servers okay so I hope
that answers your question okay so
that's one question from from rajid
it would be great if you can talk about
VPC okay let me just you know quickly
give you a little bit about PPC so so
VPC is becoming at the font in aid of
this right so essentially you should if
you look at this dashboard right and if
you go back to ec2 and if you try to
launch a new instance normally this will
launch into a BBC ok and you can see
that there's a default V PC that I have
here and is a default subnet and
basically this is a wiki cesar is a
service which is essentially a virtual
private cloud right so it's these are
your instances you can sort of define
your network box and get wings and
things like that you can choose which
servers are accessible from the public
in public internet and which servers are
not accessible right so my default you
launch instances into a V PC V PC right
now okay if you have any more like
specific questions let me know Rajee and
try and answer them the best I can write
but basically there is something called
ec2 classic which is which is kind of
obsolete now and now all servers are
sort of launched into V PC
amid sri master your question is do we
need to SSH into RDS do we need a
pee-pee cane up and praying for that
well in my experience I have not done
that you know you have you get an end
point for an RDS instance and then you
have a username and password and
normally what I would do is I would not
connect to the RDS instance from outside
right so I would only connect when our
obvious instance from another ec2
instance for example right so this way
my database is not open to the internet
right but once I am into an ec2 instance
using my SSH key then I would connect
using a password okay that's that's how
I would do it
but I think it's possible to sort of set
up a PKI sort of connection as well I'll
have to sort of forget back to you if
you're really impressed with that okay
there's some
here howdy is asking where do we choose
vertical scaling if not in auto scaling
well you know like I said before
vertical scaling is not it's not
possible right in an auto scaling group
but there are other ways of achieving it
which is essentially the server type the
instance type that you choose when you
set up the auto scaling group you can
choose to pick a larger instance type so
you can instruct Microsoft you can
choose a larger or a double large
severance right so that's how you can
achieve some sort of vertical scaling as
part of a auto scaling group so guys any
other any other questions so I'm going
to show you you know I want to let you
know before we end this program like we
have this this whole course this is a
ADA based architecture course from Megan
raker and the bad starting 128 number
right so I would ask you to consider
signing up to this course as well okay
so it's 10:15 where you know 15 minutes
past the allocated time I think I'll end
this session here guys if you have any
further questions please contact us
you'll have the contact information with
you
and we can help you with with those
questions as well right I hope you
enjoyed this session and I hope you have
a good night thank you
