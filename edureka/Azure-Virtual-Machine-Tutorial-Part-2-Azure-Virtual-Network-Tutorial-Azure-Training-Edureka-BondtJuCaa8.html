Azure my name is hemant and I'll be your
instructor for today
so yesterday we saw how we can configure
yesterday there was this is the part two
of the series of azor tutorial yesterday
we saw how we can create virtual
networks why do we need them and we saw
how we can configure a database server
and access it using our computer right
so today we will see how we can
configure a web server and let's see how
we can configure its settings using
virtual networks right so for those of
you who are new today I'll summarize
what we did yesterday and then move on
to the hands-on so for the best learning
thing I would recommend you guys to see
the first the part one of the video that
we did yesterday and then come back to
this video for it but anyways I will
summarize what we did yesterday so that
it becomes easy for you to learn all
right so let's go ahead and see let me
summarize what we did yesterday so first
we saw water virtual machines so like I
said virtual machines are just like a
raw server that you deploy on the
internet you rent those servers instead
of buying them and you can configure the
server to be anything it could be a web
server or a work at the environment then
we saw why do we need what will network
so if you deploy two servers on the
Internet you want these servers to
interact with each other you need a
network right and that is the reason we
need virtual networks why do we call
them virtual is because there are no
connections when you talk about cloud or
there are no routers or switches in the
cloud right so because it's a logical
isolation we call this network as
virtual and this logical isolation of
resources in the cloud is called a
virtual network
now you can configure the properties how
you want the resources to interact with
each other using the properties in the
virtual network in virtual network you
have for the components the first
component would be Azure subnets so it
is basically a sub part of a network and
there could be as many sub paths as you
want there is a limited number but say
there are three sub parts and each sub
part can be config
to have its own unique property let's
see we discussed all of this in detail
yesterday so let me give you an example
here that we say we have one server
right and that server wants to access
the Internet so we can give that
particular part of the network the
internet access and to do that we can
use subnets and the rest of the network
won't have the access to the Internet so
that is possible and that is possible
using subnets right so that is the
reason we use subnets and then we saw
water network security groups so network
security groups and nothing world
firewall it so it basically acts like a
firewall so all these properties which I
was telling you that you want the
Internet access to a particular group of
servers and say you want the FTP
connection to a particular server all of
that can be configured inside a network
security group which is attached to a
subnet right so let me give you a quick
diagram for this so in this diagram as
you can see this is the network security
group this is a subnet and this is the
virtual network so you attach the
network security group to your subnet
and your subnet is inside your virtual
network so your subnet is a sub part a
virtual network and with that virtual
network you attach the network security
group in this network security group you
will be configuring all your properties
and then comes the demo right so before
the part till this I mean the theory for
all of this has been discussed in the
previous video you can all refer to that
and in demo we created a network
security group we created a virtual
network we deploy two servers that are
database virtual machine and a web
server virtual machine we configure the
database part today in this session I
will show you guys how you can configure
the web server alright so let me quickly
go to my as your dashboard alright guys
so this is my Azure dashboard and for
those of you who are new I will show you
how you can deploy a virtual machine I
have already deployed one but let me
quickly show you how you can deploy
another virtual machine so in the in the
dashboard you will go to virtual
machines you will click on add
and then you can give them no the you
have to choose an operating system
you'll choose the operating system you
can click on create and then you'll have
the screen where you can fill all the
information right once you fill in all
the information you just have to click
on OK and in the last part it will ask
you to agree to the terms and conditions
you can do that and your virtual machine
will be deployed all right so I've
already deployed one virtual machine
that is from a web server
I reached till this part yesterday so I
will continue from here now in the web
server you can see these are the
properties that I have attached to my
web server so this is basically my
network security group for my web server
in this I have configured that my web
server can we should have HTTP
connections it should have HTTPS
connections and an SSH connection right
now if I want to add more properties to
it I can add by clicking here that is
that is inbound security rules I'll go
here I click on add and then I can add
any property that I want from this list
that is available here right so I've
already added the properties now what
I'll do is I'll SSH into my web server
and see how we can configure it alright
so this is my web server page so I've
just gone to virtual so if you go here
in the virtual machines tab you will
find all the virtual machines that you
are deployed over here I selected my web
server and then I reach this page now I
need the IP address of my virtual
machine to connect to right so as of now
if I copy this IP address and paste it
here you can see I cannot connect to my
virtual machine as of now because there
is no nothing installed on this web
server so what we'll be doing now is
we'll be installing the sort necessary
software's for my virtual machine to
work alright so I will enter the IP
address here and I click on open
and it will ask me the login name so
I'll give the login name that I have
configured that is ID rekha now it will
ask me the password so I'll enter the
password that is
this and while it is connecting let me
show you that as you can see the page is
not working as of now so we will install
the necessary software's here and then
we'll try again to connect so if you
guys want you can actually connect to
this website the IP addresses 13.9 3.20
9.3 8 right so my team here
they will they will put it in the
comment box for you to access you can go
to this IP address and you can see that
as of now we cannot connect to this
particular website all right so now so
this is the one to machine this is my
server I will install the necessary
software so I sudo update it first
all right so my updation is being
happening and now I will install the PHP
software so my website for that I want
to deploy on this particular server let
me quickly show you the website that I
want to deploy so it's hosted on my
localhost as of now right so let me go
to my website so here it is alright so
this is my website guys I'll enter a
name and email address a mobile number
and a location I'll click on submit and
it will enter all these values into the
MySQL database that we created yesterday
alright so I'll show you how the values
that will be reflected in the MySQL but
for now let's configure our webserver
first so this is the website that I'll
be uploading to my web server but first
I have to install the necessary software
so this is the PHP website guys so I'll
install the PHP software now so I'll
sudo install the PHP right so it will
install the PHP now and then we can go
ahead now since my website has to
interact to MySQL I also have to install
an extension for my MySQL to work so
I'll do that as well once this is done
so yeah so my PHP is installed now I
will install the extension for my PHP
MySQL so to do that sudo install the PHP
extension which is this
so I misspelled it one second all right
now for all of this to work I also have
to install the Apache server so let us
install the Apache server so like I said
as of now we cannot connect to it so
what I'll do now is install the Apache
saw so sudo apt-get install Apache
all right so now if I try to connect to
my website I'll be able to do so so let
me quickly check my network security
settings
so I'll go here I'll type in network
security groups and that will list me or
the network security groups which are
present as of now all right so I have
two network security groups this is the
new web server network security group
that I have configured so I'll go here
and as of now you can see only the SSH
rule is there so what I'll do now is
I'll install the Apaches I will
configure it to allow HTTP connections
so to do that I will go to inbound say
security rules I'll click on add I'll
add the HTTP rule
it is I will click on a law and I'll
click on ok all right so my securities
rule is being deployed I also have to
configure it to have the HTTPS rule as
well
so I'll configure to have the HTTPS rule
I click on OK
and yes I have this security rule for
this as well now let me restart the
Apache to service sudo service Apache to
restart right and if now I try to
connect to my website yes so I can see
that Apache 2 page is now working right
so if you guys will now try to access
this IP address the Apache a 2 page will
start working alright guys so now since
our page is working the next task is to
connect through FTP and upload my
website so to do that I have to first
add the FTP rule in the inbound security
rules so to do that I click on add and
in the name I'll type in FTP right
the service would be FTP and then the
action is allow and I click on ok so it
is now creating the security rule and
once this is done I'll be able to
connect through an FTP software that I
had this is called FileZilla all right
so you'll enter the IP address here your
username your password port number for
FTP connections it's 22 and then you
will click on quick connect and then
we'll have the all all the directly
listing of that server over here right
so as I can see the FTP rule has been
added so now I'll go to the dashboard go
to my web server I'll copy the IP
address I paste it here in the host the
username for it that is a Eureka
password let me enter the password and
now the port number I'll click on Quick
Connect now it will take some time to
connect to the directory of my so so now
I have the directory alright so now I
will have to
upload my website right so for doing
that I'll have to go to this particular
directory that is slash vas / w w w /
HTML alright so this is the directory
where you will be uploading your website
now by default you cannot upload your
website so let me show you what I
basically mean if I try to upload my
files here you'll see that I'll have an
errors that file transfer has failed so
that is because over here we don't have
the access rights admin I cannot read
right in this directory now for doing
that I'll have to allow myself to allow
myself from the shell so I'll do that
let me cancel all the file transfers
that are happening all right so now I'll
go here I will type sudo chmod - capital
R triple7 so this will basically give me
the readwrite access to this particular
directory and once I have that I can
upload my files all right so this should
be it now if I try to upload my files
over here
all right so now like I said if I'll try
to upload my files it should upload it
successfully so as you can see the file
transfer has now started all right I
don't need the index or - HTML so
basically this is the Apache page that
you were seeing so we can delete this
page okay so my transfers have finished
so now if I go back to my website and I
try accessing it I will be able to see
the website that I just uploaded right
so this is the website that I just
uploaded now let me show you the
database server that I configure the
yesterday so for that let me open my
command prompt go to my MySQL
installation
so this is masculine insulation guy I'll
type in the command my skill - H and now
the host name right so for the host name
I need the IP address of my server so
for that I will go back to my dashboard
and my database so which is here I'll
copy the IP address from a database
server I will paste it here and then the
username which is Ed Eureka the port
number which is three three zero six and
then the password alright so it will ask
me the password and with this I'm there
in inside my - well shell now this MySQL
shell I have created a database called
entry so let me show you so as you can
see there's a database called entry in
this my all my website data will go
right and inside entry there's a table
called entries so as of now if you can
see this table would be entry empty
right so this table is empty now my
website will actually upload all the
information that I'll be typing in here
to this MySQL shell so if you guys want
you want to try this website out you can
go to this IP address you can type in
all your information click on submit and
it will get reflected over here right so
before that before you could actually do
that let me change the index file so
I'll have to update it with the IP
address of my server of my database
right so for doing that give me a second
I'll go here in the host name this is
the IP address that I have to change
I'll change it with the IP address of my
dear base over so I'll save it and now I
override this in my so so I'll take this
file indexed or PHP paste it here
now it'll ask me whether I want to
override the file so I'll say okay and
now it has transferred my files all
right so now if I enter details then my
name my email address my phone number
all right and then my location so now if
I click on submit it'll enter the values
in the MySQL so now if i refresh my
MySQL I'll be able to see the entry
which are just made right so this is it
guys I have configured my web server on
the as your VM and we have configured it
from scratch all so you'll find there's
a service in Azure called app service so
you could do that automatically all of
this that is configuring your web server
and everything you just have to upload a
code a drive which would have installed
everything but it's good - it's good to
learn from scratch right you should
understand how things happen in the
background and that is the reason that
is the motive behind today's
demonstration today all right so with
that guys I will end today's session
right so let me summarize what what we
did so we created a virtual network we
created a subnet we created a network
security group we created a VM we
attached the VM through the subnet and
since the network security group was
attached to the subnet our VM could
access the properties in the in my
network security group in my network
security group I allowed all the HTTP
connections right I allowed the SSH
connection and that is the reason I
could connect through SSH right and that
is the reason you guys could also
connect to this website if you try to
open it and in case I would have denied
all the traffic from HTTP you guys won't
have been able to access the website and
that is the reason we need firewalls
alright so this is what we did today
guys so thank you for attending today's
session I hope you guys learned
something new today
now before ending the session I quickly
want to show you the part one of the
video
right so this is the part one of the
video guys all the theory and how to
create and set up a database server was
explained in this part one video you can
go here and refer to it right also I for
those of you who are new today I would
like to point you to the blog section of
Aras your subject so if if you want to
learn more about this or you can go
through a blog and learn about it there
are as of now 3 blogs but we'll be
updating more soon so you can be a
subscribe to this to this link so that
you'll get all the bits also if you are
into videos we also have a video
playlist on YouTube wherein we
frequently update it with new and
informative videos on Azure right so you
can go through this video and learn more
about Azure and if you guys are
interested to join a course here it is
this is the landing page for our course
you will get all the information later
to the course here right the batch
timing so we have a morning batch
operating and then evening batch as well
so for those of you who would be
interested to join the evening batch or
