question for the kernel boot parameters
are text strings which are constructed
by the system to change specific
behaviors and enabled or disabled
certain features okay so don't worry
about all this Givens as you can see
here so we need to see this are
different every part of the drug bird
font file are ready go to the blog page
okay so where do you can edit the
arguments then you'll see all these
options over there okay just search okay
okay so you will see these options
either in the grub dirt con file or the
same pie wearing you where we have seen
an image that points to the the graph
page when you restart your system
alright so at the drug thing we will
also get to see all these options will
not be modifying these options much this
that we will see one single option where
you will log in into the single unit
world but to have an understanding of
what is options for so here then you
would get to see something called root
is equal to that corresponds to the file
system okay here is another new word
called its file system okay so you will
get to hear this word we will also be
creating a file system I hope you are
aware of the windows NTFS file system
similarly
in Linux we have different file systems
available alright so on top of your rod
diff what we do is the created file
system ok another layer on top of which
we store the data
alright so but now just remember that
except it's a layer on top that would
facilitate or that would help the users
to store their data
so whenever we create a partition we
write a file system on top of it we
store the data so here this this points
to disparate alert are given that you'll
see over there group is equal to it
corresponds to the file system that
that is for the root user and this fine
system can leave in multiple modes okay
so when you read only or read right ok
so here with rest when we when we go to
the permissions topic all right that
will sell different kinds of positions
and the basic ones are really write and
execute permissions ok so here this is
the notation that will be polling and
Linux extensively W for write and
extensive execute so ro is the mounted
file system is in read-only mode alright
so I hope I have given you an example
regarding the mounting point way so
similarly what we do is when we create a
partition we create a paddock spawning
filesystem and we also mount that
particular Divine's ok and that marking
happens in different different modes
like we'd only mode and do it right all
right
next comes something called as the
initial drag this alright and where this
particular file is present you can see
all these files inside the /boot folder
ok and then we have in it is equal to
that is the basic system in each
variational process and the part of the
process and then this will start
executing all the other things using
this particular session message ok and
like that there are other options like
single use it would routing to a
specific run level and deserve in the
kernel mode setting the depth of
advanced features we'll see this 3 first
later ok so let's quickly feel the file
and let's move on to the web.com pitch
all right the moment I power on system
you will get to see their grub them ok
here we have the Edit options so if you
have multiple operating systems you will
see that list over here in the rock
pitch okay okay so one
come to this page press me your water
instructions are here press e that will
help you to list all the three processes
inside year's growth page okay so one is
the main root partition is 0 comma 0 and
then you have your kernel so we have
Linus this is your kernel and version
all right and this is the mountain
mounted point so we'll be so if you have
portfolio station we have three major
partitions money's the root partition
the topmost partitions under which your
entire file system tree structure will
remain okay so that is here slash and
then that is a slightly here
representing here we have I am NOT the
unitard a mighty trees here RAM disk
image okay so okay so you can see you
this is so the moment you have seen the
operating system the drop page what you
can do is press e to edit the combine
then you will see all the three options
then you need to provide the argument to
the kernel kernel line this line okay so
what is the argument that has been
provided here see to the colonel re to
be space quite is single all right so
when you say singing it will log into
the single user mode okay so once you
have given signal what do you need to do
you know to follow the instructions
press Penton then here come here
you have pressed enter the first or what
save and once you have done that here
there is something called being frisky
to boot it okay similarly what you can
do it if you have installed multiple
kernels in your system all these kernels
are displayed here after coming here
what you can do is rather than starting
with the default kernel you can move on
to the next kernel and then make your
system start with that particular fund
all right so all these options whatever
you can see in the unplug page you can
see all those options and this this
probe the font fine alright too
the colonel booth parameters permanently
what you can do is you can poke them
open the drug dot one fine and you can
watch them changes here here there is
something called SELinux and security
enhanced linux so first of all we'll
deal with the basic permissions
basically log security and then we have
lot of other security concepts like the
ACL access control list and like that
finally you will get to see a she - okay
it would be towards the last module I
think seven eight or nine
okay for now just remember it is all
about advanced second tape and things
and the next so I seen annex okay so we
can also set up the acid annex mode here
okay using the kernel boot parameter so
if you I mean it has been given here but
but now just remember that this is what
excellent it's an advanced feature you
can also have set up there here it means
enforcing enable or disable in the SC
Linux that can be done by passing the
parameter to the corner all right so
this particular PI it takes the brunt
will get to see all these options here
so if you can see here index particular
screen here there are I guess to the
panels here 2.6 third ten thousand three
nine zero dot dl 5 and you have another
kernel here who got six for food I think
it's a subversion another version
alright so we can restart and we can try
logging into the other one and see if
that option okay so going through all
this parameters reading for the starting
from the first one the default is equal
to zero that's a directive pointing to
the default operating system fufu that
means if you have multiple operating
systems
they'll be numbered is 0 1 2 like that
so the important see though it will
start with the default operating system
then you have the time or that means you
will see the grub page for 50 seconds
and then you have something called
splash away so it's nothing but the grub
page that you see it's an image that is
stored in the system this way and then
something called hidden mini that means
when you come to the grub page only when
you piss me you will get to see all the
other menu options right so that is what
it points to do all right and then we
have once you press that hidden menu
then it will display the bigger options
that means it will lift through the boat
it will display the kernel entry and
then it will display the unitard image
ok so to add a kernel mold parameter
permanently so here you can see your
right so some of you then draw blood on
file has been modified the text to the
displayed in the boat for selecting the
operating system is the first line with
the next fields since among the location
of /foo there creek kernel and your
initial dramtic
ok so I will start I'll show this on my
system as well so to add a column good
so this particular tool HD 0 comma 0 it
specifies the mobility that you will get
to keep all the boot eggs that were
present so it is the first partition
with the first hard disk then your
kernel this is the corresponding version
that specifies the condom location which
is inside the /boot folder this location
has related to actually this is 0 comma
0 HP is one kind of rotation for your
hard disk and we have a SELinux two
little arguments you will see these
options later ok so what powers you mode
is for enforcing mornings so both are
related to excellent
the scientists make use of the script
called chk convict to enable or disable
the system services farming in Linux so
we have seen both these waves running in
the command line
I mean how to modify the services from
the command line using chk config and
the graphical views using NTFS file
system take this little okay so the same
command just quick revision of what we
have seen in module one that's testing
shown against here coupon think I can
make a list and then we can specify the
service this that service then we can
also modify the services in other one
level system okay next
so securing the single user mode logging
is an important step in terms of
tightening the security okay so so
before going into this so we have
something called single user mode right
so that is your run level one okay
so if you forgot I have given one simple
sailor you where if you have forgot the
truth password what you can do is log
into the single user mode and then you
can change the root password in the
single user mode all right so when I say
this once I show how to do that so
you'll understand that okay this is
there is some feature that is available
but in terms of security you might have
a question that so does this mean that
any person can come restart my system
lon Casilla music rule and change the
root password so the variable security
so with respect to that we do have an
option that is available where they can
block the usual from entering into the
single user mode we will see that
security expert transfer okay so
securing the single user mode login is
an important step in terms of writing
security as anyone without knowledge of
put in the system gain root access
without knowing the truth faster by
simply modifying from there anything if
I will show you how to make this change
and how to change the password okay okay
use the following steps to take you at
the single usable condition is about
securing it let's first see how to
modify it in the first place okay
alright so here are some steps that are
even so you need to restart your system
first so this is currently a level 5
okay you have logged in as food and I
can do they started amusing so now I
have restarted my system
okay so if you can see all the messages
that are coming up we have seen their
service stopping cups so just like if
you use the command service cups stop
okay so it is going yes it has
successfully stopped this one it
similarly sshd so it refers to secure
shell if you have used it you might have
you would know how to I mean if you want
to login from one Linux system Canada
you will use SSH service all right
similarly we have something called
Autobahn I told you how to connect the
pendrive and manually move the bedroom
but if you have this feature called Auto
mount automatically when you connect a
device it could get mounted and all the
points and the device will be available
to you okay similarly we have NTP its
Network protocol I mean time and date
settings available in that service and
we have something called it sharing
Hardware extraction layer and networking
so he says ok like that we have lot of
services so one after another it will
try to see so this is your drop page
okay so I think by default the time
limit is 5 seconds so I have once you
press the arrow arrow keys it will stop
at the droplets so this is my club page
here are the instructions that are
available all right so after that here I
can press e to edit the commands before
booting so simply I can press you know
enter then the system will start booting
on what I can do is if you want to
modify this key it will display all the
three three entries which are part of my
group dot qualify so in this list there
is something called kernel to be to
maybe provide an argument that I want to
login to single user mode so press E all
right so this is the online space one OK
you can either give single ok good or
you can also mention one enter so after
that
once I entered what I can do it then
here if you see press B to boot
okay so the reason why we have B to go
then you can also have two different
kernels here all right
so you can choose the kernel modified so
single user mode and you can log into it
or you can decide which color you want
to boot with so I have voted so before
it lands up myths
so after confirming
okay so we have restarted the system
here in the boot page you've seen this
PDF in and selected the kernel line and
then here same line it's just a
different kind of indication same with
is it more okay then save press ENTER
and then be to put has that particular
and their value level see similarly you
can see my system will be starting low
so it will it will land up you know sure
okay
where they can directly so once the
system restart to the simple use it
won't it will prompt you to enter the
boot password in the single user mode
right now the shell access to the boot
will do this will be denied when you
okay put this in this example actually
we have restricted the user you know we
have enabled the security fat so that
even if you log into single user mode so
before landing up into the shell the
user will be asked to provide a good
person so this is where the routine it
has to provide the password again has to
land up in the film this is a security
measure so what I'm showing here is
where in the system will land up so the
default one where we land up English and
the shell then we will try resetting the
password go to user so then the first
scenario once that is done then we will
see how to set up a restriction and then
logging will have the root user
no they're able to provide the password
and the blood into the shell
alright so these are two different
different use cases
all right it's done so if you can see my
screen so directly I have landed in the
single user mode all right one now in
order to reset the password the command
is positive by default I'm the road to
user shipping so then you pass high
school it will ask for the duty in the
password that's it
the rule password has been changed again
I'll restart the system so this is how
we log into this thing will use it now
now here I'll show you how to respect
how to set up we know how do whoever
just to make sure that whoever has
logged into this will be the mode is the
boot is aware of the root password so
there is no restriction so that again
I'm a believer so what you can do you
this so we keep on here wait a minute
tab fight
so these are the steps in order to
enable that restriction okay so you need
to be a root user okay and if you want
to restrict the users locks interest
until you hit one you need to make sure
that three reverse the password is the
right person for marking so we need to
insert this package insert a line above
it sit for in a day for so I'll show you
my configuration file you just have to
go to the ending of the file ok here
there is something called in at a point
above which we need to mention this
particular life ok XD : 3 so before the
user lots in okay so the militant needs
to provide the password ok so this is
how so once you make an entry code that
then automatically to write the password
first before entering Israel can believe
it
so try this if there are any questions
that video okay
so this is very simple logging into
single isn't work five more I can change
this here in their top five
and try not being in see everything
if the spinner is asking you for
possible done not so we will see like
there are different ways of restricting
the users even you can restrict the
users from entering into the graph page
search them okay so gradually really
will see all the other options are good
so this is one security aspect and we
will from really will go from one level
to the next level alright so this is
about restricting the users okay
so the next one is shut down
come on there if you remember the wrong
levels you can either give in its phase
zero or you can also go with the
shutdown command other little internet
system it shuts the system immediately
there are some arguments available as
well so what do you do is you can run
this command along with this R gives
good and you can also echo or send a
message to the users of the system that
the system you might have observed this
if you are I think even in Windows you
get to see if that there are some
updates that must be done on your system
and you get restarted in some time
something like that so similarly we can
we can schedule the shutdown process and
send out a message in quick access to
all the users who are logged in other
terminals all right see okay let's start
I will show you usually our people did
if you have a Linux server how people
usually connect the server from you know
from clients like they used put tea or
some other client services all right
so in that case it will be multiple
users logging in to the server from
different different from different
different nations so then we need to
make sure that all the users are
informed that the system is one of your
three strands or something in those
areas we can and it'll do that we can
run this command so that's all being is
just another terminal change
okay so let's turn down - our argument
is easy to restart your system and in
case if you have a shutdown you can
cancel it
using this you can you can simply
practice all this arguments there very
basic ones so see you can also reboot
your system directly by using the we
would command and parallely you can use
this argument
as well so so far we have seen three
different days of starting or shutting
down your system this will be good
command
okay you can shut down using the init
command s1
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
