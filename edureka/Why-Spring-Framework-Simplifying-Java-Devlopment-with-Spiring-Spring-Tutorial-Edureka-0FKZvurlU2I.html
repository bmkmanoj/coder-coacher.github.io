decided to make a web application for
their customers so the management calls
the web development team which is led by
James
you can see James here okay so the team
of four James Rocchi Algernon Lena so
James is leading the meeting team there
is an urgent requirement so I call you
here one of our customers needs us to
build an application for them we have
very less time and the customer wants
the application to be up and running
before Christmas do you guys have any
idea how can we go about with this
because if we stop making the
application by the usual way it will
take a lot of time yeah then I have also
seen in our previous projects there were
a lot of quotes that did not do anything
we want something fast and efficient so
this the code that did not do anything
part is James was talking about
non-functional requirements so one of
the team members or has registered to go
with Spring Framework Oh rocky says can
you Rocky
can you tell us more about spring how it
matches our a requirement because as
rocky suggested to go with spring so the
other team member is curious to know
Edward why he opted for Spring Framework
then rocky started explaining spring is
well established framework with lots of
features that helps the developers to
work on their application rather than
worrying about non-functional code so
Bing
and developer you can focus on what is
required to deliver instead of in order
to deliver the required things what are
the non-functional requirement that you
need to satisfy okay so that you can get
rid of when you go for any framework
like spring it also increases developer
productivity and then reduces the
application development time because
most of the things are already offered
by the framework related to
non-functional requirements as you are
focusing on only functional requirements
so it obviously results in a better
application development yeah so he's
mister rod Johnson started SpringSource
company and development spring framework
for Apache 2.0 in June 2003 the spring
framework is an open-source application
framework and inversion of control
container for the java platform it
provides comprehensive infrastructure
support for developing java applications
spring handles the infrastructure so we
can focus on our application so all the
infrastructure related stuff will be
handled by the framework called spring
and we can focus only on our business
what is the meaning of non-functional
requirement so basically non-functional
requirements or not the requirements
that we do or the car the features that
we develop them usually non-functional
requirements could be for example if you
take flip cards 1 billion or sill so if
you recall that stuff there were lakhs
of people lakhs of users were accessing
Flipkart 8 a time
so here the non-functional requirement
would be it should handle lakhs of user
sessions so that is unknown
requirement what is a functional
requirement here when I select an item
to the cart and when I want to job
purchase that item when I want to place
in our order with respect to that item
that would be a functional requirement
and here the non-functional requirement
would be handling one lakh sessions next
why spring because there are a number of
other frameworks available in the market
so why should I go for spring so spring
is a framework like starts and hibernate
spring is famous in the industry the
learners should focus on learning more
offspring
compared to other technologies now
spring and hibernate are extremely
popular and widely used in the industry
Spring Framework is lightweight as it
does not involve installation start up
and stop activities associated with our
container
okay so first statement is it is same as
the other frameworks like Stearns
in hibernate so it is same in the
context that it is a framework under it
is more than what's struts and hibernate
okay how we will see in our sessions
under now Spring has become the de facto
standard for web application development
with respect to toe and Enterprise okay
next learners should focus on learning
spring why because we have a classic
example with within our session itself
what is that
see Dickie has asked can we cover spring
with Hadoop integration so what is what
I want to relate here is Hadoop is a new
technology and the spring as a framework
has an integration layer
with Hadoop directly under we have
several no sequel databases which were
evolving recently
okay so we have integration with the
tools
No no sequel databases also for example
MongoDB which is currently very good at
market and Springs has an integration
layer with MongoDB also so what does it
mean being a framework if any new
technology comes into the market and if
its support integration with that
framework then we can easily adopt to
any technology and we can get all the
new technologies into your project and
even after including all those
technologies into your project till they
are maintainable still they are
maintainable this was missing with
struts so mostly it was to deal with tag
lives as well as the other very limited
set of frameworks but compared to string
we cannot compare both because we cannot
compare it with respect to performance
or we cannot compare with respect to to
the number of integrations it has okay
stretch is very good in some extent but
if you are going beyond enterprise level
application preferable is spring okay
next
so spring it will come with its own
container that we will we'll talk about
in our next two slides so usually if you
aware of servlets and jsps so what we
will do in servlets and jsps if you--if
we develop a web application using
servlets and jsps we need our web
container which is assumed Tomcat and we
need a servlet container because we have
container already a has
so in order to deal with servlets and
jsps we need to have a web server under
along with it has to have a servlet
container okay so if you if you want to
borrow from a any request on your web
application so your container should be
up and running and if you do any
modifications to your piece of code then
your web server has to be restarted okay
next in case of spring we have two parts
the first part is we can use spring
framework for developing core java
applications where we do not require any
container and we can use spring for
developing web applications so in order
to leverage the web our technologies
like request response and all so we need
a web server or an application server
but creation of beams and the
manipulation of beans and mapping the
requests and everything will be done
using the configuration files with the
support or I will see container so we
will see more incoming splits Java
frameworks in Java technology there are
so many framers that help the
programmers to build complex
applications easily we can choose these
frameworks for building our applications
for example hibernate we can use for
data based access mechanism
so basically hibernate is on top of a
concept called o are an object
relational mapping okay so with the
concept of ORM what is the ultimate goal
that we are achieving we can talk to
bozos instead of firing sequel queries
with respect to each database so then we
can map our torus with our relation it
really
database management system so from them
we can directly speak to POJO rather
than speaking to the underlying relation
so with this change of database we can
do on the fly with minimal changes okay
next struts as you know we use Hertz
framework for web application
development eg B's services like
transaction security and the messaging
ejv has the inbuilt support for all this
stuff so that that is very easy B or was
very famous but nowadays the bits the
speed the spring is growing I can I
could say that
eg B's is outdated because of the
performance reasons also that was
decided and the log4j you might be
knowing about it or not I will tell you
so log4j
is a framework for logging what is the
importance of logging so using logging
many a times a developer can know for
example if an exception occurs during
while you are accessing any of the
resource on your web application so you
can directly go to the locks and you can
verify what exactly went wrong you
cannot ask the user you can ask the user
to reproduce the step reproduce the
problem by asking the steps to reproduce
it but using locks only you can verify
where exactly it went wrong and you can
rectify them let us talk about a problem
applications that use these varied
frameworks and services become difficult
to maintain as it grows including
testing effort so what is the need
applications that use a number of
frameworks and the services have to
remain
maintainable yes when it has an
integration layer with all the services
then it is maintainable code should be
loosely coupled with the frameworks so
that testing and reusability becomes
easy so this is very dependency
injection comes
so whatever the dependent classes are
there we will not be initializing those
along with the code which is using them
rather we will inject them ok so that it
is completely decoupled and it is very
easy to write a unit test cases for
those so what do you mean by what what I
mean by a unit test cases the unit is
our unit testing framework for Java
we're using which you can test a piece
of code a unit of code whether it is
working as expected lis are not by
passing they're passing some inputs and
you can expect the output also so when
your input and output result are as per
your expectation then then that piece of
code is working so that is how your Jana
Kramer evaluates your unit of code next
spring framework provides a lightweight
solution to develop maintainable and
reusable enterprise applications so what
is this lightweight we will talk about
it provides very simple and rich
facilities to integrate various
frameworks technologies and services in
the application so as I already covered
so we can integrate in number of
services along with your spring as it
has an integration rate so it would be
very easy to maintain
next spring simplified Java development
how to backup its attack on Java
complexity spring embroil
four key strategies lightweight under
minimally-invasive development with
plain old
optics we usually call them at ojos ojos
means a class with some attributes are
some data members associated with either
constructors or setter and getter
methods and which will not extend our
implement any of the framework related
classes or interfaces that is what we
call a plain old Java object loose
coupling through dependency injection
and interface orientation what does it
mean so for example for example I have a
user as well as I have a car plus so
based on users the specification a car
has to be built and that object of that
car has to be returned but if I write
that piece of code along with the user
then it is tightly coupled in steel what
I could do is I can pass user
requirements okay so this what we call
the creation of car object it can be
outsourced to the ioc container so that
user will be having a user as a class
will have a setter method for which
container will provide an instance of
car so here car is an interface in the
item BMW or i 20 and all these are
implementation of car interface so now
user as a class will have only
interfaces which will be injected by the
container what I was talking about let
us hold for a second now yeah I have a
class user ok and I
interface car so usually based on users
preferences I would be creating an
instance of car within the user class
itself what I mean
for example Boyd build a car it's a
method assumed so which will contain car
instead and here I would say that car
equal to new for example I 20 in car dot
whatever the Associated methods okay so
I would be setting info related to I
20 here okay so this is how usually we
can think of a user and a car instances
but here as the installation are as the
initialization for the creation of car
object is done inside user object what
does it mean now user and the car are
tightly coupled and the this logic I no
need to worry about it for example
somebody is developing a car interface
in your team and somebody is developing
a user class so what in order to do the
parallel development one can focus on
interface development and one can focus
on class development and one can say
that boss as you you will be providing a
instance of core with that assumption go
with your business logic so if that is a
contract then being are developed
of class user he is no need to worry
a what how exactly
God instant is created and what are the
properties associated with that the car
these is abstracted out of the user
class developer okay so how this can be
achieved this can be achieved in this
way for example instead of this I would
be having a sector method for example
void set car and here it would be having
an instance or car so here I would use
this dot car equal to car okay and here
I no need to initialize my car instance
instead as this setter method is being
invoked by some third party in our case
it is a container which is supplying me
the expected instance of car
so the instance could be for example
class I twenty implements car interface
so it could be an instance of i-20 or it
could be an instance of BMW or it could
be anything else okay so this would be
configuration driven okay so because of
this approach now car is loosely coupled
with user okay so because of I am not
creating an instance of car in the side
user we will have some other place on
the same topic will focus more yeah very
good
so we have few questions from Vijay
witnesses is it also true in production
environment that we do not need to
install web application server yeah so
in order to leverage the web features we
need to have a web container so I as I
said in one of our slides there are two
parts when you are developing core java
application using Spring Framework you
do not require to have any web app web
server an application server but when
you're developing a web application
using spring framework there you require
a web server or application server but
the instance the creation of objects are
done by I will see container only not by
your solid container that difference you
need to understand usually the instances
of servlet would be created by your
servlet container right in in your web
application but here the instances of
beans would be created and injected by
and I will see container okay so here
also in web application also as if you
want to qualify your application as verb
so it has to be deployed in AME of the
web server or application server but the
creation and what because injection
logic is no way dependent on your web
server or app server that will be taken
care by and in build a container we call
it as I will see container we will talk
about I was a container then you will be
cleared about it yeah and we he also
says that so so far whatever we
discussed like that has to be injected
so can't be as you distract any pattern
so some of you might be are knowing
about factory pattern
so what hwijae is talking about is for
it
Trumble for example I would be having I
would be having a class with a metal
coil get a car instance which access
which access our spring if you pass I 20
as the value then it will create an
instance of i-20 implementation and it
will return that object so we were
talking more of this right so that is
what which is question but here we have
there is a difference here you need to
call that factory method to give you the
instance but in I will see you no need
to call it will be injected we thought
you call it that is what inversion so we
are moving in a reverse direction right
usually you have to call to get
something here you you don't call we
will call that is what I will see so
when you can't figure it it will be
injected we thought you call it so that
is the difference between your factories
and I will see and the other difference
would be you will be end up in
developing factory process as then when
you will need so again this is a
non-functional requirement right
so we can develop a factory pattern but
if you need to develop it you need to
develop it for a number of cases again
it is a non functional requirement which
you you are getting it from you are
Spring Framework okay next
so this loose coupling through
dependency injection and interface
orientation declarative programming
through aspects and the common
conventions so what is this aspect and
all we have few other slides I will
discuss at that time then boilerplate
reduction through aspects only templates
so basically the last two points are
talking about a whoopy aspect oriented
programming which targets is which
targets it cross-cutting concerns what I
mean by cross-cutting concerned logging
could be a cross-cutting concern
security could be a cross-cutting
concern transaction management I in the
applying business rules and there are so
many other cross-cutting concerns you
can think of with respect to do an
application development
so all these cross-cutting concerns can
be addressed using a woopy can we have a
basic example to understand this sure
for example I have a class some hello
and it has a method called void
C hello now I want to calculate the time
taken by this method to execute this
piece of code so what I can do I can
write I can collect the start time here
and I can't take that
I'm here and I can calculate it by in
the time - start time okay so this is my
logic assume I can go for so in this
case if I want to perform this activity
for all the methods in my application in
all my classes then you have to write
this logic in all the methods right so
what I can treat now is I can extract I
can extract this as a concern out of my
method and I can write it only one time
and I can say that boss execute this
piece of code just when I enter into a
method and execute this piece of code
just before when I exit from a method so
if you write this logic in as a concern
or as an aspect then this can be
applicable to all your methods across
all your classes so this is what I feel
it as a cross getting concerned I don't
need to repeat the logic I can write it
for one time and which can be executed
on demand so when a method is entered
that piece of code will be executed as I
have configured it got my point so this
is what we actually using
AVO P aspect-oriented programming
