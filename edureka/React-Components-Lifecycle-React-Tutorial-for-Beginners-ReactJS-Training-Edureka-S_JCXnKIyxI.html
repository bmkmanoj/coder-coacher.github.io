name is Verdun and on behalf of Arica I
welcome you all to this session on react
components so in one of my previous
sessions I give you an introduction to
what is react and I spoke about various
other topics and today's session is
going to be limited only to react
components and I'm gonna go at that in
detail ok so without any further delay
let me show you what will be the topics
I will be covering in the session as you
can see first I will give you an
introduction to what are react
components and how they work after that
I will talk about props and state now
props in state are an integral part of
react components ok I will talk about
those things and after that I will talk
about the flow of stateless and stateful
components as to how the data flows
between them and finally I will talk
about the life cycle of these components
ok
these will be the topics I will be
covering and getting started this is the
first topic that is react confidence and
as you people might be aware of that in
react everything is a component right so
when we say everything it is basically
all whatever is are visible on the
webpage or on the web browser all those
things right whatever you see they are
divided into different components now
you might be able to see an image or you
might be able to see your video you
might be able to see a text box with
some more details and then you will find
links to other pages now each of these
are different components in that page ok
and that I've divided it over here so if
it's an image you would have it here
which would be one component the other
component might be a video and things
like that right now how does it work in
a normal browser okay in the HTML how
does it work all these different layouts
which would be there in the browser they
will all be linked with one another
right they will come one after the other
but that is what is different in react
even though you have all these things in
the same page they are separate from one
another and they do not affect the other
components okay as you can see here even
though there are different components
they are not gonna interfere with
another components performance but you
have to note that these are the building
blocks of the entire react page and
together they form the application but
having said that even if one of the
react components is removed then it's
not going to get other components to be
affected that's because these components
are independent of one another all right
so you can make any changes you want
supposing you want to remove one of the
video sections from your page and you
want to replace it with something else
you can do that and all these things can
be done without affecting the Dom okay
only the component which needs to be
changed only that component will be
changed and that will be rear-ended to
the Dom so that is the benefit with
react right so it's highly responsive
and what the change needs to be done
only that will be changed inside the web
browser okay so you should be clear on
this topic by now now moving on to the
next slide we have something called as
the react components UI tree now the
entire UI of any page developed in a
react is divided into different logical
pieces and these logical pieces are only
your components ok and these components
even though they are independent of one
another they are in fact linked in one
way right so it's not like all the
components would fade away up here or it
will not be straightaway called by your
native browser how it works is you have
one component and that component is
indirectly linked to two other
components okay and those components
would be linked to other components in
that web page so if you can see the UI
tree on the right-hand side you can see
that there is one right so the color
coding represents which component I am
talking about so the one that you see
here this is the root component or the
parent component and this parent
component has two children components
two and three so these are the two
components which we have in the web page
okay the example that I am talking about
is this one and these are the two child
competence and there are two other child
components for this component for
component number two okay known this
will act as a parent for components for
and components five now even though
these are independent of one another
they are linked in a way such that it is
the first component which invokes its
child component so in this case would be
two and three and similarly these
components four and five would be
invoked by their parent competence which
is comprar number two so that's how
there's a relation between the
components right yeah
and so you should not have the doubt
that because they are linked with one
another that you know it will affect the
performance or the visibility of the
other components no that will not happen
it's just that their layout and their
invocation only that is done by the
other component as in their parent
component okay
the only relation over here otherwise
these components are independent and you
know whatever you want to change in a
particular component you can do that
without any hassle and you know you will
not disturb any other aspects of your
webpage and now we are speaking about
the different components let's go into
details of what will be there in a
component and how a component works and
to a give you an example of that I will
show you that with the sample code that
you see on the screen and I this is a
hello world code okay now this is a very
simple code which would display these
details inside this component all right
and as you can see the class command is
what is used to initiate or start your
parent component that is component one
and every parent component it will have
a render function okay so irrespective
of which whether it's a parent or a
child component the render function is a
mask and what will the render function
contain it will basically contain all
the HTML tags that need to appear on
your web page okay because the render
function is what decides what will be
the HTML representation of this
component right
supposing I want to print hello world
and welcome to a to rake up on this
comprar number one then I would have to
specify that an HTML tags okay and since
there are two different HTML tags over
here which I want to display I have used
the and closing tags now the enclosing
tags are what is given inside the div
tags right div in case I just have one
history ml tag then in that case I don't
need to use the div all right so that's
how it works and finally it can have
these components of course they will
have one brand of function definitely
and along with that they can also have
calls to other child components in this
sample case I do not have any other
trial component I am not invoking
anything else so you do not see anything
over here okay but the other thing which
would definitely be there in the
component is rendering the Dom so
whatever components have so far been
specified in your code those will have
to be rendered to the Dom right now that
is done in this call so you're using
this line of code to basically render
your all the components to the Dom so I
hope this slide is clear to all of you
folks
now that you know what our react
confidence now let's go into details
about the two important aspects of
components these are the two important
aspects and those are prop and estates
okay now let's go into details of what
these two are let's first talk about
what props are in components so you will
have multiple components in your page
and props are what helps you communicate
with other components supposing you want
to invoke your child component then the
parent component does so with the help
of props if it wants to pass down any
values to the child component then the
whatever value is the pass on whatever
data is passed down it's called as props
props is nothing but it's short for
properties so take our example over here
this is the parent component the name of
my parent component is a body okay and
there's a render function over here
and inside the render function I have
basically two types one is the header
tag and the other is the photo tag now
these are again two different components
okay now this the syntax of invoking
other children components and in this
case I am NOT straightaway using any
header tag and writing any text so the
Bob and Alex that you see here these are
not going to be printed straightaway but
what I'm going to do is I'm invoking the
child comment which has a properties and
this props has the value of Bob right
and since this would be passed down as
props to the child the child would take
care of other functionality as to what
has to be displayed and what not
similarly I have another trial complan
which is nothing but footer and this
Haggen has a property name and the value
of this property is Alex and as you can
see on the image on your right these are
the two different components that will
be there which will come as an output
for this code okay you will have a head
of one and this component here has this
code which says this dot props dot name
alright and of course this component has
the same this dot props dot name now
these two lines that you see here which
are very identical these are what are
used to identify props if there is any
props which is coming in from the parent
component to the child component then
this is the line which is used to
identify that okay so in my case I am
invoking the props with the value Bob so
that Bob will be passed down to my child
component over here and when we say this
word props or name then
bob is what would be intermediately
displayed over here and similarly the
sake of my footer the name is Alex and
that is what is going to be displayed
over here too okay that's going to be my
foot ah so it's pretty simple slide I
hope you guys have a clarity on this
right this is a Bob and Alex this is how
is your page is gonna look alright these
two texts is what will be displayed on
your web page now moving on even if I
change the value of these props then
that would also be reflected over here
because these will be the only two items
which would be displayed to us on our
page and these components would
interpret this dot props your name to
its value and it would thus display
Cordy and in this case it would display
Milla right that's how the parent
component invokes the child component
with props and that's how the child
component displays whatever is given to
it as props moving on to the next slide
let's talk about props and material now
what are props and how do they work
so the props and react they work very
similar to HTML attributes just like how
you can change the color and set the
different aspects you can do the same
thing over here also okay it's very easy
to work on props in that way and one
important issue that you need to know is
the data always flows downwards from the
parent component to the children
component okay that's how it works in
props and the data that is there in
these props it's a unidirectional data
flow okay data flows from the top to the
bottom another important aspect you need
to notice props bits nothing but the
data always flows from the parent
component to the child component right
the child component cannot pass any
value to the parent okay and that is why
we say that there is a unidirectional
data flow over here and this is from up
to down and one more important thing is
props are immutable now when we say
immutable it means that whatever props
are being paused or whatever data is
passed from the parent to the child this
data cannot be modified by the child
component okay that's the meaning of
immutable it cannot be updated it will
have to use it as it is or displayed as
it is and of course the other thing is
these child cop prints can set its own
default props now at times if the parent
component does not send any props to the
child component then at those time the
child comment can basically set its
a prop so there's a rule for that which
will be executed and which will be
displayed at times when there is nothing
being passed from the parent okay so
that is about props and this is an
example code which I want to show you
about props okay
so as you can see here again I'm
initiating my main component over here
which is nothing about the parent
component and this has one render
function okay and inside the render
function I have one hatch tml tag which
says hello world from Ed Eureka and
along with that I have calls to three
other child components I am calling the
header component two times and then I'm
calling the footer component once and
each time I'm sending different values
okay now these are the props and these
are the values for those props and then
I'm simply closing these bags with the
help of my end closing tag okay now
let's see how children components work
the children components would get the
props from parent and it would simply
displayed okay so I have a hedge to tag
which says the head name is this got
props dot name so this what props dot
name is what comes from here right so it
says name is the property and I'm
setting that property over here so this
would be replaced by whatever value that
property has so in this case it would be
Bob and this would be the inside the
hedge to tag and the head shoe tag ends
over here and after this since the next
command R would be here executed again
I'm calling the header child component
and I would be printing a different
value though this time the value of I
will be printing is that of Max okay so
the same child comment will be called
and mash should be printed this time and
when the third child component which is
footer is called the island value will
be passed along with the property okay
and similarly that would be replaced
over here and a displayed inside the h2
tags okay so the photo name would be
Alan and accordingly the other things
and then finally I can end my code by
rendering all these components to the
Dom with this function I explained this
earlier also so every time you write a
react code you have to always render all
the components that you have defined to
the Dom so that's what I'm doing over
here so that is about props now let's go
on to what our state okay
now state is a different topic
altogether okay it's a little similar to
props but still let's see what other
differences between props and state the
with state is that so in props I earlier
said that whatever value is passed from
the parent component to the trial
component they are immutable that is
they cannot be changed however the main
difference between the two is that in
state whatever comes down it can be
changed and hence it's called state okay
so in props values cannot be changed and
in state the values can be updated to
give you an example let's see this they
will always be a change in state with
respect to time or with respect to other
factors right that is being explained
over here where there is ice and when
the temperature increases this ice melts
into water correct and this change in
state is because of some other factor
now because of such factors you might
also want a certain changes to happen in
your webpage so at those times you would
want to use state so state is thus a
very important aspect of components and
the important aspect with competence is
that since they can change it will keep
track of all the updates that are made
so in memory it would store all the
previous state and whatever future
states are there those will also be
stored in memory okay
and speaking of more details about state
I already told you that component states
are mutable okay that means the data can
be updated and it can be changed and
these state objects these are the ones
which control the rendering and the
behavior of your components okay and
because the state is so flexible it is
actually the most important part of your
competence and we consider this as the
core of the react components and because
it is the core it has to be kept as
simple as possible to enable readability
and as the diagram here represents the
state can be changed or updated with
time or with certain actions okay so
moving on to the next slide now even in
competency there are two types one is
stateless competence and the others
stateful component the stateless
components are those which do not have
any idea of what its previous state was
what its current state is and what its
future state is going to be okay
so it is going to simply display
whatever the parent component passes
down to it and the stateful component on
the other hand is a very smart component
because it keeps track of what was its
previous state it keeps track of that in
memory okay and it's always aware of
what its current state and it can also
update its current state right
that's why this is a smart component
these are the two types of components
okay and going on to the next slide as
you can see the representation the
stateful component is the parent
component it can be the child component
at times but the stateless components
can never be parent components okay
the stateless components they can only
display whatever is being told to it by
the state 'fl components all right but
the central component can also sometimes
display whatever it needs and whenever
needed it'll also pass down those states
to the other stateless competence so
that's what you need to remember about
stateful components and stateless
components okay
the stateless components they calculate
the internal state of the components
right however these stateful components
they are the core competence which store
information about the components
previous State or current state in
memory okay so moving onto the next
slide now let's see how there's a flow
between these stateful and stateless
components okay
I'll explain that with an example of es6
code okay as you can see this my app is
my parent component okay it's defined
with the help of this class and the
constructor this is my superclass which
I am using well before I explain this
code I want to help you set the context
now this code which I'm going to show
you is for an application which would
show if I am currently logged in or if
I've logged out of that application it
would display that a status to me and to
display that what I have to show is that
when the application is initially
accessed it would always be logged out
right you cannot sign into any
application directly so that is the very
same reason why I am setting the initial
state of the application to logged out
and if I have to represent that in these
terms
I have created a variable called is
logged in and I'm setting is logged in
to false which basically is the other
meaning for the application I am
currently logged out of it right that's
what I'm doing over here selling the
initial State and after that I have
another function over here okay the
function is received click so whenever I
click the login button the state has to
change right from logged out to login so
for that functionality I have written
this line of code now initially this
will not be executed straightaway but
whenever a child component
the parent component that there is some
kind of action needed then at that time
my parent company will call my child
component will send down the props to my
child component with this function call
okay
that's what you're supposed to know and
when this function call is invoked what
happens is the current state is
basically inverted so if I'm currently
logged out then the next state should be
logged in right because when there's a
button click right that's what we've
said your receive click whenever a click
is received on the button I would have
to change from the logged out state to
logged in state and that is what I've
defined here so in am setting the is
logged in value is not of this dot state
dot is logged in so if it's initially
false it would then become true and that
would be stored over here that would be
my new state all right and this it would
go down as props to my child component
and before I explain how it goes onto
the child complet let me explain what is
there inside the render function so
inside the render function I have a
number of HTML tags which I have defined
inside the enclosing tags
okay I've first of all said that hello I
am a stateful parent component which
it's true and then it says I monitor if
my user is logged in or not and then it
says let's see what is your status and
what i'm doing here is it prints the
current status based on a conditional
statement in fact initially when the
application is accessed it would be
logged out so i'm basically using the
conditional statement to print what is
my current status for that I'm saying
this dot state dot is logged in which I
have initially set it over here correct
if my this dot state dot is logged in is
true then I would be printed you are
logged in but if this condition is false
then it would print not logged in so in
my case initially it would print not
logged in right because my is logged in
would be false and because of that this
condition would fail and this is what
would be printed and I'm basically
closing these tags for that and then I
have other HTML tags when I am saying hi
I'm a stateless soil component then I'm
saying I'm a logging button then there
is also another line which says I don't
maintain the state but I tell the parent
component if the user clicks me now this
is what I told you earlier when I said
that the child component would notify
the parent component that there has been
some action
and there has to be a state change so
the parent component would then do the
honor of calling the child component
with the appropriate props or the state
so in my case what I am doing is I am
using props so my button that you see
here this is the child component that
this parent component is going to call
and the function is click so when there
is a click that happens then I'm
basically binding whatever rules have
been specified inside this function
right whatever operations that my
receive click would do that is there in
my previous slide so let me show you
that as you can see here this dot state
right
this operation is inside my receive
click so whenever this dot received
click is called then those functions
would be binded to this particular prop
okay and this would be passed down to
this child component and similarly the
is logged in state right this would also
be sent as a prop to my child component
so there will be two props which I will
be sending one is the function receive
click along with binding and then this
dot state dot is logged in this will
also be sent all right
great I'll be passing props my child
component now finally let me explain
what to be there in my child component
so I've defined my child component with
this my button okay and inside my head
gmail tags I've said when there is a
button on click that is whenever the
button to login or logout is clicked
then use the props click so this
function would be invoked right and
along with this these two props would be
handled and it would receive these props
from the parent component and the state
would change and what I'm doing here is
I'm just printing this click to with an
arrow and here I'm using props dot is
logged in so is logged in is a prop
which I'm passing from my parent
component to trial component if you
remember this one is logged in and it
would simply print what is the current
status if I'm currently logged out that
would be printed here but if I am
currently logged in that would be
printed in that case since in my
previous slide there was a click on the
button the state would change over here
right the is logged in would then change
to current state has logged in so that
is what would be sent over here and if
this probes what is
logged in if this condition is true that
is if there is a true value over here
then this is what will be printed that
is logout okay
but if it is false then login would be
specified now the rule is such that this
is the option to change the state again
if I'm country logged in and if I want
to logout then I will have to click this
button so for that purpose I am again
using the props to specify the current
state and I'm saying do this to logout
or do this to login and since I'm
calling the is logged in then this would
be called and my state would then be
changed okay that's how this would work
and then of course I'm cloning the
button tags for this and then I'm
closing also the and closing tags inside
which this button is present okay and
that's how I invert between login and
logout and finally I am rendering with
these components to my door
that's how there is a flow of states
between stateless to stateful components
okay I hope that code help you
understand what I just said but if not
don't worry because this example that
I'm showing you this would also help you
otherwise
this was the HTML tag which I wanted to
initially print hi I am a stateful
parent component and currently the first
time when you log in you will of course
be not logged in right will be logged
out so for that the initial state would
be not logged in this would be printed
and the moment this button is clicked
which is login button is clicked then
this state would change to you are
logged in okay and then of course even
this would get updated to logged in
because once you've logged in then you
would have to log out right so this is
the log out button over here and this is
the login button and yeah the same rule
is what I explained you over here during
my child component and during my render
function of my parent component okay now
I hope you got a better understanding of
react components over here right how the
data flow happens okay very good so I
can go to the next slide now and that is
component lifecycle okay now this is the
final topic in this session and what I'm
going to do here is I'll explain what
are the different phases so there are
four different phases in your component
lifecycle okay the first will be your
initial phase the next will be your
updating phase the third will be your
props change phase and the fourth will
be the unmounting phase okay now let's
see each of these in detail
this lifecycle phase would basically
represent what are the different phases
your component will pass over the
lifetime okay during its lifetime what
are the different component phases it
will fall under okay that's what I'm
going to explain over here and starting
off with the first phase in the initial
phase the component is just about to
make its way to the Dom all right now is
when is this gotten invoked but it has
not been passed on to the Dom okay and
this face will have five important
methods the first method is that of get
default props
okay now this method allows you to
specify the default value of this dot
props it gets called before your
component is even created or any props
from the parent is passed on all right
and then we have another method which is
the get initial state and the get
initial state method allows you to
specify the default value of this dot
state before your component is created
just like get default props but this too
gets called before your component is
created and the next method is component
will mount okay this is the last method
that gets called before your component
gets rendered to the Dom there is an
important thing you have to understand
about this method and that is if you
were to call the set state inside this
method then your component will not be
able to rear-end off that's the thing
okay and then you have a render method
and by now you should be familiar with
this method right every component will
have this method defined and this is
what is responsible for returning a
single route HTML node which may have
child nodes inside it I mean if you
don't wish to render anything simply
return null or you can return false and
then the next method that you have over
here is that of component dead mount now
this method gets called immediately
after your component renders and gets
placed on the Dom so at this point you
can safely perform any Dom queering
operations without worrying about
whether your component has made it or
not so that's what this method does and
one thing you to remember here is that
except the render method all of these
lifecycle methods can fire only once and
this is all done in the initial phase
now let's go to the updating phase which
is the next phase and see what methods
that we have there and what the abating
phase basically does so in the updating
phase if there is
any change to your state then that would
be updated and re-rendered over here
okay so yeah basically if there is any
update or rerender to your states in
your competence then that will fall
under this updating phase and this again
has these four methods okay the first is
should component update so sometimes you
might not want your component to update
when a state change occurs this method
allows you to control this updating
behavior and if you use this method and
return a true value the component will
update and in case this method returns a
false value then at that time this
component will just simply skip the
updating aspect and then you have
another method which is component will
update now this will get called just
before your component is about to update
as a name suggests one thing you should
notice that you can't change your state
by calling this dot a set state from
this method okay and after that you have
the render method just like the initial
phase and if you didn't overwrite the
update via other should component update
method the code inside this render
method will get called again to ensure
your component it displays itself
properly okay and the final component is
that of component did update now this
method gets called after your component
updates and the render method has been
called so if you need to execute any
code after the update takes place you
can put it inside this method okay so
that's what is about the updating phase
now let's go on to the next phase which
is nothing but the props change phase
and in this phase if there is any change
to the props in that state if any prop
is getting updated and rear-ended then
that component would be under this phase
of its life cycle okay and this again
has the same set of methods that we had
in the updating phase okay except for
this method that you see your competence
will receive props this is the only
addition in this particular phase and
this method basically returns one
argument and this argument will contain
the new prop value that is to be
assigned to it okay the rest of the
lifecycle methods will behave identical
to the methods which you know we saw on
the previous phase when dealing with a
prop change and finally down to our last
phase which is the unmounting phase your
is when our component is being destroyed
that time your component will
for under this face okay this is the
unmounting face it would be destroying
where the dome will get destroyed from
the browser and here you have one method
which is component will unmount okay and
you can perform any cleanup radial tasks
over here such as removing any event
listeners or stopping timers etc and
after this method gets called your
component is a straightaway removed from
the Dom permanently okay so now we are
done with all the phases of our
components life cycle along with that
method so let's move to the next slide
then and this would be the last slide in
my session and it's all about the
complan life cycle in a glance so if you
were attentive and if you remember what
I explained all this time then this is
just an overview that you have a way or
right so you have the component will
receive props over here after you have
the chute component update and all these
things so I do request you to go through
this and spend enough time on this light
to understand the entire lifecycle ok so
this brings me to an end of this slides
and next what I have for you is a
demonstration of this particular topic
ok and this basically brings an end to
my session on and react components all
right so guys as you can see I have
opened up a web storm for showing my
react code and in this demo I'm going to
show you a simple application which I've
created ok and this happens about how
the data I will get incremented so you
have a button there and you have a
counter on my application whenever the
button is clicked then that counter will
be incremented by one so initially you
know we have to set the value of our
counter to zero right so all these
things is what I've covered in this code
and let me get started with the code and
the most important thing that you need
to know is the my app right so this the
name of my parent component I've defined
it here and since I told you that my
counter will initially have a value of 4
0 I have to set that state right so
that's what I've done here I'm using
this dot state to set the value of my
data to 0 so initially I'm setting it to
0 and later if I want to increment it
then have to use a different function to
increment it so this is going to be the
initial state however and as you can see
this is a function which is set a new
number so whenever there's a click on
the button done that time the value has
to be incremented right so that function
I've defined it over here set a new
number where I'm using the data that
I've set over here and to this I'm
increasing by one okay so every time the
button is clicked the data the value of
my state will be incremented by one
that's what's going to happen over here
and that's all my parent comfort is
going to contain so after this I have
simply used a render function could
basically display everything by on my
HTML right so in my render function for
that purpose I have used two types okay
I've used the button tag which would
basically record any mouse click that I
perform and whenever the mouse click
happens on the button I've used the own
click function for that to capture that
right so this dot I set a new number
right this would be called so whenever
the button is clicked on the mouse the
set new number would be called and since
the first time when it's called the
value would be initially zero that would
be incremented to one and that is what
would be set okay and that value would
be sent here so in the next line of code
what I've done is I've called my child
component and my component name is
content okay and my num is the props
that I'm sending down to my child
component okay and this dot sate dot
data right this whatever data is the
updated value of my data right that is
what aunt Randal sent to my child
component and what I want my child
component to ideally do is only display
this data so my parent component here is
going to act like the stateful component
and my trial conference is going to be
the stateless component which is the
dumb component and it would simply
display whatever is print old right so
the one thing that you people need to
notice my state is sent down as props
from my parent component to my child
component okay now that we've seen my
parent component and now that I've
showed you how the data is sent to my
child component right how the ER state
is sent down as props let's go to the
child component and see what happens
over here okay
so guys this is my child component and
as I told you all your content is the
name of my child and inside this soil
component I have called these methods
which I explained during my slides so
during its lifecycle I told you that it
would call different methods right now
those methods to give you an explanation
I have shown it over here by calling
those methods with
our text which would be printed so I've
used the console dot log command to
display this text on my console so when
my component will mount a method is
called this line of X would be displayed
because of this command console dot log
okay and similarly when I component dead
mount method is called
this text component dead mount would be
displayed on the console and similarly
for each and every method which I call
her of appropriately put down that text
so for component will receive props what
will be displayed as component will
receive drops and for a short component
update I'm basically returning true okay
and similarly there's competence will
update and after tilted component will
update and for comment did update have a
similarly said competence did update and
finally when the component will unmount
a set the text will be displayed as
component will unload alright so this is
just for your explanation I am I've
tried to put down those methods over
here and since this is again my trial
component I will have to have a render
function right now I've used this render
function to accept the prop so whatever
props comes from my parent have used
that to displayed over here and I've
used that this got props got my num to
display that data so the current data is
what it will be sent down if you
remember I am using my num as a prop to
send down the current data and the data
whatever is the current value of my
state that would be sent to my num and
that I'm receiving over here and I'm
printing it inside the h2 tags okay and
my render function is only gonna do this
much it's only going to display my h2
tag all right guys
okay so that's all about my child
comforter okay now now that I've defined
both my apparent on my child
comprehensive functionalities what we
have next is the react Dom dot render
now what this would do is simply it
would render my components to the Dom
okay this would be the final step or the
final you know set of lines in my code
and whatever components that I have both
my parent and Mishelle component they
would be rendered here I want to the
HTML by using the ID
content okay so you can see the name of
my parent component here at my app
alright so that's how it's done and to
also show you how the unmounting
actually happens right now I've
explained all these methods
told you that how the complan will fall
under different phases but if you want
to destroy your Dom how will that happen
so for that purpose I have used a
timeout to basically which will destroy
my dog after set period of time and the
time period which have set is thirty
thousand milliseconds which is basically
30 seconds okay so after 30 seconds this
function would be called and my unknown
component would be executed and which
would just destroy my your conference
from the Dom okay so let me quickly
execute the score and show you this code
okay how it works so for that purpose
let me open up the terminal and execute
the npm command okay so the command is
npm run it alright
okay my application is being served from
localhost:8080 and yes it's compiled
successfully so now let me go to my
local host localhost:8080 and yes this
is the application so now this is the
simple button that we have and this is
the counter okay now if I click on this
button then the value over here would be
incremented right so if I click on
increase it's incremented by 1 and if I
click on it again
it's incremented by one more and it's
now 2 now that's how the data gets
incremented and that's how using react
the data is you know what you get what
is displayed to you that is being
updated continuously write the complex
gets rear-ended on the Dom and if you
noticed right now the content also got
destroyed that's because of the unknown
command which would have been executed
after 30 seconds from launching the
browser okay let me explain that again
so this time remember that after 30
seconds of launching this application my
conference will get unmounted
automatically so I'm going to refresh
this okay so 30 seconds from now this
component will be unmounted okay so till
then we can increase it we can hit the
button any number of times and that mean
times the counter would have increased
by one okay so let's wait for a few more
seconds
yeah so that's where so as you can see
the complan got destroyed all right now
to show you how the different methods
are being called at different times let
me open up the console okay now this is
the console and as you can see these
many times these many methods were
called during this phase because I had
incremented 10 times right now let me
refresh this page now you can see
initially the components were rendered
for the first time and those times the
component will mount and the competent
dead mount methods got executed okay now
if I increment the button then these
three methods were called right the
component will receive props the
component will update and component a
dead update now if I again increment it
the same three methods would be called
again right component receive props the
competence will update and the complan
did update and since the 30 seconds are
done the competent we get destroyed and
it'll be removed from the dom and that
will be done by the help of the
component will unmount method okay so
that's how the entire raw functionality
works alright guys so I hope you guys
had a good understanding of how this
happened now this is a very simple
application however I would request you
people to you know explore the code play
around with react and learn more and
develop more complex applications okay
so let me get back to my slides for a
