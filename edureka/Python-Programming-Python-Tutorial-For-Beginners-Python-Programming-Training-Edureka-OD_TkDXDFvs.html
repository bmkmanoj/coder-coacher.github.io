and I'm very excited to be here on a
dirac alive with you guys so today we
will be discussing about all the basics
of Python and I will also be giving you
enough reasons to learn Python but
before we move forward I want to tell
you that if you have any questions in
your mind during the session please
write it down in a chat box
me and my team will reply back to you
ASAP so let's begin guys we'll start by
understanding what exactly is Python so
python is an open source object-oriented
programming language with some
procedural concepts as well now it comes
with really cool features guys first of
all it is an open source general-purpose
language it supports automatic memory
management and various data types as
well and it's a post object-oriented
programming and apart from that it's
pretty portable it runs in all major
operating systems all right so this is
just a small introduction to Python let
us see what are the various applications
that Python comes with here I've listed
down only for applications but there are
many more guys I've listed down web
scraping you can perform testing you can
perform web development data analysis
you can even perform automation there
are a lot of things that you can do with
Python you can even create the deep
learning models machine learning models
using Python so yeah I mean it there are
like wide variety of applications that
Python comes with so let's focus on the
job training as well so here I've
compared dotnet and PHP with Python in
terms of demand of respective related
jobs and this data have taken from
indeed.com so you can see that python is
a clear winner here as well
now let us see who all are using Python
so it is basically a list of few giants
that are using Python so YouTube Google
Dropbox Raspberry Pi Netflix National
Security Agency NASA BitTorrent so I've
listed on any few companies that are
using Python right even the popular
YouTube video sharing system is
in Python now Google also makes
extensive use of Python and its web
search system similarly Dropbox
raspberry pi all these companies are
using Python and yeah it's it's a great
language and it it can be your first
programming language as well because of
the ease of you know writing Python
codes because you don't have to worry
about those complex syntax is right it's
very easy the syntax is very very simple
and yeah it's it's a great language to
start with so we'll begin guys will
first see what are variables so
variables are nothing but reserved
memory locations to store values this
means that when you create a variable
you reserve some space in memory right
so you can even see in the diagram as
well so I have three variables a B and C
with values 16 20 and a dirac are
respectively and all these variables the
value is stored in their respective
memory locations so I'll just quickly
open my pycharm
and I'll show you there how you can
declare variables so guys this is my
pycharm and let me tell you how you can
declare variables so a is equals to 10
so a is a variable in which I've stored
value 10 right and when I talk about
comment so in Python how you throw in a
comment is just use this hash symbol and
then write whatever you want and that
statement won't be executed similarly if
I have say a multi-line comments and
then I can use triple quotes right and
yeah write whatever you want so I'll
just write here multi-line comment right
so it's very easy you don't have to
worry about any complex syntax I'm
getting again repeating that it's a
great language to start with and yeah
this is how you declare a variable and
one more thing I saw in Python when you
are defining a set of characters which
we call strings you need to enclose it
within a single quotes all you need to
enclose it within double quotes and let
me tell you guys Python cannot
differentiate between single quotes and
double quotes right so if I have to say
declare a variable B and I want a set of
characters to be there inside B so
example I want
to be there so I'll just write in here
Eddie Rekha in single quotes or double
quotes it doesn't really matter now I
can just go ahead and print both these
variables and just to show you how the
output looks like
and that's pretty basic ten and Eddie
Rekha right so let me open my slides
once more and now we'll see what is next
so now we are going to discuss about
various data types in Python so Python
supports various data types these data
types actually defines the operations
performed possible on the variables and
the storage method right so you can see
in the diagram as well that the types of
data types available in Python so we
have numeric lists tuples string set and
dictionary all right so let's discuss
each of these in detail so for that I'll
quickly open my Python and we'll start
with numeric data type all right so
let's begin guys so a numeric data type
just as expected numeric data type store
numeric values and they are immutable
data type so when I say immutable this
means that you cannot change its value
and Python supports namely three
different numeric data types integer so
what are integers it holds all the
integer values that is all the positive
and negative whole numbers now it even
supports float and complex types when I
talk about float type it holds the real
numbers and are represented by decimal
and you know you can even use scientific
notations at times complex types these
are written in the form of a plus B J
where a and B are nothing but the float
values and J represents the square root
of minus 1 right so let me just quickly
show you integer float types in Python
so a is equal to 10 is an integer value
B is equal to say 10 point o 1 this is
again a float value and C is equal to 10
plus 6 J so this is a complex value
right so yeah I mean you can even
perform you could convert a float type
into an integer type an integer type
into a float type as well but you cannot
perform the similar operation with the
complex data type because the
interpreter gets confused as to which
value it has to convert whether the real
part or the imaginary part
right so I'll just quickly show you how
you can convert an integer value to a
float value I'll make use of this print
statement and I'll type in a call in
this float function and the value that I
want to convert sorry a so a is nothing
but an integer it has a value 10 I'm
going to convert it into a float type
let us see if that happens or not yep I
have converted it to a float type
similarly I can convert a B which is a
float type which contains a float value
into an integer value as well all I have
to do is put B here calling this int
function and go ahead execute this and
yup you can see instead of 10 point o 1
we have got 10 here so this is all about
a numeric data types guys let's move
forward and we'll focus on the next data
type that is called list all right so
you can consider a list as our agency
but unless you can store elements of
different types but in array all the
elements should be of the same type that
is one major difference here and what
you need to do in order to declare a
list just put it within the square
braces and separate the objects with
comma that's all you have to do so here
i've created a list these are a few
these are the names of few characters
and friends Joey Chandler and also all
of you who watch friends yeah so you can
relate to these names fine so this is
how you declare a list so I've put all
the objects inside these square braces
let me just quickly go ahead and print
this list for you
so yup Joey Chandler Ross right so what
I'm going to show you now is few
operations that you can perform with
lists right so the first operation that
I'll tell you is slicing now before
slicing I need to tell you how indexing
happens in Python right so for that what
I will do I'll just throw in a
multi-line comment and I'll tell you how
indexing happens in Python so when I say
Joey so this is this is present at the
0th index of my list when i say chandler
it is present of the first index and
when I say Ross
it is present at this second index right
so this is how indexing happens it
always starts from zero and when you go
in the reverse direction it will start
from minus one this is how indexing
happens guys
now when I say slicing is to basically
slice my list for example if I only want
say Joey and Chandler I don't want Ross
right so what I can do I'll just type in
here print statement the name of my list
and inside the square braces
I'll tell the range so from 0th index I
want till second index but it won't
include the second index value that is
Ross so 0th index value first index
value but it won't in here the second
index value right so let us see if we
get Joey and Chandler here or not so up
you can see that we have only Joey and
Chandler we don't have the entire list
right so let me just remove this comment
and yeah now one important thing about
lists is that they are immutable
when I say mutable you can update a list
you can make changes to that list once
you have defined it right so let me show
you how you can do that say if I want
friends at the 0th index I don't want
joy right I want something else I want
say Monica right so yeah I'll just call
and I'll just again print this friend
list and we'll see instead of Joey
Monica has appeared there right now no
more Joey there right so yeah let me
remove this now I'm going to tell you
about the append operation so when I say
append basically what happens whatever
value that I'm going to append in my
list will be added at the last index
right so yeah let me just show you what
I'm talking about so this type here
friends dot append and the value say if
I want again Monica at the end of my
list I can do that as well just print
friends list again go ahead execute it
and yep you can see that morning I have
appended this value that means Monica
comes to the last index of my list right
similarly what I can do is I can also
make use of this
then function so what happens with the
extent function instead of a single
object I can append an entire sequence
so I can append one more list here so if
I just write here say Janice and I write
here say Monica and so yeah you you'll
notice that this particular list will be
present at the end at the last index of
this list right so let us see if that
happens or not and yep you can see
Janice and Monica it is present at the
end of my list
right so yeah this is how you update the
elements of a list and I have a separate
tutorial the name of that is Python
programming in which I have discussed
all the operations of less than details
so you can just go through that as well
now I'll tell you how to find out the
length of a list it's very easy calling
the length function that's all you have
to do Elian and just type in friends go
ahead execute it and will show me how
many elements are there in my list which
is three all right now let's talk about
concatenation so what I mean by
concatenation is basically adding two
sequences right in terms of I mean here
this is what congratulation means right
so I'm gonna create one more list I'm
going to concatenate that with my
friends list so I'm gonna create a
subject list here select my subjects
beef physics chemistry or a little bit
physics in chemistry only fine so I'm
going to make use of the plus operator
let me show you what I'm talking about
so I'll just type it here friends plus
subjects that's all I have to do and
yeah you can see yeah then you list here
right we have concatenated to lists all
right so this is about concatenation
guys and yeah now let me explain you
what is reputation so reputation
basically means repeating a list
multiple times so if I want my friends
list a bit of petered multiple times all
I have to do is make use of this
multiply operator and the number of
times I want to repeat it so if I want
to repeat it twice I'll just put in to
here and go ahead execute it and yep you
can see that I have repeated my list
twice similarly I can type in whatever
number I want I can type in here three
and make my list longer yeah so this is
how you
few operations with less although there
are some more other operations as well
so you could just go through my bison
programming video and yeah over there
I've explained all of these things in
detail and one more last thing guys one
last thing about laser I want to tell
you is how to reverse a list so as I've
told you that indexing in the reverse
direction starts from minus 1 so if I
have to reverse a list all I have to do
is name of my list colon colon minus 1
and when I do that
you can see that I have reversed my list
so instead of you know Joey Chandler and
Ross now I have Ross Chandler and Joey
alright so this is all about list guys
so next up we are going to focus on the
next data type that is tuples so let's
go ahead with that so a tuple is a
sequence of immutable Python objects and
I've told you earlier as well
immutable means that you cannot change
its value right I'm top of the basically
sequences just like lists the
differences in topples we enclose the
objects within the parentheses but
unless we enclose it within the square
brackets and apart from that tuples are
immutable
whereas lists are mutable alright so
yeah I mean you must be thinking or when
will I use tuple or when should I use
lists so imagine a scenario when you
have constant set of values and all you
are ever going to do is I trade through
it so at that time you will use tuples
because tuples are faster than lists
right so because you know you have only
constant set of values and you don't
need to update it you are only going to
I iterate through it right so that's
that's when you can use tapas so enough
of that I'm just going to quickly show
you a few operations with tuples
although whatever operations that I've
shown you with lists you can perform
that with tuple apart from updating a
topic right so let me just quickly print
this duffel Chelsea alright it has three
elements in it
hazard lampard and Terry well there are
my personal favorites so yeah you can
see that we have successfully printed
the topple now what I'm going to show
you is the operations that you can
perform with love topple like I can find
out the length of my topple right so
yeah let's go ahead and see the length
of my topple so it has three elements
rights it's it's pretty easy now what I
can show you is
I can perform slicing like I've done for
list
so from 0th index till I want second
index I only want has our lamp I don't
want Aryan remember guys and Python
always indexing starts from zero whether
it is a list whether it is a topple
whether it is a set whatever it is
always indexing will start from zero
right so let's go ahead and execute this
so yep only I have his out in Lampard I
don't have Teddy president my no topic
right so similarly I can reverse this
topple as well all I have to do : : -1
and Yap I have reversed my top Elizabeth
now I'm going to prove it to you that
you cannot have greater topple right so
let's use Chelsea say if I want instead
of hazard I want something else say if I
want here Mikkel right so now let us try
printing this topple and we'll see what
happens so yep you can see this
particular error topple object does not
support item assignment you cannot make
any change to our topple all right even
if I call in the append function there
won't be any change in my tuples so
append what value you want to append say
again Mikkel
go ahead print this topple and we'll see
what happens so yep topple object has no
attribute up in so basically you cannot
append you cannot update a topple once
you have declared it right so yeah and
all the operations apart from that are
pretty much similar to list so you can
just you know or try it yourself it's
it's it's very very easy and yeah so
this is all about tuples guys next up we
are going to discuss about strings
alright so what is a string string is
basically you know set of characters
right and how we create them we create
them simply by enclosing characters in
code single quotes double quotes doesn't
really matter here guys it's it's Python
you don't have to worry about those
complex in taxes as I've told you
earlier
simplicity is always better than
complexity and yeah so yeah it's my
personal favorite language and you don't
actually have to worry about any syntax
here so all you have to do is enclose
your set of characters in code single
quotes double quotes doesn't really
matter
so yeah over here I've already declared
a string and it is welcome to Ada Rekha
let us try printing the string and yep
welcome to Ada Rekha now there are a lot
of operations that you can perform with
strings as well but before that let me
tell you guys again in strings as well
you have indexing are you getting
strings also indexing starts from zero
right no we're indexing is starting from
one in Python so yeah I mean let's see
few operations that you can perform with
strings so I can find out the length of
my string I'll just need to type l le n
s and yeah just go ahead execute it so
we have 19 characters in my land my
string right so now what I can what I'm
going to show you is I'm going to show
you how you can find out the index value
of a particular character say if I want
to find out the index value of L right
so what I can do is just type in the
name of my string which is s dot index
calling this index function and the
character so if I want to find out for
ll put L or within quotes or single
quotes double quotes doesn't really
matter let's go ahead and execute this
so it is present at the second index
counter yourself 0 1 and L is 2 right so
this is the second index
similarly if you want to know how many
times our character is repeated in a
string so instead of this index you can
just type in here count and yeah if I
want to find out how many times E has
been repeated in my string I'll just put
either and yeah 4 times you can see the
string e is present in my string right
now again I'll tell you slicing so it's
again very very easy guys like we have
done for lists and tuples in strings
also it happens in the same way say if I
only want wel so I'll just type in here
0 colon
2 no Ashley 0 colon 3 because it's
present at the second index and yeah so
I have only wel here right so it's it's
that easy and
again I can reverse this particular
string as well because indexing starts
from minus one in the reverse order is
go ahead execute it and I have
successfully you know now reversed a
list
similarly I can convert my list to all
the letters in my list to uppercase as
well all I have to do is call in this
upper function and yeah it is done go
ahead and execute this similarly there
is one lower function as well so it will
convert the all the characters in my
string to lowercase values right now let
me tell you how you can perform
concatenation no so I'll declare one
more list let it be
Python is great right so all I have to
do is again use a plus operator and it's
done guys it's not easy yeah Python is
great it is actually great so yeah this
is about concatenation again I can
repeat to one string multiple times well
call in this multiplication func
operator and a number of times you wanna
repeat it so if I want to repeat it
twice is go ahead type in there too and
yup you can see that you have repeated
your string twice so this is about
strings let's move forward and we are
going to focus on next up excuse me guys
so now we are going to focus on sets
right so again sides are also very very
easy so let me just open it for you yeah
fine so what is said a set is nothing
but an unordered collection of items and
every element has to be unique in a set
right so when I say you need let me tell
you what I'm talking about don't worry
about the rest of the code that is
written let me just throw in a
multi-line comment and yeah so that you
guys are not confused about anything and
yeah I'm gonna create a set s is equal
to and when I create a set I need to
enclose my elements within curly braces
and separate them
damnit comma right so if I have say 1
comma 2 comma 3 and this is my set guys
and I just need to type in here Prentiss
and you can see that my set will appear
in yeah so here it is now I'll show you
one thing if I go ahead and repeat 3
twice we'll see what happens when I try
to print this so you can see that 3 has
appeared only once because set is again
I am repeating it is an unordered
collection of unique items every element
in a set has to be unique right
and for declaring a set you can even
call a built-in set function alright so
what I mean by that suppose if I make
this as a list right so this is now a
list because I have enclosed within the
square braces now if I want to convert
this to a set I need to call this set
function and within that set function
I'll just type in the name of the list
just go ahead execute this and yep you
can see that I've converted this list
into a set right so it's it's that easy
now let me remove this and we'll see
pretty cool operations that you can
perform with set the first operation
that we are going to discuss is known as
Union all right so when I say Union it
means for example if I have a and B both
are sets so all the elements from both
the sets that is basically what Union is
right so if I have 1 2 3 4 3 and in in
set a and I have 3 4 5 6 and said P when
I perform the Union operation so I'll
get output something like 1 2 3 4 5 6
but there won't be any values which will
be repeated because because again set is
an unordered collection of unique items
guys right and this is the symbol for
Union I have two sets a and B and I'm
going to perform the Union operation let
us see how our output looks like so it's
1 2 3 4 5 6 all right so it sits so as
I've told you what is Union it is
basically all the elements and yeah so
you can notice that apart from these
apart from this set there's nothing else
an a and B I mean there is nothing apart
from this right so yeah that's what I
I wanna wanted to tell you guys now next
up I'm going to tell you about
intersection right so let me just remove
this comment here from here and I'll put
it here alright so when I say
intersection of a and B it is nothing
but a set of elements that are common in
both the sets so see a has one two three
four B has three four five six so what
are the common elements here three and
four obviously right so I'm just gonna
use this operator this is basically for
intersection if I print this I'll get
only three and four yeah so this is what
basically intersection is now we are
going to discuss the next operation that
is called difference let me remove this
first yeah so when I say difference or
when I say a minus B that means it is a
set of alamin elements that are only in
a but not in B right so if you notice if
I write a minus B in the current set
that I have a and B so what are the
elements that are present only in a but
not in B obviously it is one one two and
three right only one two and three are
present in a but not in B as you can see
four and five is also president B so
when I say a minus B that means the
elements that are present in a but not
in B and when I write B minus a that
means elements at a president B but not
in a currently I'm doing a minus B so
one two and three or should appear in my
out at my output and yup it does so this
is about difference guys let me remove
this now and I'm gonna tell you about
symmetric difference now when I say
symmetric difference of a and B it is
nothing but a set of elements in both a
and B except those that are common all
right so all the elements in a and B but
or you can say all the uncommon elements
in a and B that is what basically
symmetric differences so if you notice
one two three and six seven eight are
the uncommon elements because four and
five is president both the set a and B
right so let's go ahead and perform
symmetric difference here and one two
three six seven eight because four and
five are common in both the
both the sets right so now we are going
to move forward with the last data type
that is dictionary so dictionary
what is dictionary basically it is
nothing but a sequence of key value
pairs alright so let me explain you this
with an example so I'm guessing you guys
know about on Harker right so for those
of you who don't know what it is it is
nothing but a unique ID which has been
given to all Indian citizens so for
every other number there is a name and
few other details attached now you can
consider the other number as a key and
the person's detail has a value attached
to that key and dictionaries are nothing
but the key value pairs enclosed within
curly braces and the key values and the
key value pairs are separated with comma
and when I say keys and values so they
are separated by : so over here you can
notice I have created dictionary how
about I create a new dictionary doesn't
really make any sense it doesn't make
any sense
so right now let the name of my
dictionary be employed right and I have
my first key as name and the value that
is attached to it is say surah right now
the next key value pair is gonna be age
the value that is attached to it will be
say my age let be 42 right so I have a
head-to key value pairs and this is my
dictionary and the name of my dictionary
is employees so I'm just gonna type in
here employee and let's go ahead and
print our dictionary and Yap you can see
that we have a dictionary here now when
I want a particular value that belongs
to a key I mean that is a patch to a key
so I can just use the key let me tell
you what I'm talking about so if I write
her print employee and in the square
braces if I type the name of the key
right and if I execute this so you'll
see that the name will appear here that
is sort of similarly if I type in here
say age so age will appear that is 42
right so this is dictionary guys and now
enough with the data type now is the
time to see various operators that are
there in Python so for that I'll open my
slides once
so operators are nothing but the
constructs which can manipulate the
values of the operand so right so when I
say operands consider the consider an
expression say two plus three is equals
to five so here 2 &amp;amp; 3 are operands and
the plus operator or the plus symbol
that we use is nothing but an operator
and Python supports so various operators
there are comparison identity logical
automatic assignment bitwise membership
so let us discuss each of these
operators one by one I'll start with
assignment operator and for that I loop
in map I charm let me just quickly open
the sorry I'll start with arithmetic
operator case I'm sorry right so
automatic operators so these operators
are used to perform mathematical
operations like addition subtraction
multiplication etc etc etc right so yeah
let's just understand this with the help
of the code that is there in front of
his screen so we have three variables a
B and C with values 21 10 and 0
respectively now what I'm going to do is
perform addition first so I'll have a
variable C which will be equal to the
addition of a and B a plus B and I'm
going to print this here Prince C right
similarly I'm going to perform
difference I'm going to calculate the
difference between a and B multiply a
and B divide and this is used to
calculate the remainder this is for
exponent and this is called fab division
which means that it will ignore the
remainder and will only give you the
quotient but when I say here this means
a raised to the power B right so 2 to
the power 3 and similarly a is 10 here
and B is 5 so yeah it's pretty basic
guys and just go ahead and run this so
addition after adding the two values I
got 31 subtracting I got 11 multiplying
I got to 100 when I divided both values
I got 2.1 what was the next operation
yeah when I calculate the remainder the
remainder value is 1 then I performed 2
to the power 3 which is nothing but 8
yeah and yeah and then I calculated the
quotient quotient or you can say fab
division and that turned out to be 2
nice this is all about the automatic
operators that are available in Python
next up we are going to discuss about
the comparison operators
all right so comparison operators
basically they compare the values and
either sides of them and then decide the
relationship amongst them so whether it
is greater than equal to less than equal
to greater than equal to that's all
stuff right so yeah I mean let me just
throw in a multi-line comment here so
that you guys won't be confused Yeah
right so what I'm going to do here is
I'm gonna make use of this comparison
operators and I'm gonna write in here
save a this is for less than less than P
right so if this is true I'll get the
output us true right but currently if
you see a is actually greater than 10
and this is saying a is less than B so
if I go ahead and execute this it is
false right and the moment I make it
greater than B and if I now execute it
it turned out to be true right now I'm
going to show you equal to operator so
is a is equal to equal to B I don't
think so let us see if it returns a
false value or not and yup it does what
if I make this as 21 now else let's see
if it come true turns out to be true
yep it is so what it is doing it is
deciding the relationship among them
whether it is equal to not equal to less
than equal to right if I just write in
here and less than equal to and I make
this say as 13 right so currently you
can see that a is actually not less than
equal to B so it will return a false
value right and the moment I reverse
this I type in here greater than equal
to that is absolutely correct right and
even if I make this as 2 ne1 it will
again be true because we have an equal
to operator as well greater than equal
to right similarly we have smaller than
equal to as well so this is how
comparison operators work guys
the below code that you're seeing here
is they over here I'm using the F and L
statements and after I'm calculating
whether a is greater than B or not so
I'll tell you about these conditional
statements who are later in the session
so you don't need to worry about it
currently just remember that in
comparison operators we have mainly
equal to not equal to less than equal to
and greater than equal to greater than
smaller than right so I didn't show you
the a less than equal to operators this
is how it looks like so currently a is
actually equal to B so this will return
as a false value and yup it does so at
the moment I make it as two and now if I
try to execute it it returns me a true
value because obviously a is not equal
to B that's why it is returning me a
true value right so this is how a
comparison operators work guys and yeah
so let's see what is the next operator
that we are going to see it is nothing
but assignment operator let me open in
the open or in PyCharm so when I say
assignment operator it is used to assign
a new value to a variable so let me
explain a with the code that is there in
front of your screen so here we have
three variables a B and C with values 21
10 and 0 respectively now what I'm going
to do is update the value of C in my in
the code itself right so how I'm going
to do is I have C here which is nothing
but a plus B the automatic operator plus
I've used write addition operator now
then what I'm writing here C plus equal
to a this means that C let me just throw
in a comment here this means that C is
equal to C plus a right so whatever the
value that comes after adding C and a
will be stored in C right similarly
similarly for when I say C multiplied
equal to a multiplied to a it means that
C is equal to C into a right so this is
how it works even same goes for division
as well and yeah more calculating the
power power value like C to the power a
similarly for division as well so we are
constantly updating the value of C right
so just let me quickly run this for you
and
you'll see over here so after adding a
and B I got 31 after that what I did I
updated the value of C so the C value
was earlier 31 when I added the 21 to it
it became 52 and again it was storing C
similarly you can see the other
operators as well so after that I
multiplication then division then
calculated the remainder after that I
calculated C to the power a then I
performed the fab division as well so
this is all about the assignment
operators guys so next up we are going
to see bitwise operators so let me just
quickly open that open that dot py5
right so bitwise operators these
operations directly manipulate the bits
so obviously in all computers numbers
are represented with bits a series of
zeros and ones and in fact pretty much
everything in a computer is represented
by bits right so whatever operation that
you'll see in the over here will be
performed bitwise so whatever number we
have will be converted to a binary value
and then bit by bit those operations
will be performed so namely we have
bitwise and bitwise or bitwise XOR a
left shift right shift right so these
are all the operators that we have here
and yeah so this is what basically it is
and let me just quickly show you that in
the pycharm as well so we have three
variables a B and C with values 58 13
and 0 respectively so over here you can
notice that I've converted these values
into a binary format right so in terms
of zeros and ones and I have thrown in a
comment here which gives you the binary
value right so the first operation that
you'll see is basically the bitwise and
operator so I am guessing that you guys
know about the truth table of and and
yeah let me just quickly tell you about
the truth table of and gate which means
that if I have one input i zero another
input also a zero then I'll my output is
zero then I have one input a 0 or 1
input is 1 then output is also 0 again
if I have say a one input as one another
input i0 there are also my output is 0
but the moment I have the two high
inputs my output also becomes high this
is about your bit or your EIN operators
right so when I perform the bitwise and
operation here you can see that I get 8
right so just just go ahead and do that
let me shift it here zero line to Z 0
and 1 0 1 and 0 0 0 and 1 0 again and
then 1 and 1 is definitely one right so
yeah it's it's pretty basic guys but
yeah whatever it is so this is how you
perform bitwise and
when I talk about bitwise or in bitwise
or your output is always high your
output is always high basically and your
output will be low only when both your
inputs are low so only when you have a
condition like 0 0 then only your output
will be 0 else it will always be high
right even if you have only one input
high then also your output will be high
but when I talk about binary eggs or
then you have both high inputs then your
output will be low
now this is basically telling you about
left shift so it will shift a to bits
towards the left it will shift a to bits
towards the right so yeah just try doing
this you just shift left 8 2 bits so
this is what you are going to end up
with right so just go ahead and do it
yourself so this is what you're going to
end up with same goes for right shift as
well so just shift the bits right
towards right and this will come here
and again so this is how it is going to
look the output will be 14 let us see if
that happens or not and yeah it's pretty
accurate guys 860 355 232 and 14 so yeah
I mean this is all about bitwise
operators next up we are going to
discuss the logical operators so
core that logical operators what peopIe
fine yeah pretty basic you just need to
have understanding of an gate or gate
eggs or gate so I'll just type in the
truth table for and or and not so be a
yeah so we have three logical operators
and or and not so when I talk about and
gate unit I have I have told you
although about it but yeah I'm just
going to type in here 0 0 0 0 1 is 0 1 0
is 0 1 1 is 1 for and gate right now I'm
going to write the truth table for or
gate so as I've told you earlier as well
in or gate our output is always high and
it will only be low when you are both
the inputs are low so when 0 0 are both
my inputs then my output will also be
low and when one input is low another
input is high then also my output is
high similarly if an input is high
another input is low I my output is
again high if both of my inputs are high
then also my output is high so this is
about your or gate and naught is nothing
but the complement so if you have 0 it
will become 1 if you have 1 it will
become 0 if you have a true value it'll
become a false value for a false value
and become a true value so yeah that's
all that's about the truth table so I'm
just going to quickly show you first of
all the and operation so print X and y I
need to either this is basically that
and operator so currently you can see
that both my inputs are true or both of
my inputs are high so it should return
me a true value and yep it does the
moment I make it as false and now if I
try to execute it it'll return me false
value right because yeah I mean 0 and 1
that sort of deal is here and yeah let's
let me just convert this to true again
and I'm going to use the or operator now
just go ahead and run this so yeah true
the moment I make this as false then
also it will return a true value yeah
and if I make both the inputs as force
then it will return me a false value
right now I'll show you the North
operation not of X so X is false it will
convert this to a true value yup it does
so yeah this is about the logical
operator next up I'm going to discuss
about the membership operator so
basically we have two membership
operators in and Norton these operators
are used to test whether a value or a
variable is found in a sequence and that
sequence can be less tuples head strings
dictionaries right so yeah I mean we
have a value eight we have very belief
that has value ten and we have a
sequence that is one two three and four
right so let me just remove this he's
gonna write it in so I'm if I use this
in operator it will return true if the
value or the variable is found in the
sequence right so yet it currently
should return me false because that this
particular value is not there in the
sequence so let us see if it returns a
false value or not and yup it does it
returns a false value right so the
moment I make it as one now you can see
that it is true because the value is
there in the sequence or the variable is
there in the sequence and yup it is it
returns me true right so let's talk
about a not an operator now so it's just
it's just the opposite of in in order
and not in what happens it will return
true if the value or variable is not
found in the sequence and it will return
false if it is found in the sequence
currently it will return false because
one is present in the sequence and yup
it does return false the moment I make
it as ten so it will return me a true
value because the variable is not
present in my sequence right so yeah
this is about the membership operators
basically it will test whether a
particular value or a variable is a
member of a sequence or not now let's
talk about the identity operator
all right so identity operators are used
to check if two values are located on
the same part of the memory or you can
say two variables that are equal it does
not imply that they are identical right
so let me just explain it with the cord
itself so we have two operators here two
types of identity operators is and is
not so is will return true if the
operands are identical and is not will
return true the operands are not
identical all right so yeah I mean let
me just remove all this and x2 is equal
to say then I'll make it as ten
all right so yeah I mean currently you
can see that both the variables are
identical right so it should return as a
true value and is not should return as a
false value and let us see if that
happens or not yep it happens right and
then you can see in the output as well
the moment I make this an identical you
can see that we have true and false so
this becomes true and this become force
so yeah it's it's pretty easy guys and
yeah I mean nothing no rocket science
says Python is very easy I get it again
I'm saying that now I'll open my slides
and we'll see what is next so we have
covered all the operators guys and I
have a separate tutorial again and again
I'm telling you Python programming just
go through it I've covered all the
basics there as well so now we are going
to discuss about conditional statement
so conditional statements are used to
execute a statement or a group of
statements when some condition is true
and there are namely three types of
conditional statements in Python if
elephant else so let me explain you that
with a flowchart that is there in front
of your screen so control will first
check the if condition if X is less than
Y and if this condition is true then it
will execute the statements present
inside this if condition if condition
right so whatever the if code is there
that will be executed that is statements
underscore B and if this is false it
will check the control will check the
Elif condition and as this Elif
condition is true it will execute the
statements underscore B or you can say
the Elif code and the moment is the
moment control found finds out that this
is also false it will by default execute
the else statements and yeah statements
underscore C so this is how conditional
statements work guys I'll quickly open
my pie charm and I'll show you there as
well
where is conditional statement C yeah
here dice very very very easy guys what
I have done I have two variables x and y
with values 14 and 13 respectively so my
F condition says that if X is less than
Y print X is less than Y el if X is
greater than Y print X is greater than Y
else and I don't need to specify any
condition here it will take the
condition I will take it will take it by
default so the condition here will be X
is e
equal to Y and if-else condition is true
then L x and y are equal so currently
you can see that X is actually greater
than Y so it should execute this Elif
code that is X is greater than Y and let
us see if that happens or not yup it
happens let me change the values of it
now it should execute the if statement
because X is less than Y so yup it does
and the moment I make it 13 we will see
that the Elif condition becomes true and
x and y are equal so this is about
conditional statements guys and yeah I
mean it's it's easy only 3 conditional
statements so we have F Elif and else
right so let's see what is there next we
are going to discuss about loops now so
let me tell you why vinnie loops and
then we'll see what exactly loops are so
in general what happens statements are
executed sequentially the first
statement and a function is executed
first followed by the second and so on
but what about a situation when you need
to execute a block of code several
number of times and so what do you do in
that situation so you use a loop so
basically a loop allows you to execute a
statement or a group of statement
multiple times so yeah and let me
explain you with the core with a diagram
that is in front of your screen so the
control will first check the condition
right first the control will check the
condition if it is true then the control
will move inside the loop and it is it
is going to execute the statements that
are present inside are you loop or you
can say the conditional code and after
executing that will again check the
condition if again the condition is true
it will again execute the conditional
chorus we keep on repeating until my
condition becomes false and the moment
my condition becomes false I the control
will come are the loops now there can be
two types of loops guys it can be
infinite or it can be finite so when I
say infinite that means the condition
will never become false and when I say
fine finite so at one point of time the
condition will become false and the
control will move out of the loop
although there is one more way to
categorize loops you can call that as
pretest and posttest so when I say
pretest in this type of loop the
condition is first checked and then only
the control moves inside the loop but
when I say up to a talk about post-test
loop here for the candy
statements inside the loops are executed
and then the condition is checked
although in python there is nothing like
post-test loop there are no post-test
loops right so there's no do-while loop
in Python so in Python only we have
pretest loops so let us see what kind of
let us see what are the different types
of loops that are available in Python so
namely there are vile four and nested
loops right so yeah let let me just open
my PI charm for you know we'll discuss
with basic while loop so let's start
with while loop so invite loop first the
condition is checked and if it is true
the control will move inside the loop
and execute the statements that are
present inside the loop until the
condition becomes false now the question
is when we will use while loop so we
will use this loop when we are not sure
of how many times we need to execute a
group of statements or you can say that
when we are unsure about the number of
iterations so I have a pretty good
example in front of a screen it's pretty
basic although I'll increase the
complexity of baton and and I'll tell
you another implementation of while loop
as well but this is very basic
introduction to while loop so I have
declared a variable count which is equal
to zero right and my while condition say
is that while count is less than nine :
don't forget the : guys is the syntax
very very important while count is less
than nine print the countess count so
print the current count and then
incremented by one right it will keep on
doing this until this condition becomes
false so the moment my count value
becomes equal to nine or greater than
nine it will come out of the loop and I
will print good bye all right so first 0
will come here 0 will be printed then
the value of 0 will be incremented by 1
it will be saved in the count again it
will check the count condition so 1 is
obviously less than 9 again it will move
inside the loop play the count increment
it by 1 again check the condition keep
on repeating until the condition becomes
false at the moment the condition
becomes false print good bye
let us run this and we'll see what
happens so yeah the count is 0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 and then finally we are printing
goodbye right so yeah let me just
quickly show you one more vile operator
here guys
when one more implementation of bylaw /
or while loop I'm sorry so here I'm
going to play a little guessing game and
yeah so I am importing a random for a
random module so this is basically used
to generate a random number between 1 to
20 and my n is 20 so this will there be
an andaman umber that will be generated
which is play of integer type right so I
have to guess this number so inside the
while loop I have written a condition
when the number that I have guessed is
not equal to the number that I have
guessed that the number generated by my
system then check the if condition if if
guess is greater than 0 or so basically
the moment you input a negative number
you're our the game
so if guess is greater than 0 it will
again check one more condition guess is
greater than 2 big s print number is too
large
LF print number is too small and the
moment you put in R you have entered a
number that is less than 0 it will print
sorry you're giving up break goodbye and
the moment you have guessed it correctly
that means this condition is false
congratulations you have made it so let
us quickly go ahead and run this and let
us see how good I am at this game so I
need to get a number between 0 to 20
years later
let it be 10 it is too small so that
means it is between 0 to 10 how about 7
number is too small all right I'm sorry
I'm very sorry since the number is too
small so definitely it'll be above 10 so
how about 13 it is again too small how
about 15 it is again too small about 16
it is also small how about 17 again 18
it is also too small 19 yep it forced 19
for God's sake
yeah I'm pretty bad at this game but
yeah this is how you do it it's very
very easy as a user to input a value of
that value is not equal to the number
generated by my system check all these
condition it has to be greater than 0
and the moment it is greater than 0 is
it greater than the number generated by
the system if it is then print number is
too large if it is less than then print
number too small at the moment you have
input a number that is less than 0 you
are the game buddy you you can't play
this game and input function is
basically to input a keyboard to give an
input through our keyboard right so last
and yeah I'm going to tell you about for
loop as well
oh yeah this is about for-loop guys let
me just quickly tell you about for loop
yeah so when I talk about for loop it is
basically it allows us to execute a
block of code multiple number of times
like the while loop at the differences
in for loop we know the amount of
vibrations required and like the while
loop and let me tell you over the
example you get a better idea here so I
have a fruits list here banana apple and
mango I'm going to type in here for
fruit in fruits I've given a range here
that is fruits that is basically my list
print the current fruit so it will print
banana apple and mango and the moment it
is done with that it'll print goodbye so
let's see if that happens or not and yup
it does current fluid banana apple mango
goodbye so guys this is about four and
why loop there's also a nested loop and
a lot of other concepts that that Python
comes with but unfortunately the time
does not allow me to take the session
any further before that I'll just
quickly tell you about the Python
certification training provided by Eddie
Rekha so you can just go ahead and
enroll here www.iberia.com I thought
over here all the concepts are covered
from scratch you don't require there's
no prerequisite for this course and
whatever is required is included in this

repeat the course if you want to take
the batch again you can just go ahead
and do that and batch timings are also
pretty flexible if you're not
comfortable with the bus or if you have
made a few mists some amount of classes
you can go ahead and enroll in the next
patches where so it all is pretty pre

is you get 24/7 support so at any point
in time you face any doubt just go ahead
dial the support number or raise the
ticket and they'll solve all of your
doubts now we also have a playlist on
Python on YouTube so you can just go
through this playlist and all things are
covered here python class loops

are there in python course Python
programming language interview questions
Python selenium
Sheen learning data analysis regular
expression numpy matplotlib so yeah all
of these things are there and all you
