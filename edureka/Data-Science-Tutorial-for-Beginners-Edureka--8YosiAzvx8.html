understanding data and building
necessary mathematical models in order
to kind of do some classifications or
predictions okay for example in
financial domain whenever a transaction
comes into your system you need to first
analyze it and say and classify whether
it's fraudulent or not fraudulent and if
it is fraudulent you want to flag it up
you want to flag it and contact the
customer and whatever you want to do
right so the classification of
fraudulent versus non fraudulent is a
machine learning problem and it's a
basis data science problem okay and
similarly I mean we have emails every
one of us have emails and there is also
notion of spam messages right so back in
the base those fan messages used to come
into our inbox whether it's some African
person Nigerian person trying to make
some transaction or some other things
there's so many spam messages that we've
seen right they used to come in our
inbox but as spam filters became more
and more mature we hardly see spam in
your inbox nowadays actually sometimes
even the useful messages will go into
inbox that's another extreme but the
point is this fan filters are
essentially doing machine learning which
is again like a data science right you
are analyzing all the emails from all
the people everywhere in that particular
company and you are classifying whether
a particular email is spam or not spam
okay that's a classification problem
which is again relevant to data science
so so given all this examples you can
kind of see what data science is right
essentially data science is about
understanding data and extracting
meaningful and
we'll date information from that raw
data sets okay
and even for data science you can kind
of come up with many examples so I take
Google for example we use it every day
and what is Google essentially you type
in a search query you know basic terms
you type in a search query and you get
relevant results back okay do you think
it is great science actually let's see
do you think it's data science whatever
we are doing on Google for searching
what do you think is the data science or
nah on data fence okay Kevin says yes
the dungeon says yes any knows everyone
says yes I'm not surprisingly right and
so if you think about it I mean back in
the base when we first started even
before Google they have a search engine
called AltaVista right I don't know if
you guys heard about it I'm sure some of
you about it
so when AltaVista was it which is
actually the first search engine in the
internet space what they did they simply
indexed each web page okay if I if I
have ten different web pages in my
system
I simply index the terms so the term
sales appear in my document one document
five and document ten and and sign and
the another term let's say
BJP appears in document five and
document seven okay there's simply mixed
and depending on the query they simply
looked at in which of the documents the
war occurred the query word and then
simply retrieved those documents okay
that was a search engine that they had
but then after that these two people
came around surgery Brin and Larry Page
they said okay search is not just that
actually there is something more to it
okay not just the content but also the
link information between the pages also
make sense okay that's their observation
about the data so the intuition is that
if many web pages are pointing to a
particular web page then probably that
the Pointer web page is probably
important and that's why they are all
referring to it okay so that means the
link structure is also kind of giving
you some relevant information in
deciding which page is kind of more
useful for a particular query than the
other okay and around this intuition
they built something called a space rank
and then they use that page ranking
mechanism to kind of rank different web
pages in the system okay
that's essentially data finds because
you're analyzing the data in order to
get a meaningful information of
different ranking and you're able to act
upon that meaningful information by
showing the results in a rank ordered
manner okay that's actually perfect
example of a data science even though
it's not called as data science back
then but it is exactly data science okay
so whatever Amazon did again in 90s when
they built amazon.com and built
recommendation engine that's also
exactly data science even though it's
not called as data science
so data science is not something new
that came up out of the blue it's just
there but people have given a sexy name
to it that's all okay so yeah that's
what I mean that's all part of data
science essentially you're trying to
extract meaningful and actionable
information from the data okay and
obviously as the big data is there in
terms of volume variety and velocity the
challenge is to create a big data
solution that can kind of facilitate
this data science okay if you have lots
of data obviously you need systems to
stole manage and analyze it
or if you have let's say Twitter then
build the data science challenges to how
do I do analysis in that very very fast
fast paced manner okay
and similarly if you have variety of the
data then your data science challenges
to how do I extract meaningful
information from these diverse formats
of the data and then make some
conclusions okay
I will be getting into our very shortly
but it's just not our basics it's to
just understand what our is and stuff
like that at a very high level so even
if you miss it's okay you can always go
through the video later on and in the
next class which is tomorrow's class we
are going to spend completely our time
on our okay so yeah if you have any
urgent matter to attend please go ahead
and we'll meet tomorrow okay
by the to have you okay and so if you
remember in the initial when the class
just started ie told no one knows what
exactly a data scientists supposed to do
right and this is exactly why I accept
that because data science has flavors of
multiple components okay
it has flavors of statistics it has
flavors of data engineering
it has flavors of visualization and
advanced computing and it also has
flavors of the domain expertise okay
so depending on where you fit the role
of a data scientist can be completely
different okay if you are a statistician
your role as a bit scientist may be
different from a person who has data
engineering background which is more
like the back-end processing okay just
to kind of give you more intuition on
that aspect so someone I think some CEO
of some web 2.0 company mention that
data scientist role is like the
webmaster role in the 90s okay when the
internet just started coming okay back
then when the Internet is just coming up
people are new to web services right
every company is trying to devise some
width or design some kind of a web
service that is useful for their
customers but they didn't have a clue as
to how to build such a web service okay
and that's where they created the role
of blood master okay our web
administrator and that web administrator
is supposed to solve all the problems
related to design Inglot services
whether it's a front end or whether it's
a back end or the communication between
the front end and the back end okay
web administrator is supposed to
understand all of that
so webmaster was the magic bullet for
solving all the problems related to
designing web services and over the time
obviously that's not the right way to
operate and over the time as people
understood more about the web services
there are different roles carved out
within the space right there are like
front-end engineers who design you guys
and there are like network engineers who
design the network backend for
communicating between the front end and
the back end and there is also like
database specialists so depending on
what back in they use there are specific
people who manage the packet okay
and similarly fast-forward 20 years or
15 years and now we suddenly have this
new role of data scientists okay and
just like the webmaster and nineties
data scientist is supposed to understand
everything about the data not just
understand deal with every challenge
that we discussed about the data okay
like he should understand it that's the
expectation of data scientist as a today
he's supposed to understand how the data
is stored in the backend
how do we manage it in the Hadoop
cluster and then how do we analyze using
machine learning statistics and
ultimately how do I visualize so that I
can present it to my top level
management okay so all these aspects are
expected to be understood by a data
scientist okay so he's like the jack of
all trades but over the time as the data
science field gets more and more mature
probably there will be different roles
carved out with
this particular day design speed okay
but but the point that I am trying to
make is data science is essentially a
confluence of many components and as of
today we don't have a clue what exactly
the role of gate scientists should be so
if you are trying to enter data
scientists today then I strongly
recommend you to kind of get some
knowledge from each of these components
okay if you are already working in let's
say data warehousing then you know about
a the engineering and some bit about
advanced computing then you will go
ahead and learn little bit more about
the statistics and machine learning and
maybe some visualization okay or if you
are working as a let's say bi person who
creates reports who visualizes reports
every day and a day in day out then you
want to get some knowledge about data
engineering which is a back-end
processing as well as some statistics
okay or if you are a machine learning
expert or a cool mathematical
statistician then you need to understand
or you need to learn about system is
aspects like data engineering and
advanced computing okay or if you are a
domain expertise which is like a
functional person then you need to
understand all these other components in
order to become a good data scientist
okay so that's why I said if you are if
you want to enter the field of data
science as of today then it's a good
idea to kind of get some exposure in
each of these components okay does that
make sense
exactly irenna says I believe it is
unrealistic unrealistic to have one
person called data scientist with all
the attributes that's absolutely true
but that's what you expect if you see
any data scientist role job posting you
will have lot of these things right you
are supposed to understand the Hadoop
platform Cassandra or whatever that is
of their interest which is related to
data engineering and advanced computing
and also they will say oh you need to
understand classification models or
recommendation engines and stuff like
that which is about statistics and
depending on the company they might also
ask you about visualization aspect as
well okay but I understand totally your
point is absolutely valid and probably
over the time we will figure out what
the individual roles are going to be
clearin and as you're saying so she says
that data sign so I can understand data
science team which has group of people
with different attributes to fulfill the
requirement I think absolutely
hopefully that's how it's going to be in
the future and if you look at like big
companies like Google and IBM or
Facebook all these companies actually
hire lot of Google hire economies Google
right hires social orders so these are
all like different people expertise in
different backgrounds and hopefully they
I mean I don't know inside Google but I
hope they are all working together to
solve the issues
so Aaron says how the data science
carrier would be for an a non data
science expert okay I don't know how to
answer that question so what do you mean
by how the career would be
so as I mentioned depending on which of
these components that you are currently
working in it's good idea to kind of get
exposure of the other components but
otherwise I don't really understand the
specific question maybe you can expand
on that question or if you want I can
unmute you and you can speak and then we
can discuss okay
so those are different components of
data science and this is just graph
showing the job trends about data
science that's fine so these are like
the types of data scientists that I was
talking about different depending on
which component your expertise in the
type of role that you may get may be
quite slightly different okay Shoshana
says for data visualization which tools
do you think one can get exposure to
there are multiple of them plate are
itself has lot of plotting and charting
capabilities and there are newer things
like tableau which can do better
visualizations and are exactly like our
own Asus tableau is used very popularly
in orders
okay Niranjan says predictive analysis
versus machine learning I think it is
overlapping where is the difference can
you please explain a very good question
has he said predictive analysis and
machine learning are overlapping and I
would even say there subset essentially
so predictive analysis is just a one
branch of machine learning technique
okay and there are other classes of
machine learning techniques around let's
say clustering and other things which
are which do not form predictive model
okay so predictive modeling or
predictive analysis is a subset of
machine learning techniques yes and rner
puts it in a another way which is
absolutely right is machine learning
helps to do predictive analytics
okay this is again different roles and
focus of those roles okay like if I am a
data researcher for example the focus of
my work would be primarily on doing
machine learning and Status States and
necessary math behind it whereas if I am
a business person if I'm a data business
person I'd be spending more time on the
business aspects of it which is probably
dealing with a lot of domain expertise
yeah we talked about all this it's
essentially all those components kind of
slap them under these three bullets
which are data architecture machine
learning and analytics okay and for data
architecture we will be dealing with
Hadoop in this particular class
primarily because Hadoop is now becoming
a de facto standard for big data
analysis because of its simplicity and
resilience and other features and for
machine learning we are going to deal
with a particular tool called mahute
within Hadoop ecosystem but I mean more
than tools for machine learning we will
be learning a lot of concepts okay so we
will learn lot of concepts which are
independent of the specific technology
that is in place okay with its ass well
it's our weather its mahute these
concepts are still valid and you can
apply it to your real world problems
okay so the lot of emphasis will be on
learning those concepts okay and for
analytics we are going to use R as a
primary tool
so we have looked at use cases so okay
yeah this one kind of tells you what is
the process flow of data scientists in
dealing with any particular problem
right so let's go over them quickly and
probably we can understand that flow in
a better manner okay so the first thing
that you would given a data set and
given a problem the first thing that you
would do is understanding the problem
statement and defining the solution
space okay what consists of that
solution like if it's a email
classification problem then your
solution is in building classification
model okay and that basically predicts
whether something is spam or not spam
okay if your problem is let's say doing
market segmentation then your solution
space is not a classification model but
instead a clustering technique that you
will develop in order to kind of divide
your customer base into different
segments okay and and depending on that
solution space you understand which
machine learning algorithm to be used in
that particular analysis okay and once
you decide on one algorithm or a bunch
of algorithms then you implement those
algorithms on a smaller dataset okay you
don't directly go to a big observe set
you may be working on a sample of the
data set or other smaller subsets we
will see later when we look at
individual techniques how those subsets
can be computer but the point is you
apply those algorithms on a smaller data
set maybe using tools like our MATLAB
SAS whatever that is
okay and
once you gain enough knowledge and once
you convince yourself that this model is
good enough to solve your problem in
hand then you go and apply your models
or implement your model on the big data
and when you're doing that you use tools
like Hadoop and mud okay order are in
Hadoop in conjunction and through this
you kind of explore different ways in
processing the data on that big data
sets and then finally you visualize your
results and maybe plots and charts for
your management you look at and so on
okay
exactly irenna that's true so she says
don't we want to understand the data
available before doing machine learning
absolutely true and that's actually I
would say put it in the first bullet of
understanding the problem statement also
say explore the dataset to understand
what the data is that's true so in other
words this in this particular slide is
slightly incomplete but still I still
shows the overall flow ok neurontin us
versus our when to choose constraint
Hadoop is used we'll get to that
question in Iranian just hold on to it
there bunch of use cases here
maybe we can skip some of them which is
essentially I mean it's talking about
the same data flow that we talked here
but instead of in this generic manner
it's talking with respect to a
particular problem okay so this is a
domain from this data set is obtained
and this is a problem statement and how
do you go about it okay what are the
different steps that are involved in
solving their problem and that's
essentially what this flow looks like
okay and similarly Market Basket use
it's like if you have a grocery store or
a retail company how do you analyze your
data in order to make better campaigning
strategies better product placements bed
better pricing strategy and stuff like
that okay and we talked a lot about
healthcare you can go through this
process flows it's pretty much similar
to what we just discussed at a high
level it's pretty similar to that but
focused at the specific problem that is
in hand
okay yeah we
we already said the core components that
we will deal with are primarily Hadoop R
and other machine learning concepts in
general okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
