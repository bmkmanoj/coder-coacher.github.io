class we have use of this color so it'll
be a little quick in explaining these
things okay we have started with this in
Linux primarily there are three types of
users ok so here if you observe this rwx
this is the owner who is the user here
and he belongs to a group called as
admin user okay
there is no help in admin so this is the
permissions these three there will be
three permissions for every user okay
that is read write execute in the same
order I mean the numerical notation
would be four to one read write exit in
the cube equal to one okay so the first
three is from the owner the next three
is for the group to which this
particular user belongs to in the next
three fields please for others other
than over blue whoever rest is in the
system last three pincer applicable for
that user
okay now here so the basic permissions
these are the three I will just show you
the numerical notation say you have
something here take common file alright
so if you want to change the permissions
of this particular file so we use CH mod
so why they pulled 777 okay each H
number 4 plus 2 plus 1 4 plus 2 plus 1 4
plus 2 this one space
finally ok so there we get our WX r WX r
WX all right
so similarly so this this is the easiest
way say if you want to change specific
using there is two different notations
one is the way using CH not another one
is chmod
save so the user
Loup poops all right so I learned little
user you - I will see X okay come on
Kylie I see what happened
so here X am taking X are the
permissions that the user has so RW -
similarly if I give if they want to give
it sale I want to remove it from nope no
Holly and I won't be able W ok I've got
three more so you can say if you want to
perform two operations
okay you can use the comma separator one
OH - how the mix okay so everything has
been reborn so these are two rotations
okay you can grant read write technical
permissions so similarly just like have
granted the permissions the normal user
should have granted to the folders has
been alright so this is about
permissions another important thing that
you should remember about permissions is
the you must value okay there is
something but you mask okay so that is
the default permissions that are set
then you create a file or a folder okay
see touch - except we create in the
files I work we aren't any permissions
so these files they got creative with
some default permissions okay so this is
what your you must value is okay so by
default every user will have to you must
value so say you mask to make it simple
okay
thirty three and four and then I clearly
directly the air one okay and let's - L
will take one example first C so this
can sell you have to calculate by
default the total function say if you
have granted all permissions to everyone
that means over all permission made
right execute for mister +17 like that
to the group to the owner seven seven
seven okay so by default seven seven
seven is the maximum value that we can
grant to everyone okay
so when we have set some you must value
you need to subtract them you must value
from the maximum value in order to get
the existing one okay let me repeat by
different triple seven is max that we
can give from this you need to subtract
the umask
then you will get whatever result and
you gets here it is 5 5 5 huh so ideally
it should be 5 5 and whatever you have
given from that you need to subtract
Lupul whatever the result comes so that
will be the default value that will be
set for the files as well as the
directories so here it is 4 for 4 let me
see what is assigned to the directory
so it seemed cellar so for delivery if
they observe rwx so here two is missing
here W two is missing he W two is
missing all right so so from the total
value we need to subtract them you masks
in order to get the values for the
default files and directories that we
create okay so if you want to change
so whatever manually using you mask
space numbers not given so that is the
temporary change if you want to make a
permanent change what you can do is
there is a file called under the home
directory yeah
so we have files called back home school
profile or - RC and this profile you can
simply define here you mask is equal to
whatever one you want so the next time
you log in as this particular user so
all the variables here you can see honey
a snitch everything is get sourced okay
and automatically the new value will get
picked up okay like the way we have
declared path value similarly we can
define that you mask value has a
variable here and automatically that
will be assigned to the newly created
files and directories okay so here we
have seen RW x RW x RW x okay now we
will see how to wait to use the some
groups and then we'll come back to this
for this topic then we will see rescue
ID as g ID set user ID these are two
bits that are set to the users groups
and then we see sticky bit okay
let's see how to create users and how to
create groups so I've been opening this
file
all right so this is the file if you
create a particular user okay so in the
password pipe so this is the file
related to the users so the moment we
create the user and entry gets created
and the password point see you know how
to create a user we go with use the read
command user right say Charlie okay so
the next moment an entry got created
here so here this is the first field is
the user second field X this is the
password field then we have the user ID
then we have a group ID see this group
doesn't exist the moment we create the
user the corresponding loop the same way
that is a private group for this
particular user okay so that will get
created automatically and then we have
that particular users home directory
this is the default shell that will be
allocated when this particular user logs
into the system
alright so we'll see a couple of options
here other than so with respect when you
clear the user okay there are two
important files which would get updated
one is TTC password another one is PC
that all right there is an end in shadow
so I'll come back I'll explain you the
entries in the shadow husband and there
is another file called in PC
okay this is the third play since a
primate loop got created with the same
name
there will be an infielder group as well
and there okay so all totally there are
four configuration finds till they say
password ptc shadow user related it is
he group TC g shadow is related to the
groups okay okay so i have just created
a user called a user named John and the
four important configuration friends are
actually that would get updated it is a
password it is he shadow it a single
pretty see G shadow all right now apart
from these whole configuration files by
default when you create a user using
user ID come on so under the home
directory with the name of that
particular user user over the name of
that user the folder would get created
okay and inside that folder you will get
to see all the default points okay every
time you create a user all this increase
will get created inside that particular
user from the root 3 in fact if you up
there right so the same set of files are
present inside a piece is Kelvin scale
so if you ask me when we create a user
so how does the spice get generated so
by default when a user gets cleared all
the default files that are part of a TC
scary they will get caught with to that
P users only
so that these are the list of steps that
would happen so the folder that will get
created content from scale value
properties of soul directory all right
and then all the full important
configuration files will get updated ok
so we're we already seen it asleep ah
that's good play okay here so the
password is not given we have the user
ID and we have the group ID home
directory and the function so funny user
right we have used use the word common
there are obviously there will be lot of
arguments using which you can change the
user ID that means that it will put
randomly generate I this if you observe
all the users here all right
in a typical Linux system user IDs or
group IDs in less than 500 I mean the
first 500 would be allocated to the
system users all right mostly above I on
whatever users that we create those user
IDs could be more than 500 but it is
possible to change them it is possible
to change the user IDs and group IDs way
and how there is a question from - work
and learning stated all who see the
password for any other usable system
know the route even the root user he
cannot see the password but the root
user or the in extent we can change the
password of other users will see that
husband so here password is not present
okay but password is stored in the
system and then encrypted form wait for
that you need to go to this place first
of all I have not set the password
producer John all right let me quickly
etc see now our road user right and I am
setting a password for genre
all Dawkins successfully updated okay
now you can see then click your password
now the question that you asked again
changing passwords on again operator
again the shadow pile you don't stir up
hatred okay so use it root user cannot
sphere but he can change the password of
the normal users okay and here let's see
the other parameters here if you observe
right the username and the password
and yet there are some other options we
will see what these options are so they
are related to the password aging policy
right so how long the user the password
from the active or when was the last
time the user has changed password like
that we have a comment we will see that
come on
okay for that on the side man if this is
shadow okay what I will do is I will
open to the panels so that I can finally
execute and show you if others can
access it
okay I mean you can already see that
there are no permanent lit completely
they're blank
that means no permissions has been given
to any user so by default it's like if
you if you found yes the first - will be
for its case it is pyro directly and
then you have one two three four owner
and then next three per group and the
next three parameters so even though the
owner is route here and no permissions
are set route by default can access any
file or folder it's only for the road
you use it even a permissions are not
that you can access the buttons okay so
now we have we are done with this
yes route can change the permissions has
been root user I mean is the
administrator I can perform any kind of
operations interest all right I will
what are those and quickly delete the
user now oops
so just like user creation process even
during user deletion all the four files
will be modified and so only one five so
there is no user here okay then we need
to check home data tree okay so the
folder independent are still present
okay so what we'll do is so further user
and John however any see this message is
the moon directly already exists
okay
this will get deleted lastin so not
copying any pipe from scaled electric so
it's clear that /ut c / scale is the
directory that contains all the default
files that will get copied to users home
directory so what you can try doing is
take a set up a network and by default
by the time you create a user you want
some default files to be present in that
users home directory so what you can try
them is keep some files inside a TC
scale and try create the users see if
they get copied automatically or not
maybe that's something you can and try
okay so now I've created the user again
since that folder is already present the
else are not copied now so if you want
to delete a user along with the home
directory so you need to use the open
adoption alright so that will delete all
the files as well okay so this is how we
know individually what we can do is as
the blue to use them you can change the
default shell that is assigned to the
users all right
you think I have not shown this before
so there is the command will see this be
cool
it's big - okay so what I want to do it
we want to okay then I'd show you this
coil it decisions this is the mixed
options but we need to cross check
whether these are present or not the
corresponding another bin - see a switch
- some these are present so there is a
command called CH a switch
all right then Ben - okay now I need to
fix it out of the system
I mean log off and then log in back then
automatically by default he'll be able
to use the bin - okay so this is how you
can switch shells if you if you want to
so the primary think that you would
observe but when you switch from bash to
other shells would be with respect to
the features like here whatever previous
comments that you can see those features
will be available and we have this
control our option where we can reverse
switch the commands that we have used
those options are not available like
that most of the command line features
another helpful for you there not be
available it specific to their
concessions so that's why most of the
time we stood to the bash shell now that
we have p8 read they use this okay so
you have been seeing me using su command
do not su is for switching from one user
to another user
so XQ admin user so there are only are
two important things miss you so one is
then you have switched to admin user
using the default su command what is the
working directory where you have landed
in all right it is slash truth
previously you were under slash boot
itself okay the second thing is I still
space - admin user okay now you are
under the home directory so it's up to
you if you want to move along let me use
in a piping else you stick to this
itself okay so this is a broad su now
there is another important feature that
is the pseudo pseudo feature so it is
mainly used in order to perform some
restricted in vain tasks in the system
alright so
to be used like in most of the next
administration tasks so rather than
directly logging into the system and the
root user what we do is either you grant
access to some specific users who are
part of the admin group
so what do you do it you create a group
and you add some users to the group and
for these users you give some restricted
human access all right then those users
can handle the admin job for you rather
than you know it is not it'll be coming
up to login and put on the road tasks as
a road user so the most important file
with respect to this is EPC soon lowers
here so if you observe here so there are
a lot of there will be by default only
one user that is completed here all
right so hello loop to perform all kinds
of operations okay and all the shells
anywhere in the system all right so this
is the only configuration available so
this is where we need to define either
the groups or the users can be granted
Suda accessible once you grant a pseudo
access in this type automatically the
user will get so that's it then
in order to perform an operation I'll
give you a quick example say I use it
complete
okay so have this I can tell it will not
work because he doesn't have sufficient
privileges okay that is the same will
get me out put it better unless the
truth use them so what I can do is so I
can I can grant permissions to this user
John so that he'll be able to perform
the similar operation all right so then
once the privileges are granted you need
to use sudo alright
so reconfirm he has to give as possible
okay so this is the process so every
time you use the sudo command
okay for not only this if you want to
perform some partitions or if you want
to configure some network all right so
all these features they can be
categorized and the corresponding
commands in the hundred access to so by
default when you use a pseudo resistor
will warn you because you're performing
admin tasks then you need to give the
passwords as John is not part of the
SilverStripe this come on will not get
executed so what I will do is will
quickly make changes to doors okay
sorry Forrester - actually we do not
edit this particular file directly which
is suniverse okay there is the command
called vs you do okay so you need to use
that command and when you open the file
you can get to see all the list of
categorized commands respect to play it
working okay so there is an earliest
name what you can do is you can slowly
revolve the hash so you have this
emelius you can simply I send this ES
wird to that user so let us go get the
day for way of you know we'll take a
simple example here it is okay and at
this point this is very important if
you're not suppose to directly modify a
TC slower spoil okay
okay so you have seen here once I have
added the user for the students list
okay this command has got executed all
right so like this you can create a user
in your system and grant pseudo access
so by default if you if you will
performing over the in situation - one -
user will have a default Steudle access
okay okay here what we can do is if we
more if we have to perform if you want
to give individual view on the grand
individual access rate say here we have
multiple things see for networking there
is already an ally as mcmutt created you
can simply unhatched you want the hash
and you can add this networking in the
last name instead of all you can add
that over there all right okay you take
this particular example okay so for all
system related ok services this is how
the patients are granted ok this is a
better example for you so similarly what
you can do is you can create some oil
pipe users okay so here ok so much more
here for the road user all permissions
have been granted ok he is able to
execute each and every publisher every
command in the system you can do
anything in the system right first its
for John I showed you how to initially I
have used the sudo command in order to
execute from this - le but he was unable
to execute that before it did return an
error that this particular user is not
in this lowliest ok
so after that what I did was have simply
added him and I have granted him all
permissions here okay see here that is
the group called users okay so here it
is clear that allows members of the
users group to mount and unmount the
cd-rom as the root user right so
personalized users this is the group
so all the mothers of this group will be
able to execute these commands okay
similarly so it is the blue pink
variation here okay similarly there is
another group called sis okay so all
members of this system will be able to
run all the commands that are present it
is a part of these earlier screams
alright so you can quickly start
creating normal user okay and then you
can see the syntax is the same or even
if it is a blue or the particular use
them okay and then we can see low or no
password means you can give this okay
okay you are referring to the one where
the solar who should be asked for a
password right okay but by default all
the cases are it is mandatory so no
password is usually given if you observe
here red there is a no login shell and
responder you there is no password
option which will be given per system
processes but users usually I mean you
can if you are setting up your network
maybe you can little configure it yes in
this option will help you enable that
feature do it so like that you can
create multiple alias names you can
create groups add users to the group and
add the group here okay and then you can
test out all the individual unless s if
the users are able to execute those
specific set of commands or not
okay let's see okay so it's a lot of
options which you can see the PID is C
if you want to see this playlist
anything here okay so if you want to
space today something from comments
about the user so you can do that using
the - C argument I'm okay
the next thing is regarding the groups
okay
so by default this group it's created
there is an option called how you can
hear John so what we can do is we can
Google can bypass the user from creating
a default loop say here the user ID is
five zero five but he's this is not part
of the group ID which is five zero five
okay so there is a default group in your
system that is users we have seen the
same ID in the ATC so I mean in the
pseudo or spy there is a person there's
users group right so by default if you
don't want a user to be part of his
private group what you can do is you can
simply use you can add an option then
automatically will be part of the
default users looping system okay
similarly will what I will do is we will
just quickly I mean it's about adding
users and then adding the groups so the
basic commands there is something to you
know it's called leap about many of the
public file I will go through and show
that but now I just take you through the
BPD's yeah so here so as you have asked
me can we change the user ID can we
change the group ID similarly can I have
leave a different home directory other
than the one that gets generated under
slash from okay so for that there is an
argument like that you can even change
the default shell that you want at the
time of creating the user or even after
creating the user so we have seen CH SH
right right see this that mean use it
okay so what is it using CHS it and I
change the default shell right so
similarly so at the time of reading the
user you can change you can change the
approach
you can change the home directory and
you can change the user ID group ID
similarly after creating the user also
you can change these values okay so user
ID is the command if you'll use if you
want to make any changes you add
additional arguments at the time of
creating the user and user mod is the
command which we can use to modify the
existing entries of a particular user
okay so those are entries would include
all the values that we have seen so far
so type in the abdomen will change the
whole directory
similarly you can change the user ID all
right so if you have observed here as
I've said before okay so top 100 500
user or group IDs our result for system
users and groups okay so most of the
users that you create all of the users
that you create belong user ID of do PI
D greater than 500 okay
similarly user del yeah I've seen this
option so if you used it by default it
will only they d8 the user and we'll get
the user from all the deleting a user
means deleting the entry of that use it
from the computation prints okay let the
whole directory would remain so you need
to use hyphen R option in order to
remove the directory as well
okay so user Delphi can R then we have
something called type and F even if the
user is logged in you can remove the
user
next just like the set of comment you
can correlate them to group creation and
group modification as well alright just
like we have two files
it is a password and shadow similarly we
have let Izzy group and we'll see that
okay we have seen a TC group right so
this contains the group the correct
password is not given so yes it is
possible to set up password for loop as
well alright and so this is the group ID
and these are the groups to which this
particular user belongs to all right
once again this is the user okay so this
user yeah as possible is not displayed
and then you have your user ID sorry the
group ID and then the other groups that
use it belongs to so it is like every
user will be part of one primary group
and they can be part of multiple second
recruits okay he'll be can be part of
one primary multiple secondary groups so
what we can do is we can create a and
the time of creating a user you can say
- gee I will make him as a part of the
root and the secondary I will put him in
that main user okay so I have just
created a user and he is part of his
primary group is Ruth and his secondary
group is okay let's see I think he has
been added to the default users maybe my
maybe I did something I should stick
with my syntax okay so alright so so
that's fine
so you can you can simply go through
other options which are here so we can
so that we can so all those arguments
are helpful in hiding the users
similarly like least important
configuration page we have the
corresponding configuration files with
respective groups has been so we have
seen the group file then there is a file
called G shadow that that contains the
encrypted group password if you have
stuck to the roots all right
so see innately put in an organization
you can help multiple administrators
okay so if you want to restrict a
particular group from restrict others
other admin users okay so from modifying
the contents of that particular group
then what you do is you can restrict
password it's like now we are simply
talking about users and basic rules but
the modernization level they are much
more complicated you'll have multiple
new users and multiple groups based an
organization based on they get a lot of
different categories computer so there
is a feature available and we can really
make use of that feature right okay so
here yeah you can see a group has been
added with a group ID or by default you
can simply go and see
given 5-0 pipe if you observe
see so 5:05 is as a user ID that has
been already allocated too heavy but at
the time of creating this user I said
low for creating the default group so it
has the same fund rate so the next
available group ID is PI 0 5 so it will
follow that particular order I say the
next available group ID to manually
create your group so here
and with
oops sorry
this is the user so I create a little
cold tea so what about group idea month
that has been allocated so that is all
yeah we can change no IDs correspondent
Amin we can change the group IDs and
that's pretty much similar you can see
if you can add users the groups we have
seen how to add loops to use your sleep
or using group mod or group art in terms
of creation as well as act of creation
similarly you can use this tips and he
pass WT command in order to add users to
the group's
okay
