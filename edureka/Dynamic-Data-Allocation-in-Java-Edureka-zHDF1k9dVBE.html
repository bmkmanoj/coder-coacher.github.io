hash map in Java so the hash map is a
class which is used to perform
operations such as inserting deleting
and locating elements in a map you have
to create a map in which you pass two
kinds of values one will be the key and
the other will be value okay using key
and value pairs you'll be putting those
values in the hash path and whenever you
have to retrieve a value you'll be using
the key so that you can use the value
right so the map is an interface map
keys to the elements maths are unsorted
an unordered map allows one null key and
multiple null values okay as I told you
that three values are stored in a format
that is key and value now the key could
be one key could be null in the entire
hash map and there could be multiple
values that could be null in the entire
hash marks okay so remember this key act
as indices and can be any objects as
well okay so this was the overview of an
hash map moving on there are several
methods available with hash maps as well
so you have got put my third object key
and value simple method enumeration keys
it will face the keys enumeration
element fetch the elements object get of
you pass the key and you'll get the
object and with that key the value that
is associated with that particular key
contains earth key if you want to check
whether this is present in this hash map
or not you'll be using the contents key
moving on contains value you'll have to
pass the key and yeah if you want to
check you'll be using this method object
remove you pass the key and you can
remove the object if you want to sighs
you'll be using the size method and if
you want to convert it into string
you'll be using two strings okay so
these are several methods that are
present that you can use along with a
hash map the diagram right here this is
the way the hash map gets created these
are the elements ideas right you can
place the key and there could be a
corresponding element
right like this that is Ravi Rajeev
Megha Sonny these values can also be
empty these could be null multiple
values per ton all in the hash bar
now let's see how to use it a shop says
yes same as associative array Nikhil
says Frank says yes
now create a hash map you use the hash
map keyword hash mark us to new hash map
putting elements hash map Burt you pass
the key and you pass the value pass the
key you pass the value like this you are
putting the values inserting the values
into the hash map now how to display the
values you get an eye traitor I trade R
equal to R theta equals to hash map
entry set dot i traitor this is the
difference then I will s because the
values are actually present in a set
right so for that you'll be using entry
set dot I traitor okay you get the entry
set and then you run the isolators
you'll get all the sets into the I theta
after that while I traitor has got next
you write math on entry entry data entry
mapped on entry I traitor dot next that
entire set will come here then using the
entry you can get the key separately and
using the entry you can get the value
separately and you can use it in your
program first ArrayList class is a
concrete implementation of the list
interface ashraf says dynamic size
allocation exactly correct from the
purse a sequence of data promises
elements the word is dynamic dynamic
size allocation that is not present in
array if you are if you do not require
the dynamic size allocation there is no
need for dynamic allocation then it has
always said that instead of using RLS
you should always use an array okay
girliness RLS class is a concrete
implementation of the list interface
allows duplicate values within it okay a
list can grow our string dynamically
that is the main advantage that is the
significance of an ArrayList nowadays it
can grow and shrink dynamically on the
other hand array specs once it is
created that was Digby married
of an array now if your application does
not require insertion or deletion of
elements the most efficient order
structure is array as I said before so
this is a small diagram that depicts an
RLS so you got ArrayList that is present
in you to Java size 5 the size of the
ArrayList is 5 right now because 5
elements have been inserted like Raja
Ravi dodgy maker Sonny and author okay
so it will come like this index always
starts from 0 that is 0 1 2 3 4 like
this ok now has anyone of you seen the
source code for an ArrayList the actual
implementation of an ArrayList please
write down on the chat window and on
this node I lost also ask your question
regarding ArrayList Emma chase no what
about the rest of you so I says no yogi
says no Astro says yes pronounced 80s
man says yes yes and no ok ashraf and
pro now can you tell me where i can find
in my system the code for an ArrayList
can you tell me
can you start in this from instead of
zero no Kansai high it is done Emily
given that and it will be starting from
zero itself Ashraf says Java dot util
ArrayList package okay you are quite
specific but I would like to show you
maybe I have forgotten but still let's
try go to C Drive in your systems as
well go to users
sorry not users go to program files in
that go to Java folder the job folder go
to JDK now in the jdk half you can find
this RAR file that is SRC file that is
source ok just open it up in that you'll
find Java you'll find util and within
that you can find ArrayList right you
can find out a list of Java so this is
the code so everyone can you now find
where is the code for a realist when you
open our top you'll find it like this so
just try to paste it somewhere do
something and try to find out how it is
actually implemented ok so everyone is
that clear do you this was just some
extra curves I wanted to give it to you
so that you can find out you can tell
someone that yes I know where is the
source code present on my system for an
ArrayList
similarly you've got the source code for
each and everything present on to your
system in your JDK ok moving on there
are several methods that are present
with an ArrayList that is like boolean
odd he passed the objects you can add an
object using the odd function void are
you pass the index and you pass the
element that has to be added boolean add
all you can pass the entire collection
you cannot the entire ArrayList like
that within this object not get you past
the index and you can get the object of
your LS set you pass the index you pass
the object and it will set the value now
object remove int index you just have to
pass the index you can remove the value
or the object on the element I traitor
okay I traitor
used fetching technique pronounces
exactly for fetching technique sciences
maybe Luke yes it Axl has a loop so that
you can retrieve the elements of an
array list using I traitor
let's try traitor index off index of
gives the index of a mine says repeater
now index of gives the index of a
particular element last index off you
can use all those functions and try and
see what are the reserves that you are
receiving right size gives the size of
the array less care care CRLs okay so
first we'll understand what is an array
list and we'll see how to trace the
elements of array list so I come here in
an ArrayList okay I've already used in I
theater right here so I declared an
array list of a string tied so RLS
string address new ArrayList I pass the
string so this is the object of an
ArrayList that I created after that I
use the add function to add the values
so dot add rows not at Lille towards s
mean and finally the rows okay so what
you can understand duplicate values have
been posted into the ArrayList as well
as using the index to I am removing a
particular element so if I pass - can
you tell me if it's element will get
removed now I make an object of an eye
crater which is using the which is
telling that a string type will be there
in the error less so you write I data
equal to rlist dot i traitor okay you
task the eye traitor with your list now
using the I theta you can access the
element by using a function that is
passed next so in while I theta dot has
nest till the time it is not false okay
it will go inside string element ID
reader dot next to string okay you can
convert the value to string and save it
in the element and finally print the
element so when I run this code I
receive the answer Rose Lily Rose
because I actually deleted the value
that was present on the second index
now if I write system dot out dot
println and I mentioned that is a
realist ok RLS dot index off and within
that I pass rows but can you tell me
what will be the result that I would
receive on the console window I run this
code and I receive okay since I am
printing in while loop it is getting
printed again and again ok run this code
again so Rose Lily Rose and I receive
zero in the end okay because slices are
an exception no it won't give you an
exception it will read the first element
at got the index and it will get back ok
it won't go for the second element out
right now if I what I do I come here
oralist not get index now if I pass to
itself
now tell me what will be the result that
I would receive a chef says rose so I'll
press control and f11 I receive Rose
once again that's good
so you similarly you can use different
functions that are available with an
ArrayList and you can try it okay can
experiment with it getting back to the
presentation now how to trace the
elements of ArrayList you can use for
each loop you can use I theta you can
use lists I traitor you can use
enumeration and of course you can use
for loop simple for loop while loop 2
while loop okay so we'll be seeing each
one of them first of all before each
loop its action similar to follow it
races through all the elements of array
or ArrayList ok no need to mention the
size of the ArrayList just you have to
write for bracket string s and you
passed the ArrayList underscore name now
what is the significance of this line no
need to mention size of an ArrayList do
you have to mention the size of gr LS in
some other loop ok the actual
significance is that in for each loop
you do not have to mention the size but
if you are using a simple for loop you
have to give the size of ArrayList as
well so you'll be using the ArrayList
that has a realist underscore name dot
size function so that you can get the
size until that time you can iterate the
loop ok but in case of for each loop you
do not have to do that you just have to
pass the structure like the RLS right
here and since you know this ArrayList
is storing the string element so you
create an object string you create an
variable of a string Val and data type
okay so type of tada stored in a realist
and finally the name of ArrayList this
is how you'll be using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
