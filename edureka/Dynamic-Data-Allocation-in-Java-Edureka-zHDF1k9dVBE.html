hash map in Java so the hash map is a
class which is used to perform
operations such as inserting deleting
and locating elements in a map you have
to create a map in which you pass two
kinds of values one will be the key and
the other will p value okay using key
and value pairs you'll be putting those
values in the hash map and whenever you
have to relieve a value you will be
using the key so that you can use the
value right so the map is an interface
map keys to the elements maps are
unsorted and unordered map allows one
null key and multiple null values okay
as I told you that the values are stored
in a format that is key and value now
the key could be one key could be null
in the entire hash map and they could be
multiple values that could be null in
the entire hash marks okay so remember
this he act as indices and can be any
objects as well okay so this was the
overview of an hashmap moving on there
are several methods available with hash
maps as well so you have got put method
object key and value simple method
enumeration keys it will face the keys
enumeration elements fetch the elements
object get of you pass the key and
you'll get the object and with that key
the value that is associated with that
particular key contains a key if you
want to check whether this is present in
this hash map or not you'll be using the
contents key moving on contains value
you will have to pass the key and yeah
if you want to check you'll be using
this method object remove you pass the
key and you can remove the object if you
want to sighs you will be using the size
method and if you want to convert it
into string you'll be using to strength
okay so these are several methods that
are present that you can use along with
the hashmap the diagram right here this
is the way the hashmap gets created
these are the elements ideas right you
can place the key and there could be a
corresponding element
right like this that is Ravi rachi mega
Sonny these values can also be empty
these could be null multiple values
cottonelle in the hash bar now let's see
how to use it a shop says yes same as
associative array nickel says banks is
yes now create a hashmap you use the
hash map keyword hashmap because two new
hashmap putting elements hashmap put you
pass the key and you pass the value
passed the key you pass the value like
this you are putting the values
inserting the values into the hash map
now how to display the values you get an
isolator I trade or equal to 0 theta
equals to hash map entry set thought I
traitor this is the difference then I
released because the values are actually
present in a set right so for that you
will be using entry said dot I traitor
ok you get the entry set and then you
run the Isolators you'll get all the
sets into the I theta after that while I
traitor has got next you write mapped on
entry entry get an entry mapped on entry
I traitor dot next that entire set will
come here then using the entry you can
get the key separately and using the
entry you can get the value separately
and you can use it in your program first
earliest class is a concrete
implementation of the list interface
usher says dynamic size allocation
exactly correct from the purse a
sequence of data pronoun says elements
the word is dynamic dynamic size a
location that is not present in array if
you are if you do not require the
dynamic size allocation there is no need
for dynamic allocation then it is always
said that instead of using our a list
you should always use an array ok girlie
list RLS class is a concrete
implementation of the list interface
allows duplicate values within it ok a
list can grow our string dynamically
that is the main advantage that is the
significance of an ArrayList that is it
can grow and shrink dynamically on the
other hand array specs once it is
created that was to be married
of an array now if your application does
not require insertion or deletion of
elements the most efficient data
structure is array as i said before so
this is a small diagram that depicts an
ArrayList so you got arraylist that is
present in new to java size 5 the size
of the array list is five right now
because five elements have been inserted
like Raja Ravi gaji maker sunny and
author okay so it will come like this
index always starts from zero that is 0
1 2 3 4 like this okay now has anyone of
you seen the source code for an
ArrayList the actual implementation of
an ArrayList please write down on the
chat window and on this note I lost also
ask your question regarding a realist
Emma chase know what about the rest of
you so I says no yogi says no estas says
yes pronounced AJ's mine says yes yes
and no okay ashraf and pro now can you
tell me where I can find in my system
the code for an ArrayList can you tell
me
can you start in this from instead of 0
no contaba it is Dunham key given that
and it will be starting from 0 itself
ostrov says java.util.arraylist package
okay you are quite specific but I would
like to show you maybe I have forgotten
but still let's try go to see dr in your
systems as well go to users sorry not
users go to program files in that go to
Java folder the job folder go to jdk now
in the jdk half you can find this RAR
file that is SRC file that is source ok
just open it up in that you'll find java
you'll find util and within that you can
find arraylist right you can find out a
list or java so this is the code so
everyone can you now find where is the
code for a realist when you open our top
you'll find it like this so just try to
paste it somewhere do something and try
to find out how it is actually
implemented ok so everyone is that clear
to you this was just some extra cause I
wanted to give it to you so that you can
find out you can tell someone that yes I
know where is the source code present on
my system for an ArrayList similarly you
have got the source code for each and
everything present on to your system in
your JDK ok moving on there are several
methods that are present with an
ArrayList that is like boolean odd he
passed the object you can add an object
using the odd function void are you pass
the index and you pass the element that
has to be added boolean add all you can
pass the entire collection you cannot
entire array less like that within this
object not get you past the index and
you can get the object of your LS set
you pass the index you pass the object
and it will set the value now object
remove int index you just have to pass
the index you can remove the value or
the object on the element I traitor ok I
is used fetching technique for now says
exactly for fetching technique sciences
maybe Luke yes attack still has a loop
so that you can retrieve the elements of
an array list using I traitor let's try
traitor index off index of caves the
index of a mine says repeater now index
of gives the index of a particular
element last index off you can use all
those functions and try and see what are
the deserves that you are receiving
right size gives the size of the array
less clear chaos theory less okay so
first we'll understand what is an
ArrayList then we will see how to trace
the elements of arraylist so I come here
in an ArrayList okay I've already used
in I theater right here so I declared an
array list of a string tied so arraylist
string is new arraylist i pass the
string so this is the object of an
ArrayList that i created after that i
use the add function to add the values
so dot otros not at Lily towards a spin
and finally rue the rose again so what
you can understand duplicate values have
been posted into the ArrayList as well
as using the index to I am removing a
particular element so if I pass to can
you tell me if its element will get
removed now I make an object of an I
crater which is using the which is
telling that a string type will be there
in the air lso you right I zeta equal to
arraylist dot I traitor ok you task the
isolator with your list now using the I
theta you can access the element by
using a function that is fast next so in
while I theta dot has nest till the time
it is not false ok it will go inside
string element I traitor dot next to
string ok you can convert the value to
string and save it in the element and
finally print the element so when I run
this code I receive dancer Rose Lily
Rose because I actually deleted the
value that was present on the second
index
now if i write system dot out dot
println and i mentioned that is a
realist okay RLS thought index off and
within that high pass rose but can you
tell me what will be the result that i
would receive on the console window I
run this court and i receive okay since
i'm printing envelope it is getting
printed again and again okay around this
code again so Rose lily rose and i
receive 0 in DN ok because sizes are an
exception no it won't give you an
exception it will greet the first
element at got the index and it will get
back okay it won't go for the second
element town right now if I what I do I
come here or a list dot get index now if
i pass to itself
now tell me what will be the result that
I would see I stuff says rose so I'll
press ctrl f11 i received rose once
again that's good so you similarly you
can use different functions that are
available with an arraylist and you can
try it okay can experiment with it
getting back to the presentation now how
to trace the elements of arraylist you
can use for each loop you can use I
traitor you can you use list I traitor
you can use enumeration and of course
you can use for loop simple for loop
while loop do while you okay so we'll be
seeing each one of them first of all
before each loop it's action similar to
for loop it races through all the
elements of array or arraylist okay no
need to mention the size of the array
list just you have to write for bracket
string s and you pass the ArrayList
underscore name now what is the
significance of this line no need to
mention size of an ArrayList you have to
mention the size of here LS in some
other loop okay the actual significance
is that in for each loop you do not have
to mention this size but if you are
using a simple for loop you have to give
the size of array list as well so you
will be using the array list that is a
realist underscore name dot size
function so that you can get the size
until that time you can I trait the loop
okay but in case of for each loop you do
not have to do that you just have to
pass the structure like the ArrayList
right here and since you know this array
list is storing the string elements so
you create an object strength you create
an variable of a string back and data
type okay so type of tourists or dinner
a list and finally the name of arraylist
this is how you will be using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
