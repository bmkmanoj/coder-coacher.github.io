today's session is going to be on sash
tutorial so without wasting any more
time let's move on to the agenda to
understand what all be covered in
today's session so we start today's
session by first discussing why do we
need data analytics so once you're done
with that we'll see what data analytics
actually is and you'll be discussing the
different tools which can be used to
form the Dianetics after that we see
vice SAS is preferred over all the other
tools then we'll discuss what SAS
actually is after that we'll be seeing
what SAS solves actually in the real
world and then move on to the discussion
where and we'll be seeing what are the
different components of SAS and then
moving on to the topic of interest which
is basis we'll see how we can practice
base SAS on our own
towards the end we'll be doing a short
demo wherein will be getting acquainted
with the SAS environment and then we'll
be solving simple queries and hence
ending the session so that is this is
our agenda for today how we clear it all
right I'm getting confirmation so Juden
is clear so is solid v Bakke is clear as
well Abhilash is clear as well okay guys
since most of you are clear let's move
on to the first topic of today's
discussion that is why data analytics so
why do we need data analytics as
question so data analytics is used
because of these four things so first of
all if you are a product based company
you can come up with next generation
products right so data analytics is all
about it are you are studying data right
so if you have a product which has been
successful in the past but if you see
the other companies whose products have
been successful you can actually study
them and derive the characteristics
which made those products successful
right now based on those characteristics
are combining those characteristics with
the new features that you're trying to
implement in your product right you can
come up with the next generation product
which will be successful and at the same
time it will be more advanced right now
these features that you will be deciding
can also be decided based on the data
that you are studying
so say some there was some product which
was launched last last year there was a
mobile phone right and on the basis of
the user feedback you get to know okay
so in terms of usability it is better to
have the fingerprint sensor on the front
rather than the back right so you take
that feedback implemented in your own
product and come up with the product
which is not only usable but has more
features and hence it becomes a
next-generation product having said that
let's move on to the second property
which is cost reduction right so you can
actually study the way you have been
spending on your project and right and
then you can actually come up with a
plan wherein you can see okay I have
bent wrong here by investing more money
in this thing or I spent more money on
this thing and I didn't get any results
right so it's better not to invest money
over there you can do all these kind of
analysis and hence reduce costs on your
project right always you can also study
products from different companies or of
other companies who have actually
released that product at a lesser price
so you can see what made them minimize
the cost in their production right you
can implement that in your own
production line and hence reduce costs
of your projects then you have a better
decision making process so data
analytics basically provides you with
facts it provides you with the path to
whatever you are trying to achieve right
and when you have a path and you have
facts presented in front of you
mathematical facts mathematical proven
facts right so your decision making
actually becomes easier because you
obviously want yourself to be succeeding
right so if you want yourself to be
succeeding and you see obeyed okay so
this is the way that data analytics or
this is the way that trends have shown
me so let me go this way so your
decision-making actually becomes easier
right and hence data analytics plays a
big role here and towards the end it
actually improves the service of
products at a company source right when
you are producing the next generation
products you are offering your product
at a lower price and you are also doing
the right thing by
a following a particular part which the
trends are shown
it obviously improves your service or
product because it is more efficient now
it is more relatable to your customer
because you have studied the customer
feedback right so it is more relatable
to your customer and your customer is
more happy with your product so it
greatly improves the service and product
having said that this is why data
analytics is actually important right so
we have discussed why do we need
atlantic's and let's now move on to the
part where we discussed what data
analytics actually is so data analytics
refers to the qualitative and
quantitative techniques so qualitative
basically means that you are obviously
increasing the quality of your product
using trends using techniques and
quantitative means you're employing
formulas employing statistics such to
come up with figures which actually
gives an insight on your product right
so you employ these quantitative and
qualitative techniques or processes and
which are then used to enhance the
productivity and the business game right
so obviously if you improve the quality
of your product and in terms of quantity
if you say you increase the bandwidth of
the products say you are making 300
products previously annual now with
improved efficiency you can now make 600
products right so you are obviously
increasing or enhancing the productivity
and obviously since your productivity
has increased your business gained
increase as well right now data
analytics is not magic guys it's purely
science it's based on science added
based on data the most important
ingredient in analytics is data right so
now where is that data coming from the
data is actually extracted from your
feedback from social media right so you
can extract data from them and then
categorize it and the hence analyze it
on behavioral aspects you can actually
see or you can apply sentiment analysis
on it and see how is the feedback coming
from customers on your particular
product
and you can actually categorize the
negative feedbacks and see what are
those users saying what did they find
wrong in the product or what more do
they want in the product and hence
implement that in the next release okay
so this is what data and takes us guys
so now like I said so data unzips is not
magic right so let me give me an example
for that so if you imagine data because
data is random all right the data has no
structure so data when you provide
structure to the data that is what
analytics is so this is the data it is
all unstructured but with the help of
some tools you come up with a structured
kind of an array and this this is what
analytics is now your job is to analyze
or to read the facts that analytics
provides you and then come up with
decisions right then you come up with
decisions and then it becomes all sorted
so this is a large data so maybe this is
something that you have taken from
social media you have taken from
different sources and all of that you
have dumped in one particular place and
now you want to analyze it right so you
would employ an analytics tool that
analytics tool will actually try to read
this data and make sense out of it and
this is what it does it makes sense out
of it it categorizes it and then it's
your job to actually analyze it so using
different techniques so once you analyze
it based on the results you come up with
decisions right and this is what the
decisions look like this is the sorted
form of your data right so this is how
data analytics is actually used to solve
or to come up with predictions or to
come click paths that will lead you to
success having said that I was talking
about tools that can be used to perform
data analytics so let's move on and
understand what are the different tools
which can be used so data analytic tools
are of two kinds one is the page kind
wherein you have to pay for the software
or the tool that you are trying to use
and one is open source so you have in
paid tools you have Excel you have
Splunk
you have click view we have tableau and
you have SAS an open source part you
have are you have big hive your spark
are you have peyten and other tools as
well now today we are going to discuss
SAS right so why have you chosen SAS out
of all these different tools what is so
special in SAS let's discuss that so by
SAS now we are using SAS because these
reason so it is easy to learn and
because the data handling capacity
graphical capabilities updating of tool
and jobs Norris let's look at each of
these one by one
so let's talk about ease of learning
first so SAS is very easy to learn guys
it basically follows procedural SQL
language and people who have an
experience in SQL will actually be able
to relate to this language more right
and if we compare it with R which is an
open source language it has a very steep
learning curve as in it is very
difficult to learn are because of the
language which is there because it is
completely new does not related to any
technology that you are using right now
it is not relatable right and that is
why it becomes a little difficult to
learn all then it is difficult to learn
tennis so SAS is comparatively more
easier than learning R and all the
reason people are more inclined towards
SAS when they enter into the design fix
field since you guys are beginners right
so if you are beginners people like you
prefer SAS more than R because SAS is
more easy to learn and then it will be
more easier to get into this career by
Linux as having said that so ease of
learning in the first reason the next
reason is data handling capabilities
right so when we talk about data
handling capabilities SAS is in power
with R and peiter when it comes to
handling huge amount of data right so it
performs at par with our and Python so
it's not like in open-source you have a
tool which is better than SAS right the
SAS is in part with R and Python which
are open sourced in terms of handling
the size of data that we want there is a
huge set of data so sash can handle that
efficiently moving on let's talk about
the graphical capabilities so using SAS
you can come up with various graphs
various types of visualization tools or
graphs so that you can study your data
more quickly because it gives you more
insight when you're going with the
visualization way then actually studying
the data right so with a little bit of
learning it is possible so by learning
only a few commands you can actually
come up with good graphs which gives you
good insights into your data right so
the graphical capabilities is also a
reason
then comes updating of tools now when we
talk about open source guys or open
source you have to rely on the community
to come up with the next version right
but it says it's not like that so
whenever they feel that there's a new
feature coming up right so since as the
paid tools it's a proper company right
so their operations are very systematic
right so they come up with new feature
now and then they come up with new ways
of implementing techniques and when they
say new ways they are actually making it
more easier with every release appears
when it awkward are are is not that
frequent or when Doc but other
open-source tools they in terms of is
using or in terms of their updations
I'll not say they're not updated at all
they are but they are updated at a very
low pace right and we since we are
working in businesses we want the best
of the best right and if you have a tool
which is upgraded according to the
latest technologies which are out there
it becomes more easier for us to
implement that technology right having
said that so updation of tools is also a
reason and then comes shop scenario so
if you talk about our country india so
the companies which are using sass are
70% so 70% of the data analytics
population is using sass as compared to
the 15% population which are still stuck
on our right so if you're learning sass
you have a better opportunity to be
employed in the data analytics industry
then if you are rezoning are because all
has a comparatively lesser community or
there are lesser businesses which are
actually implementing our for data
analytics and today's world right
so these were the reasons and these are
the reasons that people are actually
preferring SAS or any other language
because first it is very easy to learn
then the data handling capabilities at
par with the other languages the
graphical capabilities are also there
and they are very easy to learn again
and then the updates are pretty frequent
and the job scenario is cool as well so
if you're learning SAS you are you
increase your probability of being
employed as our data analyst right so
this is why a SAS is preferred moving on
and now we know why we picked up SAS or
what what is the reason behind you guys
learning SAS right now let's discuss
what SAS actually is right so SAS is a
soft fist shoot right so it's a suit
which contains a different kind of tool
it has a lot of components right it
deals with different kind of things and
it is used to do advanced analytics
multivariate analysis business
intelligence data management and
predictive analytics we will discuss
each of these in the next slide so let's
check it off as of now then it was
developed by the SAS Institute for way
early I think in the 1980s or the 70s
and since then it's been using and one
more reason that people tend to stick on
to SAS and not go somewhere else is
because SAS came very earlier guys right
and now when the systems are when the
companies have already implemented their
systems in SAS moving on to some other
language becomes very expensive because
they have to actually shift or they have
to migrate from the legacy systems to
the new systems right so the underlying
architecture the coring everything will
change so when I say the underlying
architecture I basically mean when you
migrating a data onto a new system you
have to architect it again the way
because your data is now acquainted with
this architecture of sass right so you
have to remodel everything and come up
with a new infrastructure and also your
employees they are trained with the way
that things happen in SAS so
have to again clean your employees for
the new technology that you are
implementing right and hence the costs
go up and that is the reason people tend
to stick on to SAS rather than moving
ahead ok so let's move on so it was
developed by the SAS Institute really
and then it provides a graphical
pointing click user interface the graphs
are the visualization tools which are
there and self at easily accessible
right so you don't have to dig deep you
don't have to do a lot of research on
the commands which are there it is very
easy to access and with a
point-and-click user interface even for
non-technical users it becomes very easy
to use right so if I am say I am from a
technical background so if you are you
guys any of you from a non-technical
background SAS will make sense for you
as well right so it will not be
difficult for you to actually use SAS
because of the interface or because of
the UI or because of its user
friendliness right so this was about SAS
guys so like I said it is office route
for different kind of things let's
discuss these things so these are the
things which SAS actually solves right
so let's see Society is used to do
advanced analytics it is used to do
multivariate analysis it is used for
business intelligence it is used for
data management and it is used for
predictive analysis
now let's discuss each of these one by
one so first what is advanced analytics
right so it is a broad category of
inquiry that can be used to help write
changes and improvements and business
practices right so like I said it is
just like data analytics so it is just
an advanced form of data analytics
wearing you use more sophisticated the
technique and you come up with the
insights which can help change and
improve your business practices right so
this is what advanced analytics is all
about then we have the multivariate
analysis so when you have when you're
doing analysis you actually depend on
some variables right so some factors
which actually are causing a change in
your model so when you have a lot of
factors involved like if you have sale
like when I talk about the capacity the
engine capacity of a car it it is based
on a lot of things based on the create
of the car it is based on the dimensions
of the car it is also based on the
terrain that it is meant for so when you
look at all these things you come up and
say okay so this is the engine capacity
that this car should have right so
you're taking into a lot of things
you're taking into a lot of variables
similar is the case with SAS as well so
SAS actually is used where you have a
lot of variables so I just took three
variables it could be around fifteen or
twenty or thirty five forty variables
right so when you have these many
variables and you're trying to make a
decision based on all these variables it
actually becomes a cumbersome task but
when you have fast you don't have to
worry about anything because it is used
it is efficient in these kind of
analysis moving on then you have the
business intelligence topic so what is
business intelligence so it refers to
technologies application and practices
for the collection integration analysis
and presentation of business information
right also it is actually refers to the
techniques it refers to the practices
that can be used to improve your
business that can be used to help your
business to improve right so whenever
you have something going on in your
business and you want to understand how
that business how my business is doing
so that involves some techniques right
so business intelligence basically means
that you are actually referring to
technologies you are actually referring
to applications you're actually
referring to the practices which leads
to collection integration analysis and
presentation of the business information
that you want to understand right
so you using tools you do this and SAS
is an all-in-one for this so using SAS
you can actually understand you can
actually look into your business
information if you made breakthrough in
sales right in the past month
and you want to understand what actually
mean to speak through or what actually
made this last months or successful look
you can actually lead on to where you
can actually incline on your business
intelligence tools which will give you
insights onto what
actually happening in Europe this is
okay moving on you have data management
so data management basically means how
well you can manage the data so with the
help of architectures their policies
practices and processes you are actually
managing your data efficiently
now the tasks you have all these things
in place you have proper procedures you
have proper architectures you have
proper practices which are coded in
service using this you can manage your
data more efficiently than some other
tool all right and then you have
predictive analysis as well so
predictive analysis is basically a part
of advanced analytics wherein you
actually force see what will happen if
these are the inputs that I give right
so predictive analysis is basically used
for unknown events so if you want to
know if a followed this part what will
be the outcome right and this actually
helps you in better decision-making it
if you don't know what will happen so
what happens in predictive analysis is
you rely on the past data so based on
the past data you come up with the model
right so do you feed in values that you
are you feeding decisions that you took
in the past and then the two conclusions
right so based on these decisions and
the conclusions you come up with a model
and on this model you feed in the new
data or the new decisions that you want
to make before actually making them you
actually feed them in the model and this
model then predicts a conclusion what
will happen right based on the past
trends so this kind of analysis is
called predictive analysis and SAS can
do that for you as well right so these
are the things that the SAS can actually
handle moving on let's understand the
different components of cells so SAS can
do a lot of things right but then all
these things cannot be integrated into
one component so that is why SAS is
actually having a lot of components with
these with different kind of things now
there are close to 200 components that
such as right so one of these is basis
so base SAS is a topic that we are
learn in the upcoming sessions that we
are going to cover so don't worry by
seeing all these companies guys don't
worry you will not be learning all the
200 components will be learning about
base size in our sessions in our
upcoming sessions right so base size
contains basic processors and it's used
for data management and other things
right so we'll be learning about base
SAS in the upcoming sessions moving on
now you would wonder how will you
actually practice business
so I said SAS the paid tool right so
you'd be wondering okay should I
purchase as to actually practice on it
so for that the SAS community or the SAS
company has actually been very helpful
they have provided us with a free tool
which is called SAS University Society
niversity is basically a SAS you'd offer
to you for free so SAS universe is
basically used for the learning purposes
right so if you want to learn size you
can learn it for free using the SAS
university tool but this tool cannot be
used for commercial purposes and that is
the reason that all of the learning that
we are going to do what that all of the
learning that I am going to show you
guys is using the blue PS right so WPS
means the world programming system so in
WPS you can increment paces or the SAS
programming language also right so
whatever commands that I'll be showing
you guys you can implement in SAS
University and I have implemented it in
WPS why because I have the WPS license I
can use it for you you can actually
download SAS University and whatever
codes or whatever demos that we'll be
doing in our sessions that will be going
for the width you can practice it and
your SAS University right so these are
the two tools which can be used to
practice bases now let me show you guys
how we can actually install both these
tools so let's talk about SAS University
first so for fast university you have to
go to this link right and on this link
you will be seeing this page this is
actually the SAS university edition
software pills and you will be clicking
on get free software alright so you'll
be clicking here and once you
you will actually see the screen then
you will be prompted with the screen and
then you have an option to actually
choose between using your own computer
for sass or using the cloud for it right
so what happens in the cloud version is
your files will actually be downloaded
through your cloud your AWS cloud and it
will be installed on a server on AWS
right so when its installed on a server
on AWS you will basically get the IP
address of that server and you will be
able to accept sass from your browser
right this is one way the other way is
that you can download sass to your own
machine right you will have to download
VirtualBox you will be installing sass
University on to that and then sass
University will give you a link you have
to copy paste that link in a browser and
it will open the sass user interface for
you and that is where you will be
learning sass right so you have these
two options you can act a directly
download it or you can actually run it
in the cloud alright so if you guys
don't want to spend money on the cloud
you can actually download it on your own
system it's around the 2gb file so once
you do that you will be prompted bound
with this screen right so you'll have to
create a hash profile before this so do
all the registration and then you will
be prompted with this screen so we will
be clicking on get download once you
download like I said you will have to
install VirtualBox once that VirtualBox
is installed you have to open VirtualBox
and go click on file and click on import
appliance right so once you do that
whatever file that you have downloaded
from the sass website right here you'll
be presented with the window beylin you
have to browse to that file right so
browse to that particular size click on
ok and then you will be prompted with
this setup visit right so just go along
with the normal way you install things
and then sass will actually get launched
now when sass launches as you can see
there is this link that SAS is providing
you with right so you will have to enter
this link in your browser right so once
you enter that link in your browser
this is the screen that will be seen
right so this screen is actually the SAS
studio screen so and then you can click
on SAS studio start start studio and
you'll actually be up and running right
so this is the way you can install SAS
university and use it let me quickly
show you
so I've downloaded the file and I have
configured it in my VirtualBox let me
show you how it actually looks or how
the SAS user interface actually is right
so wait a second hang on alright so this
is my VirtualBox guys so now this is the
university edition I click on start
and then it'll start initializing so you
have to wait for like one or two minutes
it takes a while for it to initialize
and once it initializes it should give
me that screen so let us wait for sighs
to initialize
you
alright guys so SAS has successfully
been initialized right so you can see
the screen it has provided you with
address so let's go to this address and
see how this has actually looks like so
I'm going to look lost : 1 double 0 its
0 click on enter
alright so this you get presented with
this screen guys as you can see right
now you'll be picking on starts cos 3
over 2 sine of n and
that is Simon
it is initializing now
alright guys so this is it right so this
is the SAS video you have three things
over here you have the code you have the
log and then you have the results right
so in the code part you actually give
your code and the log part you get any
errors that you'll be getting and in the
results part you'll actually getting the
graphs or the tables that you have
actually coded the application for right
so this is how your science university
looks like on the left side you can see
that you will have some files and
folders wherever you are trying to store
your data sets wherever is trying to
store your code all will be listed over
here alright so that is this is how your
SAS you will actually look like there's
nothing much to it you have code wherein
you'll be coding it blog and the results
now whenever you'll be trying to
implement or whenever you're trying to
execute your code you know what you'll
be doing is you will be selecting the
part of the code and clicking here which
is run right so you click on run and
then it will run that particular set for
you so don't worry all of this is
exactly the same in WPS as well there's
no difference it's just over there you
will have a different icon for running
so there is nothing that you won't be
understanding over there right so this
is how the SAS studio actually looks
like guys I'm closing it now let's
continue with our session all right so
this is how you can actually install SAS
university
moving on guys I am using the blue PS so
I don't think you guys will have the
need to use WPS but if you do this is
how you install it you go to this link
and you will see the screen right and
then once you click on install you will
pre prompted with the screen you'll have
to register an account and then you have
to request for that particular software
the software name is WPS Express it is
free right so you can install this free
software and then move on to the license
so it will give you a license
and then once the license is actually
it'll take around five minutes for it to
be approved somewhere it will say to
take around one day it might take but
for me it took five minutes so you can
wait for like five minutes and your
license will be a book and then you can
click here there is download software
for this license right so once you click
here the installation will actually
begin and you'll be prompted with this
screen next and then according to your
architecture if it's a 32-bit you will
be going with x86 and it fits a 64-bit
you will actually be going for 64-bit
right so you can install your borscht in
here and once it does you are done you
are set right so let me show you the WPS
interface as well so this is how your
WPS interface actually looks like now
guys the cash with the blue PS Express
why it is free is because WPS Express is
actually available for all there's no
license such as it can only be used for
learning purposes or something like that
but but WPS Express this is a thing that
you cannot execute via sets which have
more than 100 records right it has a
limitation that it can only execute
records until 100 right after 100 it
does not execute it and that is the
reason we have actually purchased of ups
and we have implemented it on AWS right
so with WPS Express we are actually
connecting to our AWS serve which is
called Eddy Reiter as you can see the
default server is edu server and the
standard license is green so we have a
license for WPS and that is how we are
going to execute the SAS programs right
so the thing with server is this when we
are using the server we actually get out
of that limitation of that hundred of
codes so because the code will be sent
from here the code will be executing
over there and the results will be sent
back to us all right so with this you
can actually execute datasets which I
have more than hundred records having
said that you will also have the
information for the Erika server in your
LMS so in case you want to try your hand
at WPS you can actually do that but I
think you should stick on to SAS
University because ultimately will be
working on satisfy so ultimately your
goal is to learn SAS now SAS can be
learnt in WPS as well but why not learn
it now is also only because I think when
you will be going into your companies
when you will be going into your
corporate jobs you'll be using this
licensed version of SAS but for learning
we can use WPS or SAS University but
once you enter the commercial business
you actually have to use the license
product all right so having said that
let's move ahead now let's understand
the code structure of sessile so we have
now learned how we can install the SAS
software the relevance offer that a WPS
or SAS University now let's start with
the coding guys let's see how SAS is
actually programmed or how is it
structured right so basically the SAS
code has two kind of blocks one is
called the data block and the other is
called procedure block or the proc block
right so the data block is basically for
defining the data set for performing
operations on the data set and procedure
is actually like a function so it cutes
it deals with the execution part of a
data center these are the statistics or
whatever operations that you want to
implement that can be included in the
procedure part so whatever output that
you are seeing that output actually
coming from the procedure part of your
program right so having said that let's
move ahead and see a sample code right
so this is a sample code guys what this
code is actually doing is so it is
defining a data set called trail right
and this data set will have three
columns which is PID it will have named
analog age right so now PID is nothing
but number value right name is a string
and whenever you have a string guys you
have to attach a dollar after
right so if you're attached a dollar
upgrade SAS will understand okay this is
a string and then you have age which is
again a numeric value right so once you
have given the input line in the data
block next is you have to give data
lines so you'll be entering this
statement which says data lines
semicolon and semicolon is very
important guys after each and every
command that you give in SAS right so
data trail you see the semicolon input
PID name age you see the semicolon and
then you enter data line so data lines
means after this command you will be
entering whatever records that you want
to add to your database right so you
enter data lines semicolon after that
I've entered three records so the first
record is PID which is 100 then you have
the string which is my name and then the
age which is could be anything I'm not
saying I'm 21 but then yeah so you can
enter your age hit enter enter the
second line so PID is now 200
the name is IU she H is whatever you
feel like and then you have PID again
for the third records and you have 300
you have the name and the ndh right now
after each and every entry that you want
make you have to hit enter remember guys
there's no semicolon after this it's a
enter right you hit enter you come to
the second record enter the second
record hit and again enter the third
icon and so on right once you are done
with entering records in your data set
you can actually put an end to it by
putting a semicolon
so the semicolon marks that you are no
more entering any more records and then
after each block that is the data block
and the procedure block you have to
Center the run as well so run basically
tells SAS okay so run this particular
block now right so run is very important
and after a semicolon will again come
right so run tells SAS to run the code
and then this is the data block which
basically includes all the operations
related to your data set and then you
have the procedure block or the proc
block which will contain the output
section of your code right so
in this we are basically printing the
data set which we just created which is
called trail right so we say it PR OC
and then the print command and then we
say okay the data set is trail right now
the title result means the title of that
result whatever we'll be getting in the
result window should be result right so
when we say types of result instead of
the normal default header which is there
which is the double-ups system you will
get result as the title right after that
obviously like I said you have to put
run which basically tells has to run
this particular block which is the proc
block right so this is basically the
structure that is there in SAS pretty
simple right there's nothing related to
programming in this this is very fresh
this is very simple this is very new for
you so if you follow these guidelines so
basically you have like I said there are
just two blocks so there is nothing much
to remember as well right moving on guys
let's move on to the next slide which
stalks a little in detail about the data
block so the data block actually can be
used to compute datasets right it can be
used to check for errors in the data set
it can be used to subset a data set if
you want to make smaller data set out of
a parent data set you can do that in the
data block it is used to super set a
data set if you want to combine two or
three data sets to make a bigger data
set that can be used to do that can we
use to merge data sets and we use to
update their sets right so all of these
operations can be done in the data block
so as you would have noticed all these
operations are actually related to your
data set and hence they are executed in
the data block right so if any nothing
in this operation
none of these operations are actually
related to the results pane in your SAS
studio right so you will see nothing if
you execute a data block any result pin
right it is only the procedure block
which will lead to results in your
results pin all right so this was about
the data block guys next we have the
procedure block
so processor block is basically used to
summarize the results that you are
getting it is used to sort the results
that are getting from the technique city
implementing list the results can we
also use to produce descriptive
statistics as in tables which will
contain probability values and stuff
like that and also it can be used to
generate reports and graphs right so if
you want to visualize something that
also has to be done in the procedure
block all right having said that guys
with this with structure of your sass
code so we now know how to actually
install the SAS software we now know the
code structure of tasks so what are we
waiting for let's jump on to the demo
part let implement a demo in SAS now
right so the demo is going to be like
this so first I'm going to show you a
couple of basic statements in SAS so
basic commands that you can run in SAS
basic things that you should know as a
beginner what can be done right then
I'll tell you guys how you can create a
data set and SAS will be creating a data
set and then we'll be listing that data
set in different ways and also we see if
we have created a data set how we can
actually save it right so there are
basically two kinds of data sets in SAS
right so if you would come back to the
screen guys you can see that we created
a data set called trail right now
this data set is actually there until
you are running that SAS session the
moment you end that SAS session this
data set will actually cove it it will
not be there anymore right so if you
have to save your data set you can do
that using the a library command that
I'll be showing you in the demo right so
using that command then this data set
actually becomes a physical file and
gets stored in your file system right so
this kind of data set is called a
permanent data set after this you have
the temporary data sets which are there
to this session is running in your cells
for example this trail data set as of
now
since we have not executed the library
statement this stair set is actually
called temporary between the movement
I'll end by secession this trail dataset
will also get evaporated will not be
there in the system anymore
alright so this is what we'll be
learning in the demo part that is how to
create permanent datasets we will also
be creating a dataset and then we'll see
how we can actually update that data set
right so you can you create a dataset
you're actually creating a sash table
now we will see how we can actually
apply operations in tables so if the
forth of this variable is actually
dependent on one of the variables in the
table we'll see how we can update or how
we can create a new data set using the
older data sets and adding a new column
in it which is actually dependent on the
older variables right sounds a little
more complex but don't worry guys we'll
be going step by step and everything
will be clear to you in the next few
minutes that will be doing the demo form
alright so let's go to the WPS system
alright guys so this is my WPI system so
as of now let me create a new program we
click on untitled program all right so
first of all like I said you have to
enter the two blocks so we have the data
block so let's create a data block first
we are creating a data set called trail
and then we want three columns in it say
we want input will enter input and then
let's say we are entering values such as
the employee number the name of the
employee and then the salary of the
employee all right now like I said the
name is string so you have to attach a
dollar after it and with every statement
ending you have to add a semicolon all
right so we're done with the semicolon
let's go ahead now we have created a
dataset called trail we have specified
that these are the three columns that
will be there now let's enter the values
so for entering the values you actually
have to write the data line statement
to add a semicolon after that and then
you'll notice that what are the values
that you'll be entering now will come in
yellow that means that you're actually
entering the records that you want to be
there in your data set right so first
the employee number so let's give it one
right and whenever you have to move on
to the second column you just give a
space and that is it right so now the
second column is names let me enter my
name which is hemant give one more space
now it's talks about the salary so let
me enter my salary which is okay let me
enter a pseudo salary which is ten
thousand bucks
all right the next line will be the
employ number right so let me enter one
more record employ number is two name is
say sourabh right and the salary is
fifteen thousand okay so next employee
is saved by big and the salary is twenty
thousand right so three records you have
entered now to mark the end of the
entering of your records you will say
semicolon and hit enter so done you
won't have the yellow lines now and then
get done with the data set you will type
run and a semicolon so this is how your
data set will be created in the next
line let's print the day set so we'll be
ending the proc statement right sub proc
so this is basically means that this is
the prop block and then the function
that we want to implement so we want the
print function to be implemented and
then I want the data set to be trail
right so I'll enter the data set as
trail followed by a semicolon enter
after that nothing else needed I can
give a title right so the title could be
say my first result right and semicolon
followed by run good all right guys this
is our goal let's run it now let's
select it and click on run all right so
it is running my core on Ed Eureka
server and as you can see it has given
me a result all right so as you can see
it has printed the results that I have
entered let me quickly show you
so sass one I've entered him and sourabh
and be big and the salaries and the
employee number and as you can see the
title is my first result and the entries
are humans our event the big along with
their salaries right so congratulations
on your first program guys so you have
successfully started coding in SAS all
right
give me a moment let's move on to the
second part of now so we have
implemented the code for printing a
dataset right now like I said if you
want to actually save a data set on your
machine the way you will do that is like
this right so you write l ib n am E
which is lip name right and then you'll
be specifying the library name so let
the library name be demo alright and
then you have to specify the path so the
path is actually of my ID array curse
over to ask specify the Ubuntu path to
let me do that so it is home slash 1 2
and followed by a semicolon right after
that in the data statement you actually
have to specify demo dot trails so this
is where my data set will be saved right
and let's give it trail for because I
already have a file called trail in my
system alright guys so now what will
happen is first it will set the path of
demo as this right and then I specified
that the data should be saved in trail
for right so this result they got is
from a
I'm pretty data set but I'm trying to
make that data set permanent all right
so let me do that I'll show you the home
directory as an awful - server right so
there is no file called trail for over
all right so there's nothing call trail
for so now let me run the data part so I
will click on data click on OK
all right so as you can see the command
executed successfully so I wanted
something called trail for right let's
shake if they're the folder file here
called real for it is not there yet let
me refresh it right so the moment i
refresh it I see a file called trail for
over here so as you can see the file
called trail for here now right so my
data set was this right so it should
have human sort of and be baked let me
check what this data set has alright so
this is what my data set I came in sort
of and we baked 10,000 15,000 and 20,000
and this is that guy's so now your data
set is actually permanent now let us
create one more data set right let us
create a temporary data set called till
five right and then we want it to be
copy of trail for it so we'll say set
trail for so which is in demo I so we'll
specify the amount or trail for and
followed by a semicolon right so now
what will happen is it will create a
data set called trail 5 which will be an
exact copy of trail for 4 that will be
using the command calls set in the data
block alright so let me run this
statement
all right my statement executed let me
print it now so data equal to create
five Mira's first results from copied
data set
let's try to print this
enter the data - betrayal size right and
the title is my responses are from copy
data said let's try to run the statement
all right I've got a result so let's see
what a result says so as you can see my
first result from copy data set and then
you have these three records which have
been successfully been copied from the
permanent data set alright guys so now
what I want to do is I have copied the
data set now I want to add one more feel
to it let me add one more feel to it
which is say mu L right now what does mu
L mu L is nothing but the salary
multiplied by 2 all right so basically
this column will contain the salary
which is multiplied by 2 and I am saving
it in trail 5 which is my new data set
all right and I am taking a previous
date of it that is trail 4 so basically
what I'm trying to do here is I'm taking
a data set which already exists and I'm
adding one more column to it which will
be actually dependent on the salary
column from trail 4 and what I'm doing
with that is the dependency is that I'm
multiplying it by 2 all right so let's
sort of run this whole code click on OK
and we are said let's check the print
command what it has to show us so as you
can see we have copied the data values
from trail for criticized and added one
more column which is mu L which is
nothing but the multiple of salary by 2
for 10000 becomes 5000 15,000 becomes
30,000 and 20,000 becomes 40,000 all
right so we have done this as well guys
so let's now end this session but before
that let me actually show you one more
procedure statement then you can do
which I think should not be very complex
so let it be procedure and then I'll say
T chart so G chart will basically use
for creating graphs right and I want
clear set to Betrayal five title ok let
me give it title as my first chart
right and the next command that I want
you guys to see is V Bar
right so I want that to be on the salary
on the column mu L right and then I will
be closing a lot of pressing run all
right so let us try to run this command
and see what is the result
okay so I've got the results here
alright so as you can see I have
implemented the salary on I've actually
created this
so this graph doesn't mean anything guys
but this is how you can create a shot
right so basically what I'm trying to
show you is how to create a chart right
so if you have a frequency table or if
you create a data set and you want to
have a chart for the frequency for every
record that you have in that data set so
can you do that using this particular
command which is so you write proc that
is procedure then the G chart which is
basically the command for global charts
and then you'll be specifying it data
set which is trail files and then the
title which will say my fault shot so as
you can see here it says my first shot
right and then you'll be specifying the
column it should be applied on so you
want the vertical bar to be on the MU L
column in the data set and then you are
basically running that command alright
guys so this is what SAS is in a gist so
the idea that I want you guys to take
from this demo is sashes are not that
difficult to write SAS is very simple it
is very easy to understand right and
whatever you have learned today data
block and the procedure blog this is it
guys there's nothing more to it you'd be
just typing in more commands and you
will be implementing different
procedures you can apply different
algorithms in your procedure block which
is logistical Iridum or sentiment
analysis you can do anything in SAS
right but whatever you will be doing
whatever functions that you're applying
you will be applying in the procedure
bar and you see in the upcoming sessions
this is the structure that will be
following I've shown you some of the
commands some of the basic commands
which are there in SAS right and based
on that also I have prepared some
assignments so I want you guys to go
through those assignments and absolutely
guys SAS is very important you cannot
learn SAS without hands-on right as
hands-on is actually very important and
other reason I show you guys how we can
actually install the software so that
you can do it in this
was session orally right so install the
software and try to do all the things
that we did today right in the next
session it might become a little more
complex to you so I want you guys to be
eased out I want you to know how to
create a data set I want you to know how
to print the statement all of this
should be practiced by you in the next
session all right and also like I said I
have given some assignments I want those
assignments to be submitted in your LMS
the code that we've used today is also
available or will be available in your
elements once the session ends if you
have any doubts you can go through the
recording again it will be there in like
3-4 hours in LMS again if you have any
doubts if you have any queries regarding
installation or whatever we have
discussed you can always contact our
support team which is 24/7 available for
you right and if the support team can't
handle your request or is not able to
solve your query
I am also there so you can email me and
I'll reply to you whenever I have time
or in the next session right so thank
you guys for attending today's session I
hope you learned something new today
like I said please practice before
coming to the next session and please
approach your assignments as well all
right so on that note have a good day
goodbye I hope you enjoyed listening to
this video please be kind enough to like
it and you can comment any of your
doubts and queries and we will reply to
them at the earliest do look out for
more videos in our playlist and
