ADA Rika and welcome to the session on
Barbie our desktop now you must I have
all heard of Barbie from here and there
and right now it's one of the first
works that's happening so let's try to
understand what exactly is for Mia and
what makes it stand about the other data
visualization tools so without wasting
any time let's move forward and look at
today's agenda now we'll start up at
first understanding why do we need power
bi and what exactly is Fabia moving on
from there we talk on who uses Fabia as
well as flow of work in pavia then we
will try workaround with the power bi
desktop where we'll be singing different
visuals and get an insight to power bi
desktop and then finally we'll be
looking at the trends for power bi at
the present so any doubts with respect
to today's agenda can I have a quick
confirmation in the chat box ok so I've
got a confirmation from George washes
Sam Dave Harry Cooper Sandeep that's
great to see guys I hope you guys are
excited for session as much as aya so
let's move forward to the first topic
and try to understand why power bi now
these are just the major eight reasons
that we have taken into consideration as
to why you need to go with our bia in
comparison to other data which location
troops so talking about the reasons as
to why use power bi here are some of the
8 reasons as to that now let's look at
them one by one we start off by first
trying looking at the cost factor now
always before using any tool the first
thing that comes to your mind is how
much is it going to cost me and how
useful is it so talking about the cost
factor in comparison to other tools like
stab you okay where you need to pay
about thousand dollars per year for a
single user license that is for your
tableau desktop license okay in
comparison to that in Microsoft where
all you need to do is pay about $10 a
month and on an annual basis that's
somewhere about 120 dots and even
Microsoft is running an offer now where
you can get the annual subscription at
$100 straight forward so where does $100
lie and where $1,000 life so you can
feel a difference itself it's almost
1/10 and even in terms of
capable D Swabia is not for behind
tableau as well now in case some of you
are not aware tableau is one of the most
popular data which lie fish tool in the
market I press it and is slowly being
chased down by Microsoft power bi okay
now second major reason is machine
learning capabilities now machine
learning is another buzzword in the
industry right now and it's quite
growing as well because machine learning
in turn actually makes our work quite
easier so again a lot of research is
going into this field right now and by
integrating your power bi to Microsoft a
rod you can also perform machine
learning on power bi as well okay now
you don't need to worry as to how
exactly it is done we will be looking at
all the edge or related functionalities
in our next session after that comes
mobility in an age where all the first
want things in our hands now this is not
just with respect to a book
we need crickets cause we need our movie
tickets we need money everything needs
to be on our hand tips at every time and
that's one of the key reasons most
mobile applications run today in that
same race barber has also come out with
power bi has launched its Barbie
application both on androids too as well
as ice too and also how to support for
Windows phones as well so thereby it
makes it quite easy for you to have your
reports and dashboards available to you
on the go with cells now if you actually
install the power bi application on your
phone you can see a set of samples
dashboards and reports which will give
you a complete insight as to how our
dashboard would look like on the mobile
application then moving on to your data
integration question Poppaea has a lot
of API switch help you integrate your
data this data could be on various files
it could be on Vegas - Vegas
applications even could be on various
cloud providers now using power bi as
Venus API you can integrate your data
from all these sources and bring it to
power therefore your operations and data
visualizations after that comes
customizability now any tool as long as
it's not customizable would not be
something that a user would want to go
ahead because when you have a restricted
set of works that you can perform then
the tool is viewers only for a specific
purpose thereby restricting the
capability of the tool asthma in power
bi the limitation of customizability is
not there at press power bi has an open
and growing community where newer
suggestions are picked on a daily basis
your ideas are considered your options
are included and on a regular basis you
get updates with new modifications as
well so RBI is one of the most
customizable tools in the market at
present talking about advanced analytics
Fabia has a lot of capabilities in this
field apart from having its own internal
analytical platform Bobby also supports
our scripting which is one of the most
popular language used for analytical
purposes so you can also write your R
scripts as well as our visuals can be
integrated as part of your reports and
dashboards now coming down to its user
friendliness if a tool is not user
friendly then the chances are you would
not go for that and that is one of the
key reasons what made tableau quite
properly because tableau became a tool
that was quite easy for anyone to use
even though they were not from a
technical background
now Fabia is something that gives you
almost the same feature but at the same
time it also gives opportunity for those
who are technically qualified to write
queries to work with the data directly
and perform all the operations that they
want so Fabia is a tool that is created
for both professionals who are
technically qualified as well as non
technical professionals as well so
thereby it reaches you to your audience
as such now finally talking about its
integration obviou helps you integrate
with code from now code nough is
basically a Microsoft's person
assistance similar to your CD that you
have on the iPhone so similar to that
you can integrate your court not to your
power pair thereby making it quite easy
for you to work with your data and power
pair in itself so with the integration
of kortner it becomes quite easy for you
to interact with your data as well as
the power bi tool as well so moving on
from here let's look at some of the key
benefits of Pavia now power head
completely offers you various pre-built
dashboards and reports solutions for
your popular fast problems that is
offer a solution problems okay so by
using these you can rapidly cut down the
time that you need to invest for
creating various reports and dashboards
are such now talking about your
dashboard once you have integrated your
data to your power bi then any changes
that you perform with that data is
almost immediately reflected on your
dashboard so your dashboards are
something that gets updated on real-time
basis now then comes the question on
security and compatibility so pavia is a
Microsoft product so thereby in itself
you can understand how secure your
connections are going to be apart from
that you can also integrate the data
that is present on your premise or on
cloud as well this could be across we
use cloud providers it could be on
Amazon it could be on Microsoft Azure
you can even have your data present on
your git or github repository from where
you can feature it now how do we do that
we'll be seeing as part of the next
session but for now just keep that in
mind because it's an important feature
now one of the key reasons why power bi
had caught my attention in the early
2016's was because of its growing
capabilities to use natural language
query now again what natural language
query does is it simplifies the process
of fetching the data where and you don't
have to actually write a complete way
now let's say you want to identify the
most selling store from about 50 stores
that you have so again you need to see
the number of sales so all you need to
do is this use a service of power bi
that is probably a Q&amp;amp;A where and you can
just write which is the most selling
store and it will directly convert this
to a query process this and then give
you a report that is in form of a wish
work which store sells how much in a
corresponding order so there were it
again makes it quite easy for anyone to
work around now let's say you are
working with Microsoft products it could
be a jar it could be Microsoft Office
and so forth using power bi you can
integrate all your data that are present
across all these Microsoft product and
work with them on power bi as well so
integration with respect to Microsoft
product is already done so that's
something that is of your checklist as
well finally talking about deployment
and configure will be off Bobby
Fabia has one of the fastest rates for
deployment of your dashboards and
visuals apart from that let's say you
need to contribute power bi as Barakat
existing infrastructure then it's quite
easy pave in itself supports hybrid
configuration and can easily integrate
with your existing infrastructure as
well so I hope either is a clear with
respect to y power bi stands out with
respect to the other data visualization
tools okay that's great so now that I
have got a confirmation from everyone
let's move forward to discuss what
exactly is power they're now talking
about the obviou probably are basically
is a cloud-based business intelligence
tool now apart from helping you create
interactive data which rose-red is also
a self-service business intelligence
tool but again then you might be
wondering what exactly is a self-service
business intelligence tool so let me
give you some insight with respect to
that now talking about self-service
business intelligence this is basically
an approach to data analytics we're in
the business users can filter segments
and analyze their data without the
in-depth technical knowledge that they
need
so this basically means that you do need
to have the statistical knowledge or the
business intelligence understanding or
data mining process knowledge to work on
the business intelligence aspect now
apart from that you're bobbya basically
is a collection of wiggy software
applications connectors which again come
together to help you integrate your data
into a coherent format from which you
can actually create visually immersive
and interactive insights as such so
we've already talked about how the power
bi works on a real-time basis as well as
we'll be seeing how interactive the
dashboard is and we'll be seeing as to
how beautifully it can be represented as
well okay so any dots with respect to
what this power bi okay so washer has a
question
russia has asked me if power bi can
replace microsoft bi okay washa that is
a very good question that you've bought
out since both of them are Microsoft
product it's quite understandable if you
have the start so to clear your doubt
such no object cannot replace your
Microsoft business interest now that's
the spirit forward answer to it but to
give you a better understanding to save
now
Microsoft bir your sequel server tools
basically help you perform a lot of
operation starting from data integration
data warehouse creation creation of
cubes data analytics as well as data
visualization so that is a complete
package that helps you do all the three
necessary aspects of a business
intelligence solution but when you talk
about power bi all the power bi helps
you with respect to data integration and
data processing but it mainly revolves
around data which lies patient aspect as
such so it's many upscaling for those
who have been working with Microsoft
Excel for them it gives them a lot more
to work on as well as represent hwhip so
does that answer a question wash up
that's quick so moving forward let's try
to understand who uses power bi in the
industry now there are mainly four
domains of professions who use Microsoft
Bob Wian first comes developers not for
developers in terms of which lies
raishin the data is merely on a small
scale so for visualizing of this amount
of data apart we're definitely is one of
the most helpful again as we have
already talked about people working with
Excel for them are we have provides a
lot of ground to which lies on so ID
program is quite a general term here now
it basically refers to the professions
who are working as a manager level or
higher up so people who are working on
the business side of the industry for
them are where definitely is a tool that
they need to have again when you come to
subject matter experts professionals who
are experts in their domain for them
with respect to the visualisation aspect
where they need to create very start
various graphs for where definitely is
helpful for them as well a person that
we've also seen a steady growth in the
number of business analysts who use
power bi now what you need to understand
is that these are not the only people
working on power bi is adjusting
majority of the population who use power
bi but Palmilla is a tool that can be
used by anyone and everyone as such so
you don't need to have any previous
knowledge to start working with Barbie
and that's exactly what we're going to
do today but before we actually start
working on power bi let us try to
understand the flow of work with power
bi so again when we talk about the flow
of work in power bi
just talking about the general idea of
based on which the power bi was created
now starting off you always begin by
creating your power bear reports as well
as visuals on the power bi desktop now
this is something that is majorly done
by the developers and business analyst
so once you create your wish was you
then go on to publish it on to your
power bi service now your power bi
service is basically an online
cloud-based service run by Microsoft
wherein all the reports and dashboards
that you create on power bi desktop can
be published and viewed now once you
have published your report on to the
power bi service then you can go on to
share it to anyone that you wish to view
the super and as per their choice they
can either view down power bi service or
even on the power bi mobile application
as well so I know besides I've got a
simple understanding as to the flow of
power bi
great so let's now begin exploring power
bear by installing power B on our
systems now for that let me just open my
browser here just go - gugu
so once you open Google then I'd
recommend that you search for power bi
on the first page this turns you find
the option to download it so just click
on download and that will redirect you
to the download page now here you have
different options present here so you
have microsoft car bi desktop download
option here you have Microsoft Bob via
mobile download you know on-premise data
gateway and Microsoft Bob where
publisher for X now for today's session
I'd recommend that you download just the
Microsoft power bi desktop option now
just click on download and automatically
redirect you for the download page so
here you can see the download option has
already come in I have already installed
and configured power Bay on my system so
I'm not going to read it to this but you
can go ahead and click on save file
option and then run the installer now
it's a very simple process all you need
to do is just keep clicking on next next
next and then you're done with it so go
ahead and install power bi on your
system and I'll be here to assist you in
case we face any challenges okay so now
that you install power be on your system
there's one last thing that I want you
to do on the Microsoft power bi paste is
just that click on sign up for free
option now the purpose of doing this is
to help you gain access to the power bi
services as well so here just click on
download free option and here you also
get the option to download power via
again for now click on cancel and just
provide the details present here once
you've done that our verification code
would be sent to your account and then
you can go on to activate your account
as well so just follow the step as well
and then I will show you how to work
with Barbie
okay so once you launch Barbie art this
is the view that you would be seeing now
for those of you who have created your
account you have an option to sign it
now I've already signed in so my account
is our variable here so please make sure
before you sign in here you've activated
your account and then you launch your
Barbie now for those of you who are
looking for a simple introduction to
power BIA you can check out some of
these videos that will give you a good
fundamental understanding with respect
to power here and this is your power bi
desktop tool which makes it quite easy
for you to work with your reports okay
so for now what we'll be doing is we'll
be importing a new source so for that
just click on get data option here so
here you can find all the possible input
data sources now as we have mentioned
there are a lot of connection
API that are present in power bi which
help you integrate your data from
different sources okay for now what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to import
from an excel file you can't connect and
then it will ask you the location so I'm
going to load the sample store datasets
double click on that now there are three
sheets in my excel file so I just want
the order sheet so if you just select
that you get the complete sheet present
here so this has various columns then
we'll be seeing each one out there for
now just click on load and I want you to
pay your attention to the field site to
your rightmost corner well once the data
excluded just check the changes here
okay so can you see here all the columns
have been added here all the columns
that are present in your table inside
the worksheet are present here okay so I
have already shared the sheet with you
oh so please go ahead and load the
worksheet all right now there are mainly
three workspaces present in power bi by
default you are always in the report
workspace when you open the bar BIA okay
now this is the workspace where you will
be creating your videos report now
current down to the second workspace is
your data workspace here you can see the
complete data present in your data
source now you can see all the columns
present here as well as the data that is
present inside now I have nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety four rows and I
can see almost all of them present here
so you have the row ID the you order ID
on a date ship date ship mode customer
ID customer name the segment from which
they belong to which country is there in
which city state then the postal code
region product ID category subcategory
and all those corresponding details
needed okay so this is my data set now
let's say you want to make any
modifications with respect to your data
then what you can do is go to edit
queries option present here once you
click on that the query editor opens up
automatically now let's say you want to
change the data type of a single column
in that case what you can do is so you
can just right click and then you have
the option of change type so it's by
default considered to be whole number
let's say you want to change it to any
one of these you can do that as well but
again keep in mind that there should not
be any conflict with respect to exit now
as in your Excel itself if you want to
find all the possible values or you want
to filter out your data then you can
just click on this down arrow button
here and you can find all the
corresponding values that are taken up
in this corner now by default only
thousand values have been assumed here
but you can see the complete view can
you can see the complete list if you
want again if you want to sort the
column correspondingly you can do that
as well here now for those of you who
have worked with Excel all these options
are present in separate ribbons but here
it's all available in the query editor
workspace ok any doubt still here now
another thing is any
operation that you perform on your data
can be reflected in the applied step so
sometimes what happens is when you load
your data and when you view it in power
bi there's slight difference because
bobbya and itself performs a lot of
operations to optimize this data as well
now if you want to see the steps now
this is how your source data would look
like okay then comes your navigation
option and then comes from out eight
headers where it has modified the
headers and it's also changed the data
types ask for power bi now again if you
actually look here there's not much
difference that is happening here okay
it's a very minor difference if you see
but again Pavia has optimized your data
to meet the best requirements as well
now to give you just a simple example
let's look at the previous step so here
if you actually see row ID is actually a
wire carrying option which is then again
getting transformed to a numeric value
here okay so this is all internally done
by power bi and it's something that is
done to optimize it as well now again
let's say if you want to remove any rows
or columns that can be done as well
apart from that if you want to enter any
data that can be done as such okay now
if you want to split a column as for
certain conditions you can do that as
well by a specific values or any
operations that you want to do okay so
for now let me just close this and let's
come back up again you see in the data
workspace now let's go back to the last
workspace that is the relational
workspace now here you would have all
the tables that you're working with
present now since I'm working with a
single file there is no relationship
present here but let's say you are
working with multiple tables from a
database you're loading most of them
together then what Barbier does is it
identifies the relationship present
between these tables and establishes and
connection as well so I know you guys
have got a simple overview of how power
bi desktop looks like and the three
workspaces as well
okay so I've got a confirmation from
everyone so let's begin by creating a
new visual itself okay so the first we
should what I'll do is let's say I'll
bring the sales number here so any
column can be dragged and dropped
directly and a corresponding sheet would
or corresponding visual would get
created so now you can see your visual
is going to be created for the sales
number and you have a lot of visual
options present here okay now this is a
clustered column chart here where you
have the total sale now let's say you
just want it in terms of a number then
you can make it as a card option where
you have the total sale while so if you
want to modify this value here you just
have the format option here now let's
say this is a sales number now I don't
want it in this format to change this
just go to the format option press it
here okay once you click on that this
could read data labels and here you can
change the values now this is basically
represented in millions now if you want
to get the actual value just click on
now so this is the complete value of
your overall sales now again let's say
if you want to modify this as well okay
now by default it has taken this up but
let's say I want the count the distinct
number of sales so this is my total
number of sales okay I just copy paste
it here now with this what I'll do is I
just change this again and here I will
just take my average number of sales
okay apart from that I'll just add one
more which is going to have my sum of my
overall sales okay so these are three
different representation of the same
sales data now apart from this let's say
I want to understand the states to which
I am delivering my product so state
basically is a geographical data so what
I need to do is just drag it and drop it
here and automatically you can see a map
which will has been created so you can
see here am official has been selected
okay now let me just enlarge this
so these are the different states that
have been selected okay
and as you can see all of them are in
United States now do this what I want to
do is I want to calculate the number of
sales coming in so I just drag it and
drop it and you get the details of the
sales from each of the states now you
can see from California there's almost
450,000 sales that are coming in okay
now Warren can gives me only about
13,000 sales as well so you can see the
size varying with respect to the total
number of sales that is happening so
have you guys got a simple idea of how
the map usual works okay you can zoom in
and zoom out as per your requirement now
let's say I want to modify this even
little mo so I just zoom out a bit so
now what I'll do is I'll drag in
categories as well and drop it to my
workspace so here you can see by default
a table which will has been created but
I don't want it in a table format so
what I want it is in a FEMA format
now I'll show you why I wanted in femal
format so I'm going to drag categories
from here and add it to values as well
so here what it does it counts the
number of categories and then it has
created in a free map format now you
have 6026 office supplies you have 2021
furniture and you have 1,000 8:47
technologies okay now as I had mentioned
earlier I power bi create highly
interactive dashboards so here let's
this check the number of sales in
California so here you can see it's
somewhere close to four hundred and
fifty-seven thousand now if I just
select office supplies and let's see
then variation in number so here you can
see it has dropped down to one hundred
and forty two thousand six so again when
you're selecting a specific value you
can see the corresponding changes also
happen if I uncheck here you can see the
change in value of as well now again
same time let's look at furniture so the
change here again has been with respect
to California is somewhere about one
hundred and fifty six thousand so again
you can see when I'm still selecting a
specific category the variation keeps
happening now let's try to publish this
support to publish it just click on
publish option and then it will ask you
if you want to save your change so let's
save it on our system first
and let me call it my first report so
just save it and then it has been saved
on your system now what it is doing is
that it is going to publish this report
on to my power bi service ok and I'll
show you how to view this on your power
bi service as well okay so as you can
see we've successfully publish our
report to power bi now just a thing
before we go ahead I have quickly added
another sheet so these are just two
other visuals that I have added now what
we do see is we'll be seeing how to
create a dashboard from these reports as
well so to do that let's quickly open up
our bi service on our browser ok so here
we have our power bi server ok so now
this is the first report that we have
created just not ok so let me just
refresh this so here you can see the
first page is present as well as the
second page as well now anytime you want
to edit the report as well you can do
that on your power bi services click on
edit report and then you can edit it
here as well ok apart from this let's
say you want to view it according to
your requirement you can change it now
even if you want to save it as a format
as well you can save the report you can
see the copy of it that is making
duplicate of it you can even export it
to PowerPoint as well as download a
report now on we'll be doing is I'll
just show you how you can create a
dashboard now let me just close this now
before we go ahead and create a
dashboard first thing what you need to
understand is that in a report these are
basically referred to asset type so what
we need to do is that we need to pin
these tiles or visuals to our report so
just click on pin visual and it will ask
you whether you want to pin it to an
existing dashboard or a new dashboard
now since we don't have a dashboard at
present let me call it my first
dashboard
and let me just pin it to that so for
now let me just pin
thing that I have to the dashboard
so here what I've done is that I've been
the wish was from a single report to my
dash book but let me also pin the
visuals that are present in my second
report as well into my dashboard now
what are these basically these are
basically the sales by the different
categories per region so how much sale
has happened in a specific category
across different regions so you have
technology furniture and office supplies
as the main category and you have the
four regions that is central east south
and west now I'll just spin these two
visuals as well - my first dashboard
okay the second which will basically is
account of the orders from the different
subcategories and this will give you a
little more broader idea as to how much
order has come from each of the sub
departments as well now let's just go to
our dashboard now to go to your
dashboard to your left you can find this
menu tab here and if you click on my
workspace you can find four major
categories dashboards reports workbooks
and data sets now for now don't worry
about what data sets and workbooks are
you can just see the report so my first
report is present which we are working
on and my dashboard is present my first
dashboard so click on that now here you
have the complete dashboard press it
again so this is what a dashboard would
look like with respect to all the wishes
that you have included now if you want
to change the size of any wishful here
then you can do that as well just drag
it a bit and you get adjusted by it so
okay now what I want is that I want my
sales number to be bought here as well
okay and let me just move all this and
organize it a little more
let's try bringing the sales number at
the top most so what we'll be doing is
I'll make the sales number the major
header
sails down so this way it seems a bit
more organized as well now let's say if
you want more details with respect to
any specific wish wealth then what you
can do is you can just click on that so
this will highlight the specific visual
as well now one of the key features here
is that you can click on get insights to
get a relative in fact now minimum
number of values that has come from a
category is 68 the maximum is thousand
523 okay
apart from that we had an overall of 994
saves as well now here when you're just
covering on max value you can see a
corresponding visual is also getting
created and there are various insights
that gets created according okay now
this is something that gets created
automatically based on the data set that
you are using as well so this is a very
important aspect of the power bi
dashboard as well
okay now let's say you want to share the
dashboard to someone so just click on
share and you get this option to share
it but currently I am not using the pro
version so you can use it once you have
the pro version I will
alright the final thing that I want to
show you is ask a question about your
data now this is basically power VI zki
feature now let's say which state has
most orders okay so this basically tells
me which state has ordered the most okay
now let's say you want to filter this
even better by a specific value then you
can select that as well now let's say by
country again now by default it is all
United States based it also it wouldn't
matter much here but let's say by
ordered it
so this data can be even modified
further as per your requirements by
specifying further category you've just
written a simple statement here which
state has most ordered and automatically
power BIA has violated all that data and
even given us the output in form of a
wish well as well so basically we know
that California has the most orders and
second comes New York okay now if you
want the numbers you can just hover over
them to get a better insights alright
let's go back and this is your final
dash board as well so with this I hope
you guys have got a clear-cut
understanding as to how to work with the
power bi desktop where we saw how you
can load the data from different sources
how you can create different kinds of
visuals how you can bring them together
in a single report and then after that
we went to power bi service where we
also created a new dashboard as well so
any doubts with respect to this aspect
okay so I seem to have got a
confirmation from everyone so let me go
back to my power bi desktop and show you
one last thing now we've talked about
how to work with respect to the report
workspace and you also seen how the data
workspace looks like now anything that
you want to perform can be done here now
let's say you want to modify any data
present here as well just click on edit
queries
and here you can perform your
transformation you can add a new column
you can even add a new measure you can
group your data or split your column and
even you can go on to create new views
as well for now let's go back to the
final workspace that is the relationship
workspace so let me show you how to
create and manage relationships here now
this is something that's quite important
while you're working with multiple data
set and your data is linked across so
what we'll do is let me just load in two
more tables that will give you a better
idea on how to set and manage relations
in power bi so there let me just load
the data just click on get data
I am going to load the customer details
as well as let me load
transaction details now sometimes what
happens this power beer automatically
detects a relationship between the
tables and it creates but let's say
there is no relationship that is
detected and there is a relationship
present then you can manually create it
now if you see here there is a
relationship between the customer ID
from customer table and the customer ID
present in the transaction table now it
gets highlighted when I hover over the
relationship so it's basically a
one-to-many relationship happening here
okay now if you double click on the
center arrow here then you get a pop-up
that shows the details of the
relationship okay now let me show you
how to create a relationship in case
it's not first now I need to link this
customer ID from my orders table to the
customer ID present my customer I can
either manually drag this column and
drop it to create a relationship okay or
let me just delete this and show you how
to create it manually okay just go to
manage relationships so here there is
already one relationship that is better
now just click on new and here you can
select the tables and their
relationships so let me first select the
orders table that is going to be related
to my customer table okay so here I just
select the customer ID to my customer ID
and click on OK so you can see here a
relationship has been formed and when
you come back to your relationship
workspace you can see the relationship
is also marked so in case when you're
using multiple tables as part of your
wish work in those cases it becomes more
processed and well defined ok so either
is clear with respect to how the power
bi works and how you can create and
manage relationships as well
any doubts with respect to what we have
done as part of our practicals from
importing our data set to creating our
first report then we moved on to create
our first dashboard and we've tried to
work with relationships as well any
doubts - here ok that's great
ok so now that you've tried out
different visuals in power bi let's try
to look at the trends for power bi now
talking about the job openings for power
bi ever since its popularity in the late
2015
okay Fabia has rapidly being droid now
this number is close to three percent
but you need to understand this is three
percent of overall number of jobs in the
market so when we see three percent of
that is power bi then it's a huge number
and it's growing as you can see from the
graph as well now apart from that when
you talk about salary trends although
it's not on the higher note
definitely power bi is one of the good
technologies that you can carry around
as well especially if you're someone who
works a lot on reports and various
visuals power bi definitely will help
you out on the same now to summarize
what we have learned in this session we
started off by talking about why power
bi is better than other detail efficient
tools we talked about the key benefits
of power bi we understood what is power
BIA and who uses Poppaea from there we
also understood the flow of work of
power bi we saw a demo on power bi where
you all created your first report on
power bi desktop and then gone on to
publish it as well finally we saw the
twins of power so any dots with respect
to today's session okay since all of you
