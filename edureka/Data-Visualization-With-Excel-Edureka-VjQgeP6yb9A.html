30 here I hope everybody can hear me I
can see there are some 20 participants
who joined this webinar so I would like
to welcome you all to this excel webinar
I can see people are still coming in all
right
thank you so much mr. Vikram Gupta and
Sri Ram for acknowledging that you can
hear me in the questions window yes if
you have any questions during the
session you can always type it in the
questions window about me my name is
Ambarish ambarish 30 brought up in Pune
born in Mumbai
currently living in Navi Mumbai and keep
traveling across the country for various
MS Office training assignments I do
classroom as well as online training
programs on ms-office I was privileged
to be certified by Microsoft in December
2013 as a Microsoft certified trainer
and I'm glad to be associated with edu
maker I hope you all know that these
sessions are done by a break up young
lion obsession in the past I have done
training on webinars like this on
vlookup conditional formatting I think
there was one validation as well there
was well-known data protection as well
there was one on data visualization and
this is again another one on data
visualization so the reason we are
keeping this again is because lot of
people had requested us to you know keep
the data visualization session again
because charts are very important in
Excel yeah so you know rather than
typing data and paragraphs and
statements it's always good to let the
person see your data I know in the
format of a graph or a chart yeah so
very soon we will get started it's nine
three already I can see that there are
22 people with oh that makes 23 now who
have joined okay so first of all friends
the version of Excel that I have here
using for demonstration is MS Office
2013
so it's 13 right yes we cannot you will
get the recording of the session as well
so just in case doing the session if
your phone rings and you're away from
the session for 5-10 minutes if you miss
something you can always get that you
have to send a mail to the support team
it's a good question actually because
everybody if you miss out something you
can always write in to the support team
supported Rebecca and they will be able
to make the recording available okay
great so I am assuming that everybody is
able to hear me properly and they are
able to also see my screen right first
of all friends just look at the data
which I have in the a and B column it
talks about some products okay and it
talks about some sales the best way to
prepare a chart in Excel is you select
just one cell of your data a lot of
times I've seen people have the habit of
selecting the complete data by doing
control a or by using mouse or any other
keyboard shortcut and then they go to
the insert tab I'm sure we all know that
on the top portion of your excel there
is this ribbon which has some tabs and
in the insert tab of Excel you have the
option of charts
okay so a lot of people will select the
data go to the insert tab and then they
select the type of the chart that they
would like to make I am sure everybody
here also in fact most of you here are
also doing the same the best way to do
this is simply select any one cell of
your choice and the Excel data and press
f11 I repeat
simply select any one cell of your
choice in the data like in my case I am
going on 27 now which is a part of the
data okay and press f11 function 11 mind
you look in the top row on the keyboard
f11 and check it out do you see that a
graph is prepared a chart is prepared ok
I have this habit of saying graph but
it's actually called chart and Excel
it's called as chart
yeah that's it so this is a wonderful
shortcut I'm sure you are able to see
that on the left hand side of my sheet
my existing sheet there is a new sheet
prepared by the name chart 1 and it
shows me the chart
okay now if you're using the Excel 2013
version you will see that on the top
right hand side slightly on the right
hand side in your Excel ribbon you have
this command that says change chart type
okay
I hope you all of you can you will see
my circles blinking your friends are you
all able to see my circles blinking on
that command that says change chart type
okay so yeah you can just go there and
you can select change now if you are
using the Excel 2007 ten or seven then
this change chart type will appear
somewhere on the left hand side okay but
because right now I am on 13 it's
updating somewhere on the right side
okay but keep in mind you have to click
on the design tab this is a design
pattern every time you have a graph or a
chart you will have a design tab here
and you have to click on the design tab
and then go to change chart type okay
now when you click on change chart type
a dialog box opens up that says change
chart type okay if you are on Excel 2010
or 7:00 then on the extreme left hand
side bottom of this change chart type
window you will have an option that says
set as default so if you prefer a
particular type of chart and if you
always like that
type of chart to be prepared when you
press f11 you might want to select that
type of chart and press set as default
which is available somewhere here okay
in Excel 2007 and 2010 however because I
am on 2013 I have this option available
here on the right click so for example I
am not okay with this type of a column
chart which is prepared right now right
so what I can do is I can go to for
example I can go to the line right do
you see on the left hand side can you
see on the left hand side of this change
chart type window I have got you know
multiple types of charts I can see your
column I can see line I can see pie I
can see bar I can see area XY scatter
and stuff like that right I hope all of
you can see that right so let's go to
the line type chart right now okay and
in the top
portion of this change type window there
are various types of various further
subtypes of line chart available so
let's just select this the first one
maybe okay and I can do a right click
here and I can say set as default yeah
upon doing right click the only option
that comes up is set as default so I
click on that now and that's it and from
the bottom of this change chart type
window I can click OK and that's it as
you can see my chart has been changed
into a line chart now from the the
column chart okay well this was a
shortcut to simply prepare a crop chart
on the new worksheet okay now if you
wish to come back to the original
worksheet where you have your existing
data it in my case there is a sheet
called
there's a sheet called simple charts
okay so if I want to come back to the
earlier worksheet I know that everybody
knows that then I can simply click with
the mouse and I can simply just you know
come there however if it's just the next
sheet I can press ctrl page down simply
click anywhere on the existing sheet and
press ctrl page down you are taken back
to the earlier worksheet
okay now Vikram had a question your Vic
Ron says okay let me just quickly do the
question here there is this questions
window which appears on and off of the
screen ok well if you want to do a swap
between X and y-axis you can always go
to the design tab
remember design tab is like the life
line of your chart so you go to the
design tab ver bigrams and then you have
this option here that says switch row
and column okay in fact I can show that
to you right now so let's come back to
the simple charts sheet okay I hope you
all know that what I have at the bottom
of my screen are called as Excel sheets
and the entire interface is called as an
excel file so in this excel file called
chart which is opened up right now I've
got five sheets at the moment
so and the control page down and control
page of are the shortcuts to navigate
between these two sheets in the same
file okay we grant
so let's now come back to the simple
charts window friends all of you or you
just saw that I pressed f11 correct to
prepare a chart in the next worksheet
new worksheet if I would like to do that
in the same worksheet then again rather
than going to the insert tab and
searching for the chart I can simply
press alt f1 I repeat if you wish to
prepare a chart in the same worksheet
where your data lies simply select any
one cell of your choice so I can select
any one cell maybe in the M in any
column any column and I will simply
press so my cursor is now in the cell
that says product three okay and I will
now press alt f1 and I hope you guys can
see that the graph is prepared in the
sale sheet okay and microns another
question was what if we have more than
five columns well that's okay Vikram
it's absolutely okay even if you have
two columns three columns four columns
simply make sure that you select any one
cell of your choice in that data and
press either alt f1 or f/11 okay you
will just have to make sure that there
is no blank column between your data no
blank column no blank rows okay some
other people also have this habits form
of you know selecting this whole data by
doing the control shift arrow right
control shift arrow down and then they
go to the insert tab but it's not
required if your data is linear yes you
might want to do a manual selection in a
specific scenario for example your you
have sales figures okay and your maybe
you have target even for the next month
okay let us assume that this is the data
this is my datum I am selling four
different products and buy this month's
achievement is given to me in the B
column and my target for each product is
given to me in the next column okay
let's take an example 50 or 50 or maybe
in just four thirty year they can just
40 here and 20 here okay now let's take
an example that I would like to simply
prepare a chart with only the product
and the target column which means if I
want to excludable sales column in that
case I might want to simply okay now
first of all I will just delete this
chart here okay okay how do you delete
the chart simply select on the boundary
okay the boundary of the chart and press
Delete on the keyboard all right now
let's come back here again in the data I
have just added one column here which is
target like I said earlier I like like
we have done a couple of friends already
I will simply select any one cell of my
choice in the data it could be the
header it could be the actual value I
can press alt f1 and I can see that
because the default setting was done as
line this time I get the line chart I
hope you will remember last time it was
the column chart because that's the
setting by default in all versions of
Excel but because in my case I've
changed it to line it's come up with a
line chart now and the target is shown
up in the maroon line and the sales
figures are shown in the in the blue
line now if that if the chart is
supposed to be only made for just the
target and novices I can always go to
the design tab here and I can choose
this command that says select data
remember all these commands switch row
switch row/column select data change
chart type all these commands will
always be in the design tab just that in
the Excel 2007 and 10 versions you will
have it on the left hand side somewhere
and here it's the on the right hand side
anyway I go to the Select data now and
give you see can you all see it comes up
with a window that says select data
source okay it says select data source I
hope everybody can see this okay and now
since I am NOT interested in the sales
column I can simply just select that and
of course there is a tick mark for both
brackets select sales and I can say
remove and I can say okay and now you
can see that the graph is only
about one specific column okay so this
is simple information about some some
charts are you all okay with me so far
are you all able to hear me and are you
are able to see my stream properly as
well it would be great to get some
acknowledgments yeah thank you my Graham
for the acknowledgments thank you Amit
thank you yes hush money all right great
thanks minutes yeah they also thank you
all right
great so so far what you've said what
we've seen is what you've seen is f11
and odd f1 keep in mind it's applicable
to all versions of excel right and when
you have the graph prepared okay you
click on the boundary of the graph all
right and then you simply perform a
control see that is the very basic
shortcut of copying and you can simply
paste this graph in your word document
or maybe PowerPoint presentation however
please bear in mind that if you simply
do a copy and paste that is ctrl-c and
ctrl-v over there in the other document
the chart will not be dynamically
updating right if you wished to if you
wish to make it in such a way that all
changes in the Excel environment are
automatically in incorporated in the
PowerPoint of the word environment then
you will simply do a ctrl C from here
but when you go to the PowerPoint of the
word
you will go to the Home tab and you will
say paste and then you will say paste
special and then you will say paste link
okay please don't do a simple ctrl-c and
ctrl-v you might want to just do a paste
special in link if you would like it
such a way that changes here are done
there automatically right ok great
now friends again for a minute now that
I am in this line chart I would like to
go back to the design tab again okay the
design tab
okay we grant this asking a question
what is the difference between paste and
paste special paste is a simple paste
button paste special you get to choose
from various options in simple example
would be you know sometimes you want to
paste something as a formula and
sometimes you would say no no no I don't
want to paste it as a formula I want to
paste it as a value maybe you can remind
me about this when we are towards the
end of the session and we can discuss
this in details because it's not about
graphs and charts okay
all right yeah yeah but yes paste is a
simple thing in paste special is
slightly enhanced feature right okay
our friends kindly understand that you
know we only call it as a graph or a
chart but if you look at Wikipedia the
definition says a graph is just a simple
structure okay the basic thing that
comes up in front of you when you press
f11 or alt f1 is a graph however when
you modify it you know when you add data
labels or when you change axis or when
you decorate it okay to suit your
requirements then it becomes a chart and
that's why in excel it says chart
it doesn't say graph right even if you
look at this design tab here and if you
say you know it says change chart type
this is a change graph type so Microsoft
likes to use the word chart because it's
a slightly enhanced you know version of
curve okay all right I know French okay
so I am in this graph right now so chart
I have this very bad habit of saying
Kraft for sister Brie this chart okay I
select on the boundary of this chart
okay and I go to the design tab and I go
to change chart type from the right-hand
side there have been okay and now I go
to change chart type I will change it
back to column like we saw last time
there are many options available on the
left side many chart types a Rupesh
chart type is different types of charts
available to you like you can see on my
screen right now I can choose whether I
want to go with the column chart or a
line chart or a pie chart or the bouncer
on it stuff like that okay now I will go
with the column so I select this the
first one clustered column and I will
say set st called
and I will just say okay from here okay
so now I will just okay now you can see
that my chart type has been changed from
line to column okay now if you notice
the screen here you will see that I have
got four columns okay we can say
buildings skyscrapers and it's needless
to explain here that the x-axis has
taken up the names of all the products
and the y-axis is the same speakers okay
if I simply select any one of these
columns okay there are four right now I
can simply just click on any one of them
do you notice that my Excel is smart
enough to select all of these okay it's
selecting all of these right now I can
simply do a right click okay and I have
this option here that says add data
labels when I do a right click of small
window pane opens up and one of the
options out there is right so I can say
add data label and you will see that
okay now in this case do you see that
the data label is only added for the
product three so maybe when I was doing
a right click I didn't do it properly
okay I can come out I can simply just
select all the bars I can say add a
label once again and see check it out do
you see it shows the data labels for all
the bars right now okay are you guys
okay with me so for all of you I mean
it's been 30 minutes that I've been
speaking but I just want to make sure
that you guys are able to hear me and
you all are able to see my screen you
know I keep checking this because I
don't really trust the internet
connection I mean we live in the era or
internet connection
so I like to check yeah you never knows
anything can go wrong
yeah okay thank you so much ash Bonnie
the grant and oh yeah D okay thank you
wait friends generally I like to send
file you know the fine which I'm using
I'm sure even you might know some Excel
trainers who would be doing this you
know I like to send the file to the
participants but even they can practice
but since this is an open webinar we are
not sure how many registrations be able
to get in stuff like that so you know I
did not send the file earlier okay but
anyway you can also quickly prepare the
data like like the way I anyway thanks
again I click on the boundary of the of
the chart I go to the design tab again
and I go to this change chart type from
the ribbon and just a big finger I will
change it to line right now you have
already seen it gives me if I change it
to bar right now okay can you see now
okay on until you get to bar I say okay
right you see that the graph sorry the
chart has now changed in earlier it was
hiding all the names of the products as
x-axis and there were vertical columns
now that I've changed the chart type to
bar again it has now changed it's the
addition so the products have gone on
the y-axis and the values you know the
zero ten but the sales because the value
has become y-axis right so it's just a
and the columns are also now that's the
difference between the bar and call them
just opposite you know again for them if
you would like I can again click on the
boundary of this graph I will again go
to change chart type from you okay
once again I'm reminding you you friends
click on the boundary go to the design
tab and in Excel 2007 or 10 you will
have the command of change chart type on
the left side somewhere on the left side
okay all right
now I will change it to pie chart okay a
pie is like a comet okay it's not really
a donut but it's a circle basically
right so I click on the pie I say okay
from here right
do you notice that there are four
products okay product oneness
the blue color okay then there is two
which has taken up the maroon when there
is cream for product three and four
pearl or wallet whatever is this product
fool okay so what happens when it in
when you do a pie chart is it shows
percentage-wise
distribution right so that's what
happens in a pie chart at the end let's
look at one more ok one more way of
doing this okay and of course friends if
you would like to so there's a question
by speedom about changing the color
applying the color of course we can
always right-click on one of the
portions here yeah I can just do a right
click and I can go to fill I can change
the color of my choice can you see it
was purple of or violet earlier now I am
changing it to yellow the product food
right so that's how it is so you can
always do a right click and you can go
to film okay and you can do it sriram
right okay all right one more time
now let's just okay I don't really bomb
this target call them here now okay and
of course if you have more number of
products like product five six seven
eight depending on the number of
products you have your Excel will
automatically assign colors yeah okay
and of course you can do a right click
and go to fill and change the colors
okay right now I will just come here
okay they bounced who is asking a
question here it's saying that the sum
of values was yes because it was simply
picking up the figures in my column here
so one more time I said I make a graph I
make a chart here I will change the
chart type I can go back to the pie all
right and I can say okay from here right
now if you look at this just a minute
here again okay so if you look at the
screen here yes I know that you know if
you do an addition here it comes to one
one five right but remember here if you
click on figure right click and say add
data labels it is simply going to show
you whatever
they're in your D column okay so it's
not going to do this 100 and says it
shows you percentage-wise it the
distribution of the color is
percentage-wise but the values will be
shown as the way they are given to you
in your data okay again I select the
boundary of the chart I can go to the
design tab I can go to change chart type
again this time I can choose maybe XY
scatter okay see I am choosing XY scale
and say okay now French please
understand that the XY scatter
type of chart will never show you the
names of your products in the x-axis
like it was doing earlier okay this type
of chart is not really ideal for the
kind of data which I have here okay
the best example to use the XY can you
see here right now on the x-axis I've
got numbers and all then on the y-axis
I've got numbers okay and this dot here
is stirring up as 40 because my product
1 is this 40 right and then this dot
here is stopping at 27 somewhere between
25 and 37 because so the best example of
using this XY scatter chart is height
and weight of a person so maybe the
weight the weight of the person can be
plotted on the x axis and y axis can
have the height okay that's maybe
rainfall values something on those lines
right but this was just to show you okay
I think we look at one more type of
chart now and then we move to waterfall
okay so I select on the boundary of the
graph change chart type
I can go to maybe I can select area okay
I can select area right so in the area
do you see the complete portion of my
graph is shaded earlier we were having
those fallen for those bars or those
dots okay and then now we have the
complete portion which is shaded now
what happens is you know it is showing
up 40-year in the y axis itself the
beginning itself because
my product one is watered right in the
beginning here down below it comes down
here because my product 2 is 27 so
that's how you visualize you know
there's a different feel that you get
there's a different visualization for
each type of chart ok that was just a
simple you know information this was
just a very simple data ok I just taken
some products ok anyway we will again
come back to this sheet when we look at
the concept of table ok maybe we can
take another right now friends let's
look at the waterfall charts ok when you
go to the design tab and when you go to
change chart type there was no real
option that says waterfall but using the
type of charts available to us we can
create about we can mix the we can make
the chart look like what a fall chart
right so again let's press ctrl page
down can you see that I have a different
type of data here okay I mean the
information which was given to me in the
first simple chart sheet is these are
just my sales figures so I just have
some simple positive values here okay
but now if you look at my data in the
waterfall sheet I hope you can see I am
in a different sheet right now by the
name by the name waterfall okay
okay so friends now let's take an
example you that I conducted one
training program okay yes so let's
assume that in one of my training
programs I got twenty six thousand
rupees or dollars or prions whatever
deposited into my bank account right
that's my amount that's what the first
row in the data tells you right now I
realized that well to to get nominations
for this training program I had done
some advertisement in the newspaper
maybe cheap television okay and I'd
spent five thousand rupees or whatever
okay so then it's man that's my expense
but do you see her
in the same column I have been given the
the positive value as well as the
negative value can you all see this then
I realized okay well I'd also had done
some purchase of some laptops and
projectors and stuff like that for the
training so sixteen thousand was spent
on that right then I took about some
commission to vendors all right 4,000
okay and then I realize that although I
have got thirty six thousand in my bank
account I have spent up this much amount
which is five thousand sixteen thousand
and four thousand so my net profit from
this training is one thousand this is
what the data tells me are you guys okay
with this so far now what I will do is
to prepare a waterfall chart okay what I
will do is I will take assistance from
two more columns which are not really
given to me in the data okay
so let's create another column here so I
am writing in I'm typing invisible
column and I'm typing the visible color
okay
so visible column I will simply select
and I will simply copy the values given
to me in the amount column right so I
select the whole visible love column and
I press equal to I take the reference of
the cell b2 and finally I press control
enter
okay I hope all of you know
control-enter yeah not all your
solutions in Excel or are obtained by
simply pressing ctrl enter also then you
have a range selected okay all right so
my visible column is not just a
duplication of my amount column in the
invisible column I will plot figures
which are actually spent out you know
not really spender but it's a virtual
caller actually so I will start off with
a zero here okay and look at the thing
that I'm doing here now okay if you are
if you're an expert in terms of formulas
and referencing we will understand
quickly what I'm doing you equal to sum
right this is the very basic formula and
should be although that's okay right so
equal to sum now what i'm doing here is
equal to some of the values in the next
row okay I am NOT simply doing a
summation amount of all the data or
anything else I am saying submission or
the value which is given to me in c4n
people why am I doing this is something
that you will soon understand so I press
ENTER now I get this answer is 16,000
right now yeah why 16,000 right now
because there is nothing here it's a
blank cell and here we have 16,000 so
the two of them added will give you
sixteen thousand right but remember what
is my formula here my formula is
summation of the values in the next row
right so when I drag it down right now
oh by the way I don't have to drag it
here I can always do it double click
here okay so directly now do you see
that bigger changes to 21,000 okay the
reason I did this is because in the real
life scenario okay when I get this
amount in my bank account
the first reaction would be I will be
happy because I got some payment but the
next moment when I realized oh okay this
5000 amount was actually an expense okay
then my mind will tell me my mind will
quickly tell me the well the amount is
transfer s 26,000 but the actual income
is 25 10 1000 yeah that's why I used
this sum formula here and did addition
of the next two values then after some
time okay when the guy from whom I
purchased all the stuff he sends me an
invoice the day of sixteen thousand I
now realize it over here apart from the
five thousand there was another expense
of sixteen thousand so now I I will rest
my cursor in that C 4 cell which tells
me it okay the actual net income now
from this training is five thousand then
after some time somebody comes up to me
and says you know what B when even we
need to get our Commission back because
we have to getting some nominations at
blah blah blah so then that is another
expense of four thousand at the end of
the day I finally finally realize okay
from the time the money was transferred
into my bank account till the end of the
day I finally finally realized that okay
my net income was just one thousand
rupees and that's what it shows me your
is a final figure here and that's the
reason why I have made this invisible
column okay again if you are very
comfortable with your
as an thematic formulas and referencing
you would know what I'm talking about
okay anyway I have prepared this data
for myself now now what I will do is and
remember this invisible invisible
columns were not given to me in the
actual data and prepared them to be able
to make what of all chart okay now like
I said earlier I will simply select any
one cell of my choice in the data of
course I will not click mottling
somewhere outside okay in the data I
press all f1 okay now you see that this
column chart is made because the default
is set to column okay now again I will
go to this design tab like I said this
design type is like the lifeline of
chance this time I will go to the change
chart type and I will choose the one
that says if you see in the in the
column section I have this option that
says stacked column okay when you go to
the column section of your all chart
types you will see that there is this
option at number two under the column it
says stacked column okay the initial one
is a clustered column which we were
using so far the default one okay and
this one is a stacked column okay so I
select that right now okay and the
Rupesh has a question your page let's
just let me just group that okay
Rupesh says what is chart elements well
on the right side now because I am using
this excel 2013
I will have this thing here there is a
plus plus sign here it says chart
elements but let's see what's what's
there in store for us okay so I can
always do a plus and I can add data
label or I can be good do you see you so
many options coming up here okay so yeah
I had changed it to when I want to
change chart type I changed it to stack
column and that's what I want for the
waterfall so in your Excel 2007 and 10
you will see
right click on the on the skyscrapers
these buildings have these paths and
then you will get all these options but
in 13 there is this nice thing that
they've also given you can simply click
on this plus and you can say data labels
to stick mark do you see what happens
when I click on data labels it gives up
the precursors as well if I uncheck that
the figures are gone then there is
option that says data table so right
below my graph or my chart it prepares a
nice tabular structure okay so chart
elements means whatever options are
available to format your chart or to
decorate your chart okay that's what it
is it means right okay so i okay now to
page do you get my point
all of you are you okay you still give
so friends now you have seen here that
you know I've changed the column that
the chart type from clustered column to
stacked column because that's what is
ideally required for waterfall now I
will select the boundary of the chart I
go to the design tab right and I go to
this command here that says select data
okay
I will go with select data now and it
comes up with that select data source
window like we had done in one of the
examples earlier I will now remove this
amount column okay this amount column
was the one which was the amount column
was the one which was given to me
earlier okay I mean eventually and soon
now I'm sorry I'm trying to be really
low if I try to be louder than this then
my neighbors will come here you know
I'll be the problem yeah okay I hope
others are able to hear me so Anson
maybe I just fight to kind of you know
try and do some settings on my headset
here the physical headset but anyway
okay so I will come to this amount
column now and I will remove the amount
column remember we have taken assistance
from the visible and the invisible
column
to make this waterfall charge so I will
remove the actual amount column okay so
now you see how my chart is is coming up
okay
the invisible column is displayed in the
maroon bar bottom column and the visible
column is in green okay what I will do
now is I will simply select the maroon
portion of the advertising but okay I
use my mouse I click on the module
portion okay one sec I have to just
click on OK from this select data source
window okay so I simply select this
maroon and Shivan through Gupta's is to
remove the amount column we can also
uncheck yes absolutely
because not everybody is on by Excel 13
version I decided to talk about the
remove button there but even though you
are right yes okay okay so I select one
of these Amuro portions and do you
notice that all the maroon portions are
now selected the maroon portions for
advertising the maroon portion for
purchase and the module portion for
Commission everything is now selected
okay I can just come to one of these I
can do a right-click and in the film
okay in the film I will check no film
okay
in the film version I will check no film
right you see that there is no color now
applied for the maroon portion it's
there but for visible to the audience
okay and now what I will do is you still
see that I still have the advertising
the purchase and the Commission visible
columns visible okay remember they were
my expenses they were they were all
negative values the money is gone out of
my pocket or my bank account okay so
what I will do now is I will simply just
select the first one that is the
advertising one okay just the just the
just the advertising one okay so I just
go double click here okay I come in on
that bar I simply just do a double click
here and right click and again I go to
film and this time I will choose
No already won it remember it was
negative the money has gone out of my
pocket okay so it's a red one okay and
that's it now remember the purchase and
also the commission these two bars also
were my expenses today and that's why I
will simply now select the purchased one
okay and I will simply press f4 on the
keyboard
remember f4 is the shortcut for repeat
action in Excel okay not always will it
perform the task of referencing that is
applying dollars sometimes it also works
as repeat action like I did just now
yeah one more I am checking out see now
I go to the Commission okay
I select the Commission bar again I will
simply press f4 check it out so whatever
activity was done for the advertising
barn the red color is now applied to the
remaining two and that's it there goes
my waterfall chart so anybody who now
looks into this chart will say that okay
there is this 26,000 amount of credit
however there was a little bit of 5,000
then some more then some more and
finally my net income for this entire
training is just one thousand four peas
or reals okay and further like we
discussed earlier I can simply just
select these I can say add data labels
or I can go to chart elements that group
age was asking though and I can just
select some later labels so if I have it
enables it becomes all the more evident
for the person to make out the figures
rather than going to the actual data
okay are you okay with me did you all
understand this concept of waterfall
chart okay just a quick recap I created
two columns and I finally removed the
actual given amount column and I just
did some formatting to make it look like
a proper structure where I can see the
inflow and outflow of the cash are you
okay with me Thank You Santa thank you
as money for the acknowledgement now we
will go to the thermometer
chart again so let's press ctrl page
down if you look at my data you're in
the next worksheet which is thermometer
okay do you notice oh okay um it says
why is it called the waterfall chart
well I'm not sure buying Microsoft named
it as a micro as a waterfall chart
actually you know it's not a real
waterfall like you would see in a nice
space okay but these are just my new two
waterfalls you know there's a section of
outflow going that's why yes ash money
like you said it's small waterfalls yes
right yeah so don't go by the real sense
the meaning of the term okay your
English meanings can be different from
your Excel oh geez okay
Oh French have you all set can I go to
this next one this thermo video chart
okay here I have been given some sales
figures and some target values okay now
remember in this case all the target for
every month is 350 okay and in some
months my team has achieved in some
months my team has not achieved okay
like you can see for the month of jan
was 350 yeah it was not achieved yeah it
was for performance but in the fact
there was good it was good of 7-9 right
now the first thing is I will simply
select any one cell of my choice
I press alt f1 again so it gives me that
default column chart again I go to
design so this is just a basic graph
which I've got but now I will make it a
chance if I go to design I go to change
chart type and now this time friends
what I will do is I will not really
change the type okay let me of course we
can create a thermometer chart with
other different options also the
simplest method that I like to do here
is this I'll not change again do you see
that all my sales figures are shown up
in blue
and the target is shown up in Maru okay
and in some other cases you might have a
scenario where the targets are also
different for each month but in this
case have taken an example where I've
kept the same target okay all right so
now I will simply just select one of
these blue bars okay those are my actual
achieved it sales figures right click
and I might want to do format data
series and I can just go to the fill
option here and I can just change the
color just a minute this this this
online nerve webinar Emily's sister is
doing here but just a minute okay so I
go to the Phil Phil okay and I will now
change it to Ruby she wants to know the
data will automatically refresh when we
yes absolutely absolutely yes so for
example before I move on I will show it
to you for the month of June it was one
to seven let's make it through to seven
okay and you will see here in this much
of this portion here you will see this
portion here okay check it out I press
ENTER and quickly the bar raises okay if
I do a quick control said that is undo
it moves back yes as soon as you make
the changes in your Excel data the graph
will change okay okay so yes I will
select the how would he call the sales
bars right click and I will say Phil and
I like the black color okay so I'll take
the black color so for the sales I am
taking black okay now I will also go to
the maroon bars again right click I will
say format data series in Excel 13 I
already have the windowpane that comes
on the right-hand side but for other
versions it's always do a right click
format data series now I will do is now
do you see on the right side on my
screen right now okay there is this
thing that comes up
it says plot series on and now I have
selected the target portion the Burgman
portion I will plot this on secondary
axis so I click on secondary axis okay
all
so there is an option here that says gap
width now because the sales and the
target bars are placed in one single
chart there is a lot of mess that's
happening and it's not very clear again
so I in the gap width portion again I
will just make it from it's gonna be
showing me as two one nine percent I can
always change it to maybe fifty percent
okay so I have just modified the gap
width okay also I will go to the color
the fill
okay and in the solid now whatever I am
doing now is for the target okay for the
sales I have only simply changed the
color to black but for the for a target
bars I am doing the activity with
hostess I plot that on the secondary
axis then I also did something with the
gap width that is I've made it to fifty
percent now I will come to solid fill
and maybe I can take a blue color here
for the target and in the transparency I
will make it fifty percent yeah I hope
you all can see whatever big changes I
am doing there in the format data series
window they are all they're all
happening in the actual graph okay
Shanta wants to know what is secondary
axis well in the graph you have both
primary and secondary axis sometimes you
might also have more axis but general
you have the first and second when you
prepare a column chart by D in this case
because I have two different categories
there is sales and target my Excel
automatically plotted this entire graph
on this one single axis to show but
because there is one column called sales
and because there is another column for
target and because I did not want to
mess it up I purposely plotted I
purposely plotted the sales in the
primary axis and the target on the
secondary axis for a better
visualization and Shantha you will now
see that I am not changing the
transparency to 50% okay I press ENTER
here okay
I can order this whole thing do you see
yes like we're borrowin Bhandari has
already acknowledged I already have the
thermometer charger
simply had to just do some formatting
for the target the balloon portion I
changed the gap width I did something
with the transparency I also importantly
I did plot the on the secondary okay
axis and now one final thing that I will
now need to do is select the secondary
axis from here the actual graph okay
select the secondary axis from here and
press the Delete key on my keyboard and
I am done okay just one minute French
okay yes I select the secondary axis
this one
the place where my circles are blinking
right now okay I will come here oops I
think with Mike my delete okay I come
here and yes can you see this match I
will just delete that and there goes my
actual thermometer chart can you see all
target values are at the same level and
the buildings the skyscrapers of the
sales up and down dependent of the
actual data okay friends now we will
look at an important okay Rupesh has a
question can we change the color of
sales bar yeah of course yeah I mean I
mean you can always take any different
color
I took black but you can take anything I
mean for a thermometer chart it's always
good to have a compression like blue and
black that's why I did that
okay and in this case you will see that
all the targets are at the same level
that's why you have all the buildings of
targets same the slightly fade the
transparent the buildings okay all right
now friends we will look at an Varun
says by simply deleting that secondary
axis we have matched the scale of both
devices yes for room that's right
that was my whole intention of deleting
the I just took assistance like a very
selfish person only to make the chart
I took assistance from the secondary
axis but when I was done I did believe
that just simply to match the scale of
both the axis okay thanks for Ron and
for the addition there good point
okay big Ron says just a reminder about
the paste special example yes the grants
are as
you remind me later but we just have got
seven minutes now of course we can
extend the session a bit but let's get
done with the histogram first there's
this last sheet which is pending yeah
okay so let's just finish off with the
cover of says was it compulsory to add
secondary axis yes go rough because I
was interested in the thermometer chart
I like like in the earlier case where
for the waterfall chart it is required
to have an extra assistance of extra
columns to manage your positive and
negative values here also it was
imperative for me to do that that's how
the thermometer chart is made yes okay
all right now I think we will move to
the histogram okay so let's come to the
histogram worksheet yeah friends I might
not be able to answer all your questions
because I mean I was told there are
close to 300 registrants of course not
everybody makes it to the webinar but
because we have just a one-hour session
it becomes difficult to quickly check in
the questions window and then redo the
question in the answer in the real life
cross flu environment you simply have
the person standing up or reasoning is N
and asking your question here you have
to make sure as a trainer to go down to
the questions window and redo the
question and then so I'll try my level
best in fact so far I have done it I
tried my best to answer all questions
but if I have not kindly here excuse me
for that
anyway friends histogram is what I have
here okay now in all your Excel sheets
that you are working on whichever
version you are you have this histogram
again there is an atom that needs to be
initialized okay
you cannot simply see the histogram
option available in your Excel ribbon I
mean if you go to the Home tab insert
and it's not there okay let's see how to
enable that okay so you go to the file
tab in Excel 13 or 10 or if you are on
Excel 2007 you have the office button
just top left okay go
you have options Excel options okay here
the place where my circles are blinking
okay
in the options again you will see that I
have this add-ins towards the extreme
end of that several categories have
add-ins
second-last in the add-ins again in the
add-ins I will go through Excel add-ins
at the bottom here and I'll say go okay
I am clicking on go when I say go
it opens up a window that says add-ins
and from here I need to make sure that
the analysis toolpak is activated now in
my case the tick mark is there already
so I will simply say ok now and now when
I go to my data tab okay in the Excel
ribbon half of this data tab correct so
in the data tab on the extreme extreme
extreme right hand side I have this data
analysis Eden which I have just
initialized it's free it's it just needs
to be visualized it's already there in
your Excel it's programmed this is to be
initialized and it's not a third party I
don't mind you okay so I have now
initialized this data analysis all right
I didn't and now let's see now I have
been given these scores here you can see
these are sales figures or some points
or some creative whatever okay and the
second column is my range so I want to
see how many scores are there in the a
column which are between 0 to 20 okay
how many are between 21 to 40 that's
what the B column specifies its a range
so 0 to 20 21 to 40 41 to 60 61 to ad
and then 81 and more anything about 80
okay so this B column is my range and
for an histogram analysis you have to
make sure that this range column is
sorted in ascending order
okay so in my case right now I have
already made sure that it's sorted in
ascending order
okay now I will go to this data okay and
I will go to this data analysis all
right
in the data analysis I've got so many
options to choose
I can always use this cruller okay bring
all this type h-hi again or just a
simple edge and it highlights histogram
for me are you looking to be so far yeah
I know there are just three minutes
remaining
so my flight is not on time so it's okay
so it is can you will see this I went to
my data I went to data analysis and then
I went to histogram and I say okay right
now when I say okay on histogram do you
realize that I get a window that says
histogram okay so now it says input
range where is my input range the column
which is already given to be the data
column the score column whatever the
first with the actual column now I will
select it along with the header I just
do a simple control shift down arrow
okay to select the whole column next it
says bin range this second column is my
bin range
okay pin means my range okay so bin
range right now because I have selected
the headers also when doing the
selection of both these columns I will
make sure that I also take mark on these
on the labels the labels okay all right
now of course in your data if there is
no labels
there's no heading there's no header
then you can always ignore this tick
mark don't do that tick mark then but
normally it's always good to have some
headers for your data so you will take
mark on the labels now it says output
range okay now you can simply just
decide oh sorry I just I just yeah okay
in the output range okay I will decide
where I would like to have the output of
this data the actual histogram table and
the histogram chart where do I want it
to be displayed so if it is in the same
worksheet I can randomly select any one
set of my choice
can you see this right now I'm I'm
selecting e to if you want to have this
output
in a new worksheet obviously you will
select this new worksheet okay but right
and automatically when you press ok a
new sheet will be prepared showing the
histogram right now I will clip it to
output range as something in the e2 of
this same Excel spreadsheet okay
same sheet maybe okay and finally I will
also take mark on chart output okay
that's it and finally one last step is
okay yeah and there you go friends can
you see there is a table which is
created in the EMF column which talks
about how many scores are there in the
range of all the categories so it says 0
to 20 there is no score so it says zero
okay and the same information is
displayed in your actual histogram you
see this so not like in the normal bar
chart or a column chart it will not
display the actual figure as 21 or 71 or
40 it counts how many scores are there
in that range and range wise the columns
are displayed yeah
21 to 40 there are three scores that's
why for the range that says 40 if the
building is only up to number 3 then
from 41 to see the resist so depending
on the tabular data which is prepared
here the histogram is also prepared
Cheban through as a question your
shriven through says can be changed
range range like zero and of course
chill and row you will have before you
start off with your data analysis you
will you know write down your ranges
here so you know I have taken zero to 20
you might want to take 0 to 35 so in
your case you will make this first sale
35 then your next range you might want
it to happen as 36 to 70 then you will
write 30 year in the B to sell and then
70 or in the next set so yes of course
but please make sure that the range
column that is the B column is ascending
order sorted okay Shanta Jai Kumar has a
question she says I'm not sure whether
your a she or a he I'm sorry but shun
'this is why it says more
against and to against it well Santa do
you see that my range that I had defined
in my case the highest possible figure
that had taken was 80 after 80 I have
not specified anything in the cell b6 so
Excel doesn't understand whether I want
to go up to 90 that is whether I want 81
to 90 or 81 to 95 for 81 200 or 81 to
what what what upgrade be I have not
specified that to excel that's why
anything above 80 is shown up as mode
did you get my points on them okay great
superb
yeah so like I said I know you have to
make sure you know that this B column
the BIM column the range column is
depending on what are your range is what
categories do want to make you will say
0 to 10 then 11 to 20 then 330 forever
so you define that but make sure that
it's in the ascending order itself
smallest to largest okay
French another thing I will just quickly
talk about here are you guys okay with
me so far
is everybody okay with me so far I can
see there are some 30 participants right
now are you all okay with me the notes
come on thank you Robert through page
thank you so much okay great French I
will simply prepare another really quick
data here okay I love I love cricket
so let us take an example and taking
data of cricket batsman right so the
name of my player have your API of
batsmen one okay even I can take some of
the people from your itself so I will
take a myth we have a mid-engine here
you have to know
Kumar here we have Ashe one year we have
she been dragged up tired okay so I'm
just taking all of your names let's
assume you basil
let's also put my own name your star
player right okay all right and then I
have a score column here now I am NOT
going to put the score manually I will
ask Excel to perform this task for me
with a better formula so any score
between 10 to 99 is okay let's assume we
are finger-like 10 over match so you
can't score at century all right that's
okay so then I have got these figures
now and oh wow
Excel likes Shivan drew she members got
the highest score 93 cash money is what
52 okay great now friends I will simply
make a graph out of this by pressing alt
f1 I think this was very basic we
discussed right in the beginning and you
have the column graph column chart
prepared there okay in this stage I will
simply called as a craft was the very
simple thing okay now let's take an
example that another player is added
okay so let's take an example
drew page is also one of the batsmen
batsmen in our team Rupesh is also
edited okay and I am giving some code to
the page now do you all see that my
excel is not incorporating Roo page in
the graph now can you see this it's only
showing from a month to ambarish just
the first five batsmen can you all see
this because I of course you know like
like somebody had asked me earlier what
if I make change in the existing later
of course if I make change in the
existing later so for example for node
if I make it from 13 if I make it to 34
quickly the graph changes however when I
add a new person it is not adding in the
graph do you will see that friends okay
now to solve this problem lot of
corporate users of excel what the do is
they go to the design tab and then they
go to select data and from your they
keep changing the rage my problem is you
can't keep doing that always when you
have more and more players being added
in your data make more and more lows
being added in your data can't keep
doing that okay
that's why friends I will just say
delete on this graph okay I'm not okay
with this elite okay now I come back to
my original data okay and in the
original data before I press f1 I will
use a wonderful feature called table a
wonderful feature of Excel called
table select any one cell of your choice
in the data go to the insert tab
insert okay and right here just on the
left side somewhere and they insert
you've got this wonderful thing called
table okay the shortcut for that is
control tea tea for table okay so either
you go to insert tab and press table
like this and then say okay from this
window or you simply press control at T
and press okay from this window do you
see that your excel data has now changed
into a nice blue and white formatting
along with the header in pooled and even
there and you know so do you see now
it's a slightly better way of looking at
it now okay now I will make the graph by
pressing alt f1 okay whatever that is
because it was not allowing me to
incorporate my new lose in the in the
chart or the graph okay I have converted
my given data into a feature of Excel
called table and now I will make the
graph so alt f1 check it out okay I get
the graph now and now you see the magic
of this wonderful feature called table I
will add another person now okay so I
think we can't Gupta is not added as yet
I simply add a background I press ENTER
and see he is added in the check it out
I do not have to do anything I don't
have to manually drag the data I don't
have to go to the design tab yeah we can
have the same wonderful when we grant
are you saying wonderful because your
name is added because you like this
feature called table
okay and not just for your saying both
okay wonderful right friends are you
okay with me so far
right all of you are you able to
understand this okay
and not just for addition of rows even
if I add another column so let's take an
example I already have a score column
that the batting score maybe I have
another column your dad says wickets
okay wickets right check it out
maybe when death has taken just a couple
of tickets maybe three right so let's
say you know the batsman right so we'll
have less number of bigots cannot be
taking 50 20 minutes okay the new comer
says good use of dynamic table and
charge school number
Thank You shant Ajith Kumar says Wow
great okay yeah thank you so much guys
thank you so much right Lucy even the
wickets are getting added in the maroon
okay
the Quran says we use 2003 in office
hope I can still make no immigrant no
2003 Excel will not have all the
features whatever I discussed here most
of them are applicable to 2007 10 and 13
but not many features will be available
in Excel 2003 you might want to
introduce your IT your head of the
company to me I will ask him to get you
the 13 version okay okay
right so friends I hope it was useful
session yeah though she says mice thank
you for the information session Oh
becomes a space special okay Mary pick
really quick did not waste much time on
that okay the grant for you Ashwin Kumar
says thank you so much just a minute I'm
getting one of responses now okay wait
wait friends okay um it's thank you so
much
right very love these sessions is
voltage thank you okay could you have a
session on conditional formatting volume
C's well borrowed now in fact my very
second session with this Federica was on
conditional formatting so you might want
to request them to have another one like
this this session which we had put in we
had one session already about data
visualization all these graphs but
because of public demand let's be really
difficult for you I will just make an
example of paste special okay they bound
shoes is just a minute friends let me
read all your comments I mean okay I
can't even say one by one here because
you guys are all acting it and you the
bounce you says which we could download
this session for a reference while
practicing well they weren't you yes
ideally I do that in all my session
but this was a one baby now it's
difficult to know who all are coming and
how many are coming also you never know
some unwanted people also might come
okay so they want so it's not really
