welcome to the series of introductory
videos on ServiceNow from Eddie Riga in
this video today we are going to cover a
basic tutorial on ServiceNow revisiting
what is cloud various types of clouds
event more on the various cloud
deployment models which we discuss on
our first video on what is ServiceNow
and a bit more understanding on the
various enterprise offerings that
ServiceNow gives in terms of products
and the various applications related to
it so today this is our agenda so from
the basics on the cloud which we already
had time to discuss on our initial video
we would go buy a cloud based offering
is used and what are the benefits of
going with cloud and what are the
various ways in which the cloud model
can be taken forward the cloud computing
is one of the de-facto terms in the tech
world these days so it is always good to
know the various deployment models that
cloud based computing models in
enterprises are based upon and and a
simple introduction on what is
ServiceNow which we already got to cover
on the introductory video but still we
can go through it in detail so that we
get an understanding of the offerings
that ServiceNow as an application gives
what are the various products and what
are the different areas in an enterprise
service now capable T's really touch
with all that being said we would go
into the service know website we would
go into details of where you can see the
various product offerings from service
now and as we understood from our
initial video if we get to have a demo
instance in ServiceNow as a system
administrator of ServiceNow there are a
set of out-of-the-box applications that
we get to see in ServiceNow and we will
try to relate what we see in terms of
the products and the applications on
ServiceNow website into the demo model
or the day
application that we are having an access
to in ServiceNow so with that being said
on what to expect on today's video let's
deep dive onto what are the benefits of
using a cloud cloud being a de-facto
term these days in enterprise
applications we already know that cloud
is a model where the infrastructure and
all the hardware needs required to host
a particular service would have already
been taken care by the provider as an in
our case which is ServiceNow so how does
that help the customer or the consumer
who is consuming the service now it is
beneficial in many aspects one of the
main aspect is the lower cost of
ownership what does that mean well cloud
as a model when it is delivered to a
customer all the infrastructure and all
the hardware needs including the network
connectivity and everything is
completely taken care by the company
that hosts a cloud now how does that
differ from a legacy model of hosting
applications on the premises when we say
premised based model we know it is not
just the application the software code
and the functionality that exists on the
side of the customer it also includes
all the hardware needs the
infrastructure needs that is required to
host the application at the customer so
imagine an application like Gmail and if
Gmail is such an application that was
based on promise how could it be looking
like it would be in such a way that you
just do not have to open the browser and
check through the emails and whether it
is working in terms of functionality you
also need to have the servers and all
the storage and the network related
requirements needing to be taken care at
the side of the customer itself so
rather than having the user or the
customer having to take care of just the
application and its functionality the
customer would have to take care of the
infrastructure need as well so there and
by which it brings down a lower cost of
ownership which meaning the customer can
now really focus on solving the business
problems rather than trying to fight out
on the issues that would happen on
having the infrastructure at their own
end and along with that we can easily
connect the part of productivity
anywhere practically anywhere means it
just does not provide the application
and its functionality on one particular
device it helps in there by giving a
seamless experience of having different
kinds of devices being supported now
the enterprises these days having to
have quick responses and faster customer
service ability requires them to have
their employees to be able to support
the service on a global model which
basically means it's not within the
premises of the offices alone that they
need the application to be accessible
they needed to be accessible outside the
office as well so this means the part of
having to take care of the applications
and it's the deliverability in terms of
the devices are taken care by the
company that hosts the cloud as an in
this case service now you can very well
see when you open an instance of
ServiceNow that you can use it on any
kind of device may it be mobile devices
or desktop devices now the cloud gives a
lot of flexibility as well and this
flexibility is something that we would
get to understand when we deep dive into
some of the types of clouds the various
deployment models you know there might
be a lot of question that might be
arising in your mind when you're
thinking okay I understand that the
cloud is something that exists at the
end of the place where the product is
being hosted so can't I have my own
place where you know I need my data to
be secure well that is something which
is a
valid question and we will go into it in
detail so with that being said on how
the cloud is beneficial and now that we
know what is a cloud we will go into the
model of various cloud computing related
aspects which would help us in
understanding how ServiceNow can fit in
into these various different models so
the cloud as we mentioned can be hosted
in three different ways when we say
hosting hosting is a very simple term
that we use these days the deployment
models can be a combination of the
resources being using the infrastructure
on the side of the service provider as
well as the customer end so based on
these combinations we have three major
deployment models one is called the
public cloud the other is a private
cloud and the hybrid cloud meaning it
would be a combination of both public
and private so you might have already
understood these terms from the meaning
of the first word public hybrid or
private being used in the models let's
go in a bit of details and understand
what they mean public cloud have their
own resources being hosted over the
internet a classic example is any kind
of SAS application that you see like
what you see on ServiceNow or Gmail you
do not have any of the resources at your
end all you need is just a browser and
the part of the resources including the
mail server in the case of Gmail and the
servers and the application servers the
database and the network and the load
balancers are all based on the providers
promises they are not existing on the
customer side so as you can see the
hardware the bandwidth cost and the
application servers they are all covered
by the provider itself so what you get
is what you pay for in the case of a
public model in the case of a private
cloud this is a need wherein some of the
big organizations have statutory or
secure
requirements where they need the part of
the data or some part of the
applications even existing at the side
of the customer itself so in this case
we would have a limited number of
services being hosted at the end of the
company who's using the cloud service so
this is so that it can bring down very
many security concerns that may arise
due to the part that the data that they
are retrieving comes across the internet
so private cloud is nothing but a simple
model where and all the resources
required for a cloud is hosted under the
company's premised itself now what is
the hybrid model we can already
understand that this is a combination of
private and premised based service now I
can give you a simple example of a
hybrid cloud methodology in very many
countries where there are government
regulations so as to ensure that certain
sets of data when it really comes to the
part of privacy they require to be
hosted inside or within the country
itself so a particular company existing
within a particular premised on that
security is a major concern when it
comes to regulations of that country
they would go ahead with a model where
in the data storage and the services or
some part of the services that require
them to have the hosting inside their
own country would build a private cloud
for that part of the requirement and
every other part of the requirement
which has their data and services that
need not to be coming under the purview
of the premise of the country they could
have very well that part of the cloud
being hosted on the public or the
intranet or in simple terms the service
providers promise so this helps in
leveraging basically the best of both
worlds so these are the various three
models of deployment and cloud public
private and hybrid now that we
understand about cloud its various
deployment models
let's revisit what we already discussed
in our first video it is nothing but the
types of cloud services now that we
already know cloud services are services
that are offered through the cloud let
us understand what are the various types
of offerings or what we call as a
service models in cloud service
currently we have in the cloud world
three different types of asset services
being majorly talked about these are SAS
software as a service pass platform as a
service and IAS which is infrastructure
as a service what is a SAS cloud service
model well SAS is something that stands
for software as a service this basically
means that you have the application or
the software being delivered across to
the customer on the cloud and this is on
the basis of the demand from the
customer here the part where the
customer uses the software is totally
hosted at the service provider and a
classic example for a SAS model is Gmail
given from Google and all the different
applications that Google provides like
Gmail are similar examples in the case
of SAS so who uses a SAS well they're
basically simple end users or the end
customers who are basically interested
in the functionality of a particular
software in the case of Gmail
they are email users in the case of
Google word or Google product to tea
based applications they are the
productivity users now let's go into the
next model which is pass pass stands for
platform as a service here in this case
the end users are slightly of the
complicated end meaning there are users
which are more of power users these are
people who need the platform's
capability which helps in developing or
probably customizing an application
which is already being provided so
service now
a platform like Salesforce is a classic
example of pass pass on top of what is
already being delivered as a software in
the case of a SAS will have capable
these enough to basically change or
develop applications on top of the
existing as a service so in order to
understand the past model a system
administrator who is logged into a
ServiceNow instance making a change on
an existing application is a simple
example of a day-to-day activity done on
a pass based platform so that being said
let's go into the other model which
although is not much in our context
would definitely help us understand more
of advanced concepts and cloud services
so infrastructure as a service do not
just provide the SAS and pass alone it
may have even the infrastructure side
being delivered as a service what are
the classic examples of
IaaS classic example of IAS could be a
combination of various capabilities of
an infrastructure like storage
virtualization which you might have
heard these days using software's like
VMware and in terms of networking
capabilities like load balancing or CD
ends our classic example of IAS model so
IAS model is something that gives the
complete stack as a service including
the infrastructure so you can say IAS is
something that encapsulate all the types
of as a service like SAS and pass into
it
so as an end user of an IAS you would be
somebody like a system administrator or
a network engineer or an administrator
who might be taking care of various
infrastructure elements for the needs of
the enterprise with that being said
let's start or revisit on what is
service now I believe we have already
discussed
what is ServiceNow and its area of as a
service model ServiceNow being a company
which based its idea long back itself on
the cloud-based methodology was found by
Fred Larry and ServiceNow is a platform
which supports most of IT business
processes and service management related
processes for the enterprise ServiceNow
as a pass has a lot of capabilities it
has capabilities varying from the
applications or the products required in
an IT organization to various
capabilities that helps to enhance the
delivery of IT to the end users this
includes platform capabilities like
performance analytics security and
better user experiences as a platform it
provides an application development
environment as well and all of this is
still provided or means of just a
browser through Internet now with that
being said let's deep dive into the
various areas of services that
ServiceNow delivers a cross and the
various applications along with a
high-level overview so that we
understand what are the capabilities of
ServiceNow or what are the value-adds
ServiceNow provides through its products
here we see a high-level overview of the
ServiceNow suit of products slash
services and its various applications we
are going to have today top-to-bottom
approach on how to understand the
various capabilities of ServiceNow and
its products here in this diagram you
can see the areas of capabilities
ServiceNow has serviced now although it
started with IT as an ad alone has
brought its capabilities across other
areas which are quintessential in a huge
enterprise so IT having it's different
applications like IT Service Management
IT operations management IT business
management delivers these products
through a set of applications where
we would be going into detail through
our subsequent videos service now
understanding the importance of security
has also gone into various products and
applications in the security area
through GRC which is governance risk and
compliance and security operations now
customer service management or the end
user management is one of the critical
capabilities that ServiceNow identified
to be delivered across for 360 degree
view of service so customer service
management is another product which is
being offered by ServiceNow ServiceNow
also understood within an organization
it's not just the end users who are the
part of the model they include even the
employees of within an organization
requiring to have better experience so
through the HR or the HR service
delivery suit they have provided
applications and capabilities for that
as well and the business apps part is
the part which leverages more on the
capabilities of a platform which we can
already see in the now platform area
here now platform is a new name given by
ServiceNow for the platform capabilities
of ServiceNow so in the now platform you
can see various areas that being said we
already had discussed some of these
simple areas on our initial video so
capabilities like knowledge management
Service Catalog workflow management and
various developer tools are part of the
capability of the ServiceNow platform or
what we call now the now platform the
intelligent automation engine of now
platform also includes various advanced
analytics and data science based
applications and capabilities and they
include even predictive modeling anomaly
detection and performance forecasting
the non-stop cloud aspect of service now
basically deep dives into various areas
that ServiceNow supports the
organization beast
in terms of scalability security and
availability now that we understand on a
high level the various capabilities of
ServiceNow products and the alias of
products let's deep down and understand
some of the capabilities with respect to
various areas that ServiceNow offers for
most we will go into IT Service
Management as the suit of applications
our capability so is now provide in
simple terms IT Service Management
refers to the entirety of activities or
the various policies and structure
processes or procedures that is
performed by the organization to
appropriately deliver the IT services to
the customers well the implementation of
IT services meet customer needs and it
is performed through various IT service
providers or applications and with the
appropriate mix of the process IT and
people now what will high tea service
management suit help in especially from
ServiceNow it helps by consolidating it
in the cloud without not having to again
take care of the infrastructure needs
for it but you can rather get busy on
solving the business problems rather
than sorting the infrastructure issues
it helps there by aligning the IT
services with the business they're in by
increasing the efficiency and once the
whole platform provides its capabilities
across the platform it helps in gaining
better visibility across the application
now IT service management process and
organization especially the process that
are more of workflow driven can benefit
significantly from being supported with
specialized software tools now the ITSM
suit are basically set of tools or
applications or processes which mostly
use workflow based management systems as
we already know the now plat
has the capability of workflow based
system it really helps in taking the IT
service management application a bit
more on the top-notch quality IT
operations management is another area of
software as a service delivered by
ServiceNow operations in simple terms as
we all know is something that is on a
proactive basis on a reactive basis
taken care so as to meet the business
needs are the runtime of the business IT
om which is the item software is
intended to represent all the tools
needed to manage and provision the
various parts of capacity performance
and availability in terms of computing
and infrastructure so various parts of
item are actually delivered through the
various sort of applications ServiceNow
provides in the IT operation management
include event management which helps in
the operations or the command center
people to look at various events that
affect the business CMDB which is an
essential part in understanding the
services and how they are mapped inside
an enterprise and how they are all
associated in order to understand the
various impact a particular event or an
outage has so idea operation management
in simple terms help in improving
availability it increases the agility
and the visibility across the
organizational capabilities next up is
IT business management IT and business
were two different terms that used to be
used in such a fashion that they were
two different worlds altogether times
have changed and the enterprise these
days consider not just aligning IT with
business but I teen itself has become a
business so operating IT more like a
business has become the de-facto need
these days
so getting a visibility into the various
projects and having a better control
through different insights on the
finance and how the service of IT is
being delivered has become not just a
good to have functionality it's a
must-have for organizations to better
deliver so with that being understood
service now through its IT business
management sheer of applications support
organizational goals that helps run IT
like a business it helps them improve
the cost and financial related aspects
it helps in aligning IT with the direct
business goals it helps in optimizing
the various offerings and portfolio of
an application it very well also helps
in improving the quality of a project
and the speed at which it is being
delivered
Heidi business management has a suit of
applications that range from demand
management resource management even
project and portfolio management and in
the case of test management there is an
application named test management ladies
financial related applications called
financial reporting and financial
planning and cost management as well
next up is software asset management we
know that more of the IT budgets and the
business around in it can represent to
something which is very complicated
software asset management helps in
enabling organizations to have a single
source of information or a single system
of action that helps in transforming the
software assets and what is being
practiced through them into an audit
ready and the optimized licensed system
software asset management basically
helps in doing that thereby it helps the
organization to have a lot of the
compliance related part being automated
they do not have to need on a day-to-day
basis go into the system
and do the necessary checks on the
compliance manually and the software
inventory becomes something that is
managed on a automated basis through
various engines basically looking at the
details of software currently being used
and the licenses associated with being
them managed so now that we have gone
through software asset management has
issued of product being delivered by
ServiceNow our next set of product in
ServiceNow is performance analytics
performance analytics helps in picturing
the data in the hands of the SMEs and
the corresponding stakeholders in a
meaningful fashion that helps them take
critical actions that helps them aligned
with the business goals it also helps
them in improvement of the current
services that are being delivered across
it helps them in understanding the
various aspects that could be automated
and could that very well be made
self-service it helps in various
prioritizations it helps in the outcomes
to come in a faster fashion so in simple
terms performance analytics helps the
business come up with insights which are
actionable and helps in reducing cost
and increasing efficiency so performance
analytics is something that helps in
anticipating new trends in the current
fashion of working and Health's in
aligning service with better and finer
business goals next up is security
operations security and operations used
to be two different terms that used to
be used in in olden times in the newer
organizational aspect security first is
the approach that most of the
enterprise's go ahead with so that
requires the enterprise to have a
capability that helps in responding to
various security threats and
vulnerabilities on a faster fashion the
security operation suit of
applications from ServiceNow helps in
building an intelligent workflow helps
in automating and orchestrating various
security issues inside an organization
and run the operations of security in a
better fashion so that the security and
the IT is well connected it also helps
in the security team respond and work on
a workflow based approach so security
operations helps in building a better
connection between the security aspect
and the IT aspect and they basically
help in the ability to have better
response speed and efficiency HR within
a company is a important aspect the ease
of use and the ease of being able to
navigate within an enterprise is
something that keeps the employees on
their toes and helps them through their
productivity HR service delivery set of
products or suit of applications from
ServiceNow is an integrated suit that
helps in customer like experience
through various portals and cell service
requests provided through the HR service
delivery it thereby helps in employee
satisfaction helps the HR to work more
effectively it helps to ease new
employee joining an organization and
delivering the enterprise service more
efficiently customer service management
is the next suit of product or
applications provided by ServiceNow now
this from the word customer itself we
can understand is something that is
targeted for the customer satisfaction
it helps through the platform
capabilities like connect and chat like
capabilities provide more often
interactive and easy to use customer
service experiences and it also helps
various departments inside an
organization to interact more easily on
a customer centric approach this will
definitely help in reducing various cost
that comes in associated with various
services being delivered
and it is delivered through various set
of applications through case management
through intelligent routing it helps a
field service management and through set
of other applications like issue
resolution performance analytics and
operational intelligence so customer
service management helps in increased
customer satisfaction it helps in
reducing the cost associated with
delivering a service where the various
organizational capabilities are brought
together and bringing a better customer
service experience the next suit or the
last sort of products that we're gonna
discuss today is the governance risk and
compliance and service now through the
governance or the GRC application helps
to transform most of the processes which
I'm not that efficient by extending the
enterprise to more of work on a unified
approach in terms of various governance
and compliance issues so this is brought
through various continuous monitoring
and prioritization and the platform
through its automation capabilities
helps in responding to various risks and
so risk management is one of the
applications that come as part of these
set of products and policy and
compliance management is another set and
obviously the platform capabilities like
performance analytics works closely with
this product audit management and vendor
risk management being one of the other
set of applications that ServiceNow
delivers in its governance risk and
compliance suit this helps in bringing
down the burden that used to be more of
a disparate organizational capability it
helps in prioritizing many critical
risks that the organization faces as
well so with that being discussed on the
ServiceNow products and capabilities
let's go through some demonstration on
the various products offered from
ServiceNow
we might as well go through in detail
through our development instance which
we have procured to see the various
applications in ServiceNow the
ServiceNow system of applications as we
already discussed delivers across
various areas like IT security customer
service HR and business applications
down below you can see the now platform
and its various capabilities along with
the non-stop cloud capabilities let us
go and see the various capabilities that
are provided to IT in the IT Service
Management suit of products the
ServiceNow suit of products in IT
Service Management has all these various
applications namely incident management
problem management change release
management so forth available as part of
the platform now similarly you can see
other products and their corresponding
applications and capabilities as well so
now if you go to the products page of
service no coms slash products you can
see all these capabilities as something
that you would see on this area and for
example IT Service Management in
incident management is something that
you can see once you log into the
ServiceNow instance which is already
available so when you give incident on
the left navigation or the application
navigator you might see incident
management application and its various
capabilities across now these are
something that are available as part of
the out-of-the-box which means when you
have your ServiceNow instance and the
first go you would have them already
available or shown for example in our
case in the IT Service Management Europe
application we already saw that incident
management was one of those applications
when we give incident on the left
navigator we would see all the
capabilities related to incident
management basically shown on the left
side now these set of applications that
you see on the Left navigation are
something which is made active or
enabled by ServiceNow by default which
means when you get this service now
out-of-the-box application provisioned
across you would see some or most of the
applications available as we saw in the
set of products in IT Service Management
suit
these are incident management problem
management change release management and
so forth so if you are looking for the
problem management application you might
as well very will see that the left
navigation by typing problem now there
could be cases where there are products
which are new and which are not part of
the out-of-the-box these are some things
although made available by ServiceNow
would need separate licenses or
subscription to access a classic example
would be the ServiceNow security set of
applications for example security
operations has a set of applications or
capabilities that comes and helps in
security incident response now those
kind of capabilities are not something
that when you type on the left
navigation that you would be able to
immediately see in order to see that
what you would do is you would go to the
system plugins in order to go to the
system plugins you would go to plugins
by typing plugins on the Left navigation
and under system definition under
plugins you would see various plugins
available and in the list of plugins you
can see the ones which are active and
which are inactive the various set of
applications and sort of applications
provided by ServiceNow are what you
would enable or disable accordance to
your need and subscription and license
from the system plugins minim in this
current scenario we are going to enable
the security incident response as and
when you search for security you would
see all the various applications or the
plugins that contain security in them
you can see security incident response
has something which is inactive in
ServiceNow
and when you click you would see that
the activation of plugin will help in
all these various parts of the security
incident response the help page for that
particular plugin would be very well
available through the dark start service
now.com link and as you can see from the
description that this is a plug-in if
then used for an enterprise in its
production would require a separate
license now as this is a demo instance
you can very well go in and activate it
while activating it you would see the
various dependencies for this plug-in as
in this case you can see security
support orchestration security service
management core tasks outlets
relationship tree map web cab HTML to
PDF are various dependencies although
you do not have to take care of all of
these manually all you need to do is
just click on activate in case if you
need to load the demo data along with it
you might as well click that enable them
and activate it now the activation will
take its own time to load all the
various modules and applications related
to that plugin and once it activates the
plugin as we have given the option for
lowering the data it will load the data
as well along with this process
so once we have the plug-in activated we
can see a success screen where it says
the security incident response was
activated as soon when we close this
when we opened the instance back again
we would see all the corresponding
related objects of the plug-in activated
listed and if there was any error way
activating the plug-in it would swap so
when we type security on the Left we
would see all the security operations
related parts which were dependent on
the security incident response would
come up on the left you can see the
security incident application listed on
the left with its various modules right
now as we do not have any security
incident created they do not have any
records this is the end of the demo for
the a de rigueur session on the
ServiceNow tutorial thanks for watching
