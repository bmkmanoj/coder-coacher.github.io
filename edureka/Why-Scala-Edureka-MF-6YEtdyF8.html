which is important is Scala has repple
are EPL okay so what is that full form
read evaluate loop the print repple
write read evaluate print loop ripple
okay so typically repel is provided in
or what is the TEFL might the way it's
kind of a shell it's kind of you know
like menu type page enter it it opens up
a shell wherein you do you can do some
interactive analysis right so typically
with ruby ii typically with python
typically with any of the skill
languages those ripples are provided
these other environments wherein you can
just type some of your programs test it
and if they work fine then it is a proof
of the concept that yes whatever you
have typed whatever you've done is good
same is provided here as well but this
gives typically ripples come with the
languages which are interpreted right
they typically come with the languages
which which are interpreted nice I hope
you are understanding that point right
and that depends between an interpreted
language a compiled language I don't
need to tell you about that right so now
Scala gives you an illusion of an
interpreted language okay this is the
difference scholar given in if you using
an illusion of an interpreted language
it is actually compiled one where in
each and every thing whatever you type
is actually compiled to the bytecode
okay and it runs within the JVM okay so
that's that's a that's a big difference
between kind of enough Scala and other
programming languages which are actually
the interpreted languages
whereas Scala is the compiled language -
it's a compiled language and the moment
you write something in your you know
scala console it actually gets compiled
and then it is executed but it happens
so fast that you run
really realize it okay so this is
another kind of you know defense and
since it's a compiled language of course
it is kind of so you know in the
performance stack also it is much better
than there it is much better place then
it's distant cousins like you know
doobie Python and all okay static
language so type information is
exploited by the optimizers to make the
decisions movie to tell about it
it's a preferred choice for very high
performance systems of course it is and
the good thing is with the ID guys oh I
have a kind of you know you know the PS
kind of nodes right so I I would like to
share my experiences with you so I am
using eclipse Cal ID basically skål ID
is IDE is nothing but eclipse with with
basically scholar scholar plugin and
nothing else okay
it has got some bugs so that's the plain
talk which I would like to say IntelliJ
IDEA is somewhat better but not that
much
okay so far for me I have actually
become agnostic of them okay
so just just telling you all all about
it I'm having both having IntelliJ IDEA
I'm having eclipse and I don't work on
any of them I typically write very small
codes on you know on my notepad itself
that's it
okay so I'll share all those details
with you guys don't worry Scala so with
ID guys barrel Scala IDE is available
then there is this thing available
called you know IntelliJ IDEA and I
think there are others also great the
problems are yes they provide or to
completion very good but I am sharing my
personal experience the moment you go
for some sort of refactoring right and
let's say you have affected a class or
here reflected some sort of object or
some variable and all and if it is
cessful wet good but for some reason if
it gives you some error right if your
project becomes red then even if you
remove the red I mean the root cause of
it sometimes I have seen the project
remains in the red is itself I have
spent hours and hours in order to solve
it then I found what I mean out of
frustration - sometimes what I did is I
created another project and Papa faced
with the very same code in that and it
started working and I didn't do anything
other than that I can tell you about it
ok that was my experience that was my
experience
ok so Martin also has an online scaler
class and uses Eclipse plus color ID and
SVT right so this is right harsh and
others yes we use this car ID but this
is my experience ok this is this is the
experience with Scala IDE as of now and
this is about the latest release anyway
but it helps now this is called you know
that final knock can you review the
statement if I were to pick a language
to use today other than Java it would be
Scala
good see who is talking about it
right
Stephan you were asking a good question
when was this comment made some time
back so we I don't have a date that's a
problem with those comments ok
I think so I think so yes before I wait
but right I mean you can see about the
acceptance of it right the father of the
there are Java programming language
itself if they have if he is making this
comment and definitely there is a
substance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
