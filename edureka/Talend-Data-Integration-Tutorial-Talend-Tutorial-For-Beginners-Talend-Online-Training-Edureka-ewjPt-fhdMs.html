Eddie Rekha and if you were looking
around to get to know what is styling
the data integration and you are in the
right link and let's start understanding
what is talent data integration and I'll
take you through the agenda of today's
webinar so what is talent is what we
will understand first why it came into
picture and where is it now and later
we'll get to know what is talent
openstudio what are the features of it
we'll know also how to install it and
I'll let you know how it looks how we
can use it I'll take you through all the
components and connectors which are
widely used just to give you a context
of it how it works and then I'll take
you through metadata and context
variables which are kind of good
features provided by talent and I'm
making our life easier at the end I
would show you a short demo on you know
just to make sure you understand what is
the capabilities of talent so let's dive
in and understand what is talent so
talent is an open-source software
integration platform or when they're
like Thailand is a company itself and it
provides you a wide range of data
integration and data management
solutions so it is considered to be the
next generation leader in cloud and big
data integration software well it is if
you can look into Gartner chart you will
come to know what is the position of
talent today and to give you an insight
of where it is started its headquarters
are located in Redwood City California
so having a big picture of Thailand yah
Thailand it's an ETL tool provided for
us and then let's see what are the
features of it first and foremost thing
is it's an unified platform
what is this unified platform so it
gives you all the features you know the
integration for big data integration for
a java code whatever it is it gives you
an unified platform the second one is
open source so out of all our developers
like us or you know people who are
trying to download the source code and
give your own Java code to develop it or
make it better
so that open source is available for you
Talyn is an open source thing and then
the third thing is it's a meeting code
like whatever components we use in
Tallin it's actually at the back
so Java qu and it is famous for big data
integration so it writes MapReduce for
you again that native code conversion
it's available for you and then
challenge whatever you do it in that
like your data akkad it should all your
data management it's future proof so it
is not the one which will be in no one
absolutely infuriating to be there for
your future
so that's your which of you for
architecture and your data management
thing which you are going to do for your
long term projects so let me take you
through what are the different talent
products so talent platforms so it's
available in Big Data it's available in
data management have MDM you have
integration for enterprise you have data
services you have hybrid clock so
whatever you name and talent has a
platform footage so talent Enterprise
version so I will have to mention here
talent comes as open source and also it
has its own talent Enterprise version
few differences are there do they'll
understand it when you get into talent
so Enterprise version we have big data
we have talent data integration and we
have talent ESP and then coming to open
source that is an an open studio family
so that is MDM data integration very
data data quality ESB and BPM so all
these things put together are various
products offer by talent for you now
let's see what is talent open studio
talent open studio is an open source
project based on Eclipse ah CP and
provides an interactive user friendly -
I trust me talent has got a very very
very low loving curve so it's very user
friendly and you can learn it very
quickly used extensively for integration
between operational systems ETL
processes and data migration very you
know useful drag and drop features so I
can connect them do vo business rules
and you can do migrations very easily
it has connectors for whatever database
you name and whatever yup evening going
on
so TOS can easily combined convert and
update data present in various sources
so you have your heterogeneous sources
one file comes in excel another one
comes in XML and
laughing whatever it may be and if you
want to put it back to different
heterogeneous targets husband talent is
different
TOS acts as a cool generator which
converts all the underlying programs in
Java at the backend as I already
mentioned the drag-and-drop feature
components which you use in talent it's
just a bunch of Java code which in
background completely generates your
Java native code which will be compiled
and executed having this knowledge let
me tell you how does Italian Open Studio
Architecture look like so this is basic
representation of the tos architecture
that is your talent open studio
architecture which represents how jobs
are executed at the back edge so in the
GI when you open talent open studio so
actually the storage of whatever you do
whether it's a business model whether
it's a job everything will be stored and
xml structure later one level down so
whenever you compile it so code
generator you know jet templates are
available in perl java and whatever the
native code as i mentioned since it is
java and platform independent so it can
be compiled once you know you do a
development in one environment and when
you export or the build job it can be
executed in any other manner so
generally programmed it can be a Perl
program it can be a Java program it can
be your I know windows batch file or a
UNIX shell script so that is your
generated program at the end so this
stack from top to bottom is your talent
open studio architecture
so let's now come to an important topic
that is TOS installation they have made
it very simple you'll understand why so
you just go to Tallinn calm and I know
click on the download section and you
think you know what are the different
products available for talent will be
listed over here and you come to data
integration part and you just click on
talent free tool so once you click on
this talent free tool that will start
downloading
Oh zip file for you which has all the
binaries for you there is one-time
download which can be used for whatever
who is you're using ok so this is how it
looks like so you can just an you go
into the data integration it would
give you the latest version for download
second download from talent com so once
you have done that so it's just like
you're having L if five you'll have to
just unzip it and double-click on the
exe having you Java home setup that's it
no other step no footprints you know
repositories dedicated will be created
for your talents so that is how it is
very easy to plug and play so once you
install that so once you double-click on
your version of Rhino Mac or in your
Windows system you open that executable
if you are in UNIX you open the door as
which file provided for you in that same
binary installation then you can create
your project so this is the UI which you
will be seeing when you double-click on
the exe so you just tell I want to
create a new project for talent then you
create a new project by giving you valid
name so this is how talent welcomes you
so it will open up a welcome page for
you and then once you close this and you
can create the jobs file so now you
should be able to see the QoS main page
once you clear that welcome page so
we'll have a different the options
provided for you in Windows different
windows have different meanings which we
understand now
so this is of your talent to looks like
so we'll get into TOS GUI let's
understand so which all windows provide
me or all options and facilities so
first we'll start with repository so
there has all these blue color
highlighted things you are seeing are
the different windows we are talking
about so first we'll start with
repository so repository you have all
these options like you have business
models you have job designs you have
context variables like that's nothing
but a placeholder for your variables we
call it context in talent language and
we have code what is this cool all about
if you have anything which cannot be
accomplished directly by the ETL options
or the components which are provided in
talent you have some custom requirement
which is not separate out not inside
your tune then you can certainly light
it in your Java code or a perl script or
whatever you want to and you can
into talent so that is where your custom
quotes go inside and then you have a
skill templates for the same reason so
you have a predefined skill templates
you have to write something new in a
skill templates you can write here and
we have a very useful section called
metadata which is you know which holds
all my structure related things and
properties for my files whatever it in
which is kind of reusable will go into
my metadata now we have a wonderful
feature called documentation so
documentation can be a know adding
documents related to the job directly if
could be the one way and the second one
is it generates a documentation of the
ETL job which is quite a unique feature
in talent so we can get all the details
about the job and a webpage so then we
have recycle bin anything which will
delete over the job designs will go into
recycle bay so repository collects all
the technical items as I explained and
displays them in a tree structure within
talent it acts as a central store for
all the elements necessary for any job
or business mode so business model is
nothing but an ER diagram representation
or whatever job we are going to do in
Thailand which you can show it to your
management over the client for
understanding purposes how the ETL job
flow is from the repository you can
access various business models job
designs reusable routines documentation
and metadata connections right so
repository on a whole its kind of your
place hold you for all your jobs codes
and documentation and metadata right so
this is all about your repository so
let's go on to design window so design
window is the place way you
drag-and-drop the components and you
create your ETL job according to your
requirement so if you observe in
designer window we have two sections
over here one is the designer window
section another one is good so as I was
telling you whatever we drag-and-drop
it's a bunch of Java code so as and when
you drag and drop them in the designer
window the related code will be updated
in code section so workspace is where
you can lead on the designs of your jobs
as well as the business models the
designer tab this stops opens by default
when a job is created which displays a
job in graphic
that is GM mode and wherever we'll be
looking at our components and
connections so when we come to what is
that code tab this tab helps you in
visualizing the code and highlight the
possible language errors suppose when we
do this components connections for some
reason we are not giving the value
properly when he have n number of
components we need to identify where
exactly we have gone wrong
so in that case actually when we go to
Code section we can see other possible
letters and we can navigate quickly and
we can come back to designer and fix
them of course the code generated at the
background is not editable so let's know
what is palette window so palette window
it is docked at the top of the design
workspace to help you draw model
corresponding to your work flow needs
you can drag and drop various technical
components or shapes into your design
workspace so you can go and search for
you know we have a rich family of more
than eight hundred components in talent
so it may belong to your big data it may
belong to the DIA related whatever
component I'm going to use here I'll be
dragging and dropping them from palettes
so palette has all my component
collections so now we've come to
configurational tab so configurational
tab has a no-call lot of tabs embedded
in it so job tab which is the first one
will have all the information about the
current job designer so in this tab
we'll have to navigate from one to
another okay so the job will have all
the information about the current job
right
the version create name time etc so we
have contacts stuff that is I said you
like it is a placeholder for your
variables so the context tab is used to
set context variables and different
context on which they'll be used we can
have the groups of context as well so we
call it profiles so you need to have a
group of contexts or group of variables
which will carry all the values for your
dev environment and we'll have another
group of contexts which will carry all
the values for your Pradhan government
so you can just by one click choose the
profile where you want to run the job
whether it in dev or in prod and you can
go ahead so context tab will also deal
with those features and then come into
component will do so component when
we'll have all the related
configurations for that component which
we have selected so if you are selecting
one component or all configurations I
have to do for that component will be
available in component window I'll have
to go and do the configurations and the
run tab is as the name suggests the run
tab displays the progress of the
execution of the job
the logs shown here includes start end
and error messages whenever my job is
running I get all the console locks over
by run window in this section and of
course I can run the job kill the job or
clear the logs over here so let's now
get you know water components and
connectors so components in Tallin a
component is a functional piece which is
used to perform a single operation in
talent right so if I have to read a file
I choose ste file input D limited as a
component which I'll configure with file
name and what is the delimiter whether
it has header so it will just simply
read the file and give me the input so
at the back end the component is snippet
of Java code that is generated as a part
of the job whenever I drag and drop a
component a related code is generated
these Java codes are automatically
compiled were saved the trial
environment I read the file I transfer
my put it in to my database which will
include two to three components to do
this job so all together at the back and
as a Java code which should we come back
and run so now in the palette the
components I told you we have a rich
family of eight hundred characters they
are all grouped into these categories so
databases this family provides talent
components for all databases reading and
writing tables committing the
transactions performing rollback and etc
so we have components for doing all
those tasks when it comes to file family
this family groups together various
components and which you know read the
file while you well it is delimit read
positional xml whatever it is so I can
do all those plussing I can delete I can
archive I can compare I can copy so you
name it and we have the component for
that feature for filing and when you
come to intranet this family includes
all the components that help in
accessing information from Internet
through various means like web services
RSS flows
we emails FTP etc come to logon errors
are dedicated to catch lock information
and handle the job errors so I can
create reports customized things and I
can put in what all information I need
in log and I can generate my own reports
structure that's not standard I am as I
mentioned in earlier it doesn't have any
repository doesn't have any you know
default error tables default repository
table it's all about how I design it so
in miscellaneous we have you know
various components you know to just log
or to pop up a message you know before
the data are loaded in context variables
exit raw and we have orchestration this
family includes you know sequence or the
orchestration tasks and processing the
jobs and sub jobs components related to
them so having known the different
family of components you know we have
whatever category you say we have a
component over they order read a file
you want to read a database you wanna
write logs we add everything there so
let's see how we can having those
components how we can connect and
develop the job so connectors will have
all these links which we are going to
see so we have a row types in talent so
row type is all about you know main
lookup filters and rejects are the one
which come under the category of rows
which will actually carry the data so it
deals with actual data flow and slowly
we have I trade so I treat correction is
used to perform a loop on file
you know contained in the directory or
you are looking some values based on
which you have to do some you know
two-level loops or something like that
we go for a high attrition and triggers
when we come to triggers we have a
component level triggers we have sub job
level triggers in component level and
sub job we have run if to be in common
and then we have on Sub Zero boki on sub
job error control each sub job you know
the job which will do a specific task so
while the task is all the step of the
task is completed and then I won't next
steps so that's a sub job and on that
okay of sub job I do something else
if there is an any error I do something
else so likewise with the rows and
triggers I can actually manage the later
flow have control on my ETL job and
links as a last one in the corrector
we have ELT components as well and
talent so how good is that
so having ent components in ETL tool so
we have an on link connector for unity
which we can use only with ELT
components right so all together this
light speaks about your connectors in
talent where you can connect different
components and give a shape or give a
solution for your requirements
so now let's see and understand what is
metadata and context variables so
metadata in Tallin is the definitional
data which basically provides
information about other data that are
all managed within talents to do like I
mention if we want to do a database
connection which is used across all the
jobs in your project you can obviously
store it in metadata to each ones and
use it many times so if there is any
change tomorrow in the jobs you don't
have to go and change ten jobs instead
you have to come to repository and
change that in repository it will be
automatically reflected in all the jobs
where this metadata is referred so that
is the feature so in the repository
metadata you can store metadata about
the various data sources that in use
while developing any project you can use
metadata in your jobs just by dragging
and dropping them right will see it in
them or how it works so now let us
understand what is context variable so
context variables are the user-defined
parameters to hold some value for the
parameter right so this variables value
may change in runtime right
whenever you promote your jobs from
development to tester production you can
have different values for your context
so we have different varieties of
constraint that is embedded repository
and external so embedded context are
embedded in your job and are configured
just like another component like how you
configure your t4 input delimited so you
can configure the value over there and
use it in the same job but then when
coming to repository context these are
created when context variables are used
or needed in one or more than one job
right they are centrally maintained in
the repository allowing them general
accessible like I can use the same
context like my TV IP right what is the
IP of my DP you know it's available for
all the jobs to read
so that is where the positive comes into
picture so we have external context so
external context variables are those
context variables which are held in the
external file and are loaded into the to
do job at the runtime so you can keep
all your context variables outside the
job so that you don't do any changes in
the job so you can maintain those
changes in a file outside and you would
have already written a code in your job
to load variables from that file so this
is all about your context variable and
the types of it so now let's have a go I
know this understanding about what is
Stalin what was its architecture and the
open source version and components and
connectors context variables and
metadata let's see how we can develop a
simple job for a simple use case and see
how it is easy to you start so as I
mentioned so once you download the
talent tool from the talent website you
would get in zip file which has all the
information about your talent binaries
so we'll have to unzip it and after you
unzip it in the PPT so it's just simple
come and just launch the talent to
so once you open your talent exe you
will get a pop-up like this where it
asked you to create in your project
let's create a new project in the name
of Rekha
so once I have created it I just click
on finish which will take me to my newly
created project
so once your project is loaded you get a
welcome piece like this so once you
close the Welcome window you'll be able
to access the other windows which we
discussed and you saw it in the PPT
so now we come to the positive window
and let's create a metadata so what I'm
trying to do in this demo ETL job is to
create a database connection and to read
a file which is an excel file which
contains some customer data and I will
of filter out some customer data based
on the requirement conditions provided
in the requirement and I'll be loading
them into database so we cover the
metadata part of database and the
weather in a part of the file and we
also develop a use case ok so let's
start so under metadata I select the DB
connections and I just right click on it
and I see create connection you'll get a
pop-up like this which we'll have to
clean the deities which is mandatory so
it's let me start with naming them as
metadata for my SQL database and this is
for maybe dev environment something like
that
the purpose is Dell environment DB
metadata
so description is to reuse DB connection
in all products so I've given all the
information for which are mandatory and
next receipt this just click on next and
select what is the type of database you
are trying to connect to this is MySQL
so let me select my skill for this and
then the login this root and since I'm
have MySQL in my own local database I
won't have to provide the password I
just still connect to my ID localhost
the default port double 3:06 and I can
provide a database name if I already
create it otherwise I can leave it blank
for now I have already created an EMP
database which is already existing by
providing this database I'll just check
whether this connection works so MySQL
def connection is successful and then I
finish my metadata creation and this is
how my metadata created look like so now
I have the metadata
let me come to job designs and create a
job so I had created metairie double for
even I created my job because I know I
need it in the job so let's create a job
so starting with J for job and maybe I
can call it demo purposes demo
description is to read data from Excel
and write data to MySQL database
idelle foolish I'll get the designer and
code window along with all the
configuration windows so once you have
created the job we'll get the designer
window like this so which has the
designer and coding section so now
either I can drag-and-drop to company
from the palette or since I have already
created the metadata I can drag and drop
it from there so when I drag and drop
the metadata I get the list of
components which I can use this metadata
in YouTube so I can just choose team
MySQL connection and I say ok and I'll
get the MySQL connection this is the
component which will be having all the
details which I have entered while
creating metadata so MySQL localhost the
poor DMB and whatever username I have
provided over there everything is
available over here so this is my first
component which I am using to create a
connection ok so after creating the
MySQL settings in metadata now we also
see you know we can also create a
structure or related things manually as
well so I'll give you a glimpse of that
while using the excel file so let me
find what is the component bill in my
palette and I get all related components
for excel so we have T file input Excel
so I'll just drag and drop it which is
to read my excel file so once I have
done the successful connection of MySQL
I want to read this file so I'm actually
I need to have control on this
components so what I'll do I'll do a
right click on MySQL component and I say
trigger on component ok if the
successful connection is done then I'll
come and I'll start reading the excel ok
so let me go into T file input X will
come fferent window and let me give the
XLS format reading option and I should
give the file name for it so I have it
in my documents so this is the excel
file which contains us customers list so
I'm taking that file so I'll have to now
tell whether it contains header yes it
does contain headers and that's the
first row and then I have love to define
the schema for it so here if
have gone for metadata I would have
created structured dynamically so to
show you it also can be done manually
I'm taking this example so let's create
this structure manually I'll take the
values from the excel directly so I will
create so the customer ID is an integer
I create one more column which I'll take
it as customer first name
just a string check the third column
which is customer last name which is
again a string create one more column
which is customary me I'll take that
feeling just create freely more here
again email ID string for me
and ultimately I have coastal city and
customer type
so I'll quickly create these two corpse
and now after creating this I have my
structure defined for my excel and which
we did manually and if we are doing it
in method it away we don't have to give
it valid right so I upgraded all the
fields over here so I'm ready to read
this file so we have one worry over here
this company should have output links
that means there's an input component
which is capable of reading and giving
out the data and it is expecting to have
one more component which can read the
data from this component the use case
which I am going to demonstrate is we
have this lioness customer list where in
the highlighted column customer type has
different values that is it will tell me
what is the customer type of the
customer data available in this excel so
whether the customer is VIP or we have a
new customer in the list or the customer
is loyal or customer belongs to V VIP
category so what we can do is we'll
filter out these customers and we'll put
them in different tables in MySQL
separately for VVIP new and loyal
customers okay let's do that so having
this use case in mind sohow created the
connection for my skill and I have
created the schema that is structure to
read the excel which we just saw so
since I am filtering out more than two
or three categories that is new VIP VIP
and loyal so I need the same input which
is to be worked upon different filter
conditions so I use keys I need the same
data set to be worked on different use
keys so I'll just replicate it so as the
name suggests we have a component which
is called T replicate to get the
component in the design window
I can even type on the designer tab and
you'll get a doctor like this so I'm
using T replicate what are the different
kind of we have main lookup so we'll be
using main row with T replicate so from
T replicate I can take n number of
inputs which will simply replicate all
this input data right so it's a
at least he should have one sheet knee
which is necessary for or mandatory so
I'll have to give the sheet name of the
five so it is sheet 1 by D foot so let
me go on cue sheet 1 over here so it has
to read that shit so now my warning is
gone it has got all the requirements
needed to read the file right
so after this let me filter out the data
over here so I can take n number of
outputs from T replicate which will give
me the replication of the same data ok
so my first step is to filter out the
VIP customer so let me take a filter
company that is Steve filter D filter
Rho is the component name and I think
the main row from the T replicate
and give it to tea filter oh so
configuring tea filter row is very
simple so you can see the schema will be
automatically copied after we have
connected them and I can create
conditions for filter over here
so my condition is pretty
straightforward I'm filtering out the
different customer types so I'll select
customer type and tell it has to be
equal to some value maybe first I'll
take VAP values so I'll come here and
within quotes I should give the value to
be matched so in this case we filter out
the VIP customers and let me introduce
to the next component my next step is to
put this data in my SQL so I'll use tea
my scale output component which will
write data into my output either I can
do it in this way or even I can
drag-and-drop the metadata from here and
choose output compare it
so I can select team is can output I can
see okay
but she'll already have all the details
present in my metadata
so now I simply take tea filter filtered
output that means which will work on
filtering the VIP customers and I'll
directly give it to my SQL table okay
so here let configure what is the
settings in the MySQL or put component
so here I will have to give all other
things will be pre-populated from
metadata but then for output I should
give the table name right so I can say
so us VIP customers as the table name
and structure will be obviously copied
from my filter row so it will have all
the fields over here so I can select the
action on table as create table if does
not exist and we have many other options
and I can choose the action as insert so
with this I'll be able to filter out my
VIP customers and I can write it to my
SQL TV so let I can also change my
component name to VIP yes customers so
my job readability is get so similarly
we will do it for other filter
conditions I can just copy paste this
component as well and I can use it for
next condition so I can take the same
set of input for another filter
component maybe this time I will change
it to be VIP so I add the next story
since I have copy pasted all other
settings remain same that's quite easy
and even I can copy paste to output file
which is my database connection
so we VIP output I can directly give it
to my second MySQL output component I
can just see change the table name over
here everything else remains C and just
to ensure readability is right I'll even
edit the component so with this we have
filter VIP a VIP customers similarly we
can do it for loyal and new customer as
well
now let's run this job and check whether
we get expert in output
as you can see the eating job is
successfully executed and you can see
the stats as well in the GUI the hundred
rows has been great hundred rows of
replication then we have certified new
customers we have sixteen Vav customers
nine VVIP and forty loyal customers now
let's go to MySQL and check whether we
have tables created with the same data
so let me log on to MySQL it's user
which we are used to create the tables
that's root and then I'll use temp2
database which have used in the job and
I'll turn show tables so I have all the
tables which are created and they each
year so let's query one of them
so what we start with the new customers
so I have all my new customers listed
over here and similarly how am i maybe
Christmas
and similarly am i we be VIP customers
and similarly I have my loyal customers
so we have two loyal customers doodle-oo
here so a radial job has filtered out
all the records as per the requirement
and we have the output readily available
so as you have seen the MySQL tables has
the data populated in it as per the
stats you have seen in the talent G
right and we have provide and a solution
for the requirement a simple use case is
been demonstrated here so to know more
