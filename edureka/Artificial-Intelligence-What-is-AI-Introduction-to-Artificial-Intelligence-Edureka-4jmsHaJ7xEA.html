thing but why do we need a I hear is a
lot lying in his grade let's go back
into time and see what happened
Alan met with a major accident because
of driving back home trunk along with
10,000 265 other people the same year
every year this number is increasing and
we have cars that can drive on its own
that can save people like Alan Jack is
blind he wishes for a device that could
help him to see the world meet Olivia
she is visiting Berlin she cannot
understand German sign words she wishes
for a software that can convert those
German words in English looking at all
the scenarios what do we understand we
need an intelligent machine which has
the power to think analyze and make
decisions this is nothing but artificial
intelligence the basic idea is to mimic
a human brain inside a machine for
example if we want a car to drive on its
own we need to train that car based on
drivers experience with the AI people
like Alan can sit comfortably in
self-driving car and reach home safely
you will be amazed to know that
bondsman's that have been made in this
field AI has also held people like Jack
or camps my eye is a small wearable
device that has the ability to read
printed text from any surface the device
also recognizes faces at individuals as
well as identifies products and
denominations of currency notes
phylidia we have AI enabled mobile apps
that can extract the text from an image
and converted into a different language
artificial intelligence is not only
saving our lives or making it
comfortable but it is also contributing
in the field of art meet Eric the famous
painter which has a computer program
Aaron is able to create very unique and
exquisite paintings as softwares are
even composing music ai has given us
word script which can create a unique
story for you it writes articles in
newspapers and on internet we even have
Sherlock and intelligent tutoring system
teaching airforce technicians how to
diagnose electrical problems and
aircrafts so clearly after internet
which is connect as the entire world and
microchips without which more than
humans cannot survive AI is the next big
thing that is revolutionising the world
the question is what are the
technologies that are driving this
advancements in the field of AI first
game machine learning for achieving AI
and now people are talking about deep
learning which is a subfield machine
learning deep learning works in the same
way how a human brain works it is
inspired from neem logs which are
nothing but brain cells deep learning
uses multiple artificial human
these neurons are arranged in the form
of layers output of every layer is the
input to the next layer earlier due to
less data and lack of computation of
power deep learning was not possible but
now we have GPUs a huge amount of data
because of which deep learning models
give very high accuracy for deep
learning the most famous programming
language is pipeline and tensor flow is
a Python package for implementing deep
learning products so come and master the
concepts of AI and deep learning with
Eddy Rekha structured program which
includes neural networks convolutional
neural networks
recurrent neural networks RBM and
autoencoders using tensor flow thanks
for watching and hope to see you on
board with Eddie ray kazoo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
