it o rica by name is Siddharth and I
would be of taking your session for the
Prince to before we start the this
session let me decrypt the word
demystifying the mystifying if we check
a cross on your webcam it means clearer
and easier to understand clearer and
easier to understand prince2 and why
clearly understanding prince2 matters is
what across we would be taking in this
session DJ in de for the webinar is what
is Prince true and where it all began
it's been to suitable for non IT
projects who uses Prince to Prince to
exam format and the examination
methodology so what is princedom prince2
is a UK style is it project management
or is it about controlled environment I
would say it captures the all three so
Prince to is projects in a controlled
environment which is originated in UK
and is currently owned by exelon's
decoding Princeton in the said earlier
pins to stands for projects in
controlled environments it is easy to
learn and flexible for all projects all
projects is actual either for the small
projects big projects complex projects
IT projects know
any projects projects running in UK us
Asia Africa the answer is yes it is
flexible for all the projects the
practitioners over prince2 across
worldwide are more than 10 lakh till
date it provides guidance and essentials
of running a project before we move to
the other benefits of prints to let me
help you out in understanding what is
prince too and I think across the
another piece of project management
certification which is PMP to show the
comparative study between prince too and
PMP it will not only help you out in the
comparative study of each one of them
but it will also give you an idea of how
the prince2 is structured and what is
the purpose of drafting search of
project management certification so
coming to PMP which is a project
management professional certification
prince2 stands for the projects in
control environment so PMP is a
credential which is offered by PMI and
is the most popular project management
certification indoors by us and the
examinations are administered by PMI
prince2 is a structured project
management methodology which is endorsed
by the UK government as the project
management standard for public projects
PMP on the other hand is a knowledge
based approach to project
management prince2 is a processed based
approach in the PMP certification you
require certain eligibility criteria for
example 4500 raja project management
experience in addition to it 35 hours of
contact training prince2 certification
requires no prior knowledge or
experience in project management no
absolutely no prior experience is
expected out of it in PMP the each topic
area can be referred to in isolation of
others it's kind of plug and play model
prince2 on the other hand is an
integrated set of processes and themes
not isolated silos that can be
selectively applied the principles
underpins two are non-negotiable so in
PMP the knowledge areas which you have
for example the cost equality the time
these areas can be referred into an
isolation of others you can selectively
choose any of them and start working on
that model it's like a plug-and-play
model which I already said about Prince
through on the other hand is structured
set of processes and themes these cannot
be in isolation be applied to the
project
in PMP the focus is on the project
managers role I am repeating any other
important point in PMP the focus is just
on the project managers role in Prince
to the roles and responsibilities of
everyone involved in the project is
defined in Prince to you have the role
defined for the project support project
assurance project manager team manager
project board corporate or program
management each and everyone who's
involved in the project the roles and
responsibilities are defined the prince2
does talk about the non-specialist
aspects what I mean to say is in
comparison to PMP where you would find
the poor techniques bottom-up estimation
techniques own value management the
techniques which is usually been
employed in the project management in
Prince to you would not find the
detailed techniques which are elaborated
prince2 is gendrich in nature of the
framework so PMP is like a body of
knowledge which is kind of a book of
cooking that one Uehara prints through
on the other hand is like a recipe or
for a meal
the another important part is like the
PMP certifications which captures
detailed techniques leadership
capabilities professional ethics and
social responsibilities are all well
covered prince2 doesn't cover in its
scope the specialist aspects detailed
techniques or the leadership soft skills
so that was it about the comparison
between the prince2 and your PMP I hope
it would have been our Europe be
perfectly you know understandable from
the perspective of the designers of
Princeton and yes to a certain extent
for PMP also the other perception is and
this is where the majority of questions
do come up a time pace is PMP or sorry
is prince2 is talking about only the IT
projects or its focus is also on the non
IT projects the answer is Prince to not
only captures the just the IT projects
it captures any project that needs to be
done irrespective of the size complexity
geography location or the domain under
which it has been worked across let us
see some key benefits of Princeton
the first benefit having prinster
inculcates confidence in the people who
are driving the project so having a
prince to approach to project management
would surely help the project manager in
delivering the project with the
confidence Prince to talk the same
language again prince2 is not any
proprietary project management
methodology it only captures whatever is
happening across the globe and preparing
a standard out of it so Prince two talks
about the same language language like
the business case the processes
initiation work packages reports project
plans team plans it is basically to
bring all the people working under a
given project to talk in the same
language the third benefit our Prince to
is customer focus the theme of Prince to
one of the themes rather is about giving
the right business justification to the
project at each stage on a regular
fashion to the project being
focus on the product on the quality on
the business case helps in being
customer focus right from day one the
another benefit is delivers reliability
prince2 focuses the themes of prince2
which would be covering in some time
talks about the budget talks about the
quality talks about the time risk in
dependency and the opportunities which
lies ahead by going as per these
mythology it is delivering a reliable
product or deliverable at the end of the
day let us hear some more benefits of
Princeton delivers what the business
needs and that is where the continued
business justification principle of
prince2 comes into the picture what
brings to put the major thirst honors
that the clarity of the business case
should not be there on day one of the
project alone rather it should be there
as and when Tildy did the project is
running scalable using the prince tool
in an agile way creates appropriate and
effective structures that are fit for
purpose for projects from a few weeks to
much longer so if your project
of just two weeks or two months or two
years or two decades prince2 mythology
would apply to any of these projects
adaptability prince2 can be used on any
size of project through appropriate
scaling it should be adapted depending
upon the nature of the project and the
industry structure as it accommodates
the integration of any additional
techniques flexible control having
prince2 but building forward on lesson
to deliver more control by providing
repeatable delivery to budget quality
and time as well as using prince2
adaptable level of controls to ensure
that decisions are made at the
appropriate level when required hence
ensuring project speed and agility so
the prince2 has been structured in such
a manner where at each level of the
project which is four levels imprints to
that as the corporates level the project
manager level the project board level
and the team manager level each of the
responsibilities at each level is well
descriptive Lee mentioned in the Prince
to manual so one need not to be
bothering about at what needs to be done
at certain level of the project by a
given role
support cross-functional working using
prince who supports early engagement
with the supporting team such as ID in
HR to gain their cooperation and work in
how many to deliver mutual benefits and
last but not the least benefit of Prince
to his career development which is
benefiting from a professional
development and career path of people as
Prince to is part of an integrated suit
of projects for programs and portfolios
and at the same time being aware of
worldwide project management
standardization development such as a
esos which provide guidance on project
management best practices so by these
benefits you would be known by now that
Prince to is not limited to any chakra
fickle region to any size of the project
to any complexity of the project or any
other hindrances of any kind of in any
kind of project
the other benefits which are worth
noting fine is the community of users
there is a wast number of people who are
engaged in the community of prince2 by
not only benefiting the people by
enriching them with the Prince of
mythology's by also benefiting the
people of prince2 so that it is
regularly updated in the market and be
competitive with the project which is
running at present so birth of Prince
true how has been Prince to evolve over
the period of time so 1975 is all where
it started where project resource
organization management and planning
techniques was developed by an
organization known as simple system
limited it was rechristened to Prince to
in 1989 and scizzin then till late it
has been evolving over the period of
time
to see how what is the reach of prince2
you need to understand these facts
prince2 is practiced in across more than
150 countries in 19 different languages
worldwide the next question or probably
one of the thing that you would also
look after is what is the benefits of
prince2 to the project delivery the
performance and the business related
results if it brings any to the table so
having Prince to mythology in the
organization for any given project
improves communication improves the
alignment between different stakeholders
improves it trust between the people of
the project and outside the project it
also influences the organizational
culture of embedding the right set of
practices for project management it also
unites teams and the processes the focus
of prince2 is much more improved than
any other project management approaches
you have better cost control and the
effectiveness of the project largely
improvises
so till now the benefits which I was
stating to you was from the either from
the perspective of the organization or
from the perspective of the project
itself Martin does prints to also
benefits any given individual or not and
the answer to this question is yes
prince2 does benefits any given
individual also but how does it benefit
an individual since this largely of
focusing upon the organization on
projects let us see the benefits for an
individual in Prince to our the Prince
to qualification as has been stated
earlier also is recognized around the
world around the globe it improves your
position the terminology that is used is
common common across people across
domains across projects so having a
common terminology based upon which the
discussion happens the interaction
happens the communication happens it
britain's lot many benefits directly or
indirectly following the approach of
Prince to as as was stated you earlier
in this session also the roles and
responsibilities of each one involved in
the project is well descriptive so if
you are following the Prince to
mythology
it would help you out in understanding
your role in the project prince2 is a
structured approach so wherever the
approaches are structured the
functioning of given process activity or
project becomes comparatively easier to
walk upon it also helps the clearing of
any doubts which one comes across while
running the project is structuring the
project how should I structural project
how should I divide the project in given
phases or in given processes or what
kind of documents should i create which
will not be largely in count very hard
that is there should not be much
documentation work but at the same time
this the list should be very
comprehensive prince2 does have the
mention of it also so another benefit as
an individual how to close your project
effectively efficiently I think the
point is prince2 does he'll appear how
to improve your delivery how to start
your projects at each of these questions
are will descriptively defined in
Princeton so it's upon you as an
individual to gain the maximum out of it
so prince2 has benefits for individual
for organization and for the project as
well let us see the Prince tools
integrated and
garment which have seven as the lucky
one which is Prince two teams Prince two
processes and Prince two principles so
Prince who has seven themes seven
processes and seven principles I'm sorry
guys um I think there has been little
confusion wrongly put in words over here
are the processes which is given on your
left hand side of the screen are
actually the themes and on the right
hand side the themed we just mentioned
is your processes I apologize for any
conclusion which has happened because of
the content of work piece of work sorry
for it so Prince to has seven processes
which is starting up a project
initiating a project controlling a stage
managing a stage boundary directing a
project closing a project prince2 has
seven themes which is business case
organization you bility plan risk change
and progress prince2 does have seven
principles and these principles are
non-negotiable
the seven principles are continual
business justification learning from
experience defined roles and
responsibilities managed by stages
manage by exception focus on products
Taylor to project environment so these
principles are non-negotiable and what I
mean by non-negotiable is in any kind of
Prince to project one needs to
understand that the principles can on be
negotiated any time
let us see in detail what these
principles themes in processed Oxenberg
the seven crucial themes of prince2 are
the business case organization quality
risk planning change in progress
business case talks about setting out
the justification for each in every
project and at the same time clearly
highlighting what is required and
crucially when it is required the second
is organization as i said earlier also
prince2 talks about the roles and
responsibilities and rosen's won't
please all the people involved in the
project the quality part so prince who
has a generic mythology based on true
and principals risk risk analysis and
management are key to any project
successful delivery and which Prince to
do also captures the planning part the
specialist aspects of the project can be
easily integrated with Prince tool for
the true success of the project the next
theme is change chain states or
understand that having a clear
definition of project configuration
management issue management and change
control are key to all you see to
achieve the progress theme talks about
the status of the project at any given
moment of time
these seven principles of Princeton and
before that I would re status Prince two
principles are non-negotiable whatever
kind of project you are involved in
whatever complexity is involved in
whatever the geography collocation
you're working upon the Prince two
principles are non-negotiable at any
given moment of time so what are these
seven principles the first principle is
defined roles and responsibilities the
Prince to project team should have a
clear organizational structure and must
involve the right people in the right
task so basically the principles are the
guiding obligations and the good
practices which determine whether the
project is generally being managed using
prince2 or not so if you are stating
your prints to now the project you are
working upon is a prince to project the
litmus test is are you following all
these seven principles or not if not it
is not a prince to project coming to the
next principle is managed by stages so
Prince to suggest that each of your
project should be divided among the
given stages you should plan you should
monitor and you should control your
project on a stage by stage basis only
manage
I exception manage my exception state
star the prince two roles and
responsibilities which has been
described and has been descriptive in
nature should have the tolerance limit
set across at each level for an example
the tolerance limit in terms of course
can be set across you know for any
change in a project the project the team
manager can look after the changes if
they are less than three hundred dollars
if any changes are more than hundred
dollars but less than two hundred
thousand dollars it would be taken care
by the project manager if the change
involves more than two thousand dollars
but less than five thousand dollars the
project board needs to pitch in so these
are kind of tolerances limits are being
set across at each management level
learn from experience principal project
teams should continually as expected in
prince2 should seek and draw on lessons
learned from previous project so works
the tailoring is one of the USP of
trends to Prince too can be Taylor based
upon the project environment size
complexity importance capability and res
so irrespective of the project at you
working prince2 is adaptive in nature we
have talked about the continuous
business justification earlier too but
just reiterating what we discussed
earlier Prince Tuesday start the Prince
to project should be job a justifiable
reason not only for just starting the
project but it should remain consistent
throughout the project
and the last principle is focus on
products prince2 project focuses on the
product delivery definition and the
quality expectations set out of it so
they what they mean is think of the end
of the product in the starting phase of
the project what we remain is the
prince2 processes so as we had these
seven themes as we had the seven
principles we have seven processes the
seven processes are starting up a
project initiating a project directing a
project controlling a stage managing
product delivery managing stage
boundaries and closing a project what
prince2 against theatres and it talks
about in terms of tailoring is in any
project at least two management stages
must be a applied if it has to be termed
as a prince to project so what prince
who says is at least one stage that is
initiating a project in any other
further management stages can be applied
in the minimalistic situation to term
the given project as a prince to project
that was about the introduction about
the Prince roof structure it's
integrating environment the benefits of
it now comes the question of how the
Prince to examination is structure
what level of examinations does prince2
captures and what are the objectives of
each of the levels so prince2 has two
levels of examinations mainly one is the
foundation level and the other is the
practitioner level the objective of the
foundation level is to assess whether
the candidate has sufficient knowledge
and understanding of the Prince to
mythology so as to be able to work
efficiently with whom with the project
team man members what are the pattern of
the Prince to examination so the Prince
to examination is a multiple choice
examination questions which are 75
questions all of those 75 5r trial
questions which are not included in your
scoring so idly any participant or the
candidate has to score at least 35
questions correctly to secure 35 mark
since each question is carrying one
market out of the available 70 questions
or in summary fifty percent of your
questions should be correct no reference
material of any sort is accepted during
the Prince to foundation examination the
second level is prince2 practitioner for
the prince2 practitioner it is important
that the participant or the candidate
must be Prince to foundation certified
so the objective or the purpose of the
prince2 practitioner qualification is to
confirm whether the candidate has
achieved sufficient understanding
of not only of application of pens too
but the tailoring of prince2 in a given
situation the examination pattern of
prince2 practitioner is it's a
multiple-choice examination question and
the objective having eight questions
under which there are ten quotients each
in those given eight questions so idly
there are 80 questions all of which 55
person or in other words 44 question
should be marked correctly there aren't
any negative markings it is a two and a
half hour duration of exam and only the
official prince2 manual is accepted as
during the examination
the next thing comes about the validity
of prince2 so all prints to
practitioners should or the validity of
prince2 practitioner is five years for
the re-registration you have to appear
for a one our examination which is
exactly set at the same standard as the
practitioner exam so the validity of the
practitioners is five years Oh Prince to
foundation there is no validity or term
I've given you are you know lot many
benefits of Princeton but I don't know
whether it tempted you to go for this
particular certification but I give you
some statistics in terms of the pay
packages of the prince2 certified
professionals in the globe you would be
surprised to see these facts a prince to
certified project manager has a pay
package of ninety two thousand dollars
ranging till alack forty-two thousand
dollars for the project managers people
designee and certified art prints to the
pay package are in the range of 40,000
too close to a lack dollars per annum
this is the official statistics which is
openly available
so how is the Prince to Anna dereka
would help you out in a combined way or
rather how a Eureka would help you out
in the Prince to certification programs
the Eureka has the live online virtual
classes where you can appear or sit down
or go for it at any across the globe
irrespective of the geographical
location you are look at once you enroll
for the any of the print a direct
program you would get your own account
where all the classes recordings which
you have appeared for would be available
24 + 7 and so you have the 24 cross
seven support team also whom you can
reach out for any of your queries or
concerns the session also has been break
down into module and you do have the
quiz at the end of each module once you
finish up the session you have a
certified certificate in your hand so by
this I am finished with my part of the
webinar I would request each one of your
participant to please ask any query any
concern that you have in the quotient
chat box and I would be helped p to help
you out or clarify your doubts if any
requesting each one of your participant
to please read your questions
clarifications or doubts which you have
regarding
store I would the first question that we
mean says will there be a classroom
session in chennai if possible the
question is from mr. Ramanathan sir of
the prince2 or other be more generate
the edori cup business model or training
mythology is just only the online
platform they are aren't any classroom
sessions for it I hope I've answered
your question if not you can please
raise read raise or rephrase it the next
question is from mr. chiragh what is the
validity period for Prince to foundation
developed there aren't any validity for
Prince to foundation have said earlier
to the validity of prince2 practitioner
on the other hand is for five years the
next question is from ms pretty the
question is how can we go with a dereka
for Prince to certification pity for it
is very a simple thing that you need to
do is login into WWE Rho and you would
see lot of prince2 sessions that is
happening whichever suits you as per
date and time of yours go and enroll for
it in
question is from mr. abhijit the
question is how would you pitch in
prince2 against PMP I would never ever
pitch in prince2 against PMP or PMP
against Prince to each one of them have
their own benefit which can be better
captured by a given individual
organization or project based upon their
expectations however in some way I have
tried answering the question of yours
mr. bed sheet in the earlier part of the
session where we I took up the
compassion between the prince2 and PMP
but nothing against in any of these
certification I am repeating a
certification as their own benefits of
doing it the next question we have is
from mr. miss Mina the question is is
there a classroom training in bangalore
a mean I've of the mythology the
approach of Eureka is just an online so
I'm sorry they would not be help you out
in classroom training however the
benefit of going with the a director
training session model is that it is
divided into three to four weeks of
session so on each of the weekends or
weekdays you have to just given
somewhere around three to four hours of
your time so it is in a distributed
manner nothing is going against in one
gulp it sends it distributed handsome
you would get the grass of prince2 in
the meantime the next question is not
miss from marine in reality i see it is
being used by very less organization
specifically in IT companies you may be
correct in
say stating this fact mr. rinsing but
the other fact is people organizations
and projects are evolving over the
period of time they are maturing over
the period of time and directly
indirectly not only prints too but maybe
PMP maybe other approaches they are
adopting to deliver the project
successfully another sated you fact
earlier also there are over one lakh
50,000 certified prince2 practitioner
and there's a huge large number of
people who are involved in the community
practices so if it had not been the
right approach of doing the project
management it would have faded in the
earlier year of its formulation itself
but being in the industry for more than
20 years is something which is justifies
the reason of going with these
approaches the another question is from
jasmine the question is for indian
market which one is best PMP or Prince
to my question to Jasmine you is it
depends it may happen if you do not have
any schrick expectations from either of
these certifications you may go with any
of these certifications however there
are industries there are customers j-rok
lines there are organizations there are
projects with specific expectations are
set in terms of PMP operands too in that
case you do not have any leverage of
choosing any of them but if you have the
leverage you may go with any of them the
reason is at the end if you do not have
a nice trick expectations set out of it
gaining any of these certifications
would in some way or the other would
help you out in becoming the better
project managers the another question is
from the participant winner lobo do i
get an acknowledgement certificate
having attended this webinar the answer
is the question is no however you would
get an acknowledgement in terms of email
that you have attended this webinar what
is the best way to get Prince to certify
the answer to this question is the best
way to get Prince to certify it is the
first and foremost thing you need to do
which is kind of mandatory is you go and
have the best training out of it once
you have attended the training program
maybe often in Eureka then go for this
certification or the examination however
as per the track record of the previous
history anyone who have been trained
under at Eureka has passed the prince2
examination in their very first attempt
the next question is from the attendee
unworld what is this certification cost
course plus examination onward to answer
your question I would request you to
visit the website www Ricardo you would
find the pricing details mentioned over
there the next question is from mr.
abhijit the question is PMP seems to be
far more popular than Princeton as i
said earlier also i would not favor any
given certification even if it is Prince
to or PMP i would say popularity does
not goes along very far what goes along
very far is what is the benefit that
you're gaining out of any of the
certification which you are going out
for maybe Prince to maybe PMP so I would
suggest is please do see which
certification would benefit you the one
that benefit you is popular for you as
an individual the next question is from
mr. Ramanathan how will the session of
Prince to happen is it from my computer
where I can access the material
self-study and then go for the exam with
the vulture provided by eureka for
people's our Prince to foundation and
practitioner exam i would say sir you
have yourself given the answer to this
question yes the session will happen
from your computer where you can access
the material he'll sell study part and
then you can go for the exam of the
voucher which will be provided by a
dareka for people serve pins to
foundation and practitioner exam the
next question is from mr. &amp;amp; 1 the
question is is the exams paper test or
online the answer is it depends if you
will be going with the edgar acre
mythology the exam will be an online
paved the other question is from the
patent in range I see company mostly
following agile scrum and etc yes and
that is why if I'm I don't know whether
you are aware of the fact or not prince2
has come with an other certification
known as Prince to agile which will
follow the agile approach
in tandem with the Prince to approach
for that prince2 practitioner
certification l is the eligibility
criteria so if you want to adopt this
approach yes you may go for it you may
go for the Prince to agile but however
for it you need to be a prince to
certify the next question is from the
attendee pretty how much time do a
working professional needs to spend each
day in how many months can one be
prepared to give both level exams pretty
um if you follow the edori approach you
have to give in just three or four hours
on each of the vegans over a period of
four weeks to complete your prints to
training and by this approach I think
adding an additional a week or two at
most you would be ready to give both
level of exams in fact immediately after
the training finishes of a director
which is spread across four weeks you
are well versed prepared by all means to
give the prince2 foundation exam at
least the next question is from the
attendee knowing the question is what is
the cost of plans to exam loween up
answered but I'll restate it for the
cost of prince2 exam I would suggest you
to visit the WWE kaku website over there
the details of the costing is mention
the next question is from the attendee
mina certification exams can be taken
online or should it be taken in a
prometric Center the answer to the
question is it's an online it's a ver
proctored exam in which case you can sit
at your home comfort and give the Prince
to certification exam
the next question is from the attendees
jeevitha prince2 certification can help
a fresher get a job yes it can help get
a fresher our job but you need to see
whether the benefit or the knowledge
which is provided by Prince to are you
able to get the grasp of it or not the
next question is from the attendee GAO
su apart from training session does
federica also provide any sort of study
material the answer is yes also does it
helps in registration for certification
the answer for this is also yes the next
question is from a BG is it a fact that
Prince to practice is limited to the
European region the answer is no there
are more than as I stated earlier also
more than one lakh 50,000 prince2
practitioner spread across the globe
over 150 countries the Prince to
practice has been followed so it will be
wrong to say that it has been practiced
only in the European region the next
question is from the attendee pretty the
question is in IT industry as per mom I
experience different projects require
different project management approach
such as various project development
lifecycle so how would prince2 would be
helpful such approach we have given of
this answer fair bed in the earlier part
of the session is the benefits of
Princeton she would be going across from
the Prince to approach prince2 helps
enlarge many factors but yes you're
right in saying there are many
approaches which may be employed in
princeton in project management rather
but if you would be following Prince
to majority of your project project
management approaches would surface
under the umbrella of friends too but
not all the one but maximum or most of
them would definitely focus people do
approach also go with the hybrid model
of picking up the best approaches opens
to picking up the best approaches of PMP
also but as an entrant level I would
suggest you to follow one approach once
you're well versed follow the another
approach and then think decide which
works best for you in your own
organization or project the other
question is what should be the time gap
between foundation and practitioner exam
this question has been raised by the
attendee meaner the answer to this
question is it actually depends but
generally at most a week time would be
good enough to give a time gap between
these two certifications so I think
that's all the questions were if you
have any doubts any clarifications
please feel free to raise your questions
who would be this certification provider
is the question that is on raised by the
attendee mena the certification provider
will be the people search which is one
of the well-known bodies across the
globe for certification providers any
other question any other from any
participant
I will request all of you attendees if
you have any doubts any questions please
feel free to raise it at this given
platform I would be healthy to help you
out in clarifying your doubts or queries
aren't there any other questions I think
they aren't any questions which is
floating on the equation box the
question is from the attendees I och

recorded copy on this so i add you need
to drop in the mail on the eureka for
this and they would help you out in
clearing not only adults but hopefully

touch with the EDD Eureka login on to

from the you another attendee 1l is I'm
PMP certified so while getting prints to
certified been edited wanted I always
feel when L that what if you are done
one certification there is never a harm
for doing another certification after a
given cap it always enriches your
knowledge and as an individual you will
definitely benefit out of it the other
question is from PT the question is that
