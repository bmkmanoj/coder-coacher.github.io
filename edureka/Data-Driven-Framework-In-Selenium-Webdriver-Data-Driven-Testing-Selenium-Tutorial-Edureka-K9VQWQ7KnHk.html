name is Vardhan and I'm super excited to
be here on interracial life with you
guys as you all know today's session is
going to be completely about
selenium-webdriver so i'm going to do
something that's really exciting and
something I have not done before right
and that is the very famous data-driven
testing in selenium framework so before
I get started with data-driven testing
in selenium can you people tell me if
you are aware of this topic or if you
are aware of how how how its performed
in selenium and what are the
requirements for performing it can you
reply by commenting in the chat box yeah
I have an answer from Kumari she says
external file like Excel through POF a
API perfect absolutely Bala says major
major use of Excel well that's also
correct but yeah what Balazs mystery is
the fact that we have to use Apache Pio
I as an API for getting a return from
Excel to our selenium right so anyways
guys keep your answers coming in but in
the meanwhile let me just continue right
so let me first get started with my
session by showing you my customary
agenda slide and well for the sake of
any newcomers in today's session I will
quickly go through the role of selenium
as an automation testing tool in today's
market and after that I will explain
what is data driven testing framework
then I will talk about how to perform a
orderable testing using selenium
webdriver and I will conclude today's
session by giving you a demonstration of
the same ok guys so let me just quickly
go to the next slide and let's start ok
so first of all selenium is an
open-source tool which is used for
automating web browser tests right and
it's mainly use for functional testing
and three popular or the most important
reasons why selenium is really popular
in the market is because of these three
write the test scripts can be written in
any of the languages like it can be
written on any any programming language
like Java Python Perl Ruby and c-sharp
and another reason it's very popular is
because it supports cross-browser
testing you people should know that
cross-browser testing means you can
execute the tests in different browsers
like Chrome Firefox Safari browser or
even Internet Explorer
and finally the most important reason
why it's you know again really popular
is because it can be supported on these
three important operating systems like
Windows Linux or Mac so these are some
of the main reasons why selenium is
really really popular as an automation
testing tool okay now there should be
enough
you know it should be a good enough
introduction to you people and getting
to the main topic of today what exactly
is data-driven testing framework right
and what are its benefits well
data-driven testing or DDT as it is
famously acronym is an effective means
to test any data set which might change
over time okay so this is the best
technique to test any application for
whose the data set change is the only
constant okay so to be more precise what
means is the data-driven framework here
it's a testing strategy in which the
data set under test is stored separately
from the test script so as you can see
from the image on your screen over here
the selenium test code will be
independent of the data set or rather
let me put it this way the selenium test
code is independent of whatever is being
tested so what this means is that if my
test case is about checking the login
access to any website then I can store
the credentials separately and have the
cilium code stored separately the
selenium code will perform all the
operations needed as it usually will do
in a normal frame work like
instantiating a browser driver
navigating to the specified web page but
except passing the login and the
password credentials so even the
post-test action like quitting the
browser will be performed by the cilium
code itself but the very fact of not
passing the username and password fields
will be fetched from an external file
like an Excel right so most of you know
this part so there are loads of benefits
with this framework and firstly being
that the automation testing will be
driven by the data set under test in
this case okay and another benefit is
that the same same test script can be
used to test multiple data sets now at
this time you can ask me why is it that
you can ask me why is that the data
driven framework is probably the only
option or is the best option in this
case
I can present you this scenario okay now
let's say suppose we need to test the
login form with the multiple input
fields 400 different users okay to test
this you have probably three different
approaches okay so one would be to
create hundred scripts each script for
one one user and execute those tests one
after the other we could do that or we
could do this we could create one test
case with one particular users access
and then run that test trip and then the
next time we want to perform the test we
can replace that credentials with
another users we can do this okay but
again even this would have to be
executed hundred times or finally we
have the third option that is the data
driven strategy in which you have your
test code and whenever the code is
getting executed it would fetch the data
or import data from the excel and then
execute that correct so that's simple
right so you just executing advance and
the rest will be taken care of by
selenium so with the help of Patchett
piy it would fetch the data from the
excel so that's the big advantage here
right so that's the thing so for
scenarios are very tedious and
time-consuming hence the data driven
approaches the best student so you guys
are understanding this concept right
okay so do drop if you have any problems
but in the meanwhile let me go to the
next slide and here is where the
important presence does selenium
webdriver support reading of data from
an excel file for input okay does it
does send you webdriver support the
reading of data file from an excel file
for input so a couple of you gave me an
answer for this earlier itself sukumari
says yes and yeah she was probably the
one that gave an answer for that but
what you need to notice by default
selenium does not okay we have to use
this open source framework called Apache
API for that purpose right so what is
the Apache Pui in this case Apache Pui
is an open source framework written in
Java to support the read and write
operations of Microsoft Office files on
sailing
so it's basically a library which can be
referred to in the selenium code okay so
I can download all those jars and
library files similar to have you
download the selenium libraries and jars
you can place them in the same project
directory you can put them in the
freedom in the path and eclipse and you
can get started so you have a certain
inbuilt
libraries and functions which you can
use to get data in to load your excel
file to set your date at your excel file
to set the rows and columns you can do
all these things you can basically just
means of hard-coding the data set you
can use this framework for getting data
and from the py sorry from the excel to
your selenium webdriver right and there
are loads of benefits with Apache py
like c1 advantage is that easy
maintenance of the code can be done
right and even the data you know even
the test coverage of the data set will
improve so that's these are the two
advantages which are really popular
among the other things right two big
advantages among other things so so
that's what I wanted to speak about
Apache apo I now moving on to the next
slide down this is the this is the
representation of the demo that I'm
going to show you okay so I have an
excel file that looks something like
this I have the username field in one
column and I have the password field in
another column and I have the so these
are pairs of credentials okay so these
two together make up one pair of
tarantula this is a username this is the
password for one row and similarly I
have five different rows here and what I
would be doing is I would be feeding
these as input to my selenium code okay
and I would be using Apache Pui okay so
I have another class called excel data
file okay and in that file I have
instantiated or created in that
particular excel file I've created
I have placed all the libraries and jars
that Apache Pui requires and when Apache
Pui you know gets all the design that
can be used and called in the main
function so I can so here is where I'm
using the data provider and I'm calling
that excel file I'm providing the path
where it's present and
doing that so this might be a little
confusing right now but let me go
further and when I get started with the
demonstration I could explain it in a
better fashion right so let's go to the
hands-on now and see how this can be
achieved okay so guys or can you see my
Eclipse IDE over here
can you give me a confirmation if you
can see it okay so guys are this is my
yob main program which is which needs to
be executed right and let me explain on
a high level what I have over here
okay now the skeleton basically consists
of this main project so this is my class
DDD excel and I have the main method
over here called demo project and what
it does is it does the regular job of
creating first of all instituting a
chrome driver then navigating to a
particular site or a web page where I
want to perform my tests and then
finding elements there and in my case
I'll be finding three elements one for
finding the user name field the second
is to find the password field and then
the third one is the login button so I
would obtain a basic find these three
fields and in my first case I'd be
standing my username okay second case I
would be sending the password and the
login button however I would be clicking
that login button now usually what we
will do is you would in a double quotes
here we would specify what the username
is and what the password is okay but the
variation this time is have you know
I've given username and password as
variables here okay now these are
present as arguments in this method okay
now now you can ask me the questions can
come up in your mind as to from where
will this these details come wherever
the username and where the password
credentials come from right in my code
so to answer that I have another method
over here now before I explain this
method you need note that I've annotated
this main method of mine with add rate
test data provider now when we see
provider it basically means that the
method that is defined over here
this is expecting some kind of input
from another method named test data okay
and in my case I have the name of the
method or as ad rate data provider and
the name of course is your test data
okay
the scenes are of the same thing that
I've specified over here and I've
annotated it with a treat test provider
to identify this as one of the data
providers now in Adaline and working
environment they can be multiple data
providers right so they can be multiple
methods from the data can come so at
that time it would be you know the data
provider would be either constant thing
and the name would change so here in
this case it's test data one this data
if I won't have another predator
provider it would be test data one and
test data to similarly okay and that is
what has to be specified here from other
readers coming in okay now that's what's
gonna happen and now now that the
download you know what happens over here
let me go and explain this part from
where the data is actually going to my
main method okay this is the method
which is doing the execution and that
method gets data from here and the there
are three important lines that you need
to know okay
these are the three important lines
where the first one is I'm creating a
new object for my your class so I've
created another class called read excel
file and you can now see that excel file
right here okay now what this file is
doing is well okay before that what I'm
doing is I'm creating the object along
with the path of the excel file okay now
let me go here and tell you what this
file does now what does file does is
then given or when invoked along with
the excel path it would load a new it
would basically load a new file okay
so these are basically Apache Pio I
libraries which I've used okay you use
them to basically set up your
environment where you're creating a new
excel file and then you're setting up a
file input stream so that the data can
come in from the excel file to your raw
selenium and then you finally I'm using
WB - I'm using a variable called WB to
load a new project to load that
particular excel file
okay so that's what is happening you're
under this if you notice I have given it
inside a try block well the simple
reason why I have it inside a try block
is so that well in case some kind of an
exception occurs or some kind of a
problem or error comes in that can be
thrown in as an exception okay so that
is the only reason I don't want my
execution to be hampered and be stopped
so that's why if any exception happens
in getting the file it would basically
be thrown as a println statement and it
would be printed you're right so this is
the first thing that happens where my
excel path is given and based on the
path that is fed to me I am creating a
new I'm loading a new file for that and
I'm creating a file input stream for
that and I'm setting up a workbook for
that okay
so I've created a variable workbook over
here as you can see xsf workbook and
excesses of sheet now these two are
again Apache UI libraries and WB I'm
specifying that it's a workbook which I
want to create right the same thing that
I am specifying and with xsf a sheet
with this keyword I'm saying that sheet
is the sheet in my workbook which I'm
working on now your excel file can have
multiple sheets right so that's why I've
created this now this is the excel file
which I have the fed as input and this
is where my test data is present now
this currently has only one sheet so
that's why I have not specified anything
more are not specified she'd what she do
so that's the reason now getting back to
my main problem since when this is
called this what is going to happen and
going to the next line what I have here
is int Rose is equal to conflict dot get
row count okay now this is basically
creating a new variable called Rose and
it's storing integer data there okay and
what is it getting stored it's getting
it's storing a value based on this
function call so it's making a function
call to get a row counter okay now this
is again a new function or a new method
that I have inside this particular class
of mine okay as you can see there's a
gate row count over here and the
parameters the arguments to this row
counters sheet index now I've also
specified the parameters you
I'm sending the zero to this particular
column now what this means is I am
saying once you've got my file on which
I want to work it is the sheet number in
which I want to work is zero okay if you
see in this example also all my data is
present inside my sheet 1 ok but however
internally this will be mapped to index
number of zero okay so even though it's
sheet 1 the way Java works is it would
internally converted to zero right
that's the index number supposing there
is a sheet 2 and there is a sheet 3 and
sheet 4 and sweet right then this would
be this would have an index number of 1
this would have an index number of 3 and
it goes on but however the first one
would be index number zero so that's
what I'm specifying as arguments and
when the argument is given over here
this would count the number of rows in
that particular raw sheet ok in my case
I am creating another row here and I'm
saying inside the workbook which I
created ok which I've specified you're
get the sheet number okay
get sheet add sweet index basically gets
this particular sheet in my case would
be sheet number 0 and then it would say
get the last row number because I want
to find the number of rows in my excel
file ok get last row number would return
the value of 4 so even though there are
5 rows here the value that would be
returned as 4 again for the same reason
that Java would interpret this as 0 1 2
3 &amp;amp; 4 right so that's how Java indexing
works so that would be present here and
whatever value is a sense so in my case
since it's four then there would be a
mismatch right as to my logic and
program logic so for convenience sake I
am appending one plus one to row so I'm
just doing a Rho is equal to Rho plus 1
and finally I'm returning row whatever
is stored here and this is what goes
back to my method the the function call
over yard so that value would basically
be stored inside this Rose which is
present in this particular class ok so
one thing which you should do not let
confuse this there's a rose over here
variable and there's another Rose over
you're not they won't interfere with
each other because
they are defined in different classes
okay so this would again have the value
of five over here okay four plus one is
equal to five
now the third important line that I have
here is that of creating a new object
called credentials okay and I'm creating
a two-dimensional array object here and
why am i creating a two-dimensional
object can anyone guess
can you just wiggly guess why that why
I'm doing that well anyways let me just
stop the answer for that myself
the reason is every time I want to go to
my excel file and pick up the
credentials I want to pick up a pair of
these credentials so I don't want to
pick up them separately right so I want
to pick up the username first and then I
want to pick up the password along with
that and then feed them as input to my
excel file over here username password
so for that I am creating an array
storage hood and I'm basically getting
the data by making a function call to
get data so get data is another class
that I have again in this particular
file okay and these two these two
function calls are made inside a for
loop so that every time you know the
value of Phi increases the next row
would be executed in the excel so first
time when I am performing the test it
would look for it would start with I is
equal to zero so it would start with Row
is equal to zero in this case it would
be this row and it would pick up a
breaker and a trick of 1 to 3 as the
credentials okay and it would start
executing your so what it does here is I
am saying my array object first curve
for credential in the it would be 0 for
credentials 0 comma 0 the data that you
have to get from is you would make a
function call to get data okay and you
pass arguments as 0 is 0 so in my case
if I go back here you can now see that
there are there is another get data
method and this method basically takes
these same three arguments and it takes
the sheet number row and column and this
is ideally the most important method of
this whole program because this is what
does the actual fetching of data from
the excel file right
if you see here I'm basically running
the for-loop to obtain the value from
the excel and store it inside inside my
array and that's what this piece of code
does over here okay when you specify
what is the sheet number that you want
the data from and which row and the cell
you want your data from then it will be
executed straightaway and the code that
I've written is such that I'm specifying
the sheet is equal to WB dot get sheet
at a sheet number okay you use this
sheet number and it's creating a new
object spring of a swing type that's
data is equal to with these parameters
okay so it's gonna get the for this
particular sheet okay for this sheet is
going obtain the row and the cell so
whatever is there inside the row
mentioned here and inside the cell
inside this particular sheet write a
combination of these three that value is
what it's going to do and the pre
inbuilt library is get string cell value
okay so this is inbuilt function that
you know you can use to get the data
so whatever then inside the cell would
be obtained in my case when the for loop
is running for the first time it would
obtain and Raqqah and it would pass it
okay and the when this execution is done
when the I value is increased or rather
before increasing the second man this
line is being executed it would execute
for a row number zero and column number
one so in this case row number zero
would be a trigger itself this this row
and column would be a break of one two
three so that would be passed and these
two would be sent to my sent as my
username and password okay and the next
time I for loop is increasing the ie
value would be increasing and the next
row would be sent and one off the other
this test would happen in this format
okay now I hope I did a good job in
explaining the code here if you people
have any doubts so with the code can you
please tell me please put that in the
chat box because I'm gonna continue with
the execution okay I'm going to next
click on the Run button to show you how
the code would execute and how the
redoubtable test would actually be
performed okay guys
okay so I'm gonna quickly go and run
this program and when you hit run see
what happens the first set of commands
would work my Chrome browsers
instantiated and I go to the site my
username password fields were fed with
the data I've logged in successfully and
I've closed my browser because I have a
driver dog quit right after my core okay
similarly the same mercury has been sent
the sanon button has been clicked on and
I've been and I've successfully logged
in okay these were this is what happened
the first two times now however the
third time when the your credentials are
passed my year my login would fail now
you can see that you have a different UI
right that's what happens so the way I
have written my excel file is such that
the first two credentials are correct
they are valid so it would login but the
other three would fail to login so
that's what's happening here so you can
see that for each of the five rows
already mentioned it would feed the
username and the password fields here
and it would show if it's logging in or
not
okay so my test is successfully done now
let me just open up my console here and
as you can see here it says the total
number of tests run we have five that's
because they were fire rose in my Excel
and the failures bad three and that's
also because there were three invalid
credentials okay
none were skipped but this also means
that two paused now let me show you that
over here so the first time my
credentials passed it says login
successful and again the second time
when it pass it says login successful
but after that it says field
okay so just past demo project with
these credentials
I'd recover one two three and with
credentials as mercury and mercury again
my project paused in this method pass
but however it failed with these
credentials and I have a set of reasons
why it failed and again for the next
field attempt we have this and we have
set of reasons okay but anyways moving
on to the report here we have detailed
report of this test and as you can see
my default suite my default tests have
all failed okay now that's because well
in even my BDT Excel so this is the name
of my class for a class right so even
this has failed now that's because even
if one method or you know one test case
feels inside your rod may in your inside
your test or inside your class then
that's considered as a failure but
however the four times are executed with
my ex cool demo project with these
credentials @rickeon and recover one two
three and when I execute it the same
with mercury and mercury it passed right
so that's why you can see a green tick
mark here but the other times it shows a
red mark so that is the kind of a
detailed you know this is not complete
detailed also but this is the kind of
report that you get with the help of
tests Angie and yeah this is the code
and this is the console this is the view
that you have and that pretty much
brings an end to my session here okay
now this is the kind of demonstration
that I want to show you okay so let me
just uh if you have any doubts please
keep them coming and in the meanwhile
let me just go and open my browser and
I'm gonna show you a couple of things
here okay so first off I want to show
you the bass details of our course that
we have right we have a synonym 3.0
certification training this is provided
by Erika and we have the batch details
right here you can log into our thread
that you can check out our website at
this URL and you can see what's the
price and which days you have a batch
starting you can see all these details
and also the curriculum and well if you
guys want to learn there's some free
content here we have a block side here
and we have a set of blogs a number of
blogs which you can read and you can
learn a lot from similarly we have the
YouTube playlist for selenium you can
again go through these and most of all
if you guys want to be notified of such
live sessions then I would request you
to click on this Bell button over here
so when you see an indirect our video
next to the subscribe button you have a
bell option right so this would notify
you of any events of any video uploads
or any live sessions so these are the
things and I have a couple of queries
your and yeah that's it right so let me
just quickly go to my BPD again and
conclude today's session by giving you
this review okay so what we covered
today where these topics so first I
spoke about you know what the role of
selenium as an automation testing tool
and then I spoke about what is the
reader driven framework and then I spoke
about what is Apache Pui and how it's
used with selenium for development
testing and finally I give you a
demonstration of the same right guys so
yeah guys so that is pretty much the end
of my session here I thoroughly enjoyed
this live session and I hope even you we
will learn something new today and for
those who already knew it I hope this
was a you know a good revision so we
will come up with more live sessions do
subscribe to our channel like comment
and share our videos and it will be a
pleasure for you for us to have you on
board with us so thanks once again and
happy learning
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
