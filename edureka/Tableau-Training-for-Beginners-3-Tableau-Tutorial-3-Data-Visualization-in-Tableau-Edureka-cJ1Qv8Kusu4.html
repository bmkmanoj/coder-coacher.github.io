introduction that is my name
it's a condensing my full name is Barney
Kumar the pool you'll see that even on
the go to meeting right that's my full
name people find it very difficult to
pronounce my full name so I've condensed
that to Kumar which will be very easy
point here is my education details
I'm alum neo4j in tu I've done my
computer science engineering there I'm a
bita grad and then I've done my one-year
program from Indian School of Business
here in Hyderabad and here are the
profession certifications which I hold
I'm a PMP certified professional that's
the unique ID right which is given to
any person fostering and it's active now
I have taken this PMP way back in 2008
so it's still active I got it on you and
I'm also pmi-acp certified agile
certified practitioner that's the
corresponding ID there if you search by
that ID you'll find that an certified
miss consume it just brings in that
authenticity
I'm also PMI RMP certified rest
management profession certified from PMI
project management institute i'm a
certified scrum master I'm a Lean Six
Sigma Greenbelt from our ABT USA I've
done mine Six Sigma Black Belt from
Arabic us a quality society bas-reliefs
here I'm a Six Sigma master black belt
certified a mighty L we wasn't 3.0 35
I've run my adult project management
certification from on in two levels
basically foundation and then the
practitioner when I've taken
as I was the only Indian who could clear
the cutoff for the trainer because
trainers were expected to get a higher
percentage as compared to your other
people and that means a Pathmark
and the trainer cutoff was different so
I could pass that that is from APM Guk
and that's on dsdm dynamic system the
open methodology a turn that's the
latest version of that agile methodology
right and this is my profession I'm a
data scientist by profession I do a lot
of research projects in an antic space
as in how we move on I'll speak as an
how there is a situation which arises
I'm going to you know briefly speak up a
few of the research projects that I'm
part of and that's my passion I've
played for head bar Cricket Association
I have been an ardent what do you call
follower of all the bodybuilding events
and a bodybuilder by profession also we
can turn in that we right so that's a
rare combo is what people say and that
is about my boring profile now once you
log into your
Yurika website sandal passes question
are you an independent consultant or
with a corporate Oh
Sanka that's nice to hear you're into
CrossFit too yet so Sankalp as of now
I'm working with Indian School of
Business as a research associate the job
of research associate is to work on
research projects along with the
professors and the current project that
I'm working on is about video analytics
if you guys remember a few years back in
us in Connecticut right there was a
shootout there was a person was gone on
a rampage killing the small school
children right six months before he has
done that particular crime he has posted
few videos of his on YouTube first video
he has posted said that he was
frustrated with his childhood because
his parents were separated while he was
still young while he was a kid the
second video that he has posted said
that he was disturbed with a schooling
because teachers have already always
differentiated him from the rest of the
students he felt really very weird that
is what the second video says the third
video that he has posted was about his
own brother deserting him not playing
with him not speaking with him because
he was scared about the society what
would society feel and things like that
the fourth video that he has posted was
that he wants to purchase a gun v video
that he s purchase a gun and the sixth
video that he has posted was two hours
before he has committed the crime he
clearly mentioned that he is going to a
specific to school to shoot the children
we had two hours
to take corrective measures we are six
months to actually save the lives and
save this person was uh knowing some
mental trauma
how good is analytics if analytics
cannot help you cannot help for the
well-being of the human beings here
right so based on this logic there is a
research project which I mean I mean I'm
associated with along with the various
other professors and that is all about
analyzing the videos that are there on
the Internet be it
dailymotion with YouTube or bead yuku or
whatever be crying people keep posting
we use can we quickly analyze those and
how do you analyze it will be zero bytes
of data
those are videos right how would you
analyze those and try to tease out the
skin of events someone undergoing some
psychological problem someone you know
undergoing some other problems someone
you know associated with terrorist
activities whatever be trying so how to
tease out those things and take some
corrective actions even before the
damage happens right so video is broken
down into multiple frames of images
images has broken down into pixels based
on that you analyze and try to come up
with interesting insights and it becomes
even more important if a video is not an
English language think about Spanish the
second most widely spoken language right
right and then you have various of the
languages so keep up we posting in
different languages so your model that
you're going to build should be able to
analyze different videos of different
sizes of different formats of different
languages rate of different themes and
from all of those you need to bring out
these kind of interesting insights so
that's all
the research project that I must seem to
put okay over to our discussion here
once you log into it eureka website
you'll find some interesting things
right these are my courses that means
I'm training basically on these three
things
for a Eureka if you are aligned to this
data visualization with Tambo that would
appear for you all you need to do is
click on that and it's going to show you
the list of courses or modules which are
part of your data visualization with
tableau I'm assuming you all might have
already done that
that means you already might have
installed tableau 9 if you haven't done
so I would request you guys to go to
tableau website and install Table nine
anyways installation guides are also
given narrowing that's the course
content you have the way this modules
this program would last for 10 days so
today is the first day we'll be looking
into introduction to data visualization
with tableau this session would be more
of theoretical trying to understand the
architecture of tableau its server
client architecture and fear of the
basics about tableau right so today do
not expect please on any kind of
visualization on tableau or hands-on
from tomorrow we will get started and we
are going to do deep dive eyes and how
we move forward right so the first two
or three sessions would be kind of
mundane for you all
there would be less and less hands-on in
the first few sessions as in how we move
on right the difficulty level and the
kind of analysis that we are going to do
is only going to increase so by the time
you reach the end of the session tenth
module you'll appreciate the things that
you have learnt so don't take a judgment
as soon as you are in the first two
modules don't jump in and say that hey
learns nothing it's nothing because we
are just into the introduction part okay
and the next class if you were to join
you can click on the join class right so
it's very easy for you all to join the
navigation is easy and if you have any
question right you can post a question
here by clicking on that whatever
question you have whatever course you
are undergoing right you can select that
and push your question and I'll be more
than happy to assist you on that okay
since you all are new to tableau or
explore to some extent I'm assuming that
it should be a good interactive session
here all right so I would sincerely
request you guys to restrict your
question to the topic at discussion do
not jump in because the questions that
you might be asking right by jumping the
guns would be something which would get
covered at a later point of time Amy
right but nevertheless shoot out your
question if that question would be
addressed somewhere else I'm going to
let you know that it will be covered in
the next session or something in time
otherwise I'll help resolve that so
that's about the introduction and do you
have any questions for me at this point
of time
any of y'all I'll nourish promote Sanka
do you guys have any questions for me
this tableau version right would expire
in foot Indies and once it expires you
cannot do much other than purchasing the
license because tableau is going to
crack you based on your computer's IP
address based on your IP address so you
have install ones that means it gets
registered in your registry and the IP
addresses fragbite Apple
I should not be seeing this but probably
if you have anyone you know doing your
MS or something there can probably help
you with a license because for students
tableau is free of course you just need
to provide the ID student ID as a proof
the license that I have is a student
license because I'm into research it's
more or less like I believe I believe
yes but again we need to check on that
now we need to check on that but there
are few conditions that you need to be a
full-time student or you know it should
be one year program or things like that
but still I would request you to just
give a shot at that I'll see if I can be
of any help to you in this regard so
that was you know our frack our offline
discussion right so I have not recorded
this I'm not on record all right started
the recording now okay why do we need to
learn only tableau are there no other
visualization tools if that is your
question here is my answer
did anyone hear about godless Magic
Quadrant
yes Oh God nor has this magic quadrant
which it publishes right yeah you can
try out that on you can try it yeah so
good
you guys have heard about Gartner's
Magic Quadrant otherwise I my name is
trying to show you that
this is be an analytics platform there
this is 2012 doesn't make sense
mobile application got ass quadrant
all right probably we need to look into
the first one only so as of Feb 2013
right this was a snapshot tableau
software there is on the top it's much
about click view and now if you see
table would be far ahead of the race I
think we need to go to tableau website
and check tableau Gartner's Magic
Quadrant yeah here we go say in 2015
tableau was a market leader here it's
coming up godness quadrant let me click
on that here we go yeah undoubtably
today tableau is on top of the list here
so godness Magic Quadrant is based on
ability to execute your strategy and
ability or completeness of vision right
based on these two you are classified in
one of these quadrants here tableau is
placed in the leaders quadrant right so
not only that is ruling the world now
tableau in data visualization so this is
one strong reason why you have to be
happy that you know you have taken a
right decision in learning tableau this
number one number two is tableau all
about visualization because Owen has
told about the burst in the Big Data and
it makes sense for us to know tableau
and Sankalp has already been into that
Pramod is also keen on learning tableau
so now Rachel
zooming you're able to hear me so there
is a small article which was written by
killing objects which is specialized in
research in analytic space and you'll be
surprised to see this no doubt that are
is ruling the world
now when it comes to analytical speeds
this is are you do a lot of coding and
you know you write all the things you do
a lot of statistics and all that however
it has 46 point nine percent market
share this is core analytics too but if
you come down and look at this this is
amazing
tableau has twelve point four percent
market share when it comes to analytics
so tableau is not just about
visualization data visualization it is
also about using analytics and if you
see SAS it has very less market share
eleven point three percent point and it
has been dipping studied let me also
show you one more interesting thing let
me go to Google Trends and show you the
kind of demand which tableau has asana
you
look at that I think there is some
for seasonal tissue here July unite not
sure maybe in July it's business as
usual and no one is going to come up
with any new release or something like
that not sure or look at this forecast
so it's only the increasing right
tremendously that's a good part about
tableau to see that the demand is steady
or it's there is a slight trend up for
trend here and then if you go by region
you see that in France there's a lot of
demand Madagascar and things like that
so it's not just in US or the developed
countries right the kind of demand is
also extremely high in these kind of
regions that's a good part you can drill
down to the city level and view that or
maybe tableau is a different word right
maybe it's looking into different other
words rather than looking into just
tableau software so let me put my gram
and see what happens here this makes
sense right now I think region also
would be changing yeah now it's United
States in India because tableau as a
word has a different meaning right I
will if you do that a group of models or
motionless figures representing a scene
from the story or from history French
people are very good at history
historical things and all that right
historical research probably that's the
reason France was standing out but if
you look into this here you see good
crime it's a forecast the trend is only
going to increase and we know for a fact
that it picked up from 2007 right until
then no one knew what time the was so if
you want to rail down by city you can do
so fear of y'all are from
let me see whether Atlanta or California
is you know it's not there but I'm happy
because Hyderabad is one of this
Bengaluru is there anyways and you see a
lot of demand here in UK and probably
not region France also and obviously
United States Canada also has some
demand right so you know you are in the
right direction my learning tableau this
is another thing we was jumping to the
presentation and look into what are the
other benefits which tableau has but I
believe someone has spoken about maps
someone is crazy about maps I think it
sank of right so let me show you one
interesting thing while I was in Russia
in saint-petersburg for all in your IT
employee Association meeting right
we're in delegates from with different
countries have come man I represented
India because I'm also director of all
in your IT my association or Union if
you were to call in that way so we have
collected the GDP from 1960 until 2013 I
believe so when you do these kind of
visualizations right look at the small
small red dots those are GDP of the
country now everything is red that means
the GDP is very less very low right and
you can play
motion chart is called as a motion chart
which I've used because I wanted to make
a story while I play this so let me
clean that if you see carefully the size
of the red dots are going to increase
greatly if you see there is a sudden
increase here in German GDP also Japan
GDP is increasing my crazy u.s. is fast
increasing there and if you see Italy
France and UK is also increasing and
China we do not even see it there in
1980s right
Japan has become second world power in
comparison to us and then Russia started
picking up Germany is further increasing
your France Italy and you here which are
steadily increasing and look at this
China now with us started picking in
2000 right in 2008 I started picking and
US has already become green that means
its GDP as it's almost 17 team and look
at this Japan all flayed it has become
green now look at China sorry look at
Japan Japan has also started and it was
on par with you u.s. however US has
taken away and then all of a sudden your
China has you know started picking up in
2000 and it is now reach the position
where it snakes only to us and you see
that here in European region Germany UK
France and Italy are still strong and
then you have Spain also which is not
not behind this examine the Australian
GDP you have Indonesia the small
countries right Turkey Saudi Arabia the
small countries are also challenging and
here you have Mexico and Canada so let
me play play this at a faster pace and
you can visualize this
that's a good park right I could have
broken down here in two probably month
and seen month on month what what was
happening there but I could have created
another thing which sees interfere I
want each month I want to break it down
if I have the data at that granularity
GDP of each country maybe each water
maybe that would have made sense so this
is one thing that I wanted to show you
another thing is the store management
dashboard right so this is a project
which we have done for a Chinese client
so how does it work let me put that in a
slide move all right sorry friends that
was my kid okay so let me put it in a
slide move you know this is a shopping
mall all right and this shopping mall
had all these various toads they have
segregated into different departments or
different sections of the floor was
having are things alike for example on
the Sporting Goods where towards one
corner or that means you would see Nike
Reebok Puma and things like that - it's
one corner you'll see all the electronic
goods towards other corner restaurant in
one place all um
now KFC or subvi and things like that
would fall into one segment all your
home and lifestyle would fall into one
segment and things like that and baby
care products - it's one segment so how
would this help the moment you enter a
shopping mall you'll be provided free
Wi-Fi access so you tend to connect to
that the moment you connect right you
need to provide the basic demographic
information such as your gender age and
any other details which might be
relevant in deciding on whether you're
going to purchase something or not quite
so you provide those basic demographic
details and connect to your the Wi-Fi
and then you enter the shopping mall the
moment you enter the shopping mall you
would be a sign
let me play that here we go so all these
are human beings right and you're tagged
a unique ID if I hover my mouse on that
you see that there is a unique ID the
last entry there right so when did you
enter the restaurant that is time of
entry what section are you in which
state was that what was the time range
during which you were in the shopping
mall X and Y axis because you're in
space for me kind of an I need to track
based on x coordinates and Y coordinates
where you are and things like that all
right so the interesting part here is
that you can crack on who is spending
majority of the time where say there is
one person in grocery store he opens the
e-commerce website and searches for the
cost of saying Apple iPhone 6 or success
whatever people write and then the
moment this person searches for that
based on your cookies information is
sent to the relevant search engines they
in turn have a type with different other
product based companies in the
information that this person has tried
to search for iPhone 6 online and the
price of that say online was forty-five
thousand rupees just for our discussion
so say it was forty five thousand rupees
immediately a trigger is sent to the
Apple Store saying that hey there is one
Mac ID
he has says for iPhone six price on
internet and he has found that the price
was 45 thousand rupees and the store
owner he knows for a fact that the price
of knife 1/6 the product there in his
store was fifteen fifty thousand rupees
so five thousand more than what this
person has saved
that's a trigger for the shop one or
that hey probably he needs to bring down
the price to ensure that people purchase
from his store and not from the
e-commerce site as and how this person
moves around right
say this person from here why our
restaurant he is traveling towards the
electronic store there's a trigger which
is sent to the store owner would say
that hey that Mac ID are the unique ID
this person was searched for iPhone 6
online is in your store now the moment
the store owner gets that trigger and if
this person or any person for that case
there enters and goes and asks on the
store owner on the price of iPhone 6 the
store owner will provide instant 5,000
discount because he does not want to
lose the sale they're a customer lost to
e-commerce is like you're losing your
business right so you'll sell it for
5,000 discount so what is advantage here
this person rather than you know placing
an order online can purchase it
immediately here this person if it
places the order online he'll get the
iPhone 6 probably after two days but
here he'll get it instantly look at the
bunch of possibilities that exist right
probably you are the person who has
searched for baby care products right
when you have started to the mall two
days or three days before that you have
searched for baby care products online
so that information is available with me
based on the GPS I am going to track on
whether you have entered the shopping
mall or not then once you connect to the
Wi-Fi there I'm going to send you a
message saying that if this is a person
right who is in men's apparel if he's a
person who is searched for baby care
products then I'm going to send him an
SMS saying that hey there is a baby care
product store just adjacent to your
men's apparel and you have a special 10%
discount on the baby kid products what
am i doing I'm increasing my seats
right so let me play this so look at
that people moving around moving around
right so I'll be able to track who is
the person who is able to move faster
based on the beacons based on the Wi-Fi
right because if I have one router
somewhere here towards the corner it's
not going to cover the entire mouth so
what do I do I place different beacons
in different locations if you move from
one beacon zone to another zone one
Wi-Fi zone to another zone but based on
that I'm going to calculate the speed at
which you're walking the speed at which
you're walking tells me briefly that if
on an average you're going to spend two
hours then how many shopping malls or
how many stores would you cover if
you're a person who is very lazy three
hours you have spent in grocery it
doesn't make sense for me to send a
coupon for you from cosmetics because
you tend to leave now right
unnecessarily lb you know sending a junk
coupon to you Oh
discount coupons so you need to bear all
those things in mind speed at which you
walk the earning power of yours based on
how many transactions you have done in
this particular shopping mall in the
past right what is your earning power
did your earning power increase if your
earning power has increased they need
your spending power also exponential
increase absolutely absolutely so let me
increase the speed and flame there you
go so by the time it is night probably
most of the people are going to come to
restaurant because you need to have
dinner and go home right so look at that
the crowd is increasing there so
probably at 8:30 or 8:45 or from 8
onwards I'll send coupons related
restaurant food coupons
do I need to send you food coupons while
you are in shopping mall at 3:00 3:00
p.m. or 4 p.m. does it really make sense
maybe no but are you most likely to have
dinner if you are in the shopping mall
at probably 8 or 9 p.m. in the night yes
it really makes sense so probably I'll
send you those chain of coupons you know
as an how it nears the end of the day or
things like that right so you can look
into how many customers did the
customers increase at a particular time
currently right this is on an average
also you see that how people increase 10
days average also so you can do all
those things in Footwear Footwear right
if you look into probably where the
drawstring go food and beverages then
maybe maybe it has increased on one day
or maybe most people start you know mmm
going to the restaurant probably at this
time right 8:15 or so 8:00 to 8:15
that's a range which is given there or
at 7:45 maybe right or maybe at 6:00
probably you don't like the crowd so you
want to have the food and just walk away
from there and how much amount are you
spending basically at 6:30 you spend
majority of the maximum want is spent at
6:30 so it makes sense for me to you
know probably provide you more discounts
and LU you at that point of time
followed by 9:00 and now 8:45 right
there are a lot of restaurants there so
your profit margins are going to dip if
you want if you if you are going to
increase the revenue because if most
people have to come to your restaurant
your store
then you have to provide something
interesting maybe sub of the day kind of
maybe special discount food of the day
for a special price and things like that
so that's
shot about the munch of you know
possibilities using tableau that's it
for the visualization today we are not
going to look in the visualization this
is out of scope also for today's session
right but I thought in order to bring in
that excitement and interest um I
thought of showing you this so do you
have any questions around this
visualization not the technicalities on
how did you get this and things like
that but hope you have understood the
logic on where table can be used now I
would say that you know this
visualization requires a lot of writing
some code in this table but calculated
fields are there in this yeah you need
to do some groundwork for this kind of
visualization but for this visualization
right there is not much that you need to
do it's a simple drag-and-drop
we will do this visualization also when
we come to maps and you'll be surprised
at how can we accomplish this kind of
beautiful visualization in five minutes
this is slightly advanced visualization
minded a promoter so we have taken just
a sample right it was just on a sample
if we take every one you would not see
any space here so this entire chart
would be filled with all the black icons
here all the human back like icons in
the entire thing would be filled by that
so if that is the case you know I cannot
show you guys you know clearly on which
person is moving where and things limit
so out of the entire population who came
to the shopping mall I've picked out
only few people and then just to show to
the management you know of the client
shopping mall owner we have done this
visualization done alright so here is a
quick introduction to data visualization
of course happen experience the
instructor needless to say that I've
been associated with the training since
long because I wish to pursue
my PhD moving forward in some kind of
research space which I've also finalized
shortly prediction of prediction is my
area of research
what does prediction of prediction say
the companies are predicting right
Amazon is predicting on what will be the
sales Flipkart is predicting on who
would purchase what product and
recommendation engine if you have
purchased this what else are you most
likely to purchase what are the
Association rules and all such things
right what if I can predict what
companies are going to predict will have
an edge yes so how do you accomplish
that not sure because will the companies
be providing you with the data not sure
if I say that hey I'm going to predict
on what you are going to predict I'm
going to predict on what Amazon is going
to predict and will that be helpful for
Flipkart or Ebay yes absolutely
whenever you have Thanksgiving Day and
things like that right what Amazon and
eBay or your e-commerce please do is
they start playing with the price on an
hourly basis
they reduce the price for some time they
increase it they decrease if they see
what is a buying pattern and things like
that every hour they're going to change
that just try out this time you know
Thanksgiving Day or any of the special
occasions right so it's going to
frequently keep customers on the toes
and also going it's going to bring some
kind of excitement to your customers so
if I can predict upfront and say that
tell to ebay that hey Amazon would most
likely reduce the price by five dollars
in the next one hour
would that make sense absolutely right
so eBay also can be prepared with a
strategy counter strategy to Amazon's
reduction of price maybe so this is
something which I haven't seen anywhere
none of your research scholars have done
that so far of course if you want to do
a PhD it should be an unexplored
zone so that is what I'm looking into
let's see how it works
all right so there's a live online class
you can ask your questions in class
right one more thing is class recording
in elements each and every class would
be recorded in elements if because of
some internet connectivity issue at URL
if you are unable to hear my voice you
can go to the recording I am sure that
the recording would not have any sorts
of disturbances there if you miss any of
the class do not worry you can go
through the recording you'll have module
wise assignments you'll have project
work at the end there's a survey
feedback which you need to provide at
the end of each class which is going to
help me you know align myself better if
you feel that hey you're speaking
nonsense in the class please provide me
that feedback I might not know that I'm
speaking on since I until unless I come
to know from your feedback or if you
feel that I'm doing a good job just
provide that feedback so that it might
motivate me also longer and at the end
you'll be getting a verifiable
certificate and this is a USP of a
Eureka 24 by 7 support at any given
point of time you can drop in an email
to support a trader a Cutco whatever be
the problem or queries that you have
they are going to come at you if it's a
technical query they're going to route
it to me and I might take some time to
respond to that based on the query that
you are asking yes uncle
gatech or MIT am i doing my PhD from
there is that your question I know one
I'll be doing it from is be Indian
School of Business is B's on par with
any of your global B schools right in
2012 or 13 I believe is B was standing
at 13th position global Khan power
within him so since I've done my
Master's there I have an edge they call
it as fellowship program all right so
this we have already discus you log into
your ed Eureka using your credentials
here is the course for data
visualization with tableau if you go to
my course tab you just need to click on
join class or click on the link which
you get on email here are the radius
modules that we are going to discuss
today will be just introduction to data
visualization very very basic things on
why tableau what is tableau and things
like that then from tomorrow onwards we
are going to get started with the basic
visualizations we'll do a deep dive on
visualizations right then someone was
speaking about maps we're looking to
that there will be some amount of
scripting when I say scripting it's
about creating your own calculated
fields and then you'll all
be able to play with time dimension
there that means if it is time series
how do you forecast and things like that
then what is your location this is also
related to your map basically and you
have incremental loading and blending
this is all about your calculations
writing code in tableau coming up with
customized visualizations rather than
using the default features then we know
that R is number one data analytics tool
as of now so how do we integrate table
with our that's the first part in the
second part is you all know that big
data is handled using Hadoop so how do i
integrate hadoop with tableau and last
but not the least I will be discussing
about the enterprise - boots on how to
create the dashboards and things in that
alright here are the broad objectives of
this particular module why is data
visualization needed in the first place
right how to make sense of the numbers
which we have in tableau are a numbers
that you have in any of the data sets
uses of tableau well how do you install
what is the architecture and what are
the features of tableau so these are a
few things that we are going to discuss
today mmm I use tableau on windows
because I'm comfortable with windows
sangkum so either way it works either
way it works Mac has its own advantages
but if you're not familiar with
Macintosh then probably ever request you
to go with Windows only either way it
works but I would prefer tab on windows
because I'm comfortable with me those
not so nothing great I mean there's no
differentiating factor there all right
so let us get started
why visualization right why do we need
to which one is that the first point
that we have all right look at this let
me use our that's a tool I'll be using
just to show you some interesting
insight here so there is a file by name
MBA
here we have NBA dot CSV let me open
that so you have I believe 700 students
with dear work experience and the GMAT
score that they have got in your GMAT
prior to applying to your MBA right or B
schools so here are the list of students
there we there are 773 students you have
work experience in the GMAT for you
might score off all the students now
what insights can you draw by looking
into this I'll scroll up and down let me
know what insights you can draw how
cumbersome is it to actually analyze
this entire data set it's gonna be
lengthy process right it's going to be
lengthy process visualizing this entire
thing is going to be cumbersome more
work experience lower GMAT ah not
exactly
look at this someone has got to not
eight months of experience 17:17 is a
fairly good school right if you're
looking to someone with 70 has 660
someone with 72 has 650 but one or three
has cemented so we cannot generalize in
that way right because there are seven
hundred and seventy-three visually
drawing any kind of management decisions
or inferences would be difficult if I
have these Calif textual data element in
tables instead I can probably try and
visualize this I'll be using are for now
because anyways we are going to get into
tableau discussion to a great extent so
let me tell me Sam this MBA data sits
now I can do something called as
histogram which is a visualization tool
right I want to do it on the GMAT score
so with me run that here we go now this
is making sense for me right all 773
students GMAX codes is represented in a
simple graphical format here if you look
at this I know for a fact that majority
of the people get approximately 700 to
720 score maybe majority of the students
fall in the zone there are very few
people who have a GMAT score which is
less than say 650 and there are very
less people few people oh yeah who have
greater than 750 score maybe so these
kind of inferences can be drawn so I
know that in this b-school people who
get less core where it lately get
admitted and people who have extreme
scores are very rare in a market also so
majority of the people should get 700
and above GMAT score to be able to get
through the interview process of the
admission process so you can draw these
kind of inferences using data
visualization rather than you know
looking into the excel sheet or a CSV
whatever format it is scrolling up and
down trying to understand what's going
on here and things in network this is a
good part about data visualization
because human brain is cognitively
limited right if I ask you to remember
all the 773 GMAT schools would you do
that would that be possible for you know
hence we have this visualization which
is coming into picture visual analytics
is a form of analytics in which you have
interactive graphical displays of data
why do we have this graphical
representation of data remember one
thing it can be used or their two
reasons why we use visualization
one thing is to bring about interesting
insights from your data that's number
one number two is to represent the data
to any of your stakeholders in such a
way that it's not cognitively taxing on
them if I give the management team this
particular or leadership team right or
any of your sequel to this particular
thing and ask him to go make sense out
of that it would be very taxing on them
my visualization should not be taxing so
when will this be taxing if I use this
kind of a visualization instead of using
a histogram if I use a bar plot isn't
this cognitively taxing on the people
how good is this in comparison to
providing them with an excel sheet with
all the 773 entries there right so my
visualization should not be in this way
it should not be cognitively taxing I
know for a fact that here there are a
lot of people probably right
but still it doesn't make a lot of sense
for me to use a bar plot that is the
importance of visualization do not use
any chart of your choice do not ensure
that it is extremely colorful our
intention is not to provide beautiful
charts our intention is to communicate
using visualization communicate the
business inferences business insights to
the stakeholders or bring about
interesting insights from the data which
we have that is your visual analytics
all about now this which
representations translate your data into
something which is visual were visual
something which you can visualize and
bring about the commonalities and
anomalies right what are the
similarities and differences in the data
set that can be brought out using your
visual analytics or tableau so what is
data visualization it's a technique used
to communicate information with the
various stakeholders right our primary
goal here is to communicate information
our goal is not to create a static
charts which doesn't communicate
anything that's not our intention we
want to communicate clearly and
efficiently and tableau takes care of
your beautification part to a great
extent right so you need to take care of
that all right what is the data analyst
activity right you would like to be able
to do what you would like to be able to
build tables graphs to answer some
simple questions about the data think
about Big Data it will run into millions
of records millions of rows how would
you represent those millions of rows and
Records in a simple visual format that's
the challenge that we have right so if
you have any complex questions like the
visualization which I've shown you
related to the store right shopping mall
and things like that for that you need
to know little programming language and
if you want to generate some basic
chants then you require no programming
skills you can change your graphs tables
everything on a click of a button just
by clicking on different graphs right
unlike your R or any other coding
language right wherein you need to write
some write a piece of code to actually
change the visualization here it's just
completely
graphical using the phase Grebe's so you
just need to click on it I'll show you
tableau in a while from now if you want
to give our co active and interactive
presentations right that's going to keep
them interested in engage that is when
you want to probably use a good
visualization too and it has to be very
user friendly so let me go back to the
tableau here and let me open a new sheet
there so this is how your tableau
visualization is going to look like and
when you open that this is a new thing
in tableau by the way right if you click
click on the tableau button there now
you'll be able to see this particular
view and few of the new features of
tableau 9 are as follows right oh yeah
this is a new connect window there
alright and sorry I'm on that so you
have a lot of different files to which
you can connect and there are a few
interesting videos to just get started
it's not going to cover the advanced
things but it's going to cover to a
great extent and you will come to know
about the various forums various
resources you know the conference's of
tableau and things like that and
visualization of the week supreme code
somewhere has used visualization so you
can come to know about these kind of
interesting things right you can connect
to excel text file Microsoft faxes any
of your statistical files if I click on
that right if I do a drop down it says
clearly that if you're working on SAS
you can connect to sass file that's the
extension of the satisfying 7b dat or if
you're working on IBM SPSS you can
upload or you can load that data sets
into our into tableau if you are working
on our you can upload those tools or
those data sets also into tableau what
does this say what is this information
convey to you about tableau does it
way to you that da blow is only
visualization tool or is it something
else
what do you guys think absolutely it's
not just fronting for statistical tools
uncle actually you'll appreciate once we
get to the end of the module or end of
this training right that you can use
code SAS code or any other code and then
you can yeah it allows customization
through code to help with visualization
absolutely on I can write our code our
code whatever code that I've written
here write whatever code that I've
written here I can write this code in
tableau also that's a good part if I'm
using some kind of a code in size I can
use the same code in tableau and run the
same command through tableau of course
there has to be some integration which
we'll learn towards the end of this
training so that's a good part if you
have any other files that you are
planning to connect you can do so
alright other fights here you have a lot
of extensions right tableau workbooks
workbook means only one sheet here I'll
go to that in a wine tableau package
workbook means the entire package
tableau data sources tableau extracts
right tableau package data sources a lot
of files right you have Microsoft Access
extinctions star dot NDB and star dot
accdb there you have your Excel
workbooks right character limited cube
files a lot of things so you can connect
to most of the data sources now when it
comes to connecting to the databases as
such look at that there's something
establish a we will discuss about that
in a while cloudera Hadoop sequence
there were my sequel article more
servers if you click on that you see
that
yo plethora of different servers to
which you can connect right I will show
you about Amazon redshift and how to
connect to cloud environment and you
know start displaying the visualization
from there and things like that the
interesting part is most of your Hadoop
windows because nowadays it's all about
big data people are speaking about right
so cloud era Haughton works map are so
these are the key players there so you
can use any of those pivotal greenplum
is there
all right Google Analytics Google
bigquery so there are a lot of things
any no sequel is there no sequel here
if there is no no sequel but yeah you
can connect to the other databases also
you can connect to the other database
also no sequel also you can connect so I
will briefly touch upon that when we
discuss about integration with Hadoop
right now let's get some on that now we
can connect alright so this is all about
your basic interfaces right there are a
few inbuilt data sources within tabloid
subframe for your own practice so there
is something called as super store world
indicators will be using these two along
with your coffee data set right your
coffee data set was part of tableau
eight point three or eight series now in
nine they have not included that but
we'll be working on that also to a great
extent so if you click on that click on
that you'll be able to toggle between
the screen strain there's a new feature
there in in tableau
right and let me connect to this data
source called sample superstore once you
connect to any of the data sources right
you'll be seeing something called as
dimensions here and you'll be able to
see measures I'll look into parameters
later on but for now looking to these
two right dimensions and measures right
and then we have these things which are
called as shelves
you have columns shelf and you have rows
shelf all you do is drag and drop things
on the column shelf and rows ship which
will become which will become very clear
for you in a while
and then you have this show me panel
this show me panel is a floating panel I
can just float it around and if I close
that it's going to go there to the
default I can maximize and minimize and
you have bunch of visualizations here
right you just click on that histogram
which I've shown in our right you click
on that and you'll get the histogram so
it's very easy very simple let me show
you once you can select any of your
measures the moment I select these
measures the default visualizations are
going to open up and here if you see
four horizontal bars cry zero or more
dimensions one or more measures right so
even if I have one measure this is your
measure even if I have one measure I can
go ahead and you know display the
histogram but by default you see that
this chart is highlighted there so let
me spotlight so by default
is highlighted right you see the blue
highlight so that's the default shock
right that's a default jump however
based on this profit measure you can
also generate this so I just click on
that is a histogram which got generated
and when you see if you see here the
count of profit and profit bin but if
all these things are done that's a
simple thing it is it is it tipped over
user-friendly it is right so so this is
all about tableau right now we have the
current version which is nine and
tableau is fast competing with most of
the other analytic players because it's
all about data scientists and data
analytics also so that's all i want--is
what is tableau basically it's a
business intelligence software and this
is built mostly bearing in mind the end
users your customers it's not that the
developers would not be using that
developers will use that however for the
small requests and all that your end
users need not come back to you again
and again they can actually do their own
modifications their own amends to the
visualizations it's very user friendly
right if you have some kind of slow
rigid systems it's not at all useful
slow rigid systems tableau 9 and 8 let
me open even 8.0 and show you that pun
8.3 ok let me show you one interesting
advancement of tableau 9 here the new
feature this bear with me when it comes
up all right
now let me open it away when I snore
anything for advocates room so here is a
new sheet that I've created new sheep
can be created by placing on clicking on
this new dashboard can be created by
clicking on that now let us do anything
anything of our choice um let me put
origin here and let me put the GDP or
life expectancy here if you notice the
mouse being ho word let me hold on to
this it has showed me that it's taking a
split second if you see it's taking a
split second I'm going to hover this in
on to a shear now let's again spread
second Africa a split second right I
shall leave my mouse pointer there while
I'm doing some presentation right I want
this probably this thing to be staying
there forever but after a few seconds
not sure whether it's ten seconds or so
that pop-up is going to go away again I
need to hover go out come back then it's
going to show me that once again now if
I leave it like that for a few seconds
it's going to go away so I might be
doing the presentation I might want that
to remain there so I need to again come
back move my mouse right however look
into tableau 9 did it take split second
no let me hold it take split second no
seamless look at that look at that look
at that I'm just holding on it's
changing look at that
the timeline has been reduced
drastically so what else are we
expecting lightning speed right let me
do a quick scatterplot and show you this
on all speed it is if you have a number
of other data points there do not worry
about this because we are going to
discuss about these things I need you so
let me put something here I am
whore my mouse that is what I'm showing
you to explain the speed look in there
is it taking you in a split second there
no no no absolutely no it's not even
taking a split second there so this is a
good part about your Table nine
another new feature so you know tableau
software was founded on the idea that
data analysis and subsequent reports
should not be isolated activities but
should be integrated into a single
visual analysis process what does that
mean so there are multiple things to
this
this means that say this is one sheet
that I've created I'll just rename that
to scatter plot do not worry we are
going to deep dive on each and every
visualization each and every step which
I am performing now we are going to
discuss in detail in the subsequent
modules this module is only about the
introduction I do not want to keep it
very boring by reading the slides as I'm
showing you these things right so say
this is world GDP right I can create a
new dashboard by clicking on that or I
can drag and drop these things so what
happens in this way I can show multiple
things on a single screen yeah multiple
things I'm showing right so I'm bringing
everything onto a single page and
analytics should not be different thing
if I right click on this i if i say
trend lines show trend lines i'll be
able to see the trend lines and i'll be
able to come up with a prediction model
how much time did it take for me to
build a prediction model two seconds
whereas if i were to write the same code
in our i'll have to write you know this
command linear regression is it there
somewhere yeah here it is linear
model is equal to this is a way that I'm
going to predict till all these things I
need to run this command after running
this command
it's obviously throwing error because
that data set is not loaded here and
then I'll do various other things here
right so rather than writing all these
things
it's just click of a button right but
it's limited it's not as exhaustive as
our
nothing can replace our tableau is just
a supplement to our the arc which were
coding that you do probably you want to
visualize are in tableau because if I go
to my senior management and say hey I'm
going to run a command for you and show
you how it works they're going to show
me how we write they'll say all right
thanks for your service you can move on
because who is going to understand this
code and who is going to understand you
know the underlying logic behind the
statistics and all that stay relevant my
intention is to communicate clearly and
efficiently how do I do that using
visualization right guys if you have any
doubts you can you can ask me right
you're free to ask me at any given point
of time so you you have to hablo which
combines data exploration and data
visualization in an easy-to-use
application format right so for example
say I am working on a particular data
set I want to view the underlying data
here all I need to do is right-click on
that and say view data you see the
profit and scenes can I explore
everything oh yes you can do so can I
highlight everything and copy it to an
excel sheet here you can do so can you
look into the underlying data I do not
want to just look into this data I want
to look into the data which is available
in sample superstore can I do so here
yes you can do so click on this
underlying you'll see everything how
easy is it how quick is it right so you
can do all those things
needless to say speed is one extremely
important thing in tableau because even
if your visualization is going to take
say 15 seconds people do not have
patience nowadays
no one has species because we are
working at the speed of light so that is
the important thing
simplicity it is very simple it's just
bragging drop and your job is done it's
very powerful because it integrates with
most of your statistical tools it
integrates with most of your databases
and all that and you know for a fact
that the graphs are very beautiful and
you have this it's very flexible also
because I can execute the are commands
from tableau so tableau he integrates
with our you can write commands that it
integrates with SAS SPSS most of the
fine su your job is cut shot when it
comes you know giving this tablet your
developers to work on that if a person
is good at Java if he says hey I don't
know how to work on tableau tell him
that you need not know table because
it's just drag-and-drop if he knows Java
you can execute those commands from
tableau so this is the power you have
wide variety of graphs and when should I
use witchcraft that is the most
important thing right I cannot use any
visualization of my charm let me ask you
this question is using a pie chart a
good thing if I have five different
categories to be showcased what do you
guys think is pie chart a good
visualization if I want to showcase five
different categories we have bent upon
pie right to a great extent how sonker
promote Norrish is pie chart a good
representation at all in first place if
you have five categories top says yes
any other thoughts are on that
because I want to if you are showing
single points of data for each category
yes example percentage uh-huh okay okay
say our under the same nectar processor
to show the market here etc okay
okay so let me quickly pull out one
interesting visualization and show you
wipe I shot is not preferred ah all
right I'll show that in just a minute
from now I'm going to take away the
sharing because I need to quickly browse
and bring about the data visualization
from different place all right let me
know once you see the screen and I want
you guys to comment on this on what's
wrong with this I'm showing the
percentages you told me that percentages
can be shown absolutely fine right we
can show no doubt about that now I want
you guys to you know let me know on what
are the bad things about showing these
things on pie shop give it up you will
see you son if a person right if your
client or if your leadership team is
aware of the basics of data
visualization basics then they are not
going to appreciate you using the pie
chart take my word on that
not exactly Sanka because even if you
have one category right you announ have
the same understanding basically I have
completely acknowledged that you can use
pie chart but there are a few tumbles if
you want to show the categories if there
are two or maximum three right like me
female person brought did not buy yes no
if you have those kind of categories
right so elections won by Democrat
versus Republican number of seats one
things like that
yeah I can use pie chart however give a
serious thought to this visualization
and tell me what's wrong with this
what's wrong with the spine checked I am
representing five things right as you
have told we can represent the
percentages right using pie chart yeah
we can use but what's wrong with this
it's beautiful it's 3d with a beautiful
animation here but what's wrong thinking
hard only one dimension out how many
thoughts from Yaron alright no problem
so my question here was what's wrong
with this pie chart what's wrong with
this might shock so if you look into
this here we have forty percent right
and here we have two
one person for me I feel that this 21
person should be exactly half of your 40
person approximately but I just get a
sense that you know this 21 percent is
maybe 75 percent of this 40 person by
looking into this graph the second thing
is the 15 percent here and another 15
percent here I feel that this 15 percent
has a major chunk in comparison to this
15 percent right and one more thing is
if I were to represent the same thing in
a bar format it would have looked not
simple for me because the comparison
becomes easier now what happens you know
what I need to work into this 40 percent
and 15 percent and then I visually think
about that once again though you are
giving me a visual representation once
again I am going to my visualization
world virtual world and thinking that
okay 40 percent and 15 percent so it's
less dealing that instead if I represent
that in a bar format I need not think
about any other visualization then you
have 15 percent here or 15 percent you
and you were nine percent there right if
I have this
representation I need not even worry
about how to compare I need not
virtually compare these things in my
mind those things can be avoided and
there is one another concept called as
data ink ratio data ink ratio see is
that whenever you are representing
something right your data should be more
ink
ballistamon
use less of your colors and all that but
try to maintain this ratio to ensure
that there is no open space left out for
example if I use a pie chart the four
corners here is gone just because it's
in circle shape right there's and I'm
not using the space it's waste now for
me the space is a waste right so these
kind of things can be avoided and you
know moving forward as and how we move
forward I'm going to explain you clearly
on why three-dimensional images are a
big no-no in a two-dimensional space
whenever you represent a graphical image
right on a computer or any of your
presentations it's a 2d space that
you're using all right this is my y-axis
and this is my x-axis I cannot have a
z-axis which will be pointing towards
you from your computer it will be
pointing towards you the z-axis I cannot
represent that in a 2d scale right so 3d
is a big no-no do not use that and pie
charts if you are representing two
categories differentiating two things
then it's okay to use but more than two
please do not use a pie chart if a
person doesn't know about basic
visualization he can use that and you
can get away with that but if the client
or your stakeholders are aware of even
the basics of data visualization they
will not appreciate you using that all
right back to a discussion here another
good part about tableau is that
you can work with every major data
source from Excel workbooks to largest
databases that's a good part once again
so even if you are working on Big Data
there is no chance that your system
might crash because you're not directly
work on big data files in tableau
instead you'll use Hadoop or some kind
of Big Data environment right try to
bring the data to a structured format
and from that data you come up with
visualizations that's a good part right
and then you can even extract data from
large sources and you can place that on
your local machine the speed is
something that I've already spoken about
and then then I've shown you right so if
you want to sort something if you want
to filter something if you want to group
something right it's extremely extremely
simple so if I were to sort something
for example line I want to go to profit
I want to quickly filter that right and
then I want only the positive things I
do not want the negative things probably
I'll go there and click on apply' Giada
so the negative things are gone now
simple house quick is my filtering right
and I know for a fact that there are a
lot of data points within that if you
look into the data it's not such a
simple data store right it's having how
many rows five thousand seven hundred
and eighty-four rules
approximately six thousand rules and I
could do a quick filter on that even if
you have a large data set which your
Excel cannot handle so you can proceed
with this one more interesting thing is
flexibility you can easily change any
part of your view to look exactly how
you want ranging from the point shapes
colors right let me show you that also
so see I'm not liking these circles
instead I want a different sheet and
click on that you I can select probably
filled circles or
probably if I do not like the size of
that I want to reduce the size of that I
just click on the size and reduce that
or increase that all these can be done
using simple navigation see how flexible
manage all these things we are going to
again discuss in detail right so I'm
just giving you a high-level overview on
what tableau does simplicity
drag-and-drop wherever you want sort the
data automatically or manually however
you want to do that right it's very easy
you have a lot of calculated fields
right so we'll get into the calculator
fields shortly right you can just right
click on any of those things or so this
profit ratio is a calculated field so
let me edit entry so you can provide
these kind of simple calculations so
what am i doing profit by CL is going to
give me profit reesh simple things such
a simple thing right and you know
dragging and dropping right I can remove
this region
I don't want region I want segments and
I want colors associated there you go
I don't want segments probably I want
subcategory I drag and drop that I don't
like this visualization I want a bubble
chart make it that and then tableau is
intelligent enough to you know select
most of the things if I don't like that
color I added the color I change the
color to different color so the thing
that I'm trying to bring to your
attention is that tableau is an
extremely easy thing right and if you
know sequel it's even more easy for you
because doing advanced of things such as
you know not trying to extract only a
particular field and things like that is
extremely easy let me show you even man
suppose you have big data that you're
dealing with and if you're collecting
connecting to a particular file say I'm
connecting to this Microsoft Access
database right
Coffee Shane was a was an in-built data
store in tableau 8 but in nine that we
moved on so anyways we have that file
available online you can download that
so let me open that there's a password
security required I click on OK
it has brought me your right either
I can drag and drop the entire worksheet
these are all the worksheets within your
axis or I can drag and drop this entire
thing or let me not do that let me bring
the fact is like our I can write a new
sequel new customs equal right I can
write that and ensure that I call in
only profit only marketing right or
specific columns based on some specific
conditions there right all that is
possible all that is possible there you
can write your own custom code or
whatever you wish doing you just drag
and rub that you write down your own
sequel command your job is done so that
is how simple it is in Tampa and once
you're done right how do you want to
share your file or table visualization
probably I want to store this as a PDF
document so you can print a PDF you can
save this PDF document and send it
across to your stakeholders or you can
save that as a different file or I can
save this as a tableau file only ends
here to tableau fine now the recipient
also needs to have a tableau file right
if he or she wants to view that what if
that person is
not keen on purchasing the license then
you have free tableau reader similar to
your PDF right you have Adobe Acrobat
Reader similar to that we have tableau
Reader which can open the tableau files
if you want to open Word document you
need to install MS Office if you want to
open your PowerPoint presentation you
need to install MS Office on similar
lines if you want to open tableau you
need to install tableau reader and you
can also publish your work to the web
for white consumption of reasons right
for example say I want to publish this
visualization ice can simply go to
server I can say tableau public and you
know save it to tableau public tableau
public is you can think about that as
cloud-based wearing I'm going to share
my files using this tableau public
cheering say I do not have a license for
tableau server I do not have a tablet
server at all where do you publish your
visualization either send it as a
tableau file and have the end-user
install tableau reader and read this you
cannot do any visualization changes
however you can just read that or
publish it to tableau public and then
have your users view that your
stakeholders view that or if you have a
specific tableau server you place it
there the good things about tableau
server is that integrity security and
all that is taken care of if you place
that on tableau public it's accessible
to the wide audience not just to you
when your stakeholders right it's
accessible to all the wine audiences I
use pub table public if I were to write
this in a open forum or display this
visualization to blocks and things like
that I can use tableau public if it's a
secure data safe banking data how can
you put it in a public domain
for that you need to have a tablet
server so the license party apart is a
little costly their tableau let me show
you that the licensing pot now click on
buy there you have the personal Edition
right but tableau personal Edition is
only for the data storing files it's 999
dollars professional Edition is for your
business purposes 1999 dollars per user
per annum all right and then you have
tableau server you need to contact them
for pricing but it's costly tableau
online it has a hosted version of
tableau server if you feel that hey it's
extremely costly for me I'm a startup
organization probably you can look into
this 500 dollars per user per year right
you have student pricing it's free for
students by the way if you can check out
on a Eureka whether you can use your you
know details that you're a student and
then get some kind of edge you know get
it free you just need to provide your ID
card then it's free for use right and
for if you are a not-for-profit
organization or if you are into
education sector then you have a
different pricing there you need to
contact them basically and see that hey
we are not for profit so all these
advantages are there so that's about the
licensing part right and Gudda fication
we need not I need not explain more
about that this is a statically very
pleasing and almost all the
visualizations in tableau are aligned
with your data visualization standards
or principles as in how we move forward
right though the data visualization
principles and concepts which one has to
abide when one creates a visualization
those things are not part of this
curriculum but I'll try to touch upon
those and here is a
halation and architecture feature
sentience we have tableau desktop which
is the tool that I'm using now you can
create your visualizations and share
those views on tableau and this has a
client-server architecture you can use a
visualizer or view your visualizations
on mobile clients or web clients or
desktop whatever is comfortable for you
right and tableau server is an
enterprise class business analytics
platform that can scale up to hundreds
of thousands of users that's the beauty
of one tableau server right you need not
worry about you know spending money on
purchasing multiple Silver's because a
load on one server is going up so you
not very much on those wines so these
are the bunch of reasons right if
someone asks you why table why not click
your why not some of the tool so these
are all your unique selling propositions
of tableau and one a good part is it
offers powerful mobile and browser-based
analytics nowadays it's all about smart
phones if you are still relying on your
desktops and laptops then we might be
outdated very soon right so it's the
world of mobile phones here is a tableau
product architecture so you have all
these data bases excel file word
document water we write Twitter that is
unstructured data IBM SAS verdict Oracle
you have all these things right from
these places you can extract the
information to tableau and start working
on tableau desktop you can query and get
the data of your choice into tableau
right and then start working on that
once you create your visualization there
are multiple ways that you want to
publish that information to the various
stakeholders and one of those is send it
as a tableau file to your tableau reader
right have them install the app your
readers and open
the file are if they do not have to
hablo reader if they are lazy enough to
download that then you can send it in
PDF format or Excel format or when I say
Excel the data suits as are when you
create tables right you can also create
tables in tableau probably those tables
or PPT format or word format right you
can send those or you can publish it to
your server that's the meaning of server
client architecture right so you can
publish it to server here the key thing
is security you can provide read access
to few people you can read give write
access you can do edit access to few
users and things like that there is a
cachet which will help quickly get your
documents which you have been accessing
there's a repository of all your
visualizations that are stowed there's a
presentation layer management and
automation so you might say that on a
daily basis I want this report to be
triggered to these stakeholders it does
that so this kind of automation is also
possible so one of the project that I
was part of right Nestle client so what
they have bunch of products that they
have and people keep tweeting about the
products say Maggie for example recently
there was an issue right because of
excess lead so people keep tweeting or
we have used a Hadoop layer we have
pulled this Twitter information using
flume if you know how to print flume you
know you might be knowing that so using
flume we extracted this Twitter
information right and then we have done
a word cloud on tableau desktop and we
put a condition that every 24 hours this
extraction of information happens 24 bar
7 right and then these reports would get
triggered word cloud would get triggered
once in 24 hours to the client from
there you know you can either use your
web browser
or mobile if you are a mobile user and
start accessing man is are unable to
hear and the Sankalp able to hear me now
so let me quickly inform promote able to
hear properly seems like it is an issue
with your internet okay okay fine fine
then it's fine because those are able to
hear or promote Sankalp and are able to
hear me so it's only you so just check
that connection huh here we have the
tablet server architecture we have the
customer data we have the data warehouse
data mounts you have the files cubes all
that and you have few data connectors in
between fast data engine sequel
connector MDX connector repository and
here are your main components right you
have a data server which deals with the
data you have your risk you'll serve er
which deals with your visualization part
and then you have the application server
this is the architecture you need not
worry much about the strength and you
have gateway load balancer so load
balancing is very important because we
are dealing with the you know Big Data
right if I put data worth Zera bytes on
the one server server tends to crash
obviously right because the load of that
server is going to increase tremendously
so what do I do
I probably want to balance out the load
by looking into failover servers and all
that right and then you have your
clients so this is your entire
architecture at the data I have the
connectors on how to connect to each
data source because tableau connects
with multiple data sources multiple
databases so I need to have these data
connectors because each database is
different and I need to connect with all
of those and then have the data server
which needs with the data you know that
tableau is good at which
so you have SQL Server and an
application server not just that it's
also taking care of your load balancing
that's a beauty
so you'll at no point you must feel that
the speed is compromised or if one sever
fails my data goes for a toss no you not
worry on those lines
it's inbuilt and that's the data layer
we have disk is already right and one
more important thing here is it's
in-memory data engine what do you mean
by in-memory anyone what do you mean my
in memory ram absolutely right so you're
going to save the details in your memory
ram read and write access would be super
fast how do you think how do you think
it's working seamlessly when I hover my
mouse without any time lag without any
time lag if I hover my mouse pointer on
to these red dots or green dots right
it's going to quickly display me the
information why is that happening
because it's in memory that is the
reason why it is super fast that's a
good part about your tableau and that is
one feature why you see the fast and
responsive things you and you have data
connectors we need to have multiple data
connectors for obvious reasons because
we connect to the various databases
cloudera how to harden works right map
are there multiple things and also you
can connect to the ODBC connector right
that's a knee deep connector there
they're too much of interacting with the
data one is live connection the example
that I've given up the nested client
right that was a live connection because
people keep tweeting across the globe 24
bar 7 if here we sleep people in US wake
up and then start tweeting if they sleep
we wake up and start tweeting so it's 24
hours 7 that the tweets are getting
generated hence I need a live connection
because I want I don't want to miss out
on any of the interesting insights
any bad thing which people are speaking
about I want to know instantly
immediately right or if people are
speaking about some enhancements to a
product I need to know that because
otherwise there will be a lot of human
cry in the media right similar to our
Maggie example India they have man
Maggie because a few people have told
that there's a lot of lead content if
this tweets were analyzed or social
media network was analyzed live they
would have probably avoided all that
denting of their brand the brand image
is dented in the public right they could
have avoided that how nourish has a
question if you have large data set more
than Ram can handle then that's the
limitation right then nothing in that
you'll have to probably increase your on
I'll probably divide your dataset are
probably if you feel that it's limited
then you need to do this if I were to
connect right or we can go to the data
subsea so probably instead of having all
these things I will write a custom
sequel and extract only those portions
of the data set which is of relevance
from these are all the workarounds
available Norrish so and then you can
establish a live connection using sequel
and the extreme pinch is there a
question or all right okay so these
things are things which we have analyzed
donor so in memory is something that
I've already discussed about right since
it's in memory the read and write
responses would be much faster data
engine can access disk storage as well
as information on RAM and caching memory
right that's a good one
ah here goes another statement nourish
for you will okay son
kalpas this question will we use it in
the cloud for this training no that's
out of our discussion but you know
probably I will show you something or an
Amazon redshift because I have an
account on that I'll show you on how to
connect the cloud and try to do that so
here is another answer to Nora's query
data engine can access disk storage as
well as RAM as well as cache memory so
you have three different places from
which your tableau data engine can
extract hence if you have a low memory
it will not impact to a great extent but
if you obviously use terabytes of data
to analyze it will be very slow in
response alright and these are the four
things which are pivotal to your tableau
server you have an application server
because you are connecting with various
other applications where these data
sources and things like that which ql
server is important because you're
generating aesthetically pleasing
visualizations right and these
visualizations should be in line with
your data visualization principles just
because I want to show you some
interesting visualization doesn't mean
that I'm going to show you some 3d graph
on 2d I'm going to show you pie chart
unnecessarily no it's aligned with most
of your data principles a data
visualization principles and then you
have your data server because you need
to manage data which is coming from
different sources and then you have the
background er which works in the
background to check whether there's a
load on a particular server if yes I
need to look into shifting the load to
another server load balancing kind of
right so those are the radius things and
also
does one more thing if you put automated
emails or automated triggers for your
visualization saying that on a daily
basis at 9:00 a.m. I want you to trigger
this particular visualization to the end
users or promotes question is that will
this course cover tableau administration
installing load balancing etc I know for
a promote tableau server installation
and administration is not part of this
program
all right you have the gateway and load
balancer which we have already discussed
you know spend more time we have
discussed about using the tableau
visualizations on your different
browsers web browsers and mobile
applications right so you can use that
if you have an iPad Android Android
Browser Mobile Safari and all these web
browsers are supported promote I'm not
sure whether a Eureka has something
around tableau administration that is
server support and things like that not
sure on that but obviously you have a
lot of programs around that in outside
world but Ed Eureka I don't think so but
you can get in touch with them and check
whether they have one such codes are
similar to your hadoop administration
right there is a course on tablet
ministration all right when it comes to
clients we know for a fact that we have
tableau desktop we have the professional
version and the personal Edition
depending on the license cost a few of
the features are disabled enable the
tableau desktop can be used to open any
number of workbooks which are published
on tableau server so if I have one
client open right this is one dashboard
if there is another dashboard on the
server I can open that also if there's a
third one I can open that so there's no
limit on that on how many Dashwood's can
be open simultaneously
how many worksheets should you be
working simultaneously right there's no
restriction on that and one more
interesting thing is look at this
dashboard if I make a change say you
or here I'll just change the color
orange line so if we make that change
right it's automatically reflected here
in the dashboard so I need not worry
about that that's the good part
all right you have a free tire trial for
14 days you can install that and start
using that if for some strange reason if
you face any problem right just ensure
that your antivirus and spyware is
disabled by you you know install that
download and install so here is a simple
installation this is you need not spend
a lot of time yeah it's up to 14 days
now right and for a license probably
need to check with at Eureka and this is
a screenshot of your tableau eight there
is not tableau nine I've shown you for
tableau nine right how the view looks
this eight let me show you here let me
go to home there so this is how it looks
like tableau eight and if you want to
open any workbook you need to click on
that and spry to open them
however in tableau nine the entire
looking file has changed
you just need to click on that go to the
start page there this is yeah and one
more thing is you know here if I click
on more servers I can just type whatever
server I am interested in but in eight
right I need to click on that and I need
to scroll there is no search so there
are subtle enhancements in the home page
between eight and nine there's a start
page section I have explained about the
start page section with respect to your
tableau mine and we have seen these
things also mark cards show me panel
these things
are not there in your tableau 9 this
screenshot is from tableau 8 basically
right huh so that brings us to an end so
let me spend some time in explaining the
basic navigation you click on map let me
open a new sheet here here is a new
sheet here are all the things so let me
click do an inbuild 8 store this data
here right contains all the data stores
which you are connected to as i've told
you if you know sequel write you can
write sequel commands and pull whatever
data you are interested in and start
working there is another thing called as
analytics here analytics so as you know
tableau is also good at analytics right
it's not just about visualization but
also dealing with analogies and you know
for a fact that you know not sure
whether you heard about this or not need
a scientist sexiest job of 21st century
your hardware Business Review has come
up with this statement which sees data
scientists would be the sexiest show of
21st century and they've also made
another statement here which says the
shortage of data scientist is becoming a
serious constraint in some sectors and
this is a trigger most often or this is
the trigger right for tableau making
life easier for the data scientists if
this is a stock right this is just a
stop it doesn't have all the advanced
analytic features analytics features
statistic features but it's covering
basic things here but the roadmap for
tableau is such that moving forward
people should be tagged to tableau not
just for the visualization but also for
your analytics purpose so if I were to
show you this right these are the
various triggers basically for tableaus
roadmap what is the logic behind
including analytics in your
visualization right these are the radius
reasons if you see here United States
alone is going to face a shortage of 140
thousand to 190 thousand people with
analytic analytical expertise and 1.5
million managers this is the reason why
most of your tools are ensuring that
they include the analytics but that's a
trigger though this was there in your 8
also though this it was their analysis
your analytics part was here also
um it's coming here as a different
section right and if you see this option
there if I click on that it's gone
oh my god is it gone where did it go how
do I get it back once again it's here
don't work towards the left corner this
is the dimensions pane as we have learnt
already this is your majors pane you can
drag and drop your filter here and you
see that there is only United States so
that filter doesn't make sense for us
probably state is gonna make sense
because I have all the states here so
whatever you want select you can do sim
that's a quick filter option there and
in pages right normally you tend to put
your date there any of your dates here
so it will throw you them the
visualization that I've shown you
earlier this part right how is it
getting played because I've put it in
pages right and I want those pieces so
it's going to scroll slowly and show you
a motion chart to put it there next
thing is your mark Spain in which you
have the color shelf which is going to
give you the color so let me do this let
me drag and drop the profits for each
and every segment there so if you want
these three to be colored based on the
category I drag and drop you see the
color category
if you want to increase the size or
decrease the size I can do so if I want
um profits also be on the label it's
going to show me the labels there if I
drag and drop if I hold my mouse there
right I see only profit category segment
and profit as a tooltip
but if I want sales also I drag and drop
on the details now if I hover my mouse I
see the sales option also there these
are the bunch of things that you need to
know here right and here you have the
column shelf and the raw shelf these are
called as shelves I drag and drop from
dimension pain or measure pain to your
shelves and here show me panel anyways
we know that right and one more thing
which I want to show you here is that if
I want to connect with our right I need
to go to hell' settings and performance
here it is manage our connection here
manage our connection so I will get into
that shortly right the sample workbooks
there are two right substr superstore
and world indicators if you want
regional data set also you can do soon
so there are a bunch of options here and
if you want to publish in the server you
can do so if you want to publish to a
server say you have a server tableau
server you want to publish to that all
you need to do is click on the sign in
provide the server name and say connect
you can also write a story this is an
interesting thing enhancement in your
tableau 9 once again so if you look into
tableau 8 no there's also 9 so here if
you look into a tray you have only two
options here one is your worksheet and
another thing is - boo the enhancement -
9 is there is a small icon here which is
called as story so you can use this as a
PPT also PowerPoint presentation let me
show
one one lasting woman so I think there
is a tableau our integration file this
one or this one so it has a lot of
hatshepsut this is by another person
right he has used this for his
storyboarding basically so you can write
your story this is your story right when
I open that story right I can put all
these kind of things images of my choice
I can write the text of my choice right
on the neck in provide all these kind of
things such as good as using your
PowerPoint presentation which is a
statically pleasing right so what
happens if you were to provide some
training on tableau do I need to go back
to the PowerPoint each time or do I need
to open the Acrobat Reader each time and
then come back to tableau show the
visualization go back that is what is
happening now right I'll go back here
I'll show you this then I'll come back
then I'll show you here instead if I
have these things in tableau itself
right it's easier that's a good but
right yeah so these are the basics which
I intend to cover in this session as
I've told you there is not great
visualization in session one from
session two that is from tomorrow
onwards we'll do a lot of hands-on on
tab and there are a few practical things
that you might want to do and for
tomorrow session right you just try to
learn the basics of text tables bar line
chart pie chart charts and a few other
charts I mean for next module it's
important and then in the next agenda
tomorrow's agenda we are going to look
into how to connect to the data sheets
and from there on come up with some
basic visualizations such as ticks
tables bar chart a line chart pie chart
basic maps and interpreting the scene
right
and I'll also ensure that you know I
provide you with the basics on how I'm
going to use these kind of chance
all right do you have any questions at
this point of time on nourish promote
Sankalp do you guys have any questions
no problem Thank You uncle all right
fine
so as I've told you slowly we are going
to build on this and go to the advanced
concepts so if you feel that you're not
exposed to the advanced concepts that is
not the fact they will be exposed once
you're clear with the basics on basic
navigations and all that you'll be
exposed to the advanced concepts so by
the end of this tutorial I am pretty
sure you are going to have a lot of take
away most of the advanced concepts
answer right ok since you have no doubts
thank you so much for your time
and one last thing is please please do
provide your feedback the moment you
close the session there will be a pop-up
window please provide your feedback on
that good or bad right so please provide
that thank you so much for your time
friends tomorrow we're going to connect
and take this forward and learn more
interesting stuff thank you have a great
day our good night for people who are in
u.s.
