guys hear my voice if yes please reply
thank you very much I got your reply
first up everyone thank you for
registering this angularjs webinar let
me introduce myself I'm finish and I
have nearly 10 years of experience in
JavaScript technology a nearly four
years of experience in this angularjs
framework and my day to day workers
creating angularjs custom widgets and
providing to the people x1 I used to
work on that notice also this is 90
today what so before we going to produce
session just there are basic things this
session is all aboard just 16 min
minutes but we can extern up to 90
minutes okay so each a every module once
I completed so whatever you guys have a
portion you can post your questions on
the question window I will be able to
answer forever questions because in
between if I answer for your questions
will be a deviating from the topic so we
may not able to complete everything
within this 90 minutes that's why once I
complete particular module I will check
all these questions whatever you posted
in this question window then I can
answer for your questions so let's go
into our today's session so this webinar
is all about so angularjs superheroic
javascript yummy w framework okay so
what are all the things we are going to
discuss on this particular webinar first
one why do we need to use angular JS
because in the traditional web
application mostly if you will be using
JSP ASP or PHP otherwise we have a
jquery library normally we will be using
that particular crime library if you
have these many options then why do I
need to choose one new framework for my
application okay i will be answering
further next what does hangar this so
you said the framework our library if it
is a framework what does it mean now i
will be using a framework in
back end so Java be having some
framework are young our asp.net will be
having some kind of MVC framework so
what does it mean by framework in the
client side not only why do I need to
use a framework on plain sight okay then
this particular angularjs is using a MVC
or MDW framework and we will be
discussing about that architecture of
our angular JS next angularjs framework
is having some important features mainly
if you ask me the main feature of
angularjs is data binding our dependency
injection custom directives filters and
n number of features we have so will be
basically discussing about some of the
features next one will discuss about how
can you build a responsive single page
application with angular JS these are
the objective of our today's session ok
so one more thing again so whatever
questions you have just post it in our
questions winter once I complete the
particular model I'll be able to answer
for your oceans so let me go to the next
line why angular.js so till this date
normally we will be using javascript
libraries not a framework first I how to
the difference between the library and
framework so normally this jquery is a
basic library so what does it mean they
build a set of functionality on top of
JavaScript so using the functionality so
like click event are moose or event or
binding these kind of functional is a
bit on top of the JavaScript to simplify
our one okay this is Sammy just some set
of functionality that's what they're
calling it has some library so what else
we can call it as a library good stuff
so normally who ever worked on this
response you're designing so they might
have know about at bootstrap right so
good shop is a library or underscore.js
so everything is having
set a functional living simplify our
work and life okay that is what the
library and framework these structures
you are cool which is having a rules
okay how to code it in this particular
way why do we need to restrict our self
why do we need to keep follow some kind
of rules ok so today we have some kind
of requirement and we build the
application there is no structure
anything then tomorrow some what else
have to maintain our same application if
you don't have any other structure or
rules that will be really difficult for
them to get to understand what we
haven't in our application that is
really difficult instead of that the
angularjs framework or any framework
gives a Bay or structure to your code ok
this has to be like this so keep your
model everything right here and all the
control our logic everything goes to in
this particular case and your view will
be right here like this it will
structure your goal with it will be
having some more functionalities that is
the main difference between a framework
and library ok this is the difference
then why do I need to go for angular JS
because we have n number of frameworks
out there like Amber James knockout
backbone and some other famous are also
available so why angularjs so here first
whenever we develop a web application
what are all the main challenges we
faced first one is responsiveness with
the different devices so it's a
responsiveness means it is not only the
CSS responsive design it so whatever
you're building so that have to work on
the laptop as well as the desktops in
the same time it has to work on the
mobile also you just leave about the
design it has to work first so because
all this client site program whatever
you are doing that will be running on
your devices so it'd have to be
compatible so if you are using some
other language or anything else that
will be
it won't be running in mobile or some
other times it won't be running in your
tab ipad tablet or anything so this is
one of the best wind mean problem what
we have the next one US divers of user
preference normally now I wanted to see
the same application with normal table
structure data are just some random
blocks but other they wanted to see it
like a graph structure or anything so
there will be very different kind of you
I screens are different kind of devices
everything will be there so we have to
satisfy all the uses that is also one of
the biggest challenge but we have today
next a jailable a JD so whenever we get
a new request from our claim ok so today
you have to build this one next in the
suddenly they will be changing the
request ok and I don't want this I
wanted to go with some other new things
so how can I go ahead with this so at
the time already if you build something
I don't want to change everything from
the beginning okay i need to change only
that particular part how can i do that
so is that possible any other framework
these are all the web challenges we are
facing in our development phase next
multiple skill set this is one of the
biggest challenge so for database
administration or anything else we need
our DBA people and server-side we need a
java or asp vehicle the new voice I you
need some kind of specialized in
JavaScript okay there are multiple
skills each we needed we can't afford
everything ask you are a project manager
then only really get to know for each
and every thing if you are keeping the
people you can offered everyone so I'm
getting the multiple skills and people
also it's really difficult so these are
the main challenges we are facing in the
web developer so for everything we have
a solution in angular days now let me
tell you the solutions one is the
responsive design
the angularjs if you are using angularjs
to build your twine say that does your
javascript programming so it will run on
all the system mobile everything there
is no restriction so our first problem
is solved next one is diverse universe
preference right there was user
preference so here what we'll be doing
this so in the same way one is you can
open it another different size of
devices or anything else next one is you
can create a separate view for each and
every users where you can switch between
these views that is really simple in
angularjs using angular views or you can
create a custom directive just pass the
data the same data will be can be
represented in one table of you are a
graph you whatever it is whatever user
prefer weekend we can give it in that
particular view next one is a jelly so
right here so whenever we we are getting
a new requirement from the clients so if
they are changing the requirement also
we can change only that particular
control of scope we need not to change
the whole application that is also
possible in our Anchorage's next the
multiple skill set so this is a one more
trouble okay right here on the US side
only the people who are having a
JavaScript knowledge they can build
everything they don't need to have
something like a JSP resp knowledge all
right so if I my UI developer if I know
JavaScript and the basic knowledge on
angularjs I should be able to build an
application I don't want any multiple
skill set people's right there in my UI
development space in the same way if you
are using node.js on our server side
still we don't need any other people who
/ knows javascript they can't build an
end to end up with it right with this we
can solve all the challenges what we are
facing in the web developer next one so
what is angularjs so angularjs is a
JavaScript framework where you can build
application on top of it okay so here
you can specify the structure for your
client side so normally there will be a
structure for your server but here you
should be able to define your structure
okay this is my model this is the data
what I am getting from the server I
ought to keep the data over here and so
this is what my view so all the
presentation layer whatever he needs to
do it that will go for this view next
one controller so in the controller path
you can write all the business logic
validations everything okay so this
angularjs is a framework where you can
define your code structure you can
increase your code maintainability next
one so this angularjs system 20 I
JavaScript framework created by google
so if you see if whoever wants to have
more control on our client site in the
traditional application we won't be
having much control on our cleansing
whatever operation we wanted to do a
business a business operation or any
other things just will pass the data to
our server so server will do everything
then again will be getting the response
will be showing the response so you are
you a workers getting the data I give it
to server and whatever they are getting
with us from the server you have to
display to the user because at the time
we didn't how much power systems right
so you cannot do very large amount of
operations in your browser so browser
was not capable the time but now in the
browser itself you can store 10 mb of
data using our global storage and it can
handle multiple process also so why do
we need to baste your web browser this
much powerful browser so whatever the
business logic sundar violations
whatever you wanted to do everything we
can do it in our clients I did so so it
will be lightning purse instead of
sending the data to server and getting
back the data and one more main thing is
it is really similar to our history FML
attacks and whatever we have so we used
to call it as a directives in angular JS
everything so similar to nom on
JavaScript and CSS HTML there is no much
so it will be really easy to learn
languages so him so who is this guy
misko hurry so he is the one who built
our angle it is so his way of thinking
about the angularjs is it is just not a
framework ok so it is a compiler where
you can create your own HTML elements so
first what does it mean so normally you
guys know about the basic HTML elements
like do span input everything so each
and every eats having its own property
if you are giving input I pick on the
text it is giving a text box if you are
giving do it will be a block level
element in the same way you can create
your own element for example whenever I
want to create a new element i will
create something like the nation block
so there is nothing is there in the HTML
but for that particular element I can
give the look as well as the
functionality so that is what we are
calling it as I directive and so the
misko every sterling so it is not only
the framework it's peaches the compiler
where you can create your own HTML
elements and attribute to it let us the
main important an advantage of angular
JS so we will be discussing about this
custom directives also in this
particular webinar next one who are
using this angular JS because if only we
are using angularjs are if you are
opting this angularjs for art project
what will happen is whenever we are
getting into a trouble so we won't be
getting an answer from any other forums
right so whatever questions you are just
you can put it in the forums like a
stack or flow or anything else so there
you will be able to get the answers so
if you want to get the answer first many
people have to use the portable of
framework right so if you see the big
brands like YouTube definitely that is
bought by google so whatever this
framework also made by google so they
are you
see angularjs in there you do
playstation 3 version next one the paint
a enough so most of them you can have
seen the Patrian app in your browser as
well as the mobile both are using
angularjs for a client site next one's a
netflix and the freelancer com Weather
Channel calm these everyone are you see
angular JS so if you are opening that
code you can see lot of angular elements
or angular directives you can see it in
their code so next let us see what is a
single page application puzzle
significant occasion means anomaly in
the rational application first you will
be having on JSP or asp bitch and you
want to navigate to the next page the
whole page will reload so whatever data
you have it in the scope you will lose
it instead of that i want to have only
one HTML whatever pages i want to know
just I want to load it like a frames
using their routes I want to reload only
a particular part of my HTML whenever I
want to navigate from one page to next
page don't be lowered the whole bit just
load particular HTML inside down other
HTML how we are doing it in the eye
frames okay so that is what the single
page application that we can achieve
using angularjs if you are using ng
router or you a router we should be able
to get that particular functionality in
our application next 21 so in the
angularjs what are other components we
have so first weather um so in the beg
UA will be considering one is HTML CSS
and the basic JavaScript work so the
presentation layer that is what we are
calling it as a view so all the HTML so
how your application should look like
and what are all the styles colors see
everything you will be defining it in
never visible UI layer next your
application layer so this layer only you
will be writing
angularjs programming to implement your
business logic and all the validations
everything and if you are using any
other keys so as I told like routers or
anything so everything will go under
this application layer next one is data
access layer so mostly with only the
client we can't do anything so we have
to get a data from our server right so
to impact with the server we need one
particular layer so here in angularjs we
will be using dollar HTTP to interact
with your server so it will be getting
the data as a JSON or XML and we can
display those data or information to the
user through your presentation layer or
the HTML next one is sometimes you will
be getting the fixin data the data one
we change always will be safe so then
why do I need to query the server or
database to get the same data so we we
are using almost everyone is using the
latest browsers like a chrome firefox or
IE levin riu tab so eating everything is
having one feature called local story
that is the html5 feature so you can
store up to take mb of data in your
browser memory sir so he put asus patek
data if you are feeling that never
changes just you can keep it in the
browser member so whenever user opens
the same application in the same machine
so instead of currying your server side
yes it will take all this data from over
browser memory itself you from the local
story so using these things only we will
be building a basic angularjs
application so next one is the
responsiveness so the main thing is if
you are telling the responsiveness
everyone worried about the or gates of
CSS park so how to view this application
it is not how to view whether it will
really to work in all the devices so in
angularjs will be worrying about other
will it work in angular
I mean will it work in all the devices
or not this is what we have is a
responsive design but if you want to I
mean look into that CSS designing just
we have more frameworks like bootstrap
are what is a foundation these are all
the CSS framework you can use it in our
application to get this responsiveness
okay so before we go into the next slide
do you guys have any other question
let's spend three to five minutes for
your questions so so first from our
shape so he is asking can you go a
little bit slower chirac shape but
anyway it is only 60 minute session
that's why i am little bit rushing
through okay we'll go a little bit
slower also from here so from minute we
have a question can application layer be
made up using node.js so first no Jas is
not that client side component so you
can't use this node.js to view your data
are you can't do any other client side
operations using node.js that is your
server side layer in your UA itself I
wanted to have an application layer I
mean in the client site itself I want to
have an application layer that you will
be building with angular JS so first you
have to understand the difference
between no chairs and angler gates no
Jas is for only the server side
component which is built on C++ which
can compile a JavaScript so that is our
server side part of whatever you are
doing with the Java php.net he can do
the same thing with our node.js but
angular JS is a client-side framework
where you can write all this client-side
technologia the presenting layer when
presenting the data just transferring
the data from client to server for this
will be using angular JS it answer your
question minute
so again so let us go for the next
question how do we apply security to
application so first one right here
whenever you do a data transmission we
have some kind of JavaScript framework
which encrypt your data so for all that
data transmission just encrypt the data
and send it to your server with the hash
board so you in the server again you can
decrypt the same data with this
dashboard so like that only you should
be able to get the security on our
application so from ruthie we have one
question so how angularjs is better than
an awkward so right here in accession
mostly we won't be comparing the Ember
knocker but let me tell you what I feel
this about the angler chase so mainly
angularjs don't need any other
dependency like a knockout re ember so
knock out an M where we need a jquery
and underscores ayres this kind of
dependency we need to run this novel but
right here in angularjs there is no
dependency just only this angular JS
library is more than enough to run
everything so some of the jquery
components also available in angularjs
as a jake you might suit nsl main
advantage next one there are more uses
for angularjs so what will happen is
whenever you are getting into a trouble
or if you are having any of the doubts
just directly you can post your
questions in the forum you will be
getting more response in a week that if
because we have more use of startup so
they might have faced the same kind of
problem so we'll be getting the response
is very quickly the third one is there
are more modules available for angular
JS so for example I wanted to build
something like a drag and drop stuff
right so if you see the NOC code will be
having very less amount of models there
because there are no not much users are
available so here in angularjs we have n
number of third-party modules just
whenever you want get the power take
this module and you can include it in
application so you need not divide
everything from the scratch that is the
best advantage or best part what I used
to tell in angularjs that's why i prefer
angularjs over ember or knockout so from
veneta we have a question what about
designing partner so energy is you can
implement your distance logics and
validations so the designing part
everything depends on your CSS there is
nothing to do with angularjs on the
designing part so all this logic we can
implement with our angularjs on the
client side so so beneath is asking so
how can it be used to create a data
access layer normally what are you
happiness in your server side we will be
exposing all this adversity ApS whether
it is a Java or.net of node service so
we will be exposing their escapees so
you have to consume those exposed rust
ApS to consume those r staps will build
one layer on our angularjs using the
dollar HTTP so which can interact with
those rusty APA's and gets their
response or post the response to the
service and we can access those data
using our daughter HTTP method in
angular JS so that is what we will be
using so from magic we have a question
is angular JS only SP a app how to make
it up work with multiple pages apps so
the single page application means it is
not like it will be having only one page
so the main HTML will be wanted one so
whenever you are navigating for example
I have home page content contacts page
settings page and something else right
so the 11 HTML will be having this menu
and a body right so inside the body what
we are going to load will be having
another HTML whenever they click on this
particular home or any other apps we
load those HTM
inside this HTML so your parents cope
are the main page of your application
that is calcium single only just
whatever you have that's funny one you
are not going to have multiple pages so
your parents cope all these things if
you are navigating to any page that
doesn't matter you will be having one
parent scope that is what we are calling
it as a single page application in
angularjs so from shruthi we have a
question can we integrate bootstrap with
angular like a model of good stuff
containing the knockout form so we
should not use multiple frameworks in a
single application right so it will
increase your page load so that is
really main thing you have to worry
about so it can be just a 50 kb or 86 kb
that doesn't matter so it will increase
your page book so you should not use
multiple frameworks in a single
application that is the first and you
can integrate bootstrap or any framework
with angularjs model or anything also
that doesn't matter so let's take a last
question then we can move to the next
slide how can we use router so this is
the question from Bravo so there is a
two ways of using routers in angular JS
one us NT router that is angularjs
inbuilt module available so whenever you
want just you can get this MZ router
from bangladesh page itself but it is
having some kind of restriction you can
have only one level of you you can't
have a child you are parallel views that
is not at all possible in the NT router
instead we can use angular UI router so
using this angular UI router we can have
n number of views and you can have
parallel views also that is the main
advantage of using angular you Erica so
far you've inversion so we have these
two routers if you ask me the best
approach to use the router is angular UI
router ok so let's go to the next slide
but i don't i know the I didn't answer
for many of
questions so you can put all the
questions you know or he'll break up um
so I should be able to answer for it
because if answer for all the cushions
we can't cover whatever we plan for this
particular webinar sorry for the case so
let me go to the next line so but the
angularjs in data here so the angular JS
they are carrying it as a yummy see our
mvw framework first what does it mean so
in the server side you might have hear
about Izzy amazing framework young
stands for model so the sort the data
whatever you want to play out that's
what they will be calling it as a model
and next one view view is your
presentation layer whatever the HTML CSS
and other stuff you already like so that
is why we are calling it a semi next
controller so right here in the
controller only we will be writing all
our validations business logic
everything so what will happen is
actually whenever you get a data from
your server thus data you can't assign
to your scope of your particular
controller so scope is nothing but it is
like instance of your controller once
you assign a data to the scope so here
it is having won best feature called to
a binding so the same scope you can
access it in your HTML also using the ng
model directive so whenever you are
changing the data in your HTML
automatically it updates the scope
variable or if you are changing the
scoop automatically it updates the view
because of this to a binding feature so
how does it happens normally in
angularjs controller internally there
will be having one service called down
and watch so which part just all your
scope variables so if any change happens
in the scope just it will trigger a
method so which applies all the changes
whatever happened so it will
automatically update the view so
updating you means it won't reload the
view just it will update the data this
is normally to a by Nick happens so okay
this is clear MVC framework so what does
it mean by MDW because
there is many things available languages
it is not only the control so you can
write all your logic using the
controller directive are we have many
things over there so that is why if you
see it in angular JS form or other
places there will be a big debate so it
is not a MVC framework it is yummy vm
framer so BM means it is a model view
model because you are not at all writing
only the validation our business logic
in your controller that is actually it
is having the view model because of that
money whenever you changing the data it
is changing the view right so someone is
correct as a viewmodel some modern
groups calling it as a controller still
there is no conclusion so it is like
yeah be so model use fixer and W stands
for whatever you can call it as a view
model or a controller or unproductive
whatever it is however ok so that is why
the MVC rmvb m RM BTW framework normally
if you ask me just i will be going for
Emmy me w so because it is still not
able to fix because i am willing i am
writing all this controller logic idea
in the same time I have my scope model
also so if I update my scope
automatically updating the view if I
update the view it is getting changed so
that is what we are kind as a viewmodel
so still we are not able to put it out
so still we can make it as I am VW okay
so what are all the features available
in our angular JS so the main feature as
I told first Werner's the way binding
our data mining in the NOC jquery so if
you want to have a text box if you want
to give the data will search through the
Dom will find the particular class or ID
as a value to it and if you want to get
the data from the text box against us
through the dog get that class or idea
of that particular text box then get it
so it is really tedious process instead
of that if it change my data or
something in my js so it has to update
interview that's your hesse amo so for
that we can use the angular JS to a
binding so in few minutes i will show
you demo how can we implement
scopes and other stuff next one is
angularjs directives are expressions so
cyber's will go for expressions normally
in the HTML itself I want to compile my
JavaScript use the desert for example 1
plus 1 and I want to write it in the
HTML so i will be getting some wizard so
nominee if you write 1 plus 1 year in
your Hestia what will happen is it will
print 1 plus 1 1 it won't you too so if
you want to compile your JavaScript on
your HTML you will be using this
expressions next one directives so
angularjs is having an inbuilt directive
so those are all like of ng-click or
controller or whatever it is that is
nothing but a set of functions which
already there Billy where we can use it
from the frame that is what they kind of
directives okay they have already enough
directives but I want to build my own
directive something new for my project
specific directive that also you should
be able to create it so far then what
you used to call it as custom directives
in angular JS next one has services
sometimes you can have n number of
controllers in your angular JS
application you want to share the data
between these controllers so how can we
do it so further we will be using the
services which connects these two
controller and we will be sharing the
data between the controller using the
services next one is filters so if you
want to modify the data or such sort
everything can do it in your cleanser is
no need to do everything from the
database sort search and all stuff so
we'll achieve all this logics using our
angularjs filter and in the same here we
have n number of features of available
like a module to school validations unit
testing and dependency injection yeah
this is the main the dependency
injection sometimes what will happen is
whatever data i sorry not data whatever
the functionalities i need i can inject
those functionality into my application
using this dependency injection so in
angular JS whenever you declare your
you will be giving some kind of empty
braces so if you are giving empty places
I don't need anything else except my
application instead I want to use some
other features some other
functionalities so we will pass those
thing as a dependency injection so
whenever the leader for our application
at the time we can inject those
functions are methods to our application
okay this is what we are using you are
calling at us and dependency injections
in angularjs so it so how to build a
responsive single page application using
angular JS so let's go to the power
first program let me go back further
right here I want to create our first
program so what we need is let me create
a new history ml1 just I am going to
call it as index dot HTML next you need
to download angularjs script file from
our angular JS over G or you can get it
from lower or you can get the Syrian
link also but already I have done
ordered this angular JS script file you
can see it over here I already have
angular dot window JS file so this one I
am going to include it in my index dot
HTML so first let me open this index
2.html in the editor
so that's why it will take seconds to
load okay got it what so this is the
normal HTML page let me create my first
angularjs program ste ml qualified this
is the shortcut what we have in the
sublimator if you want to create the
html5 program this type HTML 4 and 5 and
tap it will create a structure of your
history MFA program so let me call it
has a demo and first without any other
angles a yes first I am going to launch
this up and i want to show something
hello world ok let me keep it in the
food so it does me easy for you guys to
read let me open this particular HTML in
the browser now you can see there is no
error nothing and in the sources if you
see you don't have anything except eva
index dot HTML and it is showing hello
Bert now what they are going to do I
wanted to do some operation let put it
this way hello world 1 plus 5 so if I
save and run it in the browser it won't
compile just it will give 1 plus 5 money
but I wanted to combine over there in
the HTML and so I wanted to do some
other operations so how can I do it
first I want to include my angularjs
script file to make my application as a
angularjs app so let's include the
script file scrub source equals so I
have all this data are all the script
file in the library lav folder ok so let
me put library / angular dot Minn dot
J's this is where I have my script file
okay now I lower my script file so does
it mean is it tangled
application so Lyle we try that so let's
go over there refresh so if you see
console there is no error in the sources
we have added the angular got winded as1
so now we have added angular JS curve so
is it was still why is it not converted
okay sometimes you have to add I
expression to convert these thing as a
JavaScript compiler so let me add
expressions so this is how we'll be
adding expressions in angular this so
save it this try again what has happened
still you can see the same brackets it
is not about compiling already we have
included the angular min file why is it
happen so once you are including this
angular min JS file what will it do vers
it will search for a directive called
eng app so once it finds the directive
of ng-app then only it will define okay
this is where my application starts till
that time you won't consider these HTM
was as a angularjs application it will
be a normal HTML file that's it there is
nothing about this angular JS so just a
HTML is having a one file called angular
winter days so it is not behaving like
angularjs application so to make it as
angular JS application first improve
this angular winter Cheers next one
incluye mg app so once you include the
MGR then only your angularjs will
understand ok the full HTML is a angular
application now if i add this mg up in
the body the whole body will be the
angularjs application everything will be
compiled whatever we are writing so now
the whole HTML becomes the angle of this
application let's try it what happens to
whenever I refresh now you can see Dover
here the 5+1 become a 6 whatever you are
giving inside that double rubber braces
so that is what we are calling as I
expressions in angular JS it will
compile and it will give a result of
that particular variables now we got six
over there ok so
this in angularjs what else the new
features we have the main thing I was
talking about the two-way binding so
let's birth I input type equal to test
and ng model so this is curve will be
binding the data to the text box ng
model equal to me just consider this is
a scope variable now what I wanted to do
whatever use reenters in this particular
text box I want to print right here let
me create on what is to tap so I wanted
to print here so I am giving the same
name whatever i use right here so mg
model equal to name i am passing the
same scope variable right here to my h2
time so that is your past in between the
flower braces so the scope variable will
become file and it gives the data if I'm
giving the same name without this flower
brazzers what will happen is let me say
so now you can see this as somebody
named you don't compile it it will be
considered as a normal string so instead
of them we can mark it as a expression
so it will this name will be compiled so
whenever I run this you can see it is
empty because the model also empty it is
compelling and it use the desert as
empty now if i enter any other text you
can see that text is automatically
coming right here if you want to achieve
the same thing in jquery our normal
javascript what you needs to you have to
watch for a key of the event in your
text to pass once the kia parents get
the value of the text box and get that
text or idea of this particular data and
bind those values this really tedious
instead of that you have to aim any
future so we are changing the view so
this is the HTML issue of you whenever
you change the view your model easier me
so this is where the all the data
available so the model automatically
gets updated now models got updated
again I am trying to use the same order
right here so he dominates the view so
whenever i chi mei
change in one place automatically
triggers a watch and watch listens for
these kind of events and it updates the
model so model making updates Cuba view
so this is what we are calling it as a
two-way binding in anger Jason ok now we
created a basic app I want to create a
app and multiple controllers and other
stuff so further what you need to do
first you have to name your I am going
to call it as dim get my app name is
going to be a deal so let me get a new
one that means save it as custom dodd
chase ok so we have to include the
script file right here so script so
sequel to custom disease so now maharana
next one first to bootstrap the
application so what are you be doing is
where you are half equal to angular dot
module ah you were happening whatever
you define right here I defend it as a
demo so market as a demo and if you have
any other dependencies or anything else
you can mark it over there but I don't
have any dependencies for me up so I
will be giving empty places now we
declared our the bootstrapped our
application name so you want to write a
controller so what are your business
logics and other stuff I wanted to build
it in the application I want to put it
somewhere else so that is where we will
be using the control so after controller
so how do we write it first give a name
of the controller just i am going to
valid as a test CTR then function so
whatever the parameters you want to pass
to the controller just pass it right
here I want to use dollar scope inside
mecca power so as I told you guys the
dollar scope is nothing but the instance
of your controller for example if you
guys are a Java developers will be
having a class so the class can have a
multiple variables methods so if you
want to access those variables or
methods or a livings will create a new
instance of your class with that instead
we should be able to access your
variables and methods so like instance
dot that particular variable name so you
can get the variable or instant star the
method name you can access the method
name in the same way whatever available
in your controller so if you want to
access it will be accessing to your
instance that is what you are scope so
first I want to create one scoop
variable inside my controller I am going
to call it as Darla's co dot maybe not
name maybe in our name okay so this is
what my scope variable I am going to
call it as an angularjs so now this
scope am L will be having the value of
this this is called anger days okay now
my controllers ready I wanted to bind
this controller with my HTM so how can I
do that so let me do it whatever piece
of code I have it right here so let me
create a deal so i am going to append
the controller in my deep so
ng-controller equal to your controller
name whatever the controller I may have
just control now if you are including
anything right here inside this
particular deal so everything will come
under this particular controller so all
the scope variables are methods whatever
we have it in the controller everything
can be accessible inside this particular
controller okay what does it mean so let
me create or normal hitch one time so
where I want to see that see that data
what is available on this within our
name so copy this and put it in our edge
wonder now whenever we load the page it
will load this controller from the
controller first this will be undefined
or empty next once the controller is
loaded for this particular scope
variable we are assigning the value
called angularjs so the variable
got change so this variable has been
used in this particular HTML so it
obtains of you that's why what happens
is whenever i refresh the page you can
see angularjs idea it will go to the
controller part let me put a debugger
point so this is go will be debugging in
our JavaScript arregle days so I put
kept a debug apart whenever I reference
the application till that time it is not
about having anything so once you load
the controller just i refreshed it
automatically it loads the controller in
the controls the controller is loaded so
what will happen is it is a signing the
scope variable of maybe not named equate
anguishes so the disco variable got
change till the time it is undefined you
can see it right here so after this lion
this scope a even become angle at the
year and it this scope you got change it
updates the view so the same angular JS
will be available right here this is
normal angularjs is working but now I
wanted to make it little bit composite
here what I am going to do this I am
going to create a button ok so before
that let me create one more text box
input i pick all the tests and ng-model
equal the username then what i am going
to do i want to create one more button
so which is add user so if they click on
this particular button I want to
whatever the name available in this text
box I want to add it in a list and are
needed to list everything how can I do
that first let's go one by one first I
am going to add a key given a user so
this is a method so you whenever click
happens on this particular button it
will call a method call
user this ng-click is a angle it is
director now let us go back to your
controller first this username will be
undefined so let us make it as a so let
it be a undefined I don't want to worry
about that for now let's go ahead with
this next I want to create own method
because there is no method is available
called add user in your control you
throw an error so let me create a scoop
method and dollar scope dot add user
equal to function right so whenever I
click on that button I will come over
here so here just I wanted to print
whatever we have in this particular text
box so how can we get the data da Das
Gupta username now let's save this let's
go back under pressure I don't want any
other debugger so let me remove it so
let's go to the console of this
application I am going to see it Rekha
add user now you can see it right here
so whenever I click on the button it has
come to that particular function and it
reads the data ID give it so why didn't
do anything else just I gave the same
modeling so whatever model Liam binder
to your view so whenever that's a few
changes update the model and we are
getting the data from the water level
but now we are going to make it little
bit complex i am going to create one
more scope variable called users are
user list so i am going to mark it as a
re so first the user list will be our so
whenever you shall click on this add
user button I want to add a coupon data
to those users so how can we do that so
let's go over here dollar scoop dot user
list dot push whatever data you have it
in your dollar Scott burning circling
dollar scope dot user name so
whenever I click on this button it will
read the data from this scope a haber
and put it in the others copyable card
list once it is done I want to show that
list also so controlled our God scope
dot user list so let's go over here
refresh so was i am adding hello and so
now you can see the array array is
having only one value in the same may
going to add one more word godhood so
again added so now the ra is having to
sew in the same meaning you can add a
number of words everything has been
added to the RA but I wanted to speak to
the user otherwise just if I have it and
the console no wonder how can i display
so here we have one important directive
called ng-repeat so however far loop
what's on your javascript in the same
way we can build a object over here or
we can build a data so let's go over
here h2 is use information next you will
ever yes I wanted to list all the user
so yelling so in each and every time I
add a user it will create a new Allah
idea has to show those information so
here I am going to use the directive
ng-repeat ah whatever the array you
mentioned right here it is a user list
array so you suggest so here how do we
write a foreword so user in use ilysm so
first time the first object will pass to
the user and will be having their
particular gives object next time we
will be having the second other if the
user list is having ten object first
time it will be out in the first second
and second third temper like that each
and every object PD available the whole
this term our lever right here then it
is just started so I want to print those
user in my LA so if I have n number of
user list automatically creates the LA
event and will be printing those uses so
let's see how does it happen
crush let's go over here hello ah so now
you can see that one next I'm going to
add wood and X angle is right so
whenever he added so the data will be
pushed to do this you surfaced are a so
this array be hydrated using the
ng-repeat and we are printing those data
on your HTML we are weak the C code is
really simple nothing on simply if you
want to do it to JavaScript watch the
Eva to get the data created you yellow
the object and find their way out any
tedious process now it is really simple
we are passing the data we are playing
around with the data right here instead
of playing with the Dom elements that is
the main difference between the
angularjs and Jacob okay so before we
move to the next light if you guys have
any other question please post your
questions in the question window let's
spend five minutes to answer all your
questions
so vanitas asking k tell me about data
access like SP darden we have SQL Server
ok so this is your one in a cleanser
application right here if you want to
store the data or if you want access the
data you need one server side language
without server-side language you cannot
do anything so still you need your
asp.net and SQL but here what they are
going to do is the hey speed art net
will you expose your services instead of
writing the code in the ASP the aspx
page will be writing a basic HTML and
the history Emma will be having a
gorgeous framework and we will be
exposing all the web services in the
asp.net so that from the antigen score
will use the dollar HTTP method which
calls this exposed to air sta PA and
will be getting the data and we can bind
those information in our cleansing
angularjs doesn't have anything like a
SQL server side stuff so it is one debug
blind side so unless you need to use the
ASP or Rob jsps I Java whatever it is
you have to use it for the server side
we are not going to test the server we
are changing the whole client side of
your application next question from
tropical so he is asking what is the
editor me so this is the subjoined
editor it is le coup for all this
JavaScript development mainly I love it
all the shortcuts what we have if you
want to create some kind of table UL li
it is really simple so minute is asking
for is asking me to open the code window
they open the code window and we'll be
answering for your questions okay now
mine either is asking can we have a
controller inside a controller yeah you
can have it you can have n number of
controllers so for example we are going
to have a pair
roller and child control so again it is
like normal java inheritance so consider
i have a bad class and child class size
class inherits our extends the bar now
what happens whenever you create a new
instance of your child you can access
your child method as well as the parent
method but from the parent you can't
access the child the same way you can
create a number of controls the pair and
controller child controller and
grandchild control so this child
controller can access the parent so for
example in the child controller I have
dollar scoop that name in the parent
controller i have task okay costly so if
i try to use that parent controller
scope variable in my child controller
that is possible it will cue the data
but the reverse if i try to use the
child controller scope variable in the
parent that would he will give em t or
undefined it is normally however we have
this inheritance in our normal job
so from Arnhem we have a question how
much angular 2 different from this all
these directives and expressions work in
angular juice too angularjs to also be
difficult I mean built not difficult so
different mostly there is no concept of
controllers so here there is a new thing
is available like directives so mostly
will be having each and everything is a
pieces components okay so in angular JS
1 dot x or wonderful if you are building
everything with only the directive
without the controller you should be
able to easily migrate to into them and
you're just too because that is not
having the controller logic it is mainly
into your directives and whatever
remaining remaining things I said the
dependency injection and expressions and
other things already have that is
totally simula but the only difference
is there is no controller on it so you
have to build the way of program will be
little bit different on angular to taco
so from mini three have a question how
how is it the bootstrap different from
anklet is so bootstrap is a CSS
framework there is nothing to do with
angular JS so it is just for a styling
purpose so if you want to write the
functionality you have to go with
angularjs so that is totally different
angularjs is a JavaScript framework and
the bootstrap is a normal CSS framework
which house of JavaScript library utter
so from a III have a question it Israeli
valiant question as most of the code is
written on the client side is it not
exposure to the security that anybody
can modify the functionality by just
downloading and changing the server side
code on their vision okay exactly so now
right here what you're going to do is
you will be adding on your server side
validation is also for example I'm a
hacker just I can put a breakpoint on
the server I McClain said record I can
make a change for example i want to send
some money like a 500 rupees instead of
the pie under i can pass 5,000 rupees so
consider i have done the validation of
your eye on them in my bank account i
have only 500 now when it goes to the
server side we should write all this
validations in the server side also so
you can't always believe with our
clients it it is not only in angular JS
any frame or anything because that is
running on the client side mission so
for example if I open any other
application I will be getting all the
coral automatically my browser downloads
the whole scripting and will keep it in
my browser and will be running it but
the server side code I can't do it that
will be in some area somewhere server it
will be there okay so it so you should
not show or any other confidential
information you should not do it in your
client say it can be angular JS p or
whatever it is but so sometimes that is
it is not much security threat one thing
is do the encryption so they can't get
all this encryption at all so only they
impact the data when you transfer the
data from your client to you a plane to
server that is the main thread one we
have so for that other than what we can
do we can add all this encryption logics
in our angular this code which encrypt
the data send it to the server and the
server just decrypt it again but main
concern is whatever validation and
whatever security stuff you wanted to do
that you have to do it in your server
side also you should not under
percentage believe the Kline's
you are doing it in the on the client
side because to improve the performance
you do everything maybe the Lightning
was so from money that we have a
question how can we web service call
using ajax and jquery ok so here instead
of our Jax will be using a dollar HTTP
using the dollar HTTP we should be able
to call all this Web Services or staps
that is what we used to call it in
angularjs and from abhishek 16 or you
have a pushing how the product the
javascript code or how to verify the
code any two there are many tools are
available something like if you are
using a grunt and other kind of task run
up which VV through this you can
compress all the good that is one way
otherwise online JavaScript tools are
available just copy paste you are
javascript code to it so kind of JS
compressor and other stuff khabib is
your code on it until can't compress it
will create a unified version again take
that one man only we have to shut off
that if you have a friend the you can
configure the task automatically which
creates the minified version of your
code so the two lemons grunt are gonna
also you can use it so minor is asking
how can we clone the input text using
angularjs so you don't need to clone so
that same day we are here we are sharing
the scope of your variable so if you
want to get the same data you can use
the same scope variable but if you want
to modify the data without changing the
words the scope variable there is one
method or the coffee so angular not copy
which coffee is your Roscoe variable and
you can keep it in the another scorpion
equal or another normal JavaScript
variable also and from shruti we have a
question which server we use with
angularjs for validations that is for
validation you don't need any server the
validation will happen on your client
side even
you can write it in your the angular JS
framework itself so that is what we will
be doing so the angular JS which works
with all kind of service it can work
with the java asp.net anything that
doesn't matter soothing is asking so
what is it for security so security yep
so from the angularjs will be passing
the data so you can pass the data to any
server that is note it angleton is not
dependent on server or a platform you
can use any server there is no
restriction so Oscar whose line is
asking for the spelling of grunt g are
you en t that is what it is a tool you
can configure it using node and switch
it is asking using good star plus
angular node.js will it slow down the
application to be frank the next
generation of application will be the
mean stack application so which will be
using MongoDB don't chase angularjs and
Express when we built this application
with this fourth component will be
lightning fast so that will be the next
generation of the application so from
man Jesus asking can you answer for you
my question so Monday's can you post
your question once again I think so I
missed your question
okay so I got the money goes in so Mandy
is asking for how can we do the image
upload enjoy angular.js normally for an
image of your body we doing will be
creating multi-part file so using that
multi-part five only you can upload so
normally the form type will be a
multipath and take on the sub video it
will you submit the data so instead of
that create a normal file upload just
the file in the input tag then get the
data once you get the data using the
HTML file feature whatever you wanted to
read you can read it or you can read it
as above so once you get those buffered
beta you can create your own multi-part
object in the JavaScript and and that
multipath object as a form type r of
your dollar and HTTP method and send it
to the server so that here the logic is
you have to create your won't multi-part
file in your dollar HTTP then only you
can upload the file so let's take the
last question from babadook umemiya
pushing one is for testing the core in
angler guess what can be used mostly
some people will be building the
automation testing for angularjs
application so for that you can use
jasmine framework with the product that
is a one more tool which built on top of
the selenium so to use the we can use
that to create all the automation test
cases for your anger this application
and if you want to build any unit is
cases for your angular JS will be
normally going with the Jasmine
framework so that with jasmine are much
also we can use it to create all this
unit is cases okay so now again we have
only 20 more minutes let me cover the
other topics
so let's go to the next line right here
we have seen our first angular JS
program and we created our controller
and we have seen what is the need of ngf
everything so let's go over it so now we
need to build angularjs fais quoi de me
first we need a basic text editor and
the latest browser if you want to build
a whole application we are normally I
prefer no traigas compared to Java SP
everything so we can run our own node
server and we can put all the data in
the MongoDB then we can create a basic
thing like a login form with the
application we can create a new user
user user list updating the existing
user lists and relatives of us okay this
is the basic application now we can't
we'll do everything together so already
built application let me remove this
application form so we are going to demo
it let me go back to this project and
folder to the project
okay so this is the project what we have
so right here whatever I have no
DiMaggio's server-side components it is
all about the servers ok so I built
everything using the node.js server but
here this webinar is more specifically
for anglet is so they are not going to
concentrate on this server side part let
me show you what we have in our client
side so let me delete this thing let's
open the folder of this one and here you
have indexed on ECMO in the index 2.html
I named this app as user management okay
so whenever so if you are mentioning
this user management app first you have
to bootstrap this out so right here
let's go over there you can see I
created an angular module love you's a
mannequin next the first example if you
have seen we have a empty array but now
the array is having one more value
called UI router what is it so this is
what I was talking about if you want to
navigate from one page to next page or
everything if you want to create a
multiple and parallel grouting will be
using this particular compound so if you
are wanting you say any directional
components include those external
components as a dependency injection of
your application now we have injected
this you were out the next you have to
configure your you a route so if your
URL is / login open this particular HTML
if you are URL is / hope for this
particular this chamber so now it won't
open the HTML directly this is where we
have a small if you see it in your body
we have one more directive card UI view
and it is empty so whatever the HTML and
other stuff you are opening
automatically that will come over here
and the history of mods will be loaded
on this particular index 2.html there is
only one HTML always that does index dot
HTML and remaining HTM us whatever we
have the login dot HTML so here in the
pages we will be having everything so
like in our HTML list our HTML home
HTML everything will be loaded inside
this one okay this is what we are
calling it as a single page application
so let me run this app fast so that will
be easier of one-eyed in the terminal so
before I run this app I have to start my
mango instance Irish will throw error
now my Mongo instance has been started
you can see right here it is listening
to the port number 2701 sir now
everything's ready now I can start my
node server also so let me start this
node ab dot J's ok it's not clear clear
it let's put it like this so now my node
server has been started and it is
listening to port number 3000 so I a
configured power port number 3000 let's
go back and I'm going to market as
localhost colon 3000 so here so the in
deficit is loading the index dot HTML
once the index HTML is loaded
automatically do will call / angularjs
control of all ran the first file
adapter js so in the apt ideas if you
see it so I don't want this particular a
purchase I mean this is one more like it
so in the aftertaste if you see it first
I haven't figured the routers so in the
router if there is no match available I
wanted to open this login as a default
router of my application okay so
whenever I know that is a stable base it
will opening it is changing the URL /
logon so when I have written all the
functionalities when the URL is / login
who open this particular HTML page login
dot HTML so if you see the over here
here i will be having the line into HTML
and the login dot HTML needs to have
this like in control so let me open its
la guitare HTML and like in our control
in the line that HTML I have nothing but
username and it is having a scope
variable of dollar flying in that user
not username and like introducer not
password
having the login method whenever I click
on is login method it is going to the
controller here i have this login method
and which uses the dollars cook sorry
this is a dollar HTTP so i wanted to
pass the username and password to the
server to get information so the method
of post URL which pass this information
to the AP AP / user / logon which passes
the data and the current will be having
the console mentor then you will be
having the response so once you get the
response if it is success just go to the
home are just throw the error okay error
occurred or whatever the message we have
so this is the basic functionality this
is so we'll be making a dollar HTTP
method whatever the method name and the
you are so let's go over here and like
it themes and I'm going here to have the
password out so this okay so I don't
have any other user name or password on
this one let me get anything going to ye
ok so in cave username and password as a
tests test so it is validator the same
data was available in our database also
so actually it we came over here so it
right here it went the URL has become
home / list so if you see again our
after day yes I have home home which is
having the child you a router are you i
use so that's why it will become home
dot list and the URL s list and the
pattern URL is poop so it will become
slash home slash list so whenever it
becomes like this I wanted to load the
listed on HTML so in the mr. HTML if you
see that will be really simple I will be
having a table head and the ng-repeat of
whatever user list i'm getting i will be
getting all the data and if you want to
sort will be using the filter of shocked
by the first name so it will sort all
the information with this possible the
so the list dot j/s will be getting once
you go into the controller will make a
call to the dollar HTTP method the
dollar SGD weather gets the data and
will be getting all the information
so this is the main thing about angle
ages now we are in the user management
in the same way you can go to the create
meta so this is this page navigation on
17 if you seal over here the URL changes
the if the URL changes using the
configuration is the lower than other
HTML pages from the HTML pages we can
display all the information or if you
want to post the data other thing is
possible right here so once you are done
with everything just you can click on
sign out it will take you back to the
luggage this is the basic application
we've built using normal egregious and
next I will be showing you one more
application which uses the rich
angularjs animation and other stuff I
built it is for my personal use let me
shortly let us all about mid crew
capsule just for rookies members I have
done this up now if you under same
router i'm using its angularjs
application nothing but here we have the
logon so if i want to register anything
i will be clicking on this thing so
instead of normal page navigation
automatically it will give all this kind
of animations so here also if you see
there is nothing but the novel page
navigation using a router but here i
have other animation there is one more
modules are available or the ng animate
include that module are the dependency
injection to your application so if you
want the login just dense and then so it
will take you to this login and here if
you want to chat with multiple people
who are available everyone will be
listed on this chair so he should be
able to charge and we can navigate to
each and every bit you can see here on
the top everything is nothing but the
URL change each and every URL change i
am just redirecting this application to
some other page and we'll be getting the
informations but i am doing it with some
basic animations again you can build
this kind of rich applications also
using angularjs with to del bootstrap
CSS framework so
this is what a fairly we have for our
two days maybe not so if you guys have
any other questions you can please put
your questions on your Posse mental have
10 more minutes
from Abby shake we have a question can
begin this code sample a savvy shake
please contact our iterator support so
they should be able to provide this
particular webinar code sample and the
same video also will be available in our
it recording and from tropic or via one
more question can we have more than one
you I you in a single HTM oh yes you can
have a multiple views in a single HTML
but just you have to name it as
different so that is what we are calling
it as a parallel views that as possible
using ng if you are using mg router you
can do it further you have to use
angular UI router so with that you can
have a parallel juice so money she is
asking how to configure lower component
compa lower to download the components
for angularjs it is a simple first
install NPM in your mission or node so
once you install the node automatically
it will take the NPM you're getting the
NPM you can install them over let us
nothing but NPM install hyphen G power
so you should be able to get the bower
components in your vision so money
Sharma is asking can we create online
chat using angular JS it's a for the
client say whatever you need you can
build it with anger there but the
service is a push technique and other
stuff we can't make it so for the server
side you have to go for a node or
anything else I built this one with the
node so argit is asking why do you
prefer more JSO ever java and the server
side Solari the java is mostly
synchronous programming and the main
thing I worry about the Java is the
multi threading concept right so for
example if I have some kind of herbs
stop it will go eat in every line by
line first line may take one of I have
multiple process
so first process taking five minutes
sorry five seconds second process is
taking only two seconds now what will
happen totally it will take seven
seconds to complete all the process but
if i take node.js it is a sin Cara's
programming so all the process will be
running parallel in all this multi
threading and other comes which also
will be handled in tomalak you need not
to worry about everything and that is it
is main thing is a synchronous program
that is the main advantage of notice
that is why I used to go over no day is
over java and one more thing we have a
main thing called a socket so the java
you will be getting only the request and
response but if you want to push some
response to your client side that is
possible only in our node.js so as it is
asking is there no need to for any HTML
for more attacks to get post in angular
exactly there is no forum leader we do
everything with dollar HTTP method
from mother is asking do we have to do
anything additional to get the
application responsive so as a CSS
responsive you have to include the
bootstrap our foundation CSS framework
and the blind side you can you include
angularjs to run the same application in
multiple devices you need to include
these two fights that is the main thing
so money she's asking can we use the nvm
on windows exactly so don't get npm a
lot better i install node in your
windows automatically that will pull the
nvm so whatever i am using my operating
system is also normal windows seven so
just i install the node with autumn and
with note you will be getting the MPN
also so just go to node.js or watching
you can get the Nolan mpm so my nigger
is asking how can we create a static
Heather and the footer for all the pages
so normally if you want to create a
static header and footer you fix your
index HTM under the header and footer
and create a body which has this view a
router so whenever you are navigating
using the URLs automatically that it
will change only this body now the
header and footer so let us say we can
build this normal a single page
application
so which way was having question can use
angularjs in SharePoint sites yes but my
concern is don't the complicate more
frameworks in a single application that
will affect the performance so if you
are using some framework for your
clients I just go ahead with the only
one framework but so i will say that
doesn't matter you can have anything so
server-side one framework trainsets
Kandra that is what we need don't
complicate your application with
multiple framers so money that is having
version so you said bootstrap will slow
down the application does angularjs has
any other framework so minor I didn't
say it the bootstrap will slow down the
application so bootstrap is totally
different bootstrap CSS framework okay
so if you want to create the CSS
responsiveness like what do you say so
whenever you are opening the page it has
to look similar on all other devices
nothing nothing about the work look
similar that we will achieve using the
good stuff if you want to work similar
that we can achieve using angular JS
that is totally different but instead of
including your good stabbed rjs you can
include your angular spam that is one
more thing so because the bootstrap will
go for the dom manipulation to avoid
that we can include angular step in the
application that will be helpful do you
guys have any other questions
okay so we came to the end of our
today's session so before that ravi
prakash is having one question what kind
of filters are available languages so in
the filters we have something like order
by search upper case lower case and you
can convert that babe you see the dead
filter number filter these are all the
inbuilt filters are available if you
want you can create your own filter on
this angular JS also okay so unlost we
came to their so intercession so what
are the things we discussed on what what
we have to take it so first we discussed
our last single page application next we
are discussing about them as a as
framework then the features right so
that the way minding our dollar HTTP
variables and other stuff with a
discussing so now which we might have
have answer so what is angular JS so
framework and you know give a structure
to your client side code with more
functionalities thats what languages
next we have seen the basic features
whatever we have it in English yes we
can't cover everything in 60 minutes of
90 minutes that's why we have gone to
the basic feature next one we are
discussing about the single page
application using the UI router Allaster
we where we did the very basic project
on angularjs these are all the things we
needed in our today's fibula okay so
last we have three more minutes if you
guys have any other pushing speech both
to push is on the question window okay
guys once again thank you very much for
attending this webinar and this session
whatever we did today so that will be
available in about eight or a curbside
in the same time if you want whatever
would be used in our demo if you want to
get that you can light a makeover to
support re-break or calm you should be
able to get reply from them so again
thank you very much have a nice day see
you bye bye
