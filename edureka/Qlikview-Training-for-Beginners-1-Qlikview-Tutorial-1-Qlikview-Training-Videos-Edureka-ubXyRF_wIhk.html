can post it in the question window
saying yes alright I receive couple of
answer that you can hear me so let's
start with our webinar today the quick
view what's your business question my
name is abby sugar guav and today i am
your presenter here for walking you
through with this webinar for you so
let's quickly see the agenda so you know
today is so we'll go a little bit into
the brief history of quick view we will
see how it is originated and couple of
other things
why quickly as compared to other BI
tools we will just look at a brief for
comparison with the other industry
standard tools we will look into career
opportunities we quickly just to give
you an idea what are the currently
available opportunities you have with
quick view advantages of using click
view we will look at a couple of inbuilt
its memory technology and a couple of
features that it provides which is
explore advantage or using it
understanding how companies are adopting
click you can look at a pattern which
quick you have seen and then enhance on
example we will look into one of the
examples which is one of the pre-built
dashboard which comes with quick you
even you can explore it once you
download like you and finally we will
have the question and answer session all
right so let's begin with the brief
history of quick view the begin Tilton's
a quickly was founded in Sweden in 1993
by the jomsberg so they were couple a
group of guys who originally started
with as an consultancy and they
originally give this tool name as quick
view which means the quality
understanding interaction and knowledge
so once they are moved on with
developing the product and the their
main intention was
by designing the product that it it
should mimic the way the brain works
so with that they basically hire couple
of guys who started working on this and
they initially written wrote this
QlikView program into EXO yeah you may
be surprised by saying that but yes
initially it was treated in axial using
a lot of pre lookups which was looking
up the data based on the selections or
based on the values that was entering
getting entered into the respective self
but that is quite an history now now you
have a full-fledged click virtual so and
reached now the customer base has
reached to 24,000 I think it is even
more than that today the recent stats I
have is somewhere around 30,000 and that
is spread across around 100 countries
and employs over 1000 people worldwide
and this market capitalization is
somewhere around 2.5 billion so it's
it's a major global company having a
cross having a presence across hundred
countries and the its offices are also
in more than 25 different countries and
and they are counting the new customers
and and the offices occasion
so why click you in this section we will
look into the patented in-memory
technology what what it is if you have a
served on the internet about the click
view and then you must have came across
this term in-memory technology so we
will look at a very high level what
in-memory technology is and we will see
how it works maybe I'm not in a position
to show you its background architecture
how it works but I will try to give you
a part which you can visualize to
understand how its in-memory technology
works faster bi solution development so
it's quite faster when it comes when you
compare it to the other tool we will
look into it how how it does it it's a
it's an infographic that I will be
showing you complete suit of reporting
analytics that is what RNA means so that
means right from data integration to
data modeling till presentation so we
will look into this and at the end of
the session I will give you the quick
demo where I will be showing you not
only you can present dynamic
presentation which requires
click-through as a tool but also you can
create static reports which you usually
need to give it to your senior
management or sometimes as a tax or the
presentations to your management and
finally we'll see associative user
experience so what it means you must
have also a came across to this term
what is associative user experience so
we will look into it and with the help
of an example I will try to show you
what it means all right so before I
begin with the first point which is
patented in memory technology I would
like to mention that while I will be
showing you or the visuals and the
different sides I will be switching
switching to a quick view as a tool to
give you a better idea about it so I
will be flipping between presentation
and click you the software ok so let's
move on to this pretended in memory
technology that's a simple infographic I
was able to come up with to show you
what is what it means by in-memory
technology so in so if you have served
the Internet the in-memory technology is
that it takes all of the data which you
are giving it wire different sources for
example Excel or databases or maybe some
other custom sources it takes all that
data does all that calculation it as it
has a lot of great scripting
capabilities and then finally load all
of that thing into the memory and then
all the magic in the front end happens
into the memory that's where all the
associative user experience or the
selection where which you know all the
charts and updates chart and matrix
updates all these things have
then in the memory that way its RAM
consumer consumption is really high so
so it is always advisable to have as
much RAM as you can in your system if
you are working on a very large
databases on a very or on a very large
application because everything is
happening over here so to give you a
just a thought about how an in-memory
technology work I will just go back to
or click to the quick view application
and I have here I am showing movie
database so let's go to the to the
dashboard what I have so here I have all
of the data already loaded how it is
loaded it is the data is loaded via the
added script into the quick view so if
you have seen it here is the way in via
which you can go into edit script events
you click it you basically see all of
the data or all of the tables that you
have loaded but either via XLS or or via
databases it has all these different
kind of capabilities and I will show you
that once I get on to that page or to
that slide so all that thing happens
over here all this calculation that you
are seeing which I was mentioning into
that calculation area on that blackboard
the side that everything every
calculation happens over here once you
load this this basically loads entire
data into the click View engine and
click you engine takes the data from the
RAM or all of the memory of the RAM to
do all of the calculation here in the
front end so if I do any of these
selection whatever selection I have done
based on the chart and matrix everything
is updated it is it is updated very fast
because it is half it is happening with
the help of the RAM as you are aware if
you are using this as your space to do
to patch all of the data or calculation
as compared to ram it will be slow
when you use RAM to store all of your
data and then to fetch it as per your
requirement it will become fast and
that's quite quick you pioneer on this
term in-memory technology because it has
provided these capabilities where
whatever selection we are trying to do
here
all of this calculation is happening at
the back end for these respective charts
and matrix okay so so that's what I
really mean by an in-memory technology
that all of these calculations after the
data load happens into the memory and
memory is not nothing but the RAM memory
of your system and that's why click U is
able to respond very fast to all of your
selection okay go back to the side so
after in memory technology I have faster
BI solutions development so if you if
you have seen any of the IT deployment
or any of any of the BI deployment it is
always via the IT route where IT takes a
role of suggesting the to making sure
that tool is adhering to all of the
policies it basically pushes the
management to to implement this tool
into the organization and then basically
they take all of the management and the
development of the reports and
dashboards into their hands and that's
where the most of the problem come where
you know the cycles becomes very large
the implementation cycle becomes very
large and the end user really have to
wait a lot to basically get a simple
change into the report or to add a new
report into its existing package so
because of that earlier the VI solution
development was a bit lengthy process
where you have to do well or where you
have to go through IT to do any of the
small change or new development but when
it comes to the click inside of defense
you basically so click you basically
gives
this tool in the hand of tea in the
hands of the analysts or the business
panelists who are actually working with
the who is actually working with a
business now because click to is a free
to use for a limited period or for the
limited period of unlimited number of
documents they basically gives you all
the power in your hand and because it's
the script chain and writing the formula
is very much similar to your sequel or
excel that's why it becomes very easy
for an analyst to quickly grasp and
understanding about this too so in this
case when the tools comes into the hand
of an analyst it they basically quickly
generate the reports and dashboards and
give it to their end users even if there
is any change as they will be in direct
calls for they will be in direct touch
with those guys and each implementation
of new change or addition of the new
feature is comparatively very fast so
that's where IT comes but it comes very
late into the picture when all of your
dashboards are familiarize or you need
to roll out the - code then obviously
you need to take IP role for doing the
data preparation and governance kind of
work as as it is mentioned over here but
you as an analyst or as an person who is
working with the business or with the
flying directly you have all of the
power of report and - for development in
your hand and and that's why you are
able to give you the faster solution to
your to your stakeholders so so this
this picture talks a lot but that's bit
in a nutshell which I have explained you
that it can take any of the data source
which is mentioned over here and quickly
creates a analysis by directly working
with the business once you have your
dashboards and reports ready you can
take IT help for rolling out that - bulb
or the major group of or for the
organization wide users so as they are
saying over here for business users who
is actually an end user it's a
self-service analysis they can create
their relevant and
Alyce's on the fly it is a feature given
on the click use server that if the end
user need to create some kind of custom
metric on their own if they are aware
about the feature they can create it and
they can do these change analysis on the
blind so for this I I do not have
anything to show it in the quake group
as it is more of a theoretical concept
that's why I try to give you an idea why
the solution development click view is
comparatively faster with as compared to
the traditional tools so so major role
of IT is reduced and you are directly
working with the user IT comes into
picture only when you need to roll out
dashboards and reports so let's see this
a complete suit of R&amp;amp;D and after that I
will take a couple of questions I know
you may be having some questions so I
just don't want to rush through all this
life and take each and every question in
the act so let's quickly see this slide
and then let's take a couple of
questions so be ready with your question
so complete suit of RNA reporting and
analytics so what it means that it has
different kind of layers so first one is
the data layer where you can fetch the
data from almost all of the different
kind of data sources which is available
today even if it is not available then
you can write your own script or that
obviously you need to have a pro or
professional into this by understanding
it scripting guidelines and everything
about how to write that custom data
module but you can get that data into
that quick view then you have you are
basically loading the component the data
into the in its memory which is via the
load script so I have shown you that
script let me quickly go back and show
you the added script section so here is
the edit script which is being taken
care over here so here basically we are
loading the script by hitting this load
button and then it comes to e an
aggregated data into the RAM
or it can be aggregated based on your
the way you are writing the script we
will look into it how you can write an
aggregated or aggregated data when you
will actually come into the class and
see how things are happening why are the
different types of scripting and then
associative search engine comes into
existence because the data is in memory
all of the data is related and it
started producing the results why are
the aggregation engine and presentation
engine so these are the different
components which is working together to
basically roll out the presentation to
these different kinds of devices whether
it is a system or whether it is iPad
iPhone or Android or it is a PDF as I
mentioned earlier at the start of the
presentation even you can have a PDF
because that that is something used by
your management so overall at a high
level that's how I have bifurcated all
of these details so first one is
integration of the data second one is
modeling data modeling and data
presentation and final is the
presentation so this is how the over
plumber healer will pick you over a few
architecture work and at every place at
every part of this coaster architecture
with this security layer is present
which is very robust here and it
provides a lot of features about how you
want to go ahead with the security
whether a Thai user level you want to
provide username password or you want to
have some kind of security based on the
user logging in from a particular
geographical location or from a
particular business unit all the
different kind of permutation
combination you can have within your if
you script yes we write a sequel script
security script within the picu the same
added script section which I showed you
earlier and that's where you specify
what kind of permutation combination you
need across the architecture so that
write use write data is delivered to
right user okay so so with this I will
take a couple of questions over here yes
the bear with me I will I'm just reading
questions for you all right so the first
thing is about sharing the screen so
that's quite embarrassing it I should it
should be showing my screen let me
quickly go back to stop sharing and
share it back guys can you see my screen
now can anybody responds alright
I really apologize for this I was under
the impression that I am sharing the
screen and I was getting the status also
that sharing but anyways I will take a
couple of questions which is over here
all right how to write MDX to fetch data
or doing some calculation in flick you
amigo tagger is asking that question so
I mean the MDX queries is something it
in a bit different way it is pretty much
straightforward in click view we have to
determine these technology in click view
where you can write your own small
script which works as a small cubes and
then once you load the data it puts all
of that data into the engine and then
you can fetch it into the front end and
in the front end you do all of that
calculation within the charts or into
the matrix I hope that answer your
question
so the next question is tableau versus
QlikView versus our Sodor hammer is
asking - it's basically asking me to do
a comparison which is pretty big
question but I will try to summarize it
depends on what kind of solution you are
building so tab you and click you
somehow provide a similar kind of
functionality where it provides a great
way of - putting your dashboards and
reports in front of your users act in a
way that it is telling a story as
compared to R where R is majorly used by
stations for doing their statistical
analysis R has a capability of doing the
or or creating the graphics and reports
but it is not as good as compared to
click u + tab you now let's go to click
U and W the major major China major
comparison or the major thing which I
find different between these two tools
is click view has a very good and robust
scripting technology which you can think
it as a ETL where you can write your
script extract the data and massage the
data in your way whereas in tableau you
simply load the data and start doing the
visualization that's a high level answer
I can give it to you for when I compare
these tools so how can this be compared
against s and tableau Sheikh Ibrahim has
asked this question so shape I think I
have just explained even facts is a
statistical analysis system it used
mainly for doing the statistical
analysis or research in in this
statistical analysis area so but not a
very good tool for doing the
presentation the next question is from
Deb of Posadas to load data from sources
other than those mentioned one in the
slides the food has to be written in
which language
so so to write a scripting QlikView has
their own scripting language which which
it comes when you write a custom
components or a custom scripting it's
it's not it has a particular kind of
language which they have used but you
can think it it's more like a VB script
or a JavaScript kind of a language if
you have a scene or if you have worked
on that that is pretty much similar to
that but they have their own own
language or doing that they have not
given any name it's more of a custom
component the scripting language what
you say alright next is can we connect
different sources of data it means SAP
and Oracle at the same time all in a
single connection so your second part is
right in a single connection but how
that that here in click you if you are
able to see my screen we have this
database connectivity via different kind
of ODBC oledb connection you can connect
the data with one of its source say for
example here you are connected with the
Oracle data but right after this if you
are connecting with these tab data then
your connection will be stopped over
here right at the semicolon and the SAP
data will or SAP data connection will
come into the picture so so your the
answer for your question is yes and no
yes because you have the flexibility of
specifying multiple connections but only
one connection is active at a time I
hope it answer your question an API info
are to be accessed for the same hmm I
really understand this I think you are
asking something related to whether
there is a Twitter API and all if that
is a case or I have not seen anything in
that such that it can be accessed by our
can access API kind of a thing but yes
there is
there are development going on this if
if there is any kind of development but
but I am not aware about that the next
one is do we need any coding language
knowledge so yes I think if you are
aware about sequel or SQL language in
any of the platform whether it is sequel
server or whether it is Oracle it is
really really helpful because it is very
much similar to it it's a little bit
different but very much similar to how a
sequel works so for example here I am
saying load testing the field name from
tubulin is similar to select column from
table name which which is there in
sequel open answer so how to access
click you sheet or dish dashboard in web
application so in web application it
gives a click view provides you the
components which which you can use which
is an ActiveX component or which you can
use to to include the click your
application but it can happen only via
it server so you have to have a server
there you have published application and
then you can use it via the link which
server produce and then you need to have
an active X component which is the
related to click view and user view and
that needs to be installed in your
system
so is it possible to integrate data from
legacy system like main trains so
mainframe systems
connecting data from mainframe system is
is something which is I have not seen
whether we are doing that generally how
we have seen it that we are extracting
the data from the mainframe in the form
of a CSV files and all and then putting
it there in the quick view for using it
but direct connection to the mainstream
that is something I have never seen into
the quick tip so the next question is if
we create a single dashboard with two
different sources can't we do it because
interview it's possible but here also it
is possible like I mentioned if you are
having two different sources like
Elektra one table is coming from Oracle
another table is coming from stab yes
you can have both of those sources but
when it comes to understanding that
technical part that only one connection
is active in the back end of this trip
when it is loading the data but when it
comes to the presentation both tables
whether it is from Oracle or from
QlikView or some SAP will be available
to you I think these are the questions I
had I think I have given my answers
though and the honest opinions about
something which is possible and I have
seen and something which is not possible
and I have not seen hope this has
answered your question so let's go back
to our presentation and see the stuff
which is remaining the next thing I have
is associative user experience this I
have shown with the help of an example
so before I move on I want to again
confirm that you can see my screen right
perfect I got an answer from the Web
Filter task that screen is there and you
are able to see it
alright so reports associated user
experience I was talking about and here
is one example from our legacy systems
like like Business Objects or other -
boring tools where you need to specify a
hierarchy at the start for your end
users so if an end user need to select a
salesperson they first need to go in to
select key region and then the state say
for example region is indium state is
some higher Ostrom the product that you
are selling is suppose electronics and
then then only you can select the
salesperson who is there for selling
this electronics product but there was
no big that you can directly select the
salesperson for making it for
understanding how it is related to
different part but here in click view
you can go in any direction you can
directly select a salesperson and
salesperson related data will be
displayed to you so for example your
selecting salesperson X who is related
to India then region will reflect as
India its state if if salesperson is
active in one state like Maharashtra
then only Maharashtra will be appear if
salesperson is active in two or multiple
states then multiple states information
will reflect and finally the product
information if if sales person is doing
a sales of electronics product then
electronic products information will be
presented so in this way you can go into
anything you can select electronic
products and you can see who are the
sales person who is doing the
electronics fails and that's where this
thing comes that quickly works like your
mind like your mind can ask any question
they can simply ask in Maharashtra what
are all the products that we are selling
so you simply select Nordstrom and all
of its product information and the
salesperson information comes to comes
directly to you
and you are able to understand okay
these are all the guys who are working
and data this is the products that they
are selling in Maharashtra region so to
show you how how it is happening let's
go back to our click view application
and see it so I will just remove its
script I will click clear which will
clear my editors so here I have the
movie director I have the director
filter I have the actor filter and I
have the title filter now in case of a
traditional system like here traditional
OLAP system I need to first select the
director like I am selecting 'evil and
then I need to select the direct the all
the actors who have worked with their
director say for example we are
selecting Erica and then we can see king
of New York is the movie which Erica has
done under the direction of pebble but
that's not the case with click view
that's the case with traditional system
that's the example I have designed for
you infect you in case of the quick view
model let's go back to dashboard I can
simply select any of the movie from this
title filter like three Godfather's and
you can see here are all the actors who
have worked in the three core father's
movie and here is the director
information about that movie and here
you know all this charting and
everything is been updated part for the
movie now my next question is a Shawn
wine is worked into this movie let's
click on John whining and let's click
again on three Godfather now what it is
giving me an indication that I want to
ask what are all the movies and who are
all the directors with whom John wine in
his work and that's where my information
these are all the directors with which
John whining has worked and these are
the movies which one whining has done so
that simply depends on what kind of
question you want to ask based on the
data which is in front to you in front
of you and that's where your intuition
comes into the picture when you keep on
asking the question and keep on digging
on the on the problem and then you
finally figure out ten
a hidden pattern or hidden information
because your mind is working in that
direction and you are getting the
answers right in front of your screen so
that's how the soffietta user experience
works so let's back to the presentation
and that's what I think I sufficiently
cover this associate of user experience
now let's go back go to this major
companies who are using click view so
here are just couple of examples very
few example and the the intention to
show you over here is that click view is
being adopted by many many big companies
whether it is a banking conglomerate I
catches PC consulting companies like
poses or TCS or whether it is companies
employees into manufacturing like
Mahindra or whether it is a well known
name to everyone flick or not they use
click view as their trusted tool for
doing the reporting and analytics work
and design the business intelligence
solutions next is a salary transistor to
give you a high level information about
the salary trends into the click view if
you can see from the bar it is clearly
visible that the click view is
definitely click to developers or click
guys who understand click you're working
as a click you consult and get the
maximum salary as compared to it's
related technologies like tableau and
all and it's source of this information
is indeed you can go to indeed.com and
run that query about jobs jobs payment
by technology tool or click to job pay
categories kind of a search to search
query and then you can add that chart
into the indeed.com next is top trends
so this is the top trends that I
prepared on the 16th of focused and at
that time the picture was that the most
of the openings were in Bengaluru and
then the delhi or NCR
comes then Mumbai Chennai and finally
football football is ready to be part of
Delhi NCR so you can club it one and
then you can see over 100 plus openings
are out there but overall if you will
count this there are like four hundred
plus openings out there in click you the
companies who are hiring into the fifth
click to developer or click view
consultant and the honestly they are not
matching up with the demand for all for
all of the openings that they have so
the tool is going with a fast-paced but
definitely there is a lack of a lack of
talent over there in the market so
that's why I think of understanding
quick you understanding how it works
what opportunity it has it's a good
thing to to adopt as an career
advancement of being the hottest
technology out there in the market today
all right so advantages of using click
you alright it's moving here taken was
ok advantages of using thick tube so
it's a down top approach of development
initiative top-down in a very simple way
I can say that top-down approaches that
management is pushing something and you
are adopting it and you are working on
it that has worked that has worked out
probably not worked for much code in the
past but here is a down topic to which
we're an analyst installers install the
click view system and then give up the
boards back to management or finding
order distribute to the management and
that's where that's how management gives
an approval that yes go ahead with this
tool and that's why it is an analyst and
this is friendly approach of quick you
because you analyst or a business user
can can download and install the stall
frequent start preparing its its reports
and dashboards faster development and
change management I explained it earlier
about the faster development and change
management because you are directly
working with your end-user you are a
click to developer who understand
and directly working with end-user and
where there is a very less and minimum
interference of the IT department
because of all that they are change
management policies and stuff you are
able to do faster development and faster
change management self-service bi for
end-users because it has the
capabilities of providing the custom
solutions to the self-service to the
end-users where they can create their
own metrics for their on the flight
questions minimum 3 society knowledge to
start working on QlikView yes it is very
much true one of the question being
asked is what kind of knowledge I should
have to start working with with you I
would say if you if you have a
bundesbank good understanding of the SQL
the structured query language on on any
of the platform whether Oracle whether
PLC or whether sequel server or anything
it's perfectly fine you should know the
basic sequel you should know how to put
the formula in Excel and mam you can
start working with QlikView nobody can
really stop this at least to start work
with it but as you move on definitely
you come across the different
terminologies different kind of problems
and that's where you start gaining more
and more expertise into the what it
really needs to go to become an expert
into the effective but you have from a
starting perspective SQL and Excel is is
your your background knowledge that you
should have data integration ETL and
presentation in one tool so data
integration and ETL in one tool that's
what I have explained earlier in one of
the slide that you can integrate the
data from multiple sources ETL can be
done via the script which is very
similar to sequel all of those joints
and everything's are are in there into
this scripting that you can do and then
finally the presentation into the final
and on to the output layer and last one
is the efficient multi layer application
development that's an advanced topic
that means that your ETL is happening in
one layer your presentation is happening
is in another
here so you have around two or sometimes
even three different KQ application just
to manage one big project so that's
that's where it becomes a very efficient
multi-layer application development
where all of your data integration ETL
and presentations are happening within
QlikView but with the multi-layer
application government so let's move on
to the next slide which is ways
companies adopting with you it's again
similar to my first point in the last
slide which was down top approach of
development instead of top-down it's a
similar kind of thing it's our down to
top approach of adoption companies our
first companies analyst or company
business users are adopting it and then
they are creating some fuel some kind of
dashboards for them and then finally
giving you to your department once
Department adopts it then other
Department sees he sees the value of the
paper that it is giving to the
department and then finally the entire
company is adopting this has been a
trend which click you have seen click
track as a company has seen that how
companies are adopting and that's how
they were able to come up with this
infographic that this is the way
companies adopting and they suggest that
if this should be the way because it's
the only that business analysts or the
business users who really understand
what business context they have what
kind of questions they are they are
asking if they have the power of link to
in their hand and if click you is giving
them the quick answers like I showed you
earlier in case of a movie database then
it becomes really a handy tool and other
departments get to know about it and
spoon the entire company adopts click
view as one unified solution for their
desire complete so that's how the
company is adopting quick view all right
here we come with the most interesting
part which is a demo so before I start a
demo let's take quick questions
that I may have here in this question
panel all right so one question from
America what is QV d file so cubed
stands for QlikView document file it is
basically object click view data file I
apologize this trick we date of file so
click new data file it's nothing
but then but the vendor when you load
the data the data is converted into a
click into a format which cliff you can
understand and click you understand qvd
format which is a key to data format it
has its compression algorithm and the
couple of features here into this
document format where it compress the
data for example if you are uploading a
hundred mb of data from your data source
based on the cardinality of the data the
data is reduced to almost around the 90
percent so if your if it is 100 MB data
that will be reduced to somewhere around
20 25 MB or even less than that
based on again the cardinality of date
on the level of cardinality it has so
click your data file is basically a
preferred of a click you understand the
data you can only create qvd or click
view data file from click view scripting
itself in the back and in the front end
there is a vein by which you can create
it but the most preferred way is from
the back end of this of the data where
you are writing the scripting I hope
this answers the question alright so
there is no more question so let me go
back and alright somebody just just
first another question so month P why we
prefer click - instead of tableau where
tableau is very good and visualization
yes
w is very good in visualization there is
no doubt about it but us a month and to
all of you guys
even QlikView is very much capable of
four to a of providing all of those
visualization which which tableau
provides tab tab new has been promoted
as a most impressive almost at once data
visualization tool whereas if you give
you a complete suit of a business
intelligence solution or business
discovery solution as what click that
cleans what it means you can not only
produce P visualization which you could
produce in any of the two like tableau
and all but you also have the ETL you
also have the data massaging you also
have the data modeling features and
everything which is missing out there
into the tab you tableau is definitely
gaining on it I have seen that debut is
coming up or probably they may have come
up with the scripting and all but so far
that has been the major point as a
negative point for for tableau but yes I
agree W has very good resume
visualization but with you is no more
less than that sometimes even has more
features based on the properties and all
of the different options that it
provides I mean once you will go through
all of the things all of the charts and
everything that we prepare and we show
you know it it produces very good very
good visualization all right so let's
quickly go to the demo and see it see
the click you in action with a little
bit about its its features and all so I
have shown you this application which is
which is a movie database and I showed
you how you can have a sociate of
experience and all so in this demo
section I will just walk you through
about a very high level what clicked
I'll click view looks and different
components of click you so this is a
front-end or click view which you are
seeing and it has different sheets like
dashboard analysis has split view model
as traditional Aleph model all of these
different tabs are called sheets and all
of these sheets are there in this one
document so we so all of these
collection of sheets are present in
document and we call it a QlikView
document like we will call it movie
database dot qbw as a movie database
document click we document alright so in
this sheets you can produce infographics
and all the different kinds of charts
and metrics you can have a text and all
of this kind of information or weather
images you can import that also so your
presentation layer is this in the back
hand you have the added script in the
back in the edit script you have the
option of loading data from multiple
sources like we are here we are using
that inline load option that that's
nothing but you specify the data inside
into our table which is present in to
this scripting which is over here inside
load statement load in line there you
specify the data and columns and that
gets created this is basically a custom
table for our special needs and all to
learn more about this why we really need
these kind of tables apart from our
small bucket of sources apart from that
we have it from the XLS file file which
is in Excel format apart from this if I
click over here table files and suppose
if I select any of the one then you can
see over here it can understand the data
from different formats whether it is
axial HTML qvd quick cube data file XML
and QV x QV x is a is a component that
you write in case of a custom data and
custom data component
or custom data that you have for you for
your rod for your document so apart from
this you can also import another click
view file that feature is called as the
binary load we will look into it
when we will move onto the move into the
class back file to fetch the data from
the web yield data or the data which is
there on the custom feel like from
Internet file or from a local file which
is there you can fetch it apart from
databases you have ODBC oledb you have
other custom components to access data
from SAP system there is a SAP connector
that you can use that even I think
purchase you need to purchase it from
the PICU and then you can use it I think
it is not freely available but they can
be double-checked salesforce is
definitely free if you have sales sales
force system in your company and you
want to access the the salesforce data
then you can download the Salesforce
component data feed access component
from the Q side and there are couple of
others which is in there apart from that
in today's world there are major
technologies like Hadoop and all for
that I think there is a Java based
database connector JDBC connector there
is a very good documentation on click
your community about how to connect your
Hadoop and all these modern big data
bases from your clicker system so that's
about your different kinds of data
sources their own with which you can
connect and here you can see it has the
different kinds of tables which is
loading it has some so it has some
predefined features like blue is the
mentioned as keyword this text which is
written in red is basically a field name
where you specify the table name like
this by specifying the name and a
following all of these things we will
look into detail and we will move into
the class but that's how you see it
if you want to know how the data is
modeled you need to press ctrl T and it
shows you model which which is being
created if you can see all of these
different tables are automatically
connected and it is connected based on
the same name that same column name that
you have in different table so for
example film count has film ID as well
as XS has film ID and probably directors
has film ID like over here till my D
film ID so you don't have to really
specify any kind of join or anything
click you automatically does all of this
thing for you joining and all but we
have to take sometimes precautions
because of if multiple feeds are there
which is of similar name it may 3/8
redundancy into the data and that's the
kind of scenario we to carefully look
and resolve it there are different ways
to resolve it and we will look that into
our course so that's about the QlikView
scripting and click view data model
viewer or you can view it now the next
key is key variables so to show you the
variables so and probably before I show
you I think all of you are must be aware
of what variables are so they are
basically placeholders contains the
values and they can be used to produce
some kind of dynamic nature into your
click to your charts or metrics and
click view has its variable overview
window in which you can create the
variables so variable name over here is
specified as V language and you can see
either you can specify a function so
that is something it is taking language
as a value that which in which language
you want to see the dashboard so this
language has been used somewhere in the
dashboard which is dynamically updating
D where dynamically updating the
language of cash
so to add it add you can add the
variables from here you can remove it
from your variable can contain text
formulas and it has a very advanced
feature there are a lot of things I mean
definitely cannot be covered in just one
hour so it's a very advanced form of
topic about what what it can do for your
kids web applications
so apart from of the key script change
the data model and and the variable
overview window of let's see the
different types of charging and metrics
which is available by right clicking
over here go to new sheet object and go
to chart
so apart from chart all of these are
different components list box is
basically nothing but filter statistics
box produce statistics so on and so
forth I mean some of them are pretty
much self-explanatory like button or
text object by just reading you can
understand what they do but the
important part comes when you point when
you are configuring it so let's take two
one to our topic of interest which is
chart so in this chart you have
different kinds of chart whether it is a
bar chart or a spider chart or this
block chart all of these different kinds
of visualization available to you all of
these apart from these standard
visualization you also have at the end
fiber table which is very much used in
in different kinds of reports to do the
analysis and then you have the straight
table again used in conjunction with
your other visualization to show rather
relevant data like top 10 sales or top
10 movies and stuff like this so all of
these different visualizations are
present to produce a dashboards and your
reports and the important part is to
understand their properties you you you
have n number of different properties I
will just explain one one component
property to you and then you can
understand what you can really do with
click view with these components so
apart
or the charts window which I showed you
I have just one quick quick new quick
you document for data visualization so
in this data visualization it shows the
different kinds of bar chart which you
can have whether a vertical or a
horizontal or a stacked bar chart
various units kind of a charted sub k in
the bar chart but in a different format
that's a kind of a combo chart bar chart
with a line chart and then again another
complex one which you having the
multiple bars with a line chart apart
from that this is what a line chart is
for for the data values which is
distributed over a period of time spider
chart and you can actually view this
once
once you download or install the clicker
application these are all the demo
applications which comes and you can
actually go through each of these and
see the different types of
visualizations which is available to you
but this is just just to show you what
what different types of visualization is
and how it looks like so let's let's
just see the different properties of any
of this chart maybe the line chart which
everybody understand very well I just
right-click on this go to properties and
we will very quickly one by one so
general is nothing but it is a similar
screen which we just saw saw a couple of
minutes back about selecting the
different type of chart then you need to
specify its dimension what are the
different dimensions which is which you
want to see by on the x axis like here
it is presented as month and here then
you have a dimensional image so there
you can restrict the data first largest
or top 10 values is small smallest top
10 by smallest n values all of these
different things based on the month or
the year dimensions that you have
specified then you have expressions what
expressions as I said it is very much
similar to your
Excel you just need to specify some and
then the relevant expression into the
into the expression window and you can
have multiple expression you can group
the expression that's again advanced
feature to show multiple expression in
just one chart and one expression at a
time and then you have all these
different kind of feature whether you
want accumulation or you want to
accumulate then step back which is
nothing but a rolling rolling ten
rolling some of from past end period you
can have different types of trend lines
and all so all of these features which
is the available to you the sorting how
you want to do this already
styling how you want the style available
to you
presentation what kind of line weight
you have symbol if you have any kind of
symbol like this you have square or the
circle not how what kind of power
distance in case of a bar chart you want
to show the legend or not you want to
have any kind of reference line so
sometimes you want to have an average
like over here you you are saying okay
three is an average so you can specify a
line like this three and you can see
okay most of the time my values are
above average so that case that is good
the field is really going good so part
on this if you have any thing like we
want to specify in chart like a text or
something you can click over here and
specify any any kind of information that
you want to provide to your end user and
it has a couple of other features like
the here related to a hex if it is given
the properties what kind of colors you
need to use number formatting what kind
of format you want all of this different
kind of formatting you can have font
what kind of punch you need size and all
which is similar to other layout
different types of layout you want to
conditionally show the chart or not that
you can specify
you want to allow move movement or size
of the chart we or end-user you can
specify over here if you don't just
uncheck that so all of these different
kind of options are available and
finally how you want the look and feel
of your charts caption whether you want
to show any kind of menu on the chart
type sending data to excel and stuff
like that what should be the position
and the help text and any kind of
information for the properties which I
told our major properties and it is
something which is available in each and
every chart so I think that is what I
wanted to show you the first of all the
different kind of components and the
charts which is available and then it's
upper teens finally I think it is a time
to take some questions I'll just mute
myself for a moment
all right so the question is how to
implement self security into QlikView
dashboard amid quadriga advanced the
question Amit I am not fully understand
but if I am right you are asking how we
can have a question how we can have a
security on the field if that is the
question yes you can have the security
on a few pinned and a P its field values
and then you can specify for example if
you have sales data for different
geographies like India
USA and and UK and if you want only if
India users are logging in to the
dashboard and they are only able to see
the dashboard yes you can specify it for
this you need to write a script which is
a landing topic but ability is there to
write that script kind of a script what
are the prerequisites to excess liquid
dashboards or mobile or iPad the main
thing is this that if the preview
provides a components or its features on
the clicker server those features need
to be enabled for click 4 click view
dashboard for documents to be there on
the mobile or iPad or iPhone and apart
from that the important thing is is you
have to know the the way you need to
show the visualization on the on your
bar on your sheets because the space is
very less into the Mobile's and all
therefore the information that you are
providing should has to be very concise
but it's the QlikView server which does
all the magic or seeing the vendors on
mobile or Peroni for iPad a subject what
is the difference between quick sense
and click view Amit has asked this
question again click sense and clicking
so I would say click sense is the next
generation and that's what check the
click Tech has marketed itself for quick
sense it provides
much more battle of visualization when
you are comparing it again to the click
cube and I think that strategy is
something to take over with the with it
tableau as a tool which I think somebody
has asked the question that temp/w has a
very nice features of doing the
visualization yes I have given the
answer yes and that's why a quick view
is click who has come up with this
click sense which is very similar to
click view it has similar kind of
scripting and similar kind of
capabilities only thing which I have not
seen in quick sense is something related
to security and something related to the
multi-layer multi-layer application when
the data size becomes huge and we do all
of that kind of data and that's where I
am NOT saying the quickly sense is very
effective so that's the major difference
I will trade next question which is how
we can give input to sheet anywhere
value integer you can give any times I
have shown you into the variable that in
variable you can have better text or
whether integer value or even it accepts
the formula which finally translates
into some kind of value but yes you can
provide a whether it is a character or
as an integer all right so the next
question Anisha is asking if we want to
design an interactive dashboard and
share it to a number of users should the
users have that liquid software
installed in the system like just in
case of tableau or do we have something
like that in server yes you you need to
have a click used server for that
installation of QlikView is not required
or it will be a web link which will be
shared to your users and they can't see
it via this weather web interface
what are the job opportunities Sheikh
Ibrahim as asking this question I have
shown you in two different slides job
opportunities are really bright but the
main thing is that QlikView is coming up
with lot of labels like it has the data
integration and data massaging by doing
the ETL and that stuff it has
presentation layer and it has finally
the output layer into the different kind
of components so the main thing is the
main opportunities that you have is
either with your designer or the click
to developer whereas get to developer is
a combination of designer and the
development part and opportunities are
right I have shown you four hundred-plus
opportunities are there in the major
cities or the metros and I think it's a
bright market which is coming up with
more jobs dividing that that's my two
cents on that okay the devatha has asked
this question is there some industry
record my certification to become a
strictly professional yes there is a
QlikView developer certification and a
digital designer certification and there
is a cliff you administrator
certification yeah there is and
definitely you can take that
certifications it's it is very much
broad in terms of your data analysis
skills or ETL and your modeling skills
that you have acquired by going through
your experience in quickvid on the plant
all right next to your next question
where we will use QV WQ v t and QV x
type of extension in quick view so this
will be used in the scripting section so
someone has asked this question by the
way and as I mentioned it to the youth
in scripting because qvd is a quick you
data format qvw can also be an input for
another
qbw file which is called binary loads
and qvx is a comp your custom component
which via which you can actually put the
data so it's the nutshell answer is it's
the scripting section how can we get
back the data which is stored in qvd
file
Harish has asked this question so there
are multiple ways after you load the
data into the qvd you can again load it
back into click view and view the data
after loading the data into click view
you can export the data into Excel or
CSV file so in this way you can have
this data back from qvd file how much
volume of data click view with SLA of 30
second max that depends on the things
like whether you are fetching the data
from Excel whether you are fetching the
data from database or whether you're
fetching the data from qvt or FAQ data
files if you are fetching the data from
qvt file the data value that you can
fetch within 30 second is somewhere
around the somewhere around the 100 MB
or so even I think more than that but
I'm just giving a rough idea in case of
for database you can fetch data
somewhere around the 50 to 80 mV if if
you have a good connection with the
server the third thing is again with the
axle Excel cannot or sometimes crash
more than more than 10 or 20 MB of data
if that is the case 10 or 20 MB is
something with which you can achieve I
will not say 30 second but probably
somewhere around the 60 seconds or 1
minute 10 seconds at the max next
question is pricing of quick you it's
again region to region but appliques
pretty expensive software to be honest
and it's it's like things like
is also it's also it's also fine but you
may need to visit to click your website
I don't have a ready answer for this
because it is different for each vision
how much volume of data click to then
handle can cover that I think it is
again asking me this question how can a
created report we shared used published
for global uses by multiple users so
that can be you can produce a PDF report
you can get the you can get the publish
the report on server and share it with
users and send the link to the all users
also click the server has the capability
that whenever you are publishing the
dashboard it sends a notification to
users at a new dashboard click publish
if that is on then your users are
notified and they can they can actually
see them alright so the last question
was asked by plancha I heard that it is
not possible to / - for developed in
another click - personal edition is it
right commit as of this question yes and
no why yes you you cannot open after a
certain numbers of QlikView document you
have opened so yes you can open the
another users click your document in
personal Edition but I think the
restriction is somewhere around the 4 to
5 document at the max which you can open
for a different users so yes you can
open it but no you cannot open it
because you have if you have reached the
threshold how to get the deleted data
from QbD file when the file is reloaded
um I don't understand this question how
to get the deleted data from qvd file
when the file is reloaded now I think
you need to explain parish this question
to me what is the difference between
unnamed Kara license and document
license for name can
license is given to the developers
document license is given to the viewers
of the document watch some who are
actually the end-users can we use cube
data as a source system yes you can
connect the SS S which is I think sequel
server analysis service where you
produce cubes that's one of the system
to which you can connect and enter data
as a business why I go with quick view
rather than Oracle VI or bo staff the
first thing is obviously a the kind of
business discovery features which is
provides and so things like which is not
there in fact business object I use sap
business object or even for my own data
sources but it does not have the kind of
capability where you are just selecting
suppose one field and you want to know
what are the values which is related to
the selection in even the values which
is not related to this collection that
kind of capability is not there but that
is something which is available in
click-through and that's why it gives a
two wave prospective to end user say for
example if I'm selecting a sales or
sales employee of a particular region
then I can know what products it is
selling and what product it is not
selling so if I'm curious why it is not
selling you know I that raises a
question and that that gives me
perspective okay I may need to reach out
to the business to the sales user and
figure it out so that kind of
functionality in a nutshell is missing
can you explain briefly about synthetic
keys Harish as out this question yeah in
brief I can explain this is something
like when you have two or multiple
tables in your script and both these
tables or multiple tables have one or
more similar column names then click new
system creates a synthetic Keys
sometimes you are creating synthetic
keys for your own purpose but generally
it is not useful because it creates a
random dense key or a duplication in how
to remove the
he is in data modeling there are
multiple ways you can do concatenation
you can rename the rename those fields
that depends on again requirement to
requirement but yeah there are multiple
ways what features are there in doc
document can license Smith has asked
this question
document Cal license has a features like
you can view the document if you have if
you have access to the to the dashboard
and apart from that you can create the
metric on the fly on the back page
itself and share your observations from
other users also that's the kind of a
feature that you get with our document
Cal license at a very very high level if
I can explain
alright these are all questions I have I
hope so there is another question let me
just quickly run this one last question
can we schedule report based on quick
view you cannot schedule a report based
on quick view button click you button D
in the server or the publisher where it
provides you here the report scheduling
so that your reports are sketching to
fetch the data or to be distributed to
your users so not in quick
but in click you server so click view
client is the client machine or
developer machine that we have click the
server is up so is a platform to which
you publish or you schedule your records
I hope that answers your question
alright I think with that I would say
thank you to all of you I hope I am able
to provide you some perspective of click
view and I hope I will be able to meet
you in the class and you have a good day
hurt I would say good night and after
this webinar you will be finding our
page for giving the feedback I
appreciate if you can give the feedback
that will help us to improve ourselves
and give more and more better webinar
and training to you guys
thank you so much for your time today
and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
