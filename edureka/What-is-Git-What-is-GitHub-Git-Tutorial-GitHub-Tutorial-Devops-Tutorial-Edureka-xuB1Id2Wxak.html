Eureka and today's tutorial we're going
to learn about git and github now if
you're someone who's new to coding and
you might be hearing your fellow
developers talking about git and github
but you don't know what they actually
are and you have never used it then this
tutorial my friend is just for you and
even if you are one of those people who
have been using git and github for a
while but you're a little doubtful that
there might be some kind of get features
that you have left unexplored then I'll
just tell you just hang in there till
the end of this tutorial and please let
me know if you have learned something
new so I would like to welcome and thank
all the attendees for joining today's
session but before I begin am i audible
to everyone so john says yes so without
any further ado let us begin this
tutorial by looking at the topics that
we'll be learning today said first we'll
see what is version control and why do
we actually need version control after
that we'll take a look at the different
version control tools and then we'll see
all about github and git will also take
an account a case study of the dominant
enterprises about how they're using
github after that we'll take a look at
the features of git and finally we're
going to use all the git commands to
perform all the git operations so this
is exactly what we'll be learning today
so is the agenda clear to everyone so
John says yes Tyler says yes so we're
good to go let us begin with the first
topic what is version control well you
can think of a version control as the
management system that manages the
changes that you make in your project
till the end the changes that you make
might be some kind of adding some new
files or you're modifying the older
files by changing the source code or
something so what the version control
system does is that every time you make
a change in your project it creates a
snapshot of your entire project and save
it and these snapshots are actually
known as different
versions now for having trouble with the
word snapshot just consider that
snapshot is actually the entire state of
your project at a particular time it
means that will contain what kind of
files your project is storing at that
time and what kind of changes you have
made so this is what a particular
version contains now if you see the
example here let's say that I have been
developing my own website so let's say
that in the beginning I just had only
one webpage which is called the index
dot HTML and after a few days I have
added another web page to it which is
called about dot HTML and I have made
some modifications in the about dot HTML
by adding some kind of pictures and some
kind of text so let's see what actually
the version control system stores to see
that it has detected that something has
been modified and something has been
created for example it is storing that
about dot HTML is created and some kind
of photo is created or added into it and
let's say that after a few days I have
changed the entire page layout of the
about dot HTML page so again with
version control system will detect some
kind of change and will say that some
about dot HTML has been modified and you
can consider all of this three snapshots
as different versions so when I only
have my index or HTML web page and I do
not have anything else this is my
version 1 and after that when I added
another web page this is going to be a
version 2 and after have changed the
page layout of my web page this is my
version 3 so this is how a version
control system stores different versions
so I hope that you've all understood
what is a version control system and
what are versions so if you have any
kind of doubts you might ask me and if
not give me quick confirmation on the
chat window so that I can move on to the
next topic
ok so John has a question he asks that
can we go back to a previous version if
you make a mistake yes of course that is
the whole purpose of a version control
system because sometimes you make
changes and you don't want them so a
version control system always keeps your
older versions neat
packed inside it only because if at
anytime sometimes you want to roll back
to the previous version you can do that
that is the whole purpose of maintaining
your version virtual system
I hope John you have got your answer
okay Seth yes thank you so much so let
us move on to the next topic and now
we'll see why do we actually need
version control because you might be
thinking that why should I need a
version control I know what the changes
that I have made and maybe I'm making
this changes just because I'm correcting
my project or something but there are a
number of things because of why we need
version control and so let us take a
look at them one by one so the first
thing that version control system
availeth is collaboration
now imagine that there are three
developers working on a particular
project and everyone is working in
isolation or even if they're working in
the same shared folder so there might be
conflicts sometimes when each one of
them are trying to modify the same file
now let's say they are working in
isolation
everyone is minding their own business
now the developer one has made some
changes X Y Z in a particular
application and in the same application
the developer too has made some kind of
other changes ABC and they are
continuing doing that same thing they
are making the same modifications
through the same file but they're doing
it differently so at the end when you
try to collaborate or when you try to
merge all of their work together you
come up with a lot of conflicts and you
might not know who have done what kind
of changes and this will at the end end
up in chaos but with version control
system it provides you with a shared
workspace and it continuously tells you
who has made what kind of change or what
has been changed so you'll always get
notified if someone has made change in
your project so with version control
system a collaboration is a page between
all the developers and you can visualize
everyone's work properly and as a result
your project will always evolve as a
whole from the start and it will save a
lot of time for you because there won't
be much conflicts because obviously if
the devil
for a we'll see that he has already made
some changes he won't go for that right
because he can carry out his other words
you can make some other changes without
interfering his word so I hope that is
understood how version control system
evades collaboration if you have any
questions you might ask me ok John says
yes and Tyler says yes trainer says yes
ok so we'll move on to the next reason
for why we need version control system
and this is one of the most important
things because of why we need version
control system I'll tell you why
now the next reason is because of
storing versions because saving a
version of your project after you have
made changes is very essential and
without a version control system it can
actually get confusing because there
might be some kind of questions that
will arrive in your mind when you are
trying to save a version the first
question might be how much would you
save would you just save the entire
project or would it just save the
changes that you made now if you only
save the changes it will be very hard
for you to view the whole project at a
time and if you try to save the entire
project at every time there will be a
huge amount of unnecessary and redundant
data lying around because you'll be
saving the same thing that has been
remaining unchanged again and again I
will cover up a lot of your face and
after that the another problem comes
that how do you actually name these
versions now even if you are a very
organized person and you might actually
come up with a very comprehensible
naming scheme but as soon as your
project starts varying and it comes to
variants there is a pretty good chance
that you'll actually lose track of
naming them and finally the most
important question is that how do you
know what exactly is different between
these versions now you ask me that ok
what's the difference between version 1
and version 2 what exactly was changed
you need to remember or document them as
well now when you have a version control
system you don't have to worry about any
of that
you don't have to worry about how much
you need to
how do you name them or you have you
don't have to remember that what exactly
is different different between the
versions because the version control
system always acknowledges that there is
only one project so when you're working
on your project there is only one
version on your disk and everything else
all the changes that you've made in the
past are all neatly packed inside the
version control system and obviously
like John asked that if you want to go
back to the previous version if you're
not sure that the modifications you've
just made are right and you want to
revert back you can do that with version
control system as well because it is
storing all your versions and you can
always revert back so I hope that this
is clear to everyone shall I proceed
further guys okay so let us go ahead and
see the next reason now version control
system provides me with a backup now the
diagram that is seen here is actually
the layout of typical distributed
version control system here you have got
your central server where all the
project files are located and apart from
that every one of the developers have a
local copy of all the files that is
present in the central server inside
their local machine and this is known as
the local copies so what the developers
do is that every time they start coding
at the start of the day they actually
fetch all the project files from the
central server and store it in the local
machine and after they are done working
they actually transfer all the files
back into the central server so at every
time you will always have a local copy
in your local machine at times of crisis
like maybe let's say that your central
server gets crashed and you have lost
all your project files you don't have to
worry about that because all the
developers are maintaining a local copy
the same exact copy of all the files
that is related to your project that is
present in the central server is there
in your local machine and even if let's
say that maybe this developer has not
updated his local copy with all the
files if he loses and the central server
gets
and the developer has not maintained a
circle copy is always going to be
someone who has already updated it
because obviously there is going to be
huge number of collaborators working on
the project so even a particular
developer can communicate with other
developers and get fetch all the project
files from other developers hope you
copy as well so it's very reliable when
you have a version control system
because you're always going to have a
backup of all your files so I hope this
is clear to everyone so shall I move
ahead ok so the next thing in which
version control helps us is to analyze
my project because when you have
finished your projects you want to know
that how your project has actually
evolved so that you can make an analysis
of it and you can know that what you
have done better or what could have been
improved in your project so you need
some kind of data to make an analysis
and you want to know that what is
exactly changed and when was it change
and how much time did it take and
version control system actually provides
you with all the information because
every time you change something version
control system provides you with the
proper description of what was changed
and when was it changed you can also see
the entire timeline and you can make
your analysis report in a very easy way
because you have got all the data
present here so this is how a version
control system helps you to analyze your
project as well so it is clear to
everyone any questions on this
ok so Sebastian says no all good so I
hope it's clear to everyone else as well
let us move ahead and let us take a look
at the version control tools because in
order to incorporate version control
system in your project you have to use a
version control tool so let us take a
look at what is available what kind of
tools can I use to incorporate version
control system so here we have called
the four most popular version control
system tools and they are gift and this
is what we'll be learning in today's
tutorial we'll be learning how to use
kit
apart from good you have got other
options as well you've got the Apache
subversion and this is also popularly
known as Sdn FCN and CVS which is the
concurrent version systems they both are
a centralized version control tool it
means that they do not provide all the
developers with a local copy it means
that all the contributors or all the
collaborators are actually working
directly with the central repository on
it they don't maintain local copy and
it's kind of actually becoming obsolete
because everyone prefers a distributed
version control system where everyone
has a local copy and mercurial on the
other hand is very similar to get it is
also a distributed version control tool
but we're learning all about get here
that's like it is highlighted in yellow
so let's move ahead okay there's a
question from Jamie so he asked that if
all of them are open-source well I'll
tell you that git is an open source okay
so shall we proceed ahead Jamie and
everyone else okay so this is the
interest over time graph and this graph
has been collected from Google Trends
and this actually shows you that how
many people have been using what at what
time so the blue line here actually
represents gives the green is SVN the
yellows mercurial and the red is CDF so
you can see that from the start
it has always been the most popular
version control tool as compared to SPN
material and CVS and it has always kind
of been a bad day for CVS but it has
always been popular so why not use git
right so there's nothing to say much
about that and yes and a lot of my
fellow attendees agree with me we should
all use git and we're going to learn how
to use creative this tutorial so let us
move ahead and let us all learn about
git and github right now so the diagram
that you see on my left is actually the
diagram which represents that what
exactly is github and what exactly is
git now I've been talking about a
distributed version control
system and the right hand side diagram
actually shows you the typical layout of
a distributed version control system
here it is got a central server or a
central repository now I'll be using the
word repository a lot from now on just
so that you don't get confused I'll just
give you a brief overview I'll also tell
you in detail what is the repository and
I'll explain you everything later in
this tutorial but for now just consider
repository as a data space where you
store all the projects files any kind of
files that is related to your project in
there so don't get confused when I say
repository instead of server or anything
else so in a distributed version control
system you've got a central repository
and you've got local repositories as
well and every of the developers at
first make the changes in their local
repository and after that they push
those changes or transfer those changes
into the central repository and also
they update their local repositories
with all the new files that are pushed
into the central repository by an
operation called
pull so this is how the fetch data from
central repository and now if you see
the diagram again on the left you know
that github is going to be my central
repository and git is the tool that is
going to allow me to create my local
repositories now let me exactly tell you
what is github now people actually get
confused between git and github they
think that it's kind of the same thing
maybe because of the name they sound
very alike but it is actually very
different
well git is a version control tool that
will allow you to perform all these kind
of operations to fetch data from the
central server and to just push all your
local files into the central server so
this is what git will allow you to do it
is just a version control management
tool whereas in github it is a code
hosting platform for version control
collaboration so github is just a
company that allows you to host your
central repository in a remote server
if you want me to explain in easy words
you can consider github as a social
network which is very much similar to
Facebook like only the difference is
that this is a social network for the
developers where in facebook you're
sharing all your photos and videos or
any kind of statuses what the developers
do in github is that they share their
code for everyone to see their project
see their code about how they've worked
on so that is good help ok I've got a
question from Jamie and yes that are
there any advantages over centralized
versions control system over distributed
version control system well of course
there are certain advantages of a
distributed version control system well
the first thing that I've already
discussed was that it provides you with
the backup so if at any time your
central server crashes everyone will
have a backup of all their files and the
next reason is that it provides you with
speed because central server is
typically located on a remote server you
have to always travel over a network to
get access to all the files so if at
some times you don't have internet and
you want to work on your project so that
will be kind of impossible because you
don't have access to all your files but
with the distributed version control
system you don't need internet access
always you just need internet when you
want to push or pull from the central
server apart from that you can work on
your own your files are all inside your
local machine so fetching it in your
workspace is not a problem
so that are all the advantages that you
get with a distributed version control
system and a centralized version control
system cannot actually provide you that
so is it ok so did you get your answer
Jamie ok so Jamie has asked another
question how is the local repository
connected to the cloud repository
well I'll actually show you this you
have to add an origin and you can it is
also connected via SSH if you want to or
you can send our HTTP request and
connect to the central server as well so
there are a number of ways to do it I
will be showing you Jamie
so Jamie have you got your answers okay
Jamie says yes and I've got a couple of
other questions as well
okay so Sebastian has a question here he
asked that so we do all the
modifications and get and once it is
done we'll push it to github and after
that how can we automate this process
well you can automate this process
Sebastian you can use a Java settler or
a Crone tab to automate all your push
and pull operations but you kind of
don't want to do that because the whole
essence of having a local repository is
that you are always free to make changes
in the central repository when you want
it because sometimes if you're not done
working on a particular file and if you
have just set a job scheduler it will
automatically actually push your
unfinished work and you don't want to do
that because everyone else will see and
it might actually interfere with the
work and sometimes when you're pulling
changes it actually updates your current
workspace so if you're working on
something and it's automatically pulling
out the files and it's making changes
automatically you might get confused but
if you still want to do that it is
possible you can use a job scheduler for
that but I will advise you not to do
that which is the whole purpose of
having distributed version control
system is that you can work in isolation
and whenever you're sure that your code
is working fine and you want others to
see that then you can push it on to
github so Sebastian have you got your
answer okay Thank You Sebastian and
thank you Jamie for asking questions and
if any of you has any other questions
you can always ask me so shall I proceed
further ok so now let's take a look at a
github case study of the Dominion
enterprises so Dominion enterprises is a
leading marketing services and
publishing company that works across
several industries and they have got
more than 100 offices worldwide
so they have distributed a technical
team support to develop a range of a
website and they include the most
popular websites like forrent.com
boats comm homes comm all the domain
Ian's enterprises websites actually get
more than tens of million unique
visitors every month and each of the
website that they work on has a separate
development team and all of them has got
a unique needs and you need to workflows
of their own and all of them were
working independently and each team has
their own goals their own projects and
budgets but they actually wanted to
share their resources and they wanted
everyone to see what each of the teams
are actually working on so basically
they wanted transparency well they
needed a platform that was flexible
enough to support a variety of workflows
and that would provide all the Dominion
enterprises development around the world
with a secure place to share code and
work together and for that they adopted
github as the platform and the reason
for choosing github is that all the
developers across the Dominion
enterprises we're already using
github.com so when the time came to
adopt a new version control platform so
obviously a github Enterprise definitely
seemed like a very intuitive choice and
because everyone all the developers were
also familiar with github so the
learning curve was also very small and
so they could start contributing or
right away into github and with github
all the developer teams all the
development teams were provided access
to when they can always share their code
on what they're working on so at the end
everyone has got a very secure place to
share code and work together and as Joe
fuller the CIO of Dominion enterprises
says that github enterprises allowed us
to store our company's source code in a
central corporately control system and
dominion enterprises actually manages
more than 45 websites and it was very
important for Dominion enterprise to
choose a platform the
made working together possible and this
wasn't just a matter of sharing Dominion
enterprises open source project and
github they also had to combat the
implications of soaring private code
publicly to make their work more
transparent across the company as well
and they were also using Jenkins to
facilitate a continuous integration
environment and in order to continuously
deliver their software they have adopted
github as a version control platform so
git have actually facilitated a lot of
things for Dominion enterprises and for
that they were able to incorporate a
continuous integration environment with
Jenkins and they were actually sharing
their code and making software delivery
even more faster so this is how github
helped not only discriminate enterprises
but I'm sure this might be common to a
lot of other companies as well shall I
move forward ok Jamie says it doesn't
have any questions so let us move
forward but if at any time if any kind
of question arises you might ask me at
all times so now this is a topic that we
were waiting for and now we'll learn
what is get so git is a distributed
version control tool and it supports
distributed nonlinear workflow
forgetting the tool that actually
facilitates all the distributed version
control system benefits because it will
provide you to create a local repository
in your local machine and it will help
you to access your remote repository to
fetch files from there or push files
into that so git is the tool that you
require to perform all these operations
and I'll be telling you all about how to
perform this operation for using git
later in this tutorial
for now just think of git as the tool
that you actually need to do all kind of
version control system stuff so do you
have any questions on what is git ok so
jamie has a question can two people
contribute in one local repository well
a local repository resides in your local
machine so now if two people are using
the same machine obviously but you don't
want that because every developer
got their own machines so there's no use
of create like having sharing a local
repository it's all meant to work in
isolation but if you want to create a
subgroup let's say that these three
collaborators are working on a similar
kind of application of that project and
these two are working on a little more
similar but that's different to this and
said so they want another repository
before they're committing to the
repository well you can do that as well
you can place any other repository where
in a few people can collaborate we're
working in the entire project as well as
for now the local repository here is the
repository that actually resides in your
local machine ok so jamie has another
question here how's that how can I share
commits with only a specific person
without committing in the remote repo
well no you cannot actually commit
something in other persons repositories
and only committed in your local
repository and a remote repository so
the remote repository is where everyone
can see what changes you have made and
what kind of commit you have made in the
project and in the local repository the
comment you made is only can be seen by
yourself and the local repository is
only meant for your use and after you
make commits in the local repository
then only you can make changes or
transfers those changes into the remote
repository but since all of you are
connected over a network you might like
hat you can take advice from your fellow
collaborators but it cannot actually
show the commits directly to him without
committing into a remote repository
where both of you have access to so
Jamie's answer clear to you
ok so Jamie says yes so we'll move on
and we'll see the different features of
git now so these are the different
features of git is distributed get is
compatible get a provider with a
nonlinear workflow it avails you
branching it's very lightweight it
provides you with speed it's open source
it's reliable secure and economical so
let's take a look at all the features
one by one so at first it is distributed
okay so Sebastian asked the questions is
that what is a collaborator actually is
it a service well collaborator is a
person who collaborates something in
your work so this is pretty much like
the English word where collaboration
actually means it means our combined
contribution so the collaborator when
I'm saying collaborator I just mean a
developer who has been working on the
project so if there are a lot of
developers working on the similar
project and they're all contributing
into the project I'm just naming them as
collaborators so so in this tutorial
when I'm saying collaborate I mean a
person a developer who has been
contributing his code so Sebastian is
the answer clear to you okay Sebastian
says got it Thank You Sebastian so the
first feature that we're going to look
into is its distributed now I've been
like telling you it's the distributed
version control tool it means that the
feature that gets provides you is that
it gives you the power of having a local
repository and lets you have a local
copy of the entire development history
which is located in the central
repository and it will fetch all the
files from the central repository to get
your local repository always updated and
this I'm calling it distributed because
every let's say that there might be a
number of collaborators or developers so
they might be living in a different
parts of the world someone might be
working from the United States and one
live in India so the words the project
is actually distributed everyone has a
local copy so it is distributed
worldwide you can say so this is what
distributed actually means so the next
feature is that it is compatible now
let's say that you might not be using
git on the first place but you have a
different version control system already
installed like SBN like a party
subversion or CVS and you want to switch
to get because obviously you are not
happy with the centralized version
control system and you want a more
distributed version control system so
you want to migrate from Sdn to get but
you're worried that
you might have to transfer all the files
all the huge amount of files that you
have in your SVN repository into a git
repository well if you are afraid of
doing that let me tell you you don't
have to be anymore because git is
compatible with SVM repositories as well
so you just have to download and install
git in your system and and it can
directly access the SVN repository over
the network which is the central
repository so the local repository that
you'll have is going to be a git
repository and if you don't want to
change your central repository then you
can do that as well we can use git sdn
and it can directly access all the files
all the files in your project that is
residing in an SVM depository so you
don't have to change that and it is
compatible with existing systems and
protocols but there are protocols like
SSH and winner in protocol so obviously
get users SSH to connect to the central
repository as well so it is very
compatible with all the existing things
so you don't have to so when you're
migrating into kit when you were
starting to use git you don't have to
actually change a lot of things so if I
have everyone understood these two
features by so far okay the next feature
of git is that it supports nonlinear
development of software now when you're
working with get it get actually records
the current state of your project by
creating a tree graph from the index a
tree that you know is nonlinear now when
you're working with git it actually
records the current state of the project
by creating a tree graph from the index
and as you know that a tree is a
nonlinear data structure and it is
usually actually in the form of a
directed acyclic graph which is
popularly known as the daj so this is
how actually get facilitates a nonlinear
development of software and it also
includes techniques where you can
navigate and visualize all of your work
that you're currently doing and how does
it actually facilitate and when I'm
talking about non-linearity how does it
get actually facilitate a nonlinear
develop
is actually by branching now branching
actually allows you to make a nonlinear
software development and this is a good
feature that actually make it stand
apart from nearly every other version
control management tool because git is
the only one which has a branching model
so git allows and it actually encourages
you to have a multiple local branches
and all of the branches are actually
independent of each other and the
creation and merging and deletion of all
these branches actually takes only a few
seconds and there is a thing called the
master branch
it means the main branch which starts
from the start of your project to the
end of your project and it will always
contain the production quality code it
will always contain the entire project
and after that it is very lightweight
now you might be thinking that since
we're using local repositories on our
local machine and we're fetching all the
files that are in the central repository
and if you think that way you can know
that there are like honey there are
hundreds of people pushing their code
into the central repository and I'm
updating my local repository with all
those files so the data might be very
huge but actually good uses a lossless
compression technique and it compresses
the data on the client side so even
though it might look like that it's got
a lot of files when it actually comes to
storage or storing the data in your
local repository it is all compressed
and it doesn't take up a lot of space
only when you're fetching your data from
the local repository into your workspace
it converts it and then you can work on
it and whenever you push it again you
compress it again and store it in a very
minimal space in your disk
and after that it provides you with a
lot of speed now since you have a local
repository and you don't have to always
travel over a network to fetch files so
it does not take any time to get files
in your into your work space from your
local repository because and if you see
that it is actually hundred times faster
detecting data from a remote repository
because because obviously have to travel
over the network to get that data or the
files that you want and Mozilla has
actually performed some kind of
performance test and it is found out
that git is actually one order of
magnitude faster than other version
control tools which is actually equal to
ten times faster than other version
control tools and the reason for that is
because git is actually written in C and
C is not like other high-level languages
it is very close to machine language so
it reduces all the runtime overheads and
it makes all the processing very fast so
get is very small and a get is very fast
and the next feature is that it is open
source well you know that it was
actually created by Linus Torvalds and
he is the famous man who created the
Linux kernel and he actually used git in
the development of the Linux kernel now
they were using a version control system
called bitkeeper first but it was not
open source day so the owner of
bitkeeper has actually made it a paid
version and this actually got Linus
Torvalds mad so what he did is that he
created his own version control system
tool and he came up with git and he made
it open source for everyone so that you
can so the source code is available and
you can modify it on your own and you
can get it for free so there is one more
good thing about git and after that it
is very reliable like I've been telling
you since the Stars that a have a backup
of all the files in your local
repository so if your central server
crashes you don't have to worry your
files are all saved in your local
repository and even if it's not in your
local repository it might be in some
other developers local repository and
you can tell him what and whenever you
need from that data and you lose the
data and after your central server is
all repaired if it was crashed he can
directly push all the data into the
central repository and from there
everyone else can always have a backup
here and Sebastian says I guess even
they would have a backup for
central repository yeah you can do that
it
you are not if you think that your
developers are not trustworthy enough
that they might not be pulling codes
regularly and you want to make sure that
you don't have to actually contact each
of the collaborators or the developers
on events like this you can always
maintain a duplicate copy of your
central repository but if you don't want
to waste more money or more space you
can always rely on your developers as
well but if you want to do it and I
think it is advisable to have a
duplicate copy of your central
repository like Sebastian you said you
can do that as well okay so and
Sebastian are you satisfied with my
answer
okay says yes so the next thing is that
kid is actually very secure now git uses
the sha-1 do name and identify objects
so whenever you actually make change it
actually creates a commit object and
after you have made changes and you have
committed to those changes it is
actually very hard to go back and change
it without other people knowing it
because whenever you make it commit the
sha-1 actually converts it well okay so
Jonathan what is sha-1 well it is a kind
of cryptographic algorithm it is a
message digest algorithm that actually
converts your commit object into a 40
digit hexadecimal code now sha I uses
techniques and algorithms like md4 and
md5 and it is actually very secure it is
considered to be very secure because
even the National Security Agency of the
United States of America uses SSA I so
if they're using it you might know that
it is very secure as well and if you
want to know what 75 and message digest
I'm not going to take you through the
whole algorithm whole cryptographic
algorithm about how they make that
cipher and all you can google it and you
can learn what it is hei but the main
concept of it is that after you have
made changes you cannot deny that you
have not made changes because it will
store it and everyone can see it it will
create a commit
for you so everyone will see it and this
commit hash in is also useful when you
want to revert back to previous versions
you want to know that which commit
exactly caused what problem and if you
want to remove that commit if you want
to remove that version you can do that
because sha I will give you the hash log
of every covet
okay so Jamie ask any revert back to the
previous commit of course we can avert
back to a previous commit you can see
what was exactly changed and if you want
Jamie I can show you that in a while
that I can revert back to a previous
commit
okay so Jamieson is cool so let's move
on and see the next feature which is
economical now git is actually released
under the general public's license and
it means that it is for free you don't
have to pay any money to download get in
your system you can have kid without
burning a hole in your pocket and since
all the heavy lifting is done on the
kind side because everything you do you
do it on your own entire workspace and
you push it into the local repository
first and after that it's pushing the
central server so it means that people
are only pushing into the central server
after when they're sure about the work
and and they're not experimenting on the
central repository so your central
repository can be very simple and if you
don't have to worry about having a very
complex and very powerful hardware and a
lot of money can be saved on that as
well so to get a free get is small so
git provides you with all the cool
features that you would actually want so
this were all the gift features if you
have any questions on that you might ask
me and if not we'll go ahead to the next
topic okay so we'll go ahead to the next
topic
our next aisle so first we'll see what
is a repository now as github says it it
is a directory or storage space where
all your projects can live it can be
local to a folder on your computer like
your local repository or it can be a
storage space and github or another
online host it means your central
repository and it can keep your code
file sticks
image files you name it you can keep it
inside a repository everything that is
related to your project and like I have
been chanting since the start of this
tutorial that we have got two kinds of
repositories we've called the central
repository and we've called the local
repositories and now let us take a look
at what this repulsive trees actually
are so on the left-hand side you can see
all about the central repository and in
the right hand side this is all about my
local repository and the diagram in the
middle actually shows you the entire
layout so the local repository will be
inside my local machine and my simple
repository for now is going to be on
github so my central repository is
typically located on the remote server
and like I just saw earlier if typically
located on github and my local
repository is going to be my local
machine as we slide in as in a dot git
folder and it will be inside your
project root the dot git folder is going
to be inside your project's root and
then you contain all the templates and
all the objects and every other
configuration files when you create your
local repository and since you're
pushing all the code your central
repository will also have the same dot
git repository folder inside it and the
sole purpose of having a central
repository is so that you're all the
collaborators or all the developers can
actually share and exchange state data
because someone might be working on a
different problem and someone might be
needing help and that so what he can do
is that he can push all the code all the
problems that he has solved or something
that he has worked on into the central
repository and everyone else can see it
and everyone else can pull his code and
use it for themselves as well so this is
just meant for sharing data where is in
local repository it is only you can
access it and it is only meant for your
own so you can work in your local
repository you can work in isolation and
no one will interfere you and after
you're done after you're sure that your
code is working and you want to show it
to everyone just transfer it or push it
into the central repository okay so now
we'll be seeing
the gate operations and commands this is
how we'll be using it
there are various operations and
commands that will help us to do all the
things that we were just talking about
right now we're talking about pushing
changes so these are all get operations
so we'll be performing all this
operations will be creating repositories
with this command will be making changes
in the files that are in our
repositories with the commands will be
also doing parallel nonlinear
development that I was just talking
about and also this thinking of
repositories so that our central
repository and local repository are
connected so I'll show you how to do
that one by one so let's start but
before that has anyone got any kind of
questions or shall I just move forward
okay so Sebastian says move forward no
doubts and so let us move forward and
see these operations one by one so the
first thing that we need to do is create
repositories so we need a central
repository and we need a local
repository now will host our central
repository on github so for that you
need an account and github and create a
repository there and for your local
repository you have to install git in
your system and if you are working on a
completely new project and if you want
to start something fresh and very new
you can just use git init to create your
repository or if you want to join an
ongoing project and if you're new to the
project and you just join so what you
can do is that you can clone the central
repository using this command git float
so let us do that so let's first create
a github account and create the
positives on github
so at first you need to go to github.com
and if you don't have an account you can
sign up for github and here you just
have to take a username that has not
been already taken you have to provide
your email address get a password and
then just click this green button here
and your account will be created it's
very easy don't have to do much and
after that you just have to verify your
email and everything and after you're
done with all sort of thing you can just
go sign in I will already have an
account so I'm just going to sign in
here so after you're signed in you'll
find this page here so you'll get two
buttons where you can read the guide of
how to use github or you can just start
a project right away now I'll be telling
you all about github so you don't have
to click this button right now so you
can just go ahead and start a project
so now git tails that for every project
you need to have you need to maintain a
unique repository it is because it's
very healthy and keeps things very clean
because if you are storing just the
files related to one project in a
repository you won't get confused later
so when you're creating a new repository
you have to provide with a repository
name now I'm just going to name it get -
github
and you can throw
it with the description of this
repository and this is optional if you
don't want you can leave it blank and
you can choose whether you want it
public or private now if you want do it
to be private you have to pay some kind
of amount so like this will cost you $7
a month and so what what is the benefit
of having a private account is that only
you can see it if you don't want to
share your code with anyone and you
don't want anyone to see it you can do
that and github as well but for now I'll
just leave it public I just want it for
free and let everyone see my work what
you have done so what's the fee with
public for now and after that you can
initialize this repository with the
readme
so the readme file will contain the
description of your files this is the
first file that is going to be inside a
repository when you create the
repository so and it's a good habit to
actually initialize your repository with
the readme so I'll just click this
option and this is the option to add git
ignore now there might be some kind of
files that you don't want when you're
making operations like push or pull you
don't want those files to get pushed or
pulled like it might be some kind of log
files or anything so you can add those
files and get ignore here so right now I
don't have got any files so this is just
the starting of her project so I will
just ignore this get ignore for now and
then you can actually add some license
as well so you can just go through what
this license actually are but if you
want to just leave it as none and after
that just click on this green button
here so just create your repository and
so there it is so you can see this is
the initial commit you have initialized
your repository with the readme and this
is your readme file now if you want to
make changes into the readme file just
click on it and click on the Edit pencil
image or I can kind of that is in here
and it can make changes on the readme
files if you want to write something
let's say just write a description
judges if for tutorial focus and that's
just keeping it simple and after that
you've made changes the next thing that
you have to do is you have to commit a
changes so you can just go down and
click on this commit changes green
button here and stuff so you have
updated we need our MD and this is your
commit hash so you can see that in here
is to go back to your repository you can
say that something has an update and to
show you when was your last commit
should even show you the time so and for
now you're on the branch master here and
this will actually show you all the logs
so since only I'm contributing here so
this is only one contributor and I've
just made to commit the first one was
when I initialized it and right now when
I modified it and right now have not
created any branches so there is only
one branch so now my central repository
hasn't created so the next thing that I
need to do is create a local repository
in my local machine now I have already
installed get in my system I have using
a Windows system so I've installed it
for Windows so if you want some help
with the installation
I have already written a blog on that
I'll leave the link of the blog in the
description below you can refer to that
blog and install get in your system now
I've already done that so let's say that
I want a project to be in the feed drive
so let's say I'm just creating in folder
here for my project so just name it
add your acre project and let's say that
this is where I want my local repository
to be so first thing that I do is
right-click and I'll click this option
here get bash here and this will
actually open up a very colorful
terminal for you to use and this is
called the git bash emulator so this is
where you'll be typing all your commands
and you'll be doing all your work in
get back here so in order to create your
local repository the first thing that
we'll do is type in this command get in
it and press Enter so now you can see
that it is initialized empty git
repository on this pot so let's see and
you can see that a dot git of a folder
has been created here and you see here
you'll see you can see that it contains
all the configurations and the object
details and everything so your
repositories initialized and this is
going to be your local repository so any
questions on how to create repositories
as you saw John says no so after we have
created our repositories it is very
important to link them because how would
you know which repository to push into
and how will you just pull all the
changes or all the files from a remote
repository if you don't know if they are
not connected properly so in order to
connect them with the first thing that
we need to do is that we need to add a
region and we're going to call our
remote repository as origin and we'll be
using the command git remote add origin
to add so that we can pull files from
our github or central repository and in
order to fetch files we can use git pull
and if you want to transfer all your
files or push files in the github will
be using git push so let me just show
you how to do that so we're back in a
local repository and as you can see now
that have not got any kind of files and
if you go to my central repository you
can see that I've got a readme file so
the first thing that I need to do is to
add this remote repository as my origin
so for that I'll clear my screen first
so for that you need to use this command
git remote add origin and the link of
your central repository and let me just
show you where you can find this link so
when you go back into your repository
you'll find this green button here which
is the clone or download just
here and this is the HTTP URL that you
want to just copy it on your clipboard
go back to your git bash and paste it
and enter so your origin has been added
successfully because it's not showing
any kind of errors so now what we'll do
is that will perform a git pull it means
we'll fetch all the files from the
central repository into my local
repository so just type in the command
git pull origin master and you can see
that they have done some guys fetching
from the master branch into the master
branch and let us see that whether all
the files have been fetched or not let
us go back to our local repository and
there is the readme file that was in the
central repository and now it is in my
local repository so this is how you
actually update your local repository
from the control repository you perform
a git pull and it will fetch all the
files from the central repository in
your local machine so now if you want to
push changes you can use git bush
okay so I have a question from Sebastian
he said that the file when you're
pulling it is it in the compressed
format well actually when you're storing
the files in your central repository
that files are actually all compressed
so when you're pulling it it comes in
the compressed format as well but while
when you're actually including it in
your workspace or in your staging area
then it unpacks all the files and you
can use it but while and after you have
done committing and you have pushed that
in your local repository it is again
compressed but while you are working
with that in your workspace it is in the
uncompressed format so Sebastian have
you got your answer so let us move
forward and move ahead to the next
operation now I've told you in order to
sync repositories you also need to use a
git push but since we have not done
anything in our local repository now so
I'll call the good get push later on
after I show you all the operations and
we'll be doing a lot of things so at the
end as we performing the git push and
push all the changes into Munson's
repository and actually that is how you
should do that the it's a good habit and
it's a good practice if you're working
with github and git is that when you
start working the first thing that you
need to do is make a git pull to fetch
all the files from your central
repository so that it could get updated
with all the changes that have been
recently made by everyone else and after
you're done working after you're sure
that your gold is running then only make
the git push so that everyone can see it
you should not make very frequent
changes into the central repository
because that might interrupt the work of
your other collaborators or other
contributors as well so let us move
ahead and see how we can make changes so
now kit actually has a concept it has
intermediate layers that resides between
your workspace and your local repository
now when you want to commit changes or
make changes in your local repository
you have to add those files in the index
first
so this is the layer that is between
your workspace and local repository now
it's your files are not in the index you
cannot make commits or you can apps
cannot make changes into your local
repository so for that you have to use
the command git add and you might get
confused that which all files are in the
index and which all are not so if you
want to see that you can use the command
git status and after you have added the
changes in the index you can use the
command git commit to make the changes
in the local repository now let me tell
you what is exactly a git commit
everyone will be talking about git
commit committing changes when you're
making changes so let us just know what
is a git commit so let's say that you
have not made any kind of changes or
this is your initial project so what a
comet is is that it is a kind of object
which is actually a version of your
project so let's say that you have made
some changes and you have committed
those changes what your version good
your system will do is that it will
create another comet object and this is
going to be your different version with
the changes so your comet snapshots are
actually going to contain snapshots of
the project which is actually changed so
this is what commit is so I'll just show
you I'll just go ahead and show you how
to commit changes in your local
repository so we're back into our local
repository and so let's just create some
five years so now if you're developing a
project you might be just only
contributing your source code files into
the central repository so now I'm not
just going to tell you all about coding
so we're just going to create some text
files write something in that which is
actually pretty much sane if you're
working on a code and you were storing
your source code in your repositories so
I'll just go ahead and create a simple
text file I'll just name it a d1 just
write something and I'll just write
first file save this file close it
so now remember that even if I have
created inside this repository this is
actually showing my workspace and it is
not in my local repository now because I
have not committed it so what I'm going
to do is that I'm going to see what all
files are in my index but before that
I'll clear my screen because I don't
like junk on my screen okay so the first
thing that we're going to see is that
what all files are added in my index and
for that I just told you we're going to
use the command git status so you can
see that it is calling Eddie one dot txt
which we just have written it is calling
it an untracked file now untracked files
are those which are not added in the
index yet so this is newly created I
have not added it explicitly into the
index so if I want to commit changes in
Eddie 1 dot txt I will have to add it in
the index so for that I'll just use the
command git add and the name of your
file which is Eddie 1 dot txt and it has
been added so now let us check the
status again so for that we'll use git
status and you can see that change is
ready to be committed is the Eddie
wonder txt because it's in the index and
now you can commit changes on your local
repository so in order to commit the
command that you should be using is gift
commit - M because whenever you are
committing you always have to give a
commit message so that everyone can see
you who made all this commits and what
exactly it is
so this commit message is just for your
purpose that you can see what exactly
was changed but even if you don't write
it the version control system is also
going to do that and if you have
configured your kit it is always going
to show that who is the user who has
at this change okay so Sebastian has a
question yes that can I add a whole
folder in the index well of course you
can you can add all the multiple files
at one go I'll just show you how the
best technical one just because I had
only one file so I just added it
explicitly and yeah Jamie also has the
same kind of questions can we add
multiple files and then commit instead
of one file of course you can do that
I'll show you how to do that
and Sebastian and Jamie will just
because I had only one file so as I was
just doing it explicitly one by one so
let me just show you this one first and
then I'll show you how to add multiple
files into the index and come with them
all at once okay so I was just talking
about writing a commit message so I'm
just going to write something like
adding first commit in local group and
press Enter so you can see once I'll
change something has been inserted so
this is the changes are finally
committed in my local repository and as
you want to see how actually get stores
all this commit with actually I'll show
you after I show you how to commit
multiple files together so let's just go
back into our local Beppo folder and we
just create some more files more text
files you can name it at you too let's
create another one and the same it at
your three let's just write something
over here we'll just say second file
first time so let's go back to our get
Bosch terminal and now let us see the
gifts status so now you can see that it
is showing that Eddie - and Eddie 3 are
not in my index and if you remember
anyone was already in the index actually
let me just go back and make some
modifications in Eddie 1 as well so I'm
going to write modified 1 so you'll just
see get status again and you can see
that it is showing that anyone is
modified and there are untracked files
Eddie - and Eddie 3 because I haven't
added them in my index yet so now
Sebastian Jamie you have been asking me
how to like a doll multiple files
together so now I'm going to add all
these files at once so for that I'm just
going to use get at - kappa ta just
press enter and now see the git status
and you see that all the files have been
added to the index at once and it
similarly with commit as well so now
that you have added all the files in the
index I can also commit them all at once
and how to do that let me just show you
you just have to write git commit and -
small a so so if you want to commit all
you have to use - small a in case of git
commit whereas in case of get add if you
want to add all the files you have to
use - capital e so just remember that
difference an add message
adding so you can see three files has
been changed and now let me show you how
this actually gets stores all this
commits she can perform an operation
called the KITT log and you can see so
this is a forty digit hexadecimal code
that I was thinking and talking about
and this is the sha-1 hash and you can
see the date and you have got the commit
message that we have just provided where
I just wrote adding three files together
it shows it it shows the date and the
exact time and the author and this is me
because I've already configured it with
my name so this is how you can see come
in and this is actually how version
control system like it actually stores
all your commits so Jamie asks can I
commit without em flag well yes you can
remove the EM flag but then what will
happen is that it will there is going to
be a prompt window asking you for a
commit message actually you cannot
commit without providing a message now I
don't want any other window or a command
line to pop up in the screen and that is
a very old-school VI editor where you
have to like insert the command and then
: WQ and exit so instead of that I will
just not use a simple M flag and provide
my message in potations but Jamie if
your question was if you can come in
without a message no you cannot you
always have to provide a message either
this way or just with the window prompt
where you can type in your message and
enter so okay this clear to your Jamie
and Sebastian okay so let us go back and
see the next operation which is how to
do parallel development or a nonlinear
development and the first operation is
branching now we've been talking about
branching a lot and let me just tell you
what exactly is branching and what
exactly you can do with branching
well you can think of branches like a
pointer to a specific commit let's say
that you have made changes in your main
branch now remember that your main
branch that I told you about it's called
the master branch and the master branch
will contain all the code so let's say
that you're working on the master branch
and you've just made a change and you
have decided to add some new feature
onto it so you want to work on the new
feature individually or you don't want
to interfere with the master branch if
you want to separate that you can
actually create a branch from this
commit and let me show you how to
actually create branches now a lot of
study that there are two kind of
branches there are local branches and
remote tracking branches your remote
branches are the branches that is going
to connect your branches from your local
repository to your central repository
and local branches are something that
you only create in your workspace that
is only going to work with your with the
files in your local repository so I'll
show you how to create branches and then
everything will be clear to you so let's
go back to our git bash clear the screen
and right now we are in the master
branch and this indicates which branch
you were on to right now so we're in the
master branch right now and we're going
to create a different branch so for that
you just have to type the command kid
branch and write a branch name so let us
just call it first branch and enter now
you have created a branch and and this
first branch will now contain all the
files that were in the master because it
originated from the master branch so now
the shows that you are still in the
master branch and if you want to switch
to the new branch that you just created
you have to use this c'mon kids check
out but it's called checking out is
going to move from one branch to another
it's called checking out and get so
we're going to get check out and the
name of the brush
switch to first brush and now you can
see that we're in the first branch and
now we can start doing all the work in
our first branch so let us create two
more files in the first round so let's
go back and this will actually show me
my workspace of my first branch right
now so we'll just create another text
document and we're going to name it edu
for and you can just write something
first right to save it just go back and
I was made some changes so let us just
commit this changes all at once so let
me just use get add after that what you
have to do if you remember is that you
have to perform a git commit and enter
okay for one file change so now remember
that I have only needs this add you for
change in my first run and this is not
in the master branch it because now
we're in the first branch if it lists
out all the files in the first branch
you can see that you've got the Eddie
one 8283 and the read movies within the
master branch because it will be
deprecated originated from the master
branch and apart from that it has a new
file called Eddie for dot txt and now if
you just move back into the master
branch at save we're going back into the
master branch
and if you just see the files
MasterBrand you'll find that there is no
adieu for because I've only need the
changes in my first branch so what we
have done now is that we have created
branches and we have also understood the
purpose of creating branches so do you
have any doubts in how to create
branches and why branches are needed or
shall we just move on to the next topic
ok so we're moving on to the next topic
the next thing we'll see is merging so
now if you're creating branches and you
are developing a new feature and you
want to add that new feature you have to
do an operation called emerging emerging
means combining the work of different
branches altogether and it's very
important that after you have branched
off from your master branch always
combine it back in at the end after
you're done working with the branch
always remember to merge it back in so
now we have created branches let us see
and we have made changes in our branch
like we have added Eddy for and if you
want to combine that back in our master
branch because like I told you your
master branch will always contain your
production quality code ok so I've got a
question from Jaime he asked that what
is get stash now git stash is actually
something that you can actually use when
you're developing some kind of feature
and and you don't want it yet you're not
sure about that feature and you don't
want to add it in a workflow yet so you
have done some kind of work on that and
you want to leave it and move on to
another work you can actually get stash
it so what good stash will do it is that
it will break up your branch completely
and store it differently and actually do
it on your other work and you want to go
back onto that so you can use git stash
apply and reattach that branch or
reattach that feature again in your
development work so that is get stash so
I'm not going to show you about like get
stash right now because we're not
actually developing a project or
something so I'm just giving a brief
idea so I hope that you have understood
ok
ok Jaime's so let us now actually merge
start merging those files because of
already created branches it's time that
we merge them so we're back in my
terminals and what we need to do is
merge those changes and if you remember
that we've got a different file in my
first branch which is the Eddy four and
it's not there in the master branch yet
so what I want to do is merge that
branch into my master branch so for that
I'll use a command called git merge and
the name of my branch and there is a
very important thing to remember when
you're merging is that you want to merge
the work of your first branch into
master so you want master to be the
destination so whenever you're merging
you have to remember that you were
always checked out in the destination
branch so I'm already checked out in the
master branch so I don't have to change
it back so I'll just use the command get
merged and the name of the branch which
word you want to merge it into and you
have to provide the name of the branch
whose work you want merged into the
current branch that you were checked out
so for now I've just got one branch
which is called the first branch and
enter so you can see that one file
change something has been added we are
in the master branch right now so now
let us let out all the files in the
master branch and there you see now you
have add you four dot txt which was not
there before I've merged it so this is
what merging does now now you have to
remember that your first branch is still
separate now if you want to go back into
your first branch and modify some
changes again in the first branch and
keep it there you can do that it will
not actually affect the master branch
until you merge it so let me just show
you an example so let's go back to my
first branch
so now let us make changes in edu for
I'll just write modified in first French
we'll go back and we'll just commit all
these changes and as you feel skit
commit so now remember that the get
commit all is also performed for another
purpose now it doesn't only actually
commit all the uncommitted file at once
if your files are in the index and he
has just modified it also does the job
of adding it to the index again by
modifying it and then committing it but
it would work if you have never added
that file in the index now Eddie for was
already in the index now after modifying
it I have not explicitly added in the
index and if I'm using git commit all it
will explicitly added in the index it
will because it was already a tracked
file and then it will commit the changes
also in my local repository so you see I
didn't use the command git add I just
did it with git commit because it was
already a tracked file so one file has
been changed so now if you just just
scat it and you can see that it's
different
it shows the modification that we have
done which is modified at first branch
now let's just go back to my master
branch now remember that I have not
merged it yet and my master branch also
contains a copy of Eddie Ford and let's
see what this copy actually contains
so you see that the modification has not
affected in the master branch because I
have only done the modification in the
first branch so the copy that is in the
master branch has not it's not the
modified copy because I have not merged
it yet so it's very important to
remember that if you actually want all
the changes that you have made in the
first branch all the things that you
have developed in the new branch that
you have created make sure that you
merge it in don't forget to merge or
else it will not show any kind of
modifications so I hope that if
understood or why merging is important
how to actually merge different branches
together so we'll just move on to the
next topic and which is rebasing now
when you say rebasing rebasing is also
another kind of merging okay so before
that I've got a question from Jamie he
asked that what's the difference between
get full and git fetch well the main
difference is that when you do a git
pull it actually pulls all the new files
or the changed files from a central
repository and it directly places them
or connects them into your master branch
and when you actually do a git fetch git
fetch also does the same thing it just
pulls or it just fetches all changed
files or new files from the central
level but it actually stores it in a
different branch which is not connected
with your current workflow so if you're
doing a git fetch make sure that you do
a git merge so that you actually can see
the changes in your local repositories
so you can say that git pull is equal to
a git fetch plus a git merge so that is
the main difference so Jamie have you
got your answer ok he says yes so now
let's get back to rebasing and as i was
telling you that rebasing is another
kind of merging so the first thing that
you need to and
standard rebase is that it actually
solves the same problem as of get merge
and both of this commands are designed
to integrate changes from one branch
into another and since that they just do
the same task in a different way
now what rebasing means if you see the
workflow diagram here is that you've got
your master branch and you've got your
nybridge now when you re basing it what
it does if you see in this workflow
diagram here is that it's got a new
branch and your master branch and when
your rebasing it instead of creating a
similar commit which will have two
parent commits what rebasing does is
that it actually places the entire
commit history of your branch on to the
tip of the master now you'd ask me why
should we do that like what is the use
of that well the major benefit of using
our rebase is that you get a much
cleaner project history now sometimes
yes Sebastian is asking that is it done
to reduce the number of branches yes of
course because having so many branches
together you might get confused if you
have merged it or if something has been
merged or not and you're reverting back
so it's actually very happy third your
workflow becomes a very haphazard and if
you want to maintain a cleaner project
history and if you want a linear
workflow you can use freebasing for that
and it also helps you to navigate better
if you have a linear workflow right so
this is the way that you can use rebase
so I hope you've understood the concept
of relays so let me just show you how to
actually do rebasing okay so what we're
going to do is that we're going to do
some more work in our branch and after
that we've eBay's our branch onto master
so we'll just go back to our branch use
git checkout
first brunch and now we're going to
create some more file view image ed u5
and let's say do you fix so we're going
to write some random stuff absolutely
welcome to where Eureka won all right
the same thing again let's say welcome
to so we've created this and now we're
going back to our git bash and we're
going to add all this new files because
now we need to add because if we cannot
do it with just get commit all because
these are untracked files this is the
files that I just created right now so
I'm using and now we're going to commit
and it has been committed so now if you
just see all the files in C I do 1 2 3 4
5 6 and read me and if you go back to
the master and if you just list out all
the files and master it only has up to 4
the 5 and 6 are still in my first brush
and I have not merged it yet and I'm not
going to use git merge right now I'm
going to use rebase this time instead of
using git merge and this you'll see that
this will actually do the same thing
so for that you just have to use the
command so let us go back to our first
branch okay
did a typing error IRS CDR K and ch okay
switch the first branch and now we're
going to use the command git rebase
master now it is showing that my current
branch first branch is up-to-date just
because because whatever is in the
master branch is already there in my
first branch and there were no new files
to be added so that is the thing so but
if you want to do it in the reverse way
I'll show you what will happen let's
just go and check out master let's do
releasing it rebase first branch so now
what happened is that all the work of
first branch has been attached to the
master branch and it has been done
linearly there was no need new set of
commits so now as you see all the files
as a master branch you'll find that
you've got 85 and Eddy 6 as well which
was in the first branch
so basically rebasing has merged all the
work of my first branch into the master
but the only thing that happened is that
it happened in the linear way all the
commits that we did in first branch
actually got reattached to the head in
the master so have you all understood
what rebasing is okay so I've got a
confirmation from Jamie and John okay so
should I go on forward so this was all
about a nonlinear development I have
told you about branching merging read
thing that made changes with full
changes committed changes but I remember
that I haven't shown you how to push
changes so since we're done working in
our local repository now we have made
our all final changes and now we want it
to contribute in our central repository
so for that we're going to use git push
and I'm going to show you how to do a
git push right now before I go ahead to
explain you a git push you have to know
that when you're actually setting up
your repository if you remember you
can't have repository as a public
repository it means that you're giving a
read access to everyone else in the
github community so everyone else can
clone or download your false profiles so
when you're pushing changes and a
repository you have to know that you
need to have certain access rights
because it is a central repository this
is where you're storing your actual code
so you don't want other people to
interfere in it by pushing wrong codes
or something
so we're going to connect mice and
repositories via SSH in order to push
changes into my central repository now
at the beginning when I was trying to
make this connection with SSS or facing
certain kind of problems let me go back
to the repository let me show you when
you click this button you see that this
is your HTTP URL in order that you use
in order to connect with yours and
repository now if you want to use SSH so
this is your SSH connection URL so in
order to connect with SSH what do you
need to do is that you have to generate
a public SSH key and then just add that
key simply into your github account and
after that you can start pushing changes
so first we'll do that will generate a
ssh public key so for that we'll use
this command s - fetch - qijin sender
file there is already an SSH key so you
want to override it yes
so my SSH key has been generated and it
has been saved in here so if I want to
see it as a few scat and copy it so this
is my public SSH key now if I want to
add this SSH key I'll go back into my
github account and here I will go back
in settings and we'll go ahead and click
on this option as to fetch and TPG keys
and I've already had two SSH keys added
and I want to add my new ones so I'm
going to click this button new SSH key
and just make sure that it provides a
name to it I'm just going to keep it in
order because I've named the other ones
ssh-1 and SSS - just so I'm going to fit
as 3 so just paste your switch key in
here just copy this key
paste it and click on this button which
is add SSH key ok so now well the first
thing you need to do is clear the screen
and now what you need to do is you need
to use this command at the search - T
and your SEO search URL that we use
which is get at the rate github.com and
enter so my ssh authentication has been
successfully done so i'll go back to my
github account and if i refresh this you
can see that the key is green it means
that it has been properly authenticated
and now I'm ready to push changes on to
the central repository so we'll just
start doing it so let me just tell you
one more thing that if you are
developing something in your local
repository and you have done it in a
particular branch in your local
repository and let's say that you don't
want to push this changes into the
master branch of your tentacle or your
github repository so let's say that
whatever work that you have done it will
stay in a separate branch in your github
repository so that it does not interfere
with the master branch and everyone can
identify that it is actually your branch
and you have created it and this branch
only contains your work so for that let
me just go to the github repository and
show you something let's go to the
repositories and this is the repository
that I had just created today so when
you go in the repository you can see
that I have only got one branch here
which is the master branch and if I want
to create branches I can create it here
but I would advise you to create all
branches from your command line or
sonica - only in your central repository
as well so let us go back and
branch so now what I wanted that I want
all the work of the first branch in my
local repository to make a new branch in
the central repository and and that
branch and messenger publisher will
contain all the files that is in the
first branch of my local repository so
for that I'll just perform
git push the name of my remote witches
or written and first branch and you can
see that it has pushed all the changes
so let's verify it let us go back to our
repository and let's refresh it so this
is the master branch and you can see
that it has created another branch which
is called the first branch because I
have pushed all the files from my first
branch into and and I have created a new
branch or first branch as similar to my
first branch in my local repository here
in github so now if we go to brunch you
can see that there's not only a single
master we have also called another
branch which is called the first branch
now if you want to check out this brand
just click on it and you can see it has
all the files with all the commit logs
here in this branch so this is how you
push changes and if you want to push all
the change into master you can do the
same thing let us go back to our branch
master
and we're going to perform a git push
here but only what we're going to do
this time is we're going to push all the
files into the master branch and method
for repository so for that I'll just use
this git push origin okay so the push
operation is done and if you go back
here and if you go back to master you
can see that all the files that were in
the master branch and the local repo has
been added into the master branch of my
central ripple also so this is how you
make changes and from your central
repository to local repository so this
is exactly what you do with git so if I
have to summarize what I just showed you
entirely in this when I'm when I was
telling about git add and committing and
pushing and police so this is exactly
what is happening so this is your local
repository this is your working
directory so the staging areas are
indexed the intermediate layer between
your workspace and your local repository
so you have to add your files into the
staging area or the index with git add
and you commit those changes with git
commit in your local repository and if
you want to push all this changes into
the remote repository or the central
repository where everyone can see it you
use a git push and similarly if you want
to pull all those files or fetch all
those files from your github repository
you can use git pull and you want to use
branches if you want to move from one
branch to another you can use git
checkout as we want to combine the work
of different branches together you can
use git merge so this is entirely what
you do when you're performing all these
kind of operations so I hope it is clear
to everyone does anyone have any
questions on that
and I remember Jamie you have often I
think Sebastian Ying I've asked me that
question to that how can we actually
revert back to previous versions and I
remember John has asked me that same
question too when I was explaining about
versions so I'll just show you how can
you check out what has been
and modifications so so just clear the
screen and okay so let us go back to our
terminal
and just for experimentation purpose
just to show you that how we can
actually get revert back to our previous
changes so now you might not want to
change everything that you made in ed
you wanted you to at use for or some
other files that we just created so
let's just go and create a new file
modify it two times and revert back to
the previous version just for
demonstration purpose so I'm just going
to create a new text file let's call it
his word and now let us just type
something hello let's just keep it that
simple to save it and go back we'll add
this file then come with this and say
just call it revert one just remember
that this is the first comment that I
made with revert one and just so has
been changed so now let's go back and
modify this so after I've committed this
file it means that it has toward a
version with the text hello exclamation
and my revert text file so I'm just
going to go back and change something in
here I'll just let us just add there
hello there save it
go back to our - now let us commit this
file again because I've made some
changes and I want a different version
of the reverse file so we'll just go
ahead and commit again so I'll use git
commit all 6 River - and enter and it's
done so now if I want to revert back to
ok so now you just see the file you can
see I've modified it so now it has got
hello there let's say that I want to go
back to my previous version I would just
want to go back to when I had just hello
so for that I'll just check my get log
and you can check here that this is the
commit log or to commit hash
when I first committed revert it means
that this is the version one of my
revert now what you need to do is that
you need to copy this commit hash now
you can just copy the first eight
hexadecimal digits and that will be it
so just copy it whole clear the screen
first you just need to go use this
command git checkout and hexadecimal
code are back to decimal digits that you
just copied and the name of your file
which is revert dot txt so you just have
to use this command get checked out and
the commit has that you just copy the
first eight digits and you have to name
the file which is revert dot txt
so now when you just see this file you
have to gone back to the previous commit
and now when you just the status file
you can see that now I've only got just
hello it means that I have rolled back
to the previous version because I have
used the commit hash when I initially
committed with the first change so this
is how you revert back to a previous
version so Jamie and John Sebastian has
everyone understood how you can roll
back to previous versions with git so do
you have any questions ok
so this is what we have learned today in
today's tutorial we've understood what
is version control and why do we need
version controls and we've also learned
about the different version control
tools and in that we have primarily
focused on git and we have learned all
about git and github about how to create
repositories and perform some kind of
operations and commands in order to push
pull and move files from wonderful the
tree to another this also studied about
the features of git and we also seen a
case study about how the minion
enterprises which is one of the biggest
publishing company who makes very
popular websites that we have got right
now we have seen how they have used
github as well so this is what we
learned today I hope that it is helpful
to you so does anyone have any kind of
questions before I end this tutorial
okay so everyone seems to be clear about
everything so thank you everyone for
joining today's session and if you have
any kind of questions and queries or if
