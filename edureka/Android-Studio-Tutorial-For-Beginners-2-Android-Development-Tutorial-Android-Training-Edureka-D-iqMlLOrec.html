to the session of Android if you can
hear me can you quickly acknowledge in
the questions panel great yeah I can see
you guys in the questions - all right I
want you guys to enjoy to this session
no the second agenda now you are
familiar with your Android you're
familiar with your activity you know how
to write your application and
religiously you have said hello and
you're quite comfortable that your
application works now is the time for
you to go deeper into Android in this
session you guys are going to
concentrate on the event business now
just as an example in the previous
session that we got the button and you
guys are going to learn how exactly the
button works now like if someone clicks
on the button how do you listen to it
and we'll be implementing the logcat
right into the button now whenever you
click on the button my logcat is going
to tell you all that you clicked on the
button this is what you guys are going
to learn under the event listeners now
then comes the most interesting part
there happens to be the intense now
intent happens to be the spine of your
android the intent takes birth at the
kernels now in kernel normally we call
that as a binders now to call an
activity we use the intent and apart
from that I'll be teaching you how
exactly to take a deep dive into intent
and how formally how professionally that
we all can use intent in android now how
to call the Android components like your
geo coders the Google map and your
google chrome can be called the dialers
can be called all this happens to be the
component of Android and you guys are
going to learn how to call all those
components using the intense so first
this is what we intend to learn in your
session - and after that I'm going to
clarify your doubts all right guys let's
take a plunge and let's get started
no guys it's time for us to move on to
event lessness and this is going to be
the most interesting part of this
session and this is where you're going
to learn how to call many activities and
you guys are going to learn how to call
activities with implicit and explicit
intents and you are going to learn how
to make an activity as a standalone
activity wherein the others from the
different process boundary can also use
your activity all right guys let's start
with the event listeners so far we wrote
a program to have a text being displayed
on the screen and we had the button now
let us see how to grab the event if
somebody clicks on the button how do I
get to know that if somebody has clicked
on the button so let's get to understand
how exactly this works now in event
listeners we have various event
listeners like on click listeners for
example when the user is going to click
on the button now we are going to
override the on click listener this is
called when the user either touches the
item when in the touch mode that means
when the user touches the button and we
are going to grab the on click listener
so as you have onfocus change and you
have on long click now when you come to
the screen and hold it for a long time
and you want a context menu to pop up so
probably those cases we use the on long
click and on key whenever you click on
any of the keys on key will come in and
on touch will come in you can have one
touch multiple touches to play the game
all those things as possible so this way
we have many listeners so as of now I'm
going to talk only about the on click
and the rest of the listeners will be
covered in the next couple of sessions
all right now to get going with this on
click and I am back to my code and here
you all can see this push me is right
there and when you click on push me I
want to say something I want to create a
text right so this is all that I want to
do now let us see how how to do that
now here all that I am going to do here
is I have to bring in push me that is a
button now let me use the butt
and I will declare the button and I'm
going to call this as push push me is
the name of the button and now I'm going
to use something called as find view by
ID now by using this find view by ID now
this guy in turn is going to refer back
to my resource so what I am going to do
is I'm going to use my resource and I'm
going to use my ID now guys do remember
we are already there in activity main
because we have already moved from
resource we went to layout and we went
to the activity been now in activity
main now we are already this and we have
to be here in the button now to get the
hang to get the handle of this
particular button we need to declare an
ID now let me say for that I will opt
for at plus ID this is the identity to
write your button now here I'm going to
call this as push B
push me button and this is the identity
of the button and I'm going to use this
identity if the button in the main
program to get the handle of this
particular button all right so I'm going
to say ordered ID dot the very minute I
say y'all can see the handle yo got
activity main has one handle and push me
button and this is what we created just
now and let me get the handle of that
again
this guy's throwing up a nurse because
he says he he is recommending me to cast
to write the cast here in front of fine
view by ID no I'll click and they'll say
Castro Android Bridgette button okay and
this is what he brings in by himself so
when you're returning the address the
address has to be known it is off the
type button so you are casting it right
there now you go the handle of the
button no the next taking that what you
guys will be doing here is use your push
me dot you can call set onclicklistener
know if anybody clicks on the button I
want to be the listener now you're
overriding a class called as new view
now when you type capital V you get this
onclick listener this happens to be the
function that brought your overriding
the very minute you override this
onclicklistener
you are going to get this implementable
function on click right here so inside
this you can say whatever you want to
say you can say that somebody clicked on
me somebody pushed me or whatsoever it
is now in this case let me also use my
log log dot d and I'm going to use my
tag and here I'll say somebody
pushed the button alright so this is
what you want to say somebody push the
button now this is one way now you guys
know that this going this is going to
appear on your log now instead if you
want to bring instead of hello Erica I
just want to bring in my message how do
you do that that's fairly simple very
similar to push me again y'all can use
your text view now I'm just bringing in
texture now I will call this as texture
is equal to no I will cache this text
you this time myself and I'm going to
use my fine view by ID and or dot ID dot
obviously you have to have a hand in
here for the texture so there is no
handle so let me create the handle here
now I will say Heidi and Mandal is going
to be
texture now this is going to be the
handler now what is that I am going to
do here is I'm just going to bring it
and you all can see this text you here
and I've got the handle to it all right
now the texture this is what is going to
point to my text what I have in my
activity main know here you know what I
can do I can use my text view dot I will
call the say text function and I will
pass my string that is some body
pushed the button alright so there are
two ways of doing it one is you're
showing it in your log the other way
around is you're trying to show it in
the texture that somebody clicked on the
button now guys this is what you're you
call it as an event listener right this
is what you call it as your event
listener and this is where you're
overriding push me dot euro rating set
on click listener if somebody clicks on
the button now the control is going to
come in here you are creating new you on
click listener you are using this
particular view object on click listener
and this drinks in the implementable
function now this is actually an
interface now this is what you call it
as an implementable function right
inside this you are trying to show a
message in log you're quite familiar to
log on us now and then you can even
still display the message on your screen
using your extra alright so let's see
how this code will work as a stuff
now I've got my logcat also here watch
what happens
and just going to push that button now
watch I'm just going to press the button
now somebody push the button and in the
log area you're can see somebody push
the button right so you can see to the
log as well as on the screen both the
areas you can see the message now this
is what we call it as the event
listeners guys you have a problem here
now you may ask me what is if I have
many buttons no for example I've got
button one and now I've got my next
button this is my button - we'll just
call this is button - and I'm going to
call this is button - alright so this is
what it is right so you all can see the
push me button - and there is some
problem here now I just want this guy to
be straight like this all right so I've
got push me button to know what is that
I will do you know what I have to repeat
the same programme the meaning of to
copy this push me button and this is all
the cut and paste kind of a scenario
what I will be doing now here it is
going to be button button now it says -
I'm going to check on this - right so
here this is going to be push me - right
now
you know what I'm going to do under this
I will say push me push me - now set on
click listener right so I'm bringing in
set on click listener and everything is
going to be the same stuff all over
again and I'm going to bring this and
again and log and I'm going to bring in
this two messages control C now I'm
going to paste it here
now it says somebody pushed me on button
- and somebody pushed me on button -
right so the even this guy is going to
work now but if you see your
applications like this if you have 20
buttons in your application if you have
10 buttons in your application don't you
think this is going to clutter up the
entire screen no this is not a good way
of writing program now this will start
lettering of the entire screen when you
have so many functions right first let
us try to run this and see if the
program works then if everything is all
right then we are going to bring a
better way of writing program
now incidentally you have to see two
buttons here and you have an option to
click on any of the buttons and that
message has to come on top of the screen
Rick so you have got push me to I'm
going to click on this and you all can
see somebody pushed on the button too
now you can see in your logcat
that somebody pushed me on button to let
me click on push me and you all can see
push me somebody pushed on the button
and either of this and you all can see
is displaying here and even in this
logcat you are able to see the button
has been used alright now let me do one
thing though I told you this is not a
good way of writing program now let me
write put a remark into all this and
then you know what I'm going to do
instead of writing it here okay the way
that we have written a program now I am
going to implement an onclicklistener
now I will say implements now I'm just
going to call my view dot on click
listener and this is what I want to
implement now this in turn is throwing
an error and let me see what he says he
tells me to implement a method and I'll
say okay now he is giving me a
generalized on click and I'm going to
say okay to it alright now this is what
is bringing in right now this is more
comparatively this is a better approach
approach now let me use it click on any
number of button the control is going to
be here now let him have one button to
button or 10 button the controller is
going to come here now you all may ask
me how it's very simple now I'm going to
use my switch and I'll save you view dot
get ID and here in this switch I am
going to figure out what did the user
press I say case r dot ID dot now you
know we have button one button and break
then you have again I will say case or
dot ID dot so though you know it is
button to know I'm just going to click
on this and it is a button to and what
is that you want me to do now here I can
bring in my messages that what I had
written earlier now I can bring in my
log or my text here right here now I'm
just going to copy this and I'll just
paste the entire thing right here
alright so this is what I am trying to
bring it now the user is clicking on the
button so here it is showing an errors
now obviously because you have said that
text you right here right now he has
also brought into the final now a better
way a good idea to do this is I'm going
to make this global right control see
it's always good to make it global
making it Globus then I'm going to call
ok now here I'm going to remove this so
as even for button I can make it global
so it will be better because I'll be
using the button everywhere now you had
push me push underscore me come on you
had push underscore me to write so here
I'll just take this guy out and I'm
going to take this guy out alright so
you have these declarations here no it
is the small letter and you're done and
you're ready to go right so I've
declared it global and here you will not
get the error because it's been made
global now I am just going to bring in
that functions here
right so there's going to be two and
it's going to be two so that's about it
and when you run the program and that
this code is going to work no this is a
better approach and this is a better way
of bringing in the listeners for the
multiple buttons when you have too many
buttons and the best thing that what you
could do right so let's wait for the
resistor now you are able to see the
same screen now there's not much of
difference but you can y'all can see now
we have a small problem that is it is
not displaying this is it's right so now
let me come here no log key and texture
texture texture okay let me go back and
see if I have text you is right this now
texture you go to hand and X 2 dot
selects set X and you're printing it
right now let me decompile this because
everything seems to be all right but why
is it not working so it's good for you
that the log you should be able to see
the log at least if this program is not
working
I have got the exterior and under
x2
one click so here inside this your
cotton okay the case already push me
button and button too
or ID handbrake log ID
they can push me yeah everything seems
to be alright
so we did a small mistake see here we
have to have set the listener right so
we have the push me button here and
whenever somebody clicks on that and we
need to add the onclick listener to it
now I put everything in a remark and as
if got out of it now I'll say set on
click listeners this time I just say
this meaning when anybody clicks on the
button so I am awaiting on click on my
application itself that is pointing to
this pointer so that the onclick is
right there in this application that is
what is that you are trying to mention
and you are trying to print it and that
was missing there was the actual errors
now here I have to add this also this
button also I need to add and
onclicklistener
now because we never had down click
listeners and the reason is in work
right now let me run this
now the program is going to appear more
like the same stuff but only the
functionality is that we have changed
right so y'all can see that somebody
pushed on the button and somebody pushed
on button - it is appearing here as well
as in your log also both the places you
are able to display it so this way you
can bring in any number of buttons that
you want to use in your application so
this is a better way of writing an event
business this in case if you have too
many buttons now guys it's time for us
to learn about the intense
now let us want to intense and let us
see how to go about it now let me go
back to my slides now it is a time for
us to want to intense and in intense now
all it means is by using an intent you
can call from one activity you can call
the other activity and there is ways we
are going to use intense and slowly the
way that I am going to take you towards
I will be making the activities as
components and even without knowing name
of the activity you will be able to call
the activity and there is what you guys
are going to do now let's see how to
create it another activity and how to
call the activity now let us use let us
move on to that and let us see how to do
that right so here y'all can see an
intent is a messaging object you can use
to request an action from other app
component meaning you can call from the
first activity you can call the second
activity at the same time if you have
any messages text objects even that can
be passed on to the other activity right
so methods are used to deliver intense
to different components now in fact the
activity is being broadly classified it
is being divided into services broadcast
and many of the other component and
while sending the message it can you can
use context dot start activity or you
can start a service or you can send a
message to the broadcast though this
things that we are going to see it in
the later stages though in today's
session we are going to see how to call
an activity alone right now again an
intent
you have implicit intent and you have
explicit intent guys even before I'm
onto the implicit intent and explicit
intent I would love to show you what
exactly an intent is all about and how
to use an intent all right now I'm going
to show you I'm going to teach you about
various flavors of intent how to use the
intent in many different ways now let me
show you how to do that now for that let
me go back to the code let me do it
quickly so that will give you a very
good insight into intense now let me go
back to my text now here I have the push
me button one now let me call this as
okay now I'm going to change all this
stuff I don't want this to be called as
the push me button now let me give a
name to it let me call this guys now I
just want to dial a number right so that
is what I am going to use now the second
button that what I am going to use is
I'm going to call a toast you guys are
going to learn something new and here is
this I don't want the string as if now I
will say dial a number is what I just
want to display and here I don't want to
anything
toast is all that I want to display now
like this let me create five more
buttons and that is what you guys are
out to learn in credit session three
five so we have stopped a toast
right now you know what I am going to
bring in something called as show
location now here let me call this as so
this in turn is going to take you to the
Google map and it is going to show you
some location of your choice now that is
what we are going to do in my show
location now here is call
open web page now I will call this is
open web page now this can be Google or
whatever you want to open it can be that
now here I am going to call something
called as you intent this is going to be
very interesting now this is where you
are going to call this as a generalized
and common intent now comes there's
another interesting stuff I'm going to
call this as let's get pro professionals
let's get professionals now this is what
it is
now this is what you guys will be
dealing with in today's session all
right now this is an amazing stuff and
you're going to learn how to use the
intent in many different ways
all right now we have the buttons ready
now let us go to the main activity and I
have to bring in no it is not
my push-me you know very well it is not
push me now we have used a couple of
other things here right so it is going
to be dial the phone and toast and
location right so open web open web page
all these things will be very simple and
very easy for you to understand and view
intent right then let's get through
let's get professional right so this is
all that what we'll be using now here
the texture let this guy be this and
here in the first button now you're
going to use dial dial phone and instead
of dot push me you know when I type D
you're going to get this now the second
button it's fairly simple as you all can
see now once if you write this program
you will be very comfortable throughout
right you will be you'll be learning how
to use get handles of all the objects
now sure location right so ya know
second is the toast so I'll say toast
toast comes in here right now comes let
me copy this ate another four times
right so it is not to stain now sure
location
and let me call your location and here
it is going to be open web page
open my pitch and I'm going to call this
as you intent
and this is going to be your intent
right so ID dot so just type be the view
intent comes in this and here there is
the problem so it is oh yeah the typo
notice view intent right so yeah and now
the final one is going to be let's get
pro and dot legs
let's get no it should come by itself
right so why is that it's not coming dot
lets us what is that
let's get pro there's some problem here
we have everything and how capital L
know why capital everywhere we are using
a small letter so let me start let's get
through sir right so we are right there
so I have declared all this now here as
just to bring in the monotonous stuff
now as you all started now it is going
to be dial the phone that you are going
to bring in here and set onclicklistener
and you're going to bring in toast toast
to something new that you're going to
learn and then it on the for stuff that
what you want to bring in here one two
three four that's about it now here we
have to change this to show location and
we are going to add a listener for your
open web page and we're going to add a
listener again for your view intent and
the final one is let's get through the
word itself sounds exciting right so
that about it now here inside this we
have to change now we are not interested
in any of the stuff that what you have
done so far and I don't need this I can
even delete this even I don't need this
to stuff and here as you all know the
first one was a dot dial number and no
the second one was your dot toast
alright so now I am just going to copy
this four times all right so one two
three four and here I don't want the
toast
now next to the toast is your Russia
location right so sure location a hand
after the show location we had your open
web page and after the open web page
you had your view intent right so view
intent and after that
yeah that's about it and we had let's
get draw that's about it and we have
everything in place now how is that we
are going to call dial a number now let
me go back to the slides now guys y'all
can see we are dealing with two intents
that that happens to be the implicit and
explicit intent now here you are calling
something called as an implicit intent
implicit intent is when the target
component is not defined in the intent
and the Android system has to evaluate
the registered components based on the
intent data that means you really don't
know whom you are calling now anybody
can give you the service from any point
of time meaning you can call completely
a different application different
activity to get your work done for
example when you are calling I I said
that I'm going to use a dial s and
anyway eventually I am going to come to
the webview I'm going to bring in this
statement also so at that point of time
if I have to call a dialer dialer
happens to be a different component now
I want to use that component to dial the
phone now the wav file to call the ADA
record Co action view happens to be a
different component now I want to call
that component to display the webview
there is your ID record Co is it right
so I don't know whom I am calling and
who is going to help me who's going to
render my job and that is when I'm going
to call the implicit intent all right
now even before you guys learn how to
call implicit intent it would be a good
idea to learn how to call an intent from
your application right now what it is
how it looks like even to call an intent
now just before this I will show you how
to call an intent and I will come back
to this now then the things will be more
clear to you now first I am going to do
this in this case you're giving intent i
is equal to new intent this comma
activity to class though here you are
writing an intent and you are calling an
intent and you're placing this pointer
there that means that you are trying to
put in your resigning object that is
your main activity and
then activity to class is the object
that what you're what you intend to call
that means this is the class that what
you will be firing now before firing you
want to send a message to activity to
class so what is that you're going to do
you are going to use either put extra in
that you have the key value pairs the
value one that what you see inside the
codes is the key and to that the value
what you are going to put is
this is activity two there is a value
what you are trying to put and you are
passing it on to the activity to class
so that you are having two keys that is
value one value to it has got two values
and when you call start activity of I
that means you're passing the value is
also to the activity second active now
let me break this into a simpler piece
for you now let me teach you how to
write only two lines just how to create
an intent as you all can see in the
first line and how to call the start
activity right now let me do this first
and then I will talk about how to pass
the message to the other object and how
to receive it right now let me Montu my
code
now in my dial my number you know what I
am going to do or let me take toast in
my toast let me click let me create an
intent intent intent now I am just
creating my intent
intent intent is equal to new intent now
I am just creating a new sorry new
intent right now Here I am going to give
it this pointer to be very explicit let
me say main activity dot this when I am
giving the disparate that I am being
very clear this is this pointer belongs
to the main activity no I want to call
the other activity so to call the other
activity we don't have the other
activity here right so let me create a
to another activity called as the other
activity guys you know what I told you
all the manifest is a very important
part of your application the manifest in
turn will keep all the information of
the applications this is what I have
told you so let me take you to the
manifest now in manifest I am going to
go really deep into it as we start
progressing with our application now
here you have the application this I
will be talking about it later now to
tell you in brief this application class
happens to be the superclass to your
activity he happens to be the parent for
your activity now this will be
discussing in the next sessions now
although back up also you will get a
good insight when you all learn the DDMS
so that the file system the file manager
now you can take a backup of that guy
and that will happen later now here what
kind of an icon you want to associate
with your application
now in my myth map you all can see this
myth map in the mid map I have got
couple of icons ready-made icons we are
going to pick one right from there now
that is what you have picked there is IC
launcher and what should be the name of
your application now here it is called
as the app name there is all there in
string now I can call it as intent also
if I want and now support RTL I will
talk about it later now the team in fact
when we come to material design and
we're going to go deep into it so till
then just bear with me and then comes
the activity now when you all see the
activity you have your starting the
activity or ending the activity and then
then
name of your application is the main
activity like what you have created is
what you all can see here now when you
created the application all this has
been generated by your Android right
Android studio now whenever you create
an activity it has an intent filter in
intent filter you have three data type
that's what I have shown you while
explaining there is what I said the
action category and data the data is in
between which is not shown to you as of
now but I am going to bring it in later
now in action now this main activity
happens to be the default activity that
means this is the launching kind of an
activity so it is called as a main and
then category will say it is the default
and that happens not a default this
happens to be the launcher meaning this
is the know if you have ten activities
in this particular application now this
is the application which starts which
kick starts everything that is what is
that you are trying to say in the
category right this is what we have done
now I want to create one more activity
just because we want to call that right
so I right click on my package I'll go
to new now I will go to my activity now
I will click on my empty activity so
this I'm going to call this as others
activity this is the name that what I am
going to give and I will say finish now
you all see the other activity is
created now there is an XML file for
other activity now if you know what just
fold my laziness I'll go to this guy
I'll fetch this textview and I'll come
to the other activity and I'm just going
to copy it this because I just want to
say that you know you have been called
from the other activity or something
like that in text area okay from
activity now let me say hi from other
activity now this is what you want to
say when you guys land in here this is
what you want to see so we have has the
texture also here now text you other
other texture okay so this in turn will
clarify and there is no confusion with
us alright so now I am going back to the
main activity and here I'm going to call
the other activity right so y'all can
see other activity now I am just going
to bring this in dot class now it's a
class well it's a Java class effect
that's what it gets compiled it and now
I'm going to call my start activity
because they want to fire the activity
and the intent is where I have the
address of my other activity and I am
giving this intent so what exactly this
line does now this intent in turn you
are giving the current applications
address this in turn is going to fire
the other activity dot class now this is
where you guys are going to jump into
and when you when you start this when
you click on the toast and you are
actually toasting meaning you are firing
another activity so obviously you guys
are going to be there in the other
activity now this is what is the meaning
of intent the intent in turn will help
you to call the other activity or to
cause any of the activities down the
line we are going to explore quite a lot
about intent so intent happens to be the
central nervous system of the Android
and everywhere till the end of the
session you are going to learn many
flavours of intent and you're going to
learn quite a lot about intent and there
is what we have started exploring as of
now now let me click and let me just run
the program and see if you all can land
in the other activity when you click on
the toast button right so aren't you
serious about this aren't you curious so
let's see if this line works now when
this line works I can move on to the
other explanation now none of the
buttons are activated because you have
nothing in this buttons only toast we
have some hopes on toast because when
you click on toast the control is going
to come here to talk
and here you're trying to launch the
other activity right from the toast and
obviously you are not going to see the
screen from this activity you are
jumping on to the other activity
completely what y'all can see that
you're here in the other activity it is
called as hi from the other activity now
I will take you back to the manifest now
how what exactly you can see here what
kind of changes that you can see here
now the Android has inserted one more
line that activity again dot other
activity
this guy is inserted now this is the
body now anyway this intent filter is
not created because we just created a
very simple and empty activity so the
intent filter is not this later on I'm
going to bring in the intent filter and
I'm going to show you what exactly that
means then how exactly to add the
intense okay
meaning the intent filters we'll talk
about it later
now let me go back to my code so this
program is working now let me go to the
other activity you know what I just want
to teach you something because I use the
word toast let me also show you the
toast I just say toast and use I just
scroll down to the last brush I will
click enter now I told you these are two
ways one else I can call other activity
dot this or even this is okay now here I
can say any message landed in others
activity you know what this
toast is going to stay for a couple of
milliseconds there is the behavior of
the toast now whenever you set the alarm
in your program the toast will appear
and it stays for a few seconds and that
is what exactly is going to happen here
and this toast dot length short in fact
this is going to delay by a few
milliseconds length long is going to
give little more a longer time
all that is negligible we cannot
calculate or we cannot say in so many
milliseconds the toaster is working it
this is just the arbitrary time that it
delays down to and then it is showing it
on the screen now let me run this code
all over again just to see as soon as
you guys land in the other application
you will get to see a toast message also
right here now here it will take me to
the first activity now when I click on
the first activity it has to take me to
the second activity yeah when I click on
toast
it has to take me this then you have to
see a toast also watch the toast you
landed in other activity alright so as
you have learnt toast also so you have
learnt two things you have learned as us
now that is you have learnt how to
create an intent and how to fire the
intent so that it starts the other
activity guys is that clear to you do
you have any questions here at this
point so you guys are clear with this
concept so let me move on to the next
way of looking at the intent now let me
see
let me show you how to use the implicit
intent that in fact when we all went
when we all saw this in the slide there
is looking a bit cryptic to you now let
me define that now you know what I can
again say intent and I can again call my
handle intent intent 1 is equal to 2
now I will say new intent now till now
you have seen they have learned at this
address of the current activity and the
other activity you have to give no I am
NOT interested in calling my other
activity I want to call a different
component which is mounted in my Android
I want to call one of the component that
happens to be the
is right no you know what I am going to
use I'm going to use something called as
intent dot and I'm going to call the
action there let's write this I'm going
to call the action there no to that to
dial the number let me say I want to
dial my number I I want to dial my phone
right so to dial I have to give the data
the data has been given in your right
path and inside this yellow can see this
right the remark inside this you are
going to give the data and form of a
string now let me click on that and I am
proving to give my phone number here
just before I give the phone number it
is a mandate for me to give my T L :
now this is the data type that what what
you saw in yours this is the specific
data type that what you saw in the slide
and this is the action that what you saw
in this slide right now I just know I
told you that you are trying to call a
component right from the Android and
there is action and in about a minute
I'm going to demystify this to you so
just hang on to this as of now so I
understand it is calling one of the
components in Android and here you are
trying to give the phone number when you
are trying to give the phone number the
phone number is identified by te l : if
you do any typos or any mistakes here
your application will not work now let
me give my phone number this is my phone
number
right now that's about it and then you
know what I'm going to call my start
activity and I'm going to call my intent
all right
that's about it you know what should
happen now now whenever you oh I sorry I
did everything on show location it
should have been on my dialer right so I
have given everything in the dialer now
when I run the program and when I click
on the dialog button and this in turn
should open up a dialog for me right
know the the most interesting question
here is did you write the dialer program
does it belong to you the answer is no
it's a part of you it's it's a component
it's no dialer happens to be an Android
component right you're calling a
component that means an application that
can give service to any other
applications is what you are trying to
call no having said this the other
immediate question that what will ring
in your mind is can we create our own
component is what is the next immediate
question what will ring in your mind oh
can I make my program also generic can
somebody use my program also the way
that I am using the action - guys this
is where we are getting to so to get to
this particular point we have to travel
through some simple process and then it
becomes very easy for you to understand
how to get - right now let us see how
this program works no let me by clicking
on the dial number let me see if my
application can call the dialer now you
know what if you are writing if you are
running this up like impelling this
application on your device and when you
run and you can really dial you can dial
and talk to the person right that is all
that you can do and your calling one of
your dialer components let me click on
the dialer that's it now you all can see
the phone number is already there the
dialer is already there for you and all
you have to do is click on this and this
is going to place a call and this is
mimicking as though it is calling as you
as I told you the emulator cannot do all
such things so for this you need the
real-time device so that this in turn
will place a call and the call will get
generated right now this is how you guys
can call the dialer and this is all you
can dialogue a number from your
application that means it's a different
component it is sitting and you are
calling the component and you passed the
data to the component and the component
in turn dialed it for you guys is this
clear
do you have any questions with this can
I quickly see yes if you all are clear
with us and please tell me no if you are
not yeah great thank you so much so we
have learnt how to dial a number and we
have learned how to toast and that means
you have learned how to want to a
different this thing you know
application altogether right so that's
you guys have seen now you would be
curious to know how to write a couple of
other things like how to call a couple
of other components now let me write one
more program this is going to be a kind
of con territory and you may wonder
what's happening and you may not even
have a lot of doubts by end of this but
intentionally I am doing it now I am
going to bring in an intent and I am
going to bring in by intent to is equal
to new intent so you know this is what
you have to bring in now I'm going to
bring in an intent dot know for a change
I'm not going to use the - I'm going to
use action you know you all may think oh
my god this guy is calling yet another
component right now how is that what is
that is going to do with it
now you know what I'm going to call a
component called as you know what this
is a generic component now this
component can belong to many of others
also I'll explain the two clearly in a
short well from now now again to use I
have to give may you are a passer and
this is where I have to give the data
now the label itself sounds exciting to
you there is sho location right now let
me ask for the location just to ask for
the location I have to say geo this is a
must and you have to give the geo just
in case if you want to bring in the map
right there no but having said this let
me see if I have my applications right
here yeah thank God I have one of the
applications here so I can quickly go
grab the location from him location
tracker okay ha I just wanted the
latitude and longitude this guy does not
have it so
ok now you know what let me go do that
quickly I'll go to Google Google map
okay yeah I'm already there alright so I
am there in a Google Maps you know here
I'll say Bangalore High Court and I just
want to go this right
so it takes me right here and I'll
right-click here and it says what's here
and that is where you can see the
latitude and longitude oh I can take it
from here or I can even grab it from
here now this is what I wanted instead
of keying in the number this becomes too
cryptic it may take me to some other
place right so it's always a good idea
to copy it from here now let me click
here yeah
so I've copied so this is a junk also
along with this not a problem now I'm
going to go back to my application and I
just wanted no I don't want this I'm
just going to close this and I just
wanted my location right so control B I
copied it
now this said L dream oh now this is my
latitude and this is my longitude right
so you know what I can even give the
zoom position also no I can put a
question mark and I can give a zoom
position is equal to three Suman little
bit and try to get me as close as
possible to High Court is what is that
and requesting this guy okay now that's
what it is and and I'm going to start my
activity and I am going to call my
intent - all right guys now you would
have understood that oh to call the
Google Map I have to use action view to
call the phone I have to use action del
right now
not really true to call the phone you
have to call you can use action dial to
call the Google Map we can use action
view to call the notepad I can use
action view to call so many other things
maybe the web services I can call the
action view and to call my Chrome I can
use action view so please do not get
deceived by looking at action view this
action view is not really bounded to
your Google Map in fact it can be used
in so many other places and now this
intense this is what you call it as the
implicit intent and this whoever is
overriding the action view and everybody
is called now not only the Google Map
your web page your Chrome everybody is
using the action view so when you call
this and everybody should get called but
find here is you gave geo : this is red
everything or narrowed down and it
called only the Google map it didn't
cause your notepad didn't call your
webview isn't call your Chrome or
whatever it is by giving this tag you
narrowed it down now let's take a look
at this as a snow and I'm going to
clarify this little more after after you
see the code working I'm going to
explain I'm going to go deeper into this
intended actions norm now whether it be
we aren't sure location let me click on
this show location now this guy the
emulator you know what we installed it
fresh and this emulator is asking for
all the sign-in add account were you all
those usual asked for and finally if I
give all my dedication ant is going to
take me to the Google and he's going to
show me that now let me say
though is asking overall many
credentials at Asus try to use email
so he's asking for all
missions and
all right so let me push this guy okay I
agree I agree is then I just want to see
the map please don't delay come back as
soon as possible and okay so on now once
if you have been using the emulator it
will not be a problem
right so guys you all are able to see
the Google map and they're yours and
you're in Bangalore and as a
double-click and I can go get close to
your markers
now that's where you are H so let me
somewhere here it is showing the markers
and okay so that is how it takes me to
the map I am not really keen on where we
are going and which has got the marker
and I'm just trying to take you to the
hi code and I'm trying to get the Google
map entered so you all got the Google
map know just to use the action view all
over again let me use this just to
explain just to make you understand the
action view is a common scenario right
now here you know what what you guys saw
instead of this let me bring in a dreary
car right so this is what you guys saw
isn't it now let me see here let me go
back now you are a parser and HTTP colon
to /ww w is a record code the right so
let me go this now let me say HTTP colon
forward slash www dot
oh now this is where I want to get to
now again guys watch he is using action
you I am also using action view I am
requesting hey please any of the
browsers guys can you please get me to a
Dora Cutco is what you are requesting
your browsers right so let me change
this to three now here I am trying to
tell you watch even the browser's
browsers like Chrome or dot or dot is is
using intent dot intent dot action
action view right so here in this case
even your even not the browser's let me
say in this case who is using the map
right control V even the Google Google
map is using using the view right and
even the chrome is using the view no no
this is where you guys will get to
understand also may have been there
using the views it yes you know work end
of the line will be using the view in
our own application that is where we are
getting to that is where I am making the
things even more exciting for you all so
let me run and let me go to the open web
page and if everything is right now this
is the specific data type that what you
guys have learnt now I can give Kron
dot-com also I can give Eddie recalls
where you have to be you have to click
on open web page now let me click on
open web page and if everything is
alright no because this is the brand-new
stuff and I will say hello
now he is asking me for all the
credentials because there's a new
emulator that watiam creating and he is
this now you are can you all see this
HTTP Eddie recorded cook and he took you
right in there and this is the ID
recovery page that you all have landed
in right now Eddie Rica is a different
portal there's a different web page and
you in fact opened it using one of the
browsers that one of the browsers has
had the action view in them and you said
hey guys can you help me to open a door
a karateka that is what you requested
and you don't even know whom you
requested with and whoever had action
you your message has been sent your
request has been sent to all the guys
were having the action view and one of
them that fellow had that is a Chrome
browser and he said hey I can do this
work for you because Chrome browser
identified the specific this is what is
specific HTTP is specific geo-specific
telephone is specific they will identify
this and if it is related to me if it is
my kind of a work now HTTP has the
chrome kind of a work and he executed
this for you know geo happens to be the
Google map book it will ask me a
question oh if I add geo what will
happen now nothing will happen your
application is going to crash when I
click on show location because it is not
nobody will understand the geo right so
he thinks even a google map will not
understand so obviously there is an
error in the ura that what you are
trying to pass and you are going to get
into troubles right when you click on
the show location so guys that is where
I told you this specific type the data
type that what you're using is very
important now sure location that has to
create a disaster for you all know right
so look at this unfortunately my first
step has stopped and Android throws an
error and there is where everything
stops because this is what went wrong
the typo nobody understood what you are
trying to say right when you are using
geo and the method immediately
understand he will respond
when you are using HTTP the chrome will
respond right now you're going to ask me
let me put our doubts here can we create
create our own our own data type like te
l : GE o : : is it right then what is do
so then HTTP : right my answer is my
answer is yes you know what let me show
you how to create my streamer as their a
type like this my streamer is going to
be like one of the types you know I am
going to soon I'm going to come this I'm
going to show you just before this I
just want to my last explanation I just
want to explain with one more view
because you have been so curious than
you have been you had all the patience
to stay with me so that I just want to
break the tie I want to break the eyes
and showing the meaning of intense you
know watch the fun now I'm going to use
cockiness now this is a fun part and
just for the heck of it and I am going
to really wild all over and I'm just
going to say I don't care for all this
what if if I call only the section you
know the way that you have been
explaining me so far this is what you
guys will be thinking now because the
geomap had action you the map skimming
and the chrome had action you the chrome
came in because you gave the right data
drive if you don't give the right data
type now the Geo can G also appear here
can chrome also appear here whoever is
overriding the action you will everybody
appear here in front of me is what is
the question right now will all the apps
which is imbibing view will it appear on
screen now okay that is what is your
question is it right guys now so far
I've been explaining y'all understood
now I told you
anybody can all read action you if this
is the case now can I see the map coming
up can I see the chrome canning of
Tennessee not another application coming
up on my screen is what is that I am
trying to ask myself when I click on it
in pew now
this is the greatest of the time that
this is the best part of the time that
you all are having now now you will
understand the meaning of action you
because I have not given any specific
data type this in turn will call for the
confusion you are calling the view but
there is no data type so everybody is
going to show and asking you can I help
you can I give you a services what is
that everybody's going to ask you now
let me click on the view intent right so
can you all see this guy's now you can
see Matt's
you can see application hardware
preferences you can see calendar you can
see so many other applications all right
now you know what this other activity is
one of my activity calendar when I click
on calendar it is going to take you
right into the calendar so which ever so
many applications is coming up and it is
taking you right into that application
now I see just once and you're there
right in the calendar right now anyway
the calendar is not there because it's
not there in the simulator because it is
a brand-new one right so anyway so this
is how the view intent in turn is going
to show all the applications it is going
to bring up all the applications no
grace do you have any questions now we
have almost come to the end of the
session by using the intent and I am
going to show you all like how to call
my own component how to call the
component is what is that we are going
to see now you know what I am going to
make a small change before that I just
want to know if you are clear with the
concept can I quickly see yes if you
guys are clear with the concept
all right great so you're with me and
and you're able to appreciate the flow
now let me go to the last part of the
thing that is your let's get
professionals you know what I've been
telling you the action view is used by
so many guys how is that they'll be
using this this action view is what
would be the next question what will be
racing in your mind now we have to
create that for our own cells is it now
watch what I am going to do in my
manifest now I told you in manifest I
can bring in my intent filter now let me
copy this now in my other activity I am
bringing in my intent filter now in
action now this is a packet name I can
copy this know instead of Android intent
action main I am going to copy the
packet name then I am going to give my
other activity to it now people can call
me by this package name also right this
is something that what I am trying to
say now instead of launcher I am going
to say dot default default now watch
this
this is beautiful way of writing program
very professional way of writing program
I am going to take you right there now
here y'all saw this right now I am just
going to add one more line here now let
me bring this in here and paste it
instead of calling this intent action
view and I'm going to do something very
funny and very different and this will
be mind-blowing watch this what I am
going to do now is I am going this no
this is application name isn't it I am
just trying to get this package name
this is what I call it as action right
guys do you remember you saw the
PowerPoint and y'all saw action and you
saw something called a specific for a
switch this is what you call it as
action now I am going to go into the
internet and I am just going to give
this now I'm not going to call No
me and how what did you learn you have
to call your application like this you
have to call by the activity the current
activity and then the other application
name now what are the what I am trying
to do I am just trying to call my
application using the package never know
the package across the process
boundaries and this in turn is going to
fire the application across the process
boundaries now guys this is ways you
guys are getting closer to the component
you are getting closer to the component
meaning you kill any package name across
the process boundary and this guy in
turn has to execute it now let us watch
now we are ready let's get through and
this is the first step and then we have
got one more step to go let's get
through watch this and it calls your
other activity and it's a success and
you all can see that it called your
activity just by using this now my next
question is this
can I call my activity how is that I can
imbibe brother how is that I can imbibe
the action in view so when somebody
calls my application also should show up
other activity also should show up
this is the next question now guys you
know what I am going to do now well
creating action watch I am going to
create an action this is what I told you
I am I can create action category data
now I can create an action now here let
me create the action now inside this
action let me create a name right so
inside the name I will create Android
intent now you all can see this view I
am going to imbibe this view right in
there now by imbibing this view in my
program you know what I am going to copy
this no not necessary I'll put a remark
to this now I will copy this and I will
paste it here now I am going to call
this guy as five or six let me say six
now watch carefully now among the
application your other activity also
will be an application it is going to
pop up because you imbibed the view in
your manifest because you override it
the view in your as a part of the action
so when the guy when anybody calls the
action view your application should also
pop up that is the whole idea behind it
now let me show you that lets get Pro
now watch open with calendar my first
step look at this this is your my first
step it is all already there and you
have the other activity now this other
activity is completely a different
application now this is not the activity
you're looking at this is small little
and this is capital it works completely
different application now your my first
app is coming Dell and I am going to
click
on that and it is going to call your
other activity right this is from the
other activity now this is what you
called is it right and that is how you
can imbibe the view right in the
manifest here you embed the view and now
among the application your application
to will turn up and you can call your
application just by having the view know
this is what is called as the explicit
intence then you declare now you are
trying to tell the world that you can
give a service now if anybody wants to
do anything this is the job that what I
can do now when you go to gallery and
when you click on the photograph now lot
of other applications like email
whatsapp lot of applications will come
up meaning it says that hey do you want
me to mail your photograph do you want
me to set it in whatsapp what is it you
want to do like every application has a
behavior so as your other activity also
has a behavior so where then you can
even print the the documents or the
pictures of whatever that is your
characteristics now when the people
clicks on your application and you can
carry out your work and this is how you
guys can create a generic component do
you know what in my next session I'm
going to show you I'll be deleting this
main activity I'm going to copy this
program in a different name I'm going to
call this other activity I'll delete the
main activity and when I run the first
application this other activity also
comes up the way that you're watching it
now alright so this is how you guys can
call the activities meaning in various
different forms you can use the intent
and now if you want to pass the data to
the other activity as the last thing
that you have seen in the slide let me
say intent six we are using intent six
dot put right now you have put extra you
can put the key value paid into it there
is a name and boolean value now let me
say put extra you have the key value
also in it you can pass and let me bring
that an intern source where is that
now let me take you to the slide this is
the last thing no guys you understood
this is action and this is the specific
stress now this I will teach in the next
class like how to write my own streamer
I am going to teach you how to do it so
that you will be streaming the videos
and all that through your own codex and
through your own streamers is what is
that you're going you guys are going to
see and here put extra you have the key
and value pair now that is what you want
to do now let me go back and this
happens to be the last part of your code
put extra no why is that dot put extra
yeah now I say let me call this is key
and let me call this is value okay value
is my data is all that I am trying to
put here and now you know what when you
call in ten to six now this guy in turn
is going to receive know when that guy
is going to receive know you have to you
have to evaluate if the data is coming
in or not is it no I have passed the
data now what I have to do here is you
have to receive the data so to receive
the data I'm going to use bundle now in
the latest stage I am going to go more
deeper into bundle so I'm going to use
the variable is equal to get intent okay
get int int dot now the extra data that
what you have given has been obtained
from here and that you are taking it
into bundle alright now next what you
want to do is you want to give the key
and you want to get the value out now I
will say bundle dot now I'll ask for get
string now see he is asking for the key
now what is the key key is a key because
I want to remember it the way it is
right now this guy in turn is going to
bring the data for me now string STR and
he is going to bring the data now what I
can do here is I can even display it on
texture or I can display it into post
now let me do the toast is much easier
for me now let me bring it in toast you
guys can try it out bringing the texture
and displaying it right there now Here I
am
bring in my STR okay so this in turn is
going to display the key first it says
landed in other activity then you all
can see the value being received here
and the value being displayed here now
let me run this guys you have come a
long way with the intense and so slowly
what is that you have to understand here
is your activity is just not an activity
it has got enormous power to it and your
activity is a component and that can be
used by the other application across the
process boundaries even without doing
much of the work and there is what that
you guys have to understand now let me
see where my this guy is hiding yeah
he's right here let me pull this gap now
I'm going to click on let's get Pro and
know what yeah I'm going to click on my
first step now here when I click on this
you have to land in our first step
though landed in other activity values
my data now it is showing the data now
that is the value that what you passed
right from the other activity right now
this is where you pass the value now it
can pass any value that you want we can
pass objects also
- but we need to use
we need to use the past level and so on
so forth we can even pass the objects
now this in turn can happen can be
across the
please do remember guys the activity
that what you're writing it is in a
process boundary nobody can touch your
data now if you want to pass the data to
completely - at another application yeah
this intent in turn will work right
there is very told you the intent
happens to be the most powerful stuff
that what you guys can find an Android
and this is not the end of your intense
in fact in next session I am going to
continue and I will be teaching you how
to create the remote components and how
to call like your dialers like yours you
that is going to be your own component
and how to call those components right
from your application so now let us
quickly go back and see ways we have
gone now let me take you slightly up you
all have seen the implicit intent and
explicit intent and intent can carry
data bundle to perform an activity yeah
you saw that for example if an activity
has to launch an email operation we can
use an intent action send your email GAE
will identify that now we have to talk
about implicit and explicit intent this
this is the implicit intent you saw the
action and the specific stuff now I
haven't really taught you how to create
our own specific like the video
streamers or anything that you want to
create in your component that I haven't
touched upon and as the slide says I
have taught you how to use a URI passed
now this URL a pulse can be your your
own your iPad's like my streamer that I
am going to cover in the next session so
this is what you learn to the implicit
intent and this is how you learned how
to call an another activity this is of
you learned how to pass the value to the
other activity you can pass as many key
value pairs you want and that's about it
guys we have come to the end of the
session so please do let me know if you
have any doubts and the session is open
for the discussion right if you really
want to discuss anything I'm here I'll
unmute you guys then y'all can have fun
discussing the complete session and I

interesting session I hope that you all
really enjoyed this session because this
happens to be the most important session
in Android and you have learnt about any
person of the intent then other 20% is
even more important that I'll be
covering up in the next sessions so it's
