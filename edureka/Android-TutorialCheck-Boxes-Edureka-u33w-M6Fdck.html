toggle button here now let's quickly
take a look at the checkboxes also i'll
just take the same sample that i have
here so ganache you have raised your
hands I just want to know whether it is
of the last time that you had okay so
all right now let's quickly take a look
at the check boxes here so in the main
dot example I'll use the same code here
any may not eczema what i will do
instead of the check sorry instead of
the toggle button what will be sorry
sorry about this instead of the toggle
button i'll be using a checkbox here so
let's quickly take a look at the
graphical representation of the checkbox
in it has a checkbox and it shows a
toggle buttons now let's change this
text also so let's change it to say
check box now let's see the graphical
representation yeah so that this is the
check box okay I'll just enlarge the
trafficking representation for all of
you to take a clear ll-look is this
clear to you now is this visible to all
avinash so this is the this is the check
box that I have just created here now I
will be utilizing this check box in my
activity so instead of the talking
button here what I will be declaring is
I will be declaring a check box and I
say a check box i will be just renaming
it to check here reference it from the
xml here do with the check box ID i
think i have kept the same toggle one
which i'll just change to check one once
i do what control s here it will
automatically get reflected here and
give it give you an error so i will just
clear this error on the check I'll again
put an unchecked change listener the
toggle button instead of the dog
louboutin I'll switch it to check box
here now let's see what we have when we
try to use a checkbox if i go to run as
run as android application
here i have a question coming from
abinash elaine does toggle button
checkbox have the same constructor ah
avinash I'm actually not I I don't think
I don't think this is about I'll just
look into it I'll just show you see here
if I try to do a check equal to new and
I say check box this is what i mean by a
constructor because what i am doing is
I'm actually creating a new object from
the constructor so when I talk about the
constructor this is the what i mean by
the constructor so if i am saying those
dot make text this is the parameters
they say these are the methods like
alright so this is the method that is
associated with the toast method here
toast object here when i talk about a
constructor constructor is something
which actually lets me construct a new
object so these are the various
constructions that are available with
the check box similar to this if i say
there might be various constructors
which are available will toggle buttons
so this is the difference between both
now let's take a look at the example
that i have just created so this is the
check box here if I click on the check
box it says check button is true my
click on it again it says the check box
check button as false very much like the
toggle button that we have in android
the only difference between ma both
being the user interface I hope this is
clear to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
