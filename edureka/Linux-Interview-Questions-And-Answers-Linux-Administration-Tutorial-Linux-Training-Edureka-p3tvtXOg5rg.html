online training session would like to
hear from all of you whether you all can
view of my screen and able to hear me
properly please confirm either by
raising your hand or by using chat
option which is present in your
attendees panel field knowledge means
thanks a lot for confirming let me
quickly introduce about myself my name
is Bhaskar Reddy and I have 14 plus
years of experience in IT industry my
main expertise into Linux and UNIX
administration Storage Management and
various other virtualization
technologies I've handled many projects
in storage but UNIX and Linux
administration especially into
automation and virtualization
technologies like Hetchy and fault
tolerance apart from this I have been
engaged in in-house training corporate
and online trainings as well so today we
will have a session on Linux interview
questions I hope this session will be
very helpful for those audience who
would like to take part and attend
interviews on linux administration part
though we are not covering each and
every aspect of linux but we have
selected few frequently asked questions
in interviews as we all know linux is
completely a command oriented operating
system and you can expect questions and
interviews like in theory and practicals
as well so thank you once again for all
the attendees for joining today's
session so let's get started with it and
please let me know if you have any
queries and concerns during the session
I would kindly reduce you to use the
chat option so that I can assist you
further so I'll just run through some
slides and if any practical question
comes I will be using this buddy session
as you can see here I just logged into
one of my linux server if any practical
question comes I can show you
practically by using this party session
I've just connected to one of my Linux
box through but it's offered so this
would be practically oriented one so
let's get with the interview questions
here the first question the basic
question would be what does
okay so as a layman as an interviewer if
I ask this question what is Linux the
first answer would be it is an operating
system so before I get into Linux first
of all let me explain you like what is
an operating system every time you
switch on your computer you see a screen
where you can perform different
activities like read and write or browse
the internet or watch a video what is it
that makes the computer hardware work
like that how does the processor on your
computer knows that you are asking it to
run or mp3 file well it is the operating
system of the kernel which does this
work a kernel is the program at the
heart of the operating system that takes
care of fundamental stuff like letting
Hardware communicate with software so to
work on your computer you need an
operating system in fact you are using
one as you read this on your computer
now you may have used popular OS like
Windows Apple OS X but here we will
learn what Linux is and what benefits it
offers over other OS choices so Linux is
an operating system or a kernel which
germinated as an idea in the mind of
young and bright Linus Torvalds when he
was a computer science student Linus
Torvalds is considered as father of
Linux operating system so when he was as
a computer science student he took a
Linux kernel and he developed from the
scratch he used to work on UNIX
operating system which in those days
called as a proprietary software and
thought that it needed improvements
however when the suggestions were
rejected by the designers of Unix
he thought of launching an operating
system which will be receptive to
changes modification suggested by its
users the benefits of using Linux
operating system what are the main
benefits and why it gained more
popularity compared to other operating
systems the main benefits are it offers
a free operating system
you do not have to shell hundreds of
dollars to get the oils like Windows
being open-source implicit or Scott the
Linux operating system
nuf offers millions of programs
applications to choose from most of them
are free now once you have Linux
installed you no longer needed an
anti-virus because Linux is highly
secure system more so there is a global
development community constantly looking
at ways to enhance its security with
each upgrade the OS becomes more secure
and robust Linux is the oil of choice
for server environments due to its
stability and reliability mega companies
like Amazon Facebook and Google used
Linux for their service a Linux based
server could run non-stop without a
reboot for years on end ok this is all
about Linux so Linux is just an
operating system or a kernel ok which
has been developed from UNIX operating
system so this is what we have discussed
and coming to the next question how
different is Linux when compared to UNIX
operating system you might face
different types of questions when you
attend this type of interviews in linux
operating system like what is the
comparison what is the differences did
you find between like Linux and UNIX
operating system as I said earlier Linux
is the UNIX clone but if you consider it
according to the POSIX standards a
process is nothing but a portable
operating system interface according to
this standards
Linux can be considered as Unix exactly
to code from official Linux kernel
readme file Linux is a UNIX clone
written from the scratch by Linux
turbines with assistance of hackers
across the net so I'll just take some
strategies here in terms of cost in
terms of development and distribution in
terms of manufacturer like what are the
differences between Linux and UNIX in
terms of cost
Linux can be freely distributed
downloaded freely distributed through
magazines books etc there are priced
versions of Linux also but
they are normally cheaper than Windows
operating system when you compare with
UNIX in UNIX we have different flavors
of UNIX have different cost structures
according to the vendors in terms of
development and distribution Linux is
developed by open source development
that is through sharing and
collaboration of code and features
through forums and it is distributed by
various vendors when coming to UNIX UNIX
systems are divided into various other
flavors mostly developed by AT&amp;amp;T as well
as various commercial vendors and
nonprofit organizations in terms of
manufacturer Linux kernel is developed
by the community by Linus Torvalds Linus
Torvalds will oversee things and when
you talk about Unix
three biggest distributions are Solaris
which is stuff acquired by Oracle AIX by
IBM vendor hp-ux it's by tablet packer
and Apple makes OS X which is also a
UNIX based operating system okay so I've
just taken three aspects here like cost
development and distribution and
manufacturer like this we have many such
differences between Linux and UNIX
operating system okay so in case of any
questions any queries please use a chat
window I will be gladly assist you so
this is what we have discussed okay
coming to the next question like what is
the importance of GNU project GNU
project was launched in September 1983
by Richard installment to create a
complete operating system which is free
software the main intention of GNU
project is to create an operating system
which is completely open source which is
completely freely available for all
public users the main licenses of the
GNU project are the GNU GPL which is
nothing but the general public licenses
the name of the GNU project is derived
from the recursive acronym which is
nothing but GN use not Unix
okay the full form of GNU it's a
recursive term Jian use not Unix
unikz was a very popular operating
system in the mid-80s
so richard stallman designed gnu to be
mostly compatible with unix operating
system so that it would be convenient
for people to migrate to GNU so the
genome project was intended to create a
unix-like operating system but it should
be freely available for all the public
uses and it should be a open-source
operating system so this led to the
birth of Linux operating system okay
the end of Linux kernel and the GNU
utilities that is a question from
Prakash the question is GNU compatible
with physics standards yes okay every
operating system like when you talk
about Linux and UNIX all are POSIX
standards I hope I answered your
question Prakash okay the importance of
the GNU project the free software
movement started by Richard installment
ok you see the full form of GNU GNU snot
UNIX it's a recursive term ok and coming
to the next question the question is
like what does Linux kernel okay so this
is an important question would be asked
in different types of interviews and
most of the people will they get
confused in answering this question what
is Linux kernel let me explain you in a
simpler way with over 13 million lines
of code the Linux kernel is one of the
largest open source projects in the
world but what is a kernel and what it
is used for a kernel is the lowest level
of easily replaceable software that
interfaces with the hardware in your
computer it is responsible for
interfacing all of your applications
that are running in user mode down to
the physical hardware and allowing the
processes which are known as the
services to get information from each
other using inter process communication
technically speaking a kernel is nothing
but the core of any operating system and
it is responsible for translating the
user commands into equivalent language
understood by the computer hardware
okay so kernel it is nothing but the
heart of any operating system
it's a code of any operating system
which is responsible for translating the
user commands into equivalent language
understood by the computer hardware okay
so if you can see this a pictorial
representation on the Left pane okay you
see applications on top of kernel you
see applications and bottom of the
kernel you see the hardware devices the
hardware devices like CPU memory and the
devices which are attached to the
computer okay so in order to interact
with the kernel okay applications you
see on top of operating system you have
applications so in order to interact
with an operating system applications
you need to have some kind of language
right so kernel would be acting as a
mediator mediated between applications
and hardware devices it just translates
the users language to the machine
language and machines language to the
users language it's a core kernel is
nothing but the core the heart of any
operating system okay any questions any
concerns please let me know and coming
to the next question what is a shell and
in shell what is exactly called as a
bash shell okay so let me explain you
what is exactly a shell a shell is a
user program or its environment provided
for user interaction a shell is a
command language interpreter that
execute commands read from the standard
input device which is called as a
keyboard or from a file shell is not
part of system kernel but use the system
kernel to execute programs like creating
files creating directories etc okay so
please remember shell is exactly called
as a user interface in order to interact
with operating system we need one kind
of interface right that interface is
called as a shell okay shell is a
command language interpreter most of the
people often confuse between interpreter
and a compiler okay please remember
interpreter is
type of a mechanism that execute
commands which are read from the
standard input device or from a file
okay so when you talk about shell in
shell we have different types in Linux
and UNIX operating system we have bash
shell we have single shell we have
console we have facial we have public
domain cultural we have different types
of shells used in Linux and UNIX
operating system but bash is a default
shell bash has been adopted as a default
shell for most Linux systems okay bash
is a shell or a command language
interpreter for the GNU operating
systems once again I am using the term G
and new ok GNU operating systems like
Linux in most distributions of Linux
operating system bash is incorporated as
the default shell okay
the name is an acronym for the born
again shell bash stands for born again
shell
okay it is named after a person called
Steven born okay he is the author for
born again shell now why bash has been
incorporated as the default shell
because in bash we have many such
futures features like command aliasing
command completion by using the tab keys
and the command history also okay like
in order to execute the commands like no
need to remember all the commands in
Linux operating system okay
with lot of ease you can execute all
these commands by the features of bash
shell okay
c'mon aliasing command completion or
file completion by using the tab keys
and the command history okay in order to
execute like previous commands no need
to type the commands again and again you
can recall those commands by using the
up and down arrow keys using that you
can recall all those commands okay if I
show you practically one particular
example we have one command called clear
in Linux so this is the terminal I am
using the command line interface the
terminal where we can gain access to
Linux operating system
I'm just giving one particular example
like by Bosch has been incorporated as a
default shell okay let's see what is
exactly a command aliasing I am
executing the command called clear the
command clear which is used to clear the
screen so every time you want to clear
the screen
you run the command clear once you press
Enter the screen will be cleared now
instead for this lengthy program and
what I'll do here I'll just make an
alias C is equal to clear now once you
press ENTER for that particular command
clear has been Aaliyah's to see now
instead of running command clear I can
run the alias command called C once you
press ENTER the screen would be cleared
like this for any such programs or
applications if you want to do a liasing
this is possible with bash shell now
these kind of features you cannot see in
other shells okay in other shells other
shells like sea shell conch shell public
domain conch shell you don't see all
this types of features in other shells
okay there is a question from Prakash so
it's just the next version right yes
okay in UNIX operating system the
default shell was shell okay and what
this person has done stiffened born has
incorporated some new features okay some
features have been incorporated in
single shell and this has been renamed
as the bash shell okay bash is nothing
but the born again shell it is named
after an inventor called Steven born
okay
in Linux if you want to see the types of
shells which are supported you can check
this configuration file the
configuration file called slash EDC
slash shells okay this is a
configuration file where you can see the
number of shells supported by Linux or
UNIX operating system if you want to see
what is the default shell you can just
recall the environment variable called
shell this will tell you what is the
default shell used in the operating
system
you see slash bin slash bash
okay so that is the importance of Bashan
and you must have got an idea like what
is shell and what is the importance of
bash shell okay
and coming to the next question what are
demons so this would be a tricky
question asked in interviews like what
are demons if I put it in simpler format
or demin according to my readings demons
are services that provide several
functions that may not be available
under the base operating system its main
task is to listen for service requests
and at the same time to act on these
requests after the service is done it is
then disconnected and wait for further
requests Adam in process has no
controlling terminal it cannot open the
terminal for example /dev / tty if you
do psi fan AF and look at that PPD tty
field all the lens will have question
mark for the tty terminal okay I'll give
a practical example here if I run a
command psi n EF you see for most of the
demons usually in Linux and UNIX
operating system
adilyn would end with D okay you see for
example let's take this particular
dimension K thread D okay at the end you
see the character here D which is
nothing but a demon okay as I told you
Adam end process has no controlling
terminal
if you check TP wife field here for this
particular dimension mark okay Adam end
process is essentially a program that
runs in the background and is usually
started when the operating system starts
up okay if you want me to take one more
example a typical Devon process in a
male demon that runs in the background
checking to see if we have received a
new male when you do it notifies you
okay
so most demons tend to last a long time
be owned by a root or do something
useful but this is a very tricky
question okay what is the difference
between a demon and the process okay so
please
don't get confused between this a demon
is a service that provides several
functions that may not be available
under the base operating system okay the
main advantage the main task is to
listen for service requests and at the
same time it will be act on this request
so that is about the demons okay one
good example you can always run psi
finesse and you check all the demons in
the tty field you see the question mark
that means we have not initiated this
system the operating system has
initiated all these demons okay and
coming to the next question
what is a lil Oh a lil o is a Linux
loader it's a boot loader for Linux
operating system it is used to load
Linux into the memory and stop the
operating system lilo can be configured
to boot other operating systems as well
lilo is customizable which means that if
the default configuration is not correct
it can be changed the main configuration
file for Lila would be /et c / yellow
corn okay as I said lil o stands for
Linux loader which is just a bootstrap
program lilo is a code snippet which
loads PC BIOS into the main memory at
the time of starting the computer system
okay and the main task
it handles is locating a Linux kernel
identifying other supporting programs
and loading them into the memory and
starting the kernel okay so lilo is not
used nowadays the default boot loader
for Linux operating system is now this
grub which is called a grand unified
boot loader okay when you talk about the
latest version of Linux operating system
it has been replaced with grub - okay
some more features has been added in
grub and they have released a new
version that is called grub - okay so
this is all about lilo it is just a
lonex loader it is called as a bootstrap
program it's a boot loader which loads
Linux operating system into the main
memory coming to the next question what
are the advantages of Linux being open
source okay
so we have been discussed in the earlier
questions also the advantages of open
source operating system Linux was one of
the first open source technologies but
many programmers have contributed and
added software that's completely
open-source for any user this means that
you can download the source code and
change it in any way you like some
developers have restrictions on how you
can distribute the code for instance
some developments allows you to change
the code but you cannot distribute it
for money one main advantage of open
source technologies such as Linux is a
wide range of options available to users
and the increased security with Linux
being open source several distributions
are available to the end user
for example distribution such as debian
fedora Ubuntu and mint are just a few of
the distributions available to end-users
and these distributions are completely
free to download security is the other
main advantage several white hat hackers
have contributed to the overall security
of Linux and by making the source
available to anyone security experts can
help identify any main security flaws in
the operating system there is a question
from Prakash it says that is every Linux
distro is free technically speaking yes
ok but there are some companies ok when
we talk about this support when we talk
about technical support ok so I was
talking about Linux is completely
open-source product it's completely
available for public users yes the OS is
free but if anyone if any organization
is looking for support ok you have to
pay only for the support not for the
operating system operating system is
anyhow free
okay if you talk about Enterprise Linux
okay Red Hat Enterprise Linux this is
the commercial stream this is the
product which comes from the commercial
stream the operating system is available
free of course but if you're looking for
the support enterprise support you have
to pay them okay
Prakash does it answer your question is
according to my readings like borer and
3/16 and dollars would be charged okay
according to the enterprise support the
basics are put again
in the support you have different types
okay for basic support you have to pay
369 dollars when you talk about Red Hat
Enterprise Linux you have to pay 315 in
dollars no problem Prakash that's fine
so shall we move on to the next question
yes Prakash when we say open source yes
the operating system is open source but
we are not paying anything for operating
system like Windows right even for
getting Windows operating system we will
pay some fees to the Microsoft
Corporation
but unlike Windows we're not paying
anything for operating system in Linux
here only for enterprise support only
for the support we are paying that ok
yes if you look the kind of support the
support like in case of the new updates
or any new releases or any bug you
looking for
the bug free operating system for that
we are just paying support for
enterprise solutions ok
Thank You Prakash coming to the next
question like what are the basic
components of Linux operating system ok
this is a general question which would
be asked in the interviews Linux
operating system has primarily three
components what we have discussed
already is kernel a kernel is the core
part of Linux which is responsible for
all major activities of this operating
system it consists of various modules
and it interacts directly with the
underlying hardware kernel provides the
required abstraction to hide low-level
hardware details to system or
application programs ok we have ro
discuss what is kernan next comes the
second part is system library and system
utility ok system libraries are special
functions or programs
using which application programs or
system utilities accesses kernel
features these libraries implements most
of the functionalities of the operating
system and do not require kernel modules
code access rights like when you compare
with windows in Windows we have dot DLL
which is nothing but dynamic link
libraries in Linux we have something all
the libraries which are there to read
the file write the file all this coding
part ok implementation of the most of
the functionalities will be there in the
slash USR slash Lib directory or slash
Lib directory ok then coming to the next
question how to check memory stats and
CPU stats as a Linux admin ok so in
interviews as I said earlier the
questions would be always in tricky
format like can expect questions in
theoretical or you can expect questions
in practical also so you should be well
advanced you should be well prepared for
the interview in the practical part also
so according to this question being the
Linux administrator have you can check
the memory stats and the CPU stats so
there are various commands in Linux here
one such command would be free if you
want to check memory statistics you can
run the command called free - M if you
want to see the size in megabytes or
free - G if you want to see the size in
megabytes and if you want to see the
virtual memory statistics you have a
command called vmstat a linux vm stock
command used to display statistics of
the virtual memory you can also see the
kernel threads the disks system
processes are your blocks interrupts CPU
activity and much more
ok let me explain you this practically
here as I said if you want to see the
memory statistics you can run the
command called free - M according to my
system I just got approx some 10 GB of
RAM because by default and sing in
megabytes your 9008 38 MB out of which
651 is used 8000 714 is free or if you
want to see that in gigabytes you can
run the command free - G if you want to
see that in gigabytes
and when you talk about virtual memory
statistics you have a command called
vmstat - eh okay so in this example
there are six columns here the
significant of the columns are explained
okay in details here as you can see the
first is the processes the memory swap
IO
system and CPU okay you can just find
out with the vmstat - a command you can
also check the dynamic activity of your
system like for example you see I'm
running the command here vmstat - space
6 with this command vmstat execute every
two seconds and stops automatically
after executing 6 intervals see this
practically see the interval here ok
interval is every 2 seconds and it will
stop automatically after 6 intervals
here you can monitor like this virtual
memory statistics ok if you want to see
along with the time format here you run
the command vmstat - P ok 1 comma 5 for
example once you press Enter you can see
along with the time format ok so like
this we have many such options in vmstat
the based on the requirement the based
on the performance and monitoring you
can execute those and coming to the cpu
you have a command called Tsar the
system activity report okay with Tsar -
you you can display the CPU usage see
exactly you can see the CPU stage ok
Tsar - you displays the CP usage for the
current day that was collected until
that point ok if you want to see the
real-time CPU usage the same like vmstat
Tsar - you 1 space 3 ok every once I get
but 3 intervals here you can see ok Tsar
is very very very important command it
is used by every administrator to
monitor the day-to-day activity ok
inside also we have many such arguments
here if you want me to discuss more Tsar
- are to see the memory
free and used I'll give one comma three
you can also see the desert you see the
KB memory free KB memory used and memory
used in percentage you can see all that
with the SAR command also ok this is all
about the system monitoring and the
performance
yes Prakash each and every system in the
network be it windows or beep Linux
operating system every system would be
monitored by using some monitoring tools
for example Nagios Nagios is one such
tool which is used for monitoring and
for performance wise ok like for example
in real time if any such server going
beyond threshold ok according to my
requirement now what I want is I would
like to notifies all the users ok if the
CPU usage threshold crosses like 80
percent ok
I would like to notify all the users if
my CP usage is going beyond 80 percent
threshold I can set all that in the
monitoring tool to just ensure my system
performance and the monitoring is under
threshold ok we have many such
monitoring tools
Nagios we have clone we have many such
monitoring tools ok
yes Prakash nag yours will be hosted on
the server and on the client we have NR
PE which is nothing but Nagios remote
plugin executors which will keep on
communicating with the server and it
will notify if anything goes beyond the
threshold ok so coming to this light so
these are some programs we have just
given in the slide here we have
discussed about the free vmstat to see
the virtual memory statistics and when
you talk about CPU statistics you can
always use the program SAR which is that
input system activity report ok so
give you some basic examples but if you
dig more into this commands you have
many such options okay and the
frequently asked questions in interviews
would be how to reduce or shrink the
size of an LVN partition okay this is a
frequently asked question in interview C
the main advantage if you just compare
between a partition and a logical volume
okay the storage management can be
created like whenever you want to create
a partition partitions can be created by
using the tool called fdisk
but if you create a partition using
fdisk it is the fixed partition size
later it is not possible for us to
modify or resize or shrink the partition
size that flexibility is not available
using fdisk
partitioning tools now using advanced
partitioning tool like a VM which is
called as a logical volume manager we
have a flexibility of either resizing
the logical volume or reducing or
shrinking the size of a logical volume
so let's see practically how you can do
that in Linux operating system I am
talking about advanced partitioning tool
called LVM which is nothing but the
logical volume manager okay
so I've already created a logical volume
manager here as you can see with the
command dfi sin H capital P you can see
for example there is a logical volume
here the logical volume is zoom Linux
and the type of the file system is ext4
the size is 4 point 8 GB and currently
this logical volume is mounted on the
mount point called slash LBM so now I
got a requirement of reducing this
logical volume size okay
in other file systems and running out of
space
I would like to reduce this logical
volume and I want to increase the
logical volume for other file systems so
let's see how exactly we can do that
okay so there is a question from Prakash
so ext4 indicates partitions No ok the
cache like after creating a partition in
Linux operating system we make a 5
- so ext4 is one such kind XD for ext3
when you talk about rhel7 x surfaces the
default file system when you compare
with Windows Windows has a default file
system called NTFS unlike NTFS in Linux
also it is called as ext4 and ext3 file
system see each and every opting system
maintains its standard in order to read
and write data okay
fetch data from disk to RAM or Ram to
hard disk read so unlike windows we have
NTFS in Linux we have ax t3 and ext4 as
a default file system so let me take one
example here there is a logical volume
which is of 5 GB currently I would like
to reduce to 3 GB now okay so that that
2 GB I can accommodate to other file
systems the first thing is online
shrinking is not possible so first you
need to unmount a logical volume the
command is you mount and specify either
the device name or the mount point and
then you can check whether you have any
problem with this particular file system
you run the command E - f ck - f and
specify the device name okay so this is
must ensured before you reduce the
logical volume you just need to scan
your filesystem ok e to F f ck is the
command to check the particular file
system whether you have any problems or
not now once you press enter so exactly
you should find this ok so we have no
problems with this particular file
system now we can reduce by using the
command resize - SS specify the logical
volume name I would like to reduce from
Phi GB to pre GB the current size is 5
GB I would like to reduce to 3 GB and
the remaining 2 GB I would like to
accommodate through other file system
enter now you see the logical volume
size has been reduced okay so now we can
run the command LV reduce - capital L 3
GB and specify your logical volume name
now once you press Enter it will be
reduced to 3 GB now
5gb to 3gb as you can see some
information here and then you can mount
your logical volume to the mount point
called LVM now you can see the logical
volume size now it has been reduced from
5 gb to 3 GB ok this is us you can
reduce or you can shrink the size of a
logical volume okay so this flexibility
is not available in fixed disk
partitions
once you create partition that's it now
you don't have a flexibility of
modifying the partition size or
shrinking the partition size so this is
possible only by using advanced
partitioning tool called lvl which is
nothing but the logical volume manager
there is a question from tracker SH this
means that even the new partition will
have its own route ok
Prakash if you know the Linux standard
filesystem hierarchy standard there
would be one root filesystem under root
you have all the sub directories sub
directories like us are MNT VAT boot
like that have created one directory as
mounted under root ok so we don't have
again another root for this particular
logical volume ok there would be only
one root under root you have all the
logical volumes mounted under it ok so
let's get back to these slides here so
we were discussing about like how to
reduce or shrink the size of our LVM
partition or a logical volume it's a
five-step process first you have to
unmount run SS again run the resize - SS
- 3 GB or whatever required size you
want and then you run the command lv
reduce to reduce the logical volume then
you can mount that particular file
system ok the next question being
explained the functionality of a root
user okay so in computing world the
super user is a special user account
used for system administration depending
on the operating system the actual name
of this account might be root or if we
talk about Windows we call as an
administrator or admin or supervisor in
unix-like computer operating system
root is the conventional name of the
user who has all the rights or
permissions to all the files and
programs in all modes okay
the root user can do many things which
an ordinary user cannot such as changing
the ownerships of files binding to
network ports numbered below thousand 24
so root is the default account every
time Linux is installed okay correct yes
Prakash seabass told you in the
beginning of the session because this is
the operating system which is completely
command oriented yes you can create a
folder in graphical also you have access
to graphical mu yes you can create a
following you can mount to that
particular fine system yes you can do
that okay so there comes your question
again what does CLI and what does GUI
okay see you like there's nothing but
the command-line interface is a console
or x2 based representation in which the
user types the commands to operate the
software or devices the main advantage
of C Liars multiple steps can be
executed by specifying the single
command which is not possible in
graphical mode okay so a GUI which is
nothing but the graphical user interface
is a graphical representation in which
the users can interact with software or
devices through graphical icons okay
simple definition what is CLI and what
is GUI so how can you find out how much
memory used in Linux operating system
again a same question here so how
exactly you can find out there are many
such programs here the command would be
free okay the free command is the most
simple and easy to use command to check
memory usage on Linux operating system
so here is an example free - n or free -
G or you can also cap the contents of
/proc /mm info this will also give you
the complete information about your
memory you can see here the total memory
okay memory in free and memory available
and you see the used in everything here
okay you
use this command also you can just cap
the contents of /proc /mm info okay or
better the simple command would be free
- gee okay what is swap space and what
is the typical size for a swap partition
under the next operating system so this
is also one of the most frequently asked
questions in interviews so what is the
swap space swap space in Linux is used
when the amount of physical RAM physical
memory which is also called as a ram
okay it's full if the system needs more
memory resources and the RAM is full in
active pages in memory are moved to the
swap space why swap space can help
machines with a small amount of RAM it
should not be considered as a
replacement for more RAM okay so people
often get confused between main memory
and swap memory okay so if the CPU
doesn't find free space in the physical
RAM so what CPU does is it just moves
all inactive processes all inactive
pages from the main memory to these wrap
space the sub space which is created on
to the disk okay to ensure it improves
your system performance okay so the
preferred size for swap partition is
twice the amount of physical memory okay
amount of physical memory available on
the system if this is not possible then
the minimum size should be the same as
the amount of memory installed okay swap
is used in normally desktops and laptops
okay not in service because in service
we have equipped with more RAM we have
32gb 64gb 128 GB on those systems there
is no need to create a swap space okay
swap space only for low-end machines
where we don't have enough RAM available
okay so swap is just to improve the
performance of the computer nothing more
okay so any questions any queries please
use a chat window okay and how do you
access partitions under Linux what is
the naming convention
four devices in Linux operating system
okay as you can see here I am running
the program fdisk - l and you see the
first device I got two drives connected
to my Linux system the first drivers
slash dev slash SDA and the second
drivers slash dev slash s DB C the
naming conventions here the conventions
used for sketchy drives in case you have
ID hard drives the first convention
would be slash dev slash HD a HD be
something like that if it got sketchy
drives or SAS drives the naming
conventions would be SDA and s DB and
under this first hard drive here if you
see you have the partition starting from
SDA one - SDH so team the first
partition slash dev slash SDF 1 and the
second partition is de 2 like that ok so
these are the naming conventions used
for your storage devices and this is a
exactly you can access partitions under
Linux operating system ok you see here
ID hard drive starts with H in case you
got sass and CSE starts with S SDA SDB
go on how our hard drives and floppy
drives referred in Linux just am I told
you right s das DB and for floppy drives
it would be FD 0 FD 1 nobody owes nobody
accessing floppy drives but it would be
a question in interviews half floppy
drives would be referred in Linux slash
dev slash FD 0 slash dev slash
FD bun based on the number of
connections you have in your system in
case of hard drives h ta h TB in case of
ID if we have sky C or SAS drives SDA s
DB something like that ok these are the
naming conventions used for floppy
drives and hard drives
similarly in Linux how are names
assigned to different serial ports what
we also called as communication ports
the communication ports are identified
as slash dev / TT bytes s 0 to T device
s 1 SC practically here LS - L / - / T
TV
yes star you see here the communication
ports okay 85 s 0 TT 5 s 1 okay what we
normally called as communication ports
in windows communication Wan
communication - like that ok coming to
the next question asking about printer
ports how exactly you can I defy the
printer ports Ingenix same thing
/ - / LP star LP 0 LP 1 LP through these
are the names to use for printer ports
ok
and the very basic question asked in
interviews is what are the kind of
permissions available in Linux okay what
are the basic file permissions are the
directory permissions available in Linux
so there are basically three levels of
file and directory permissions in Linux
one is read read like users only read
the files or list the directory contents
and the second permission would be right
as the name suggests users can write
information to the file or create files
inside the directories of a subdirectory
and the third permission would be
execute the users can run the file or
look up a specific file within a
directory okay so besides these you can
have a combination of all the three
levels of permissions and two of them or
one of them some combinations read write
execute or read write or read execute
the based on the requirement as an
administrator I can change permissions
okay
basically there are three permissions
the three permissions what we see here
that is read write and execute okay
coming to the next question like how do
you change permissions under Linux so
there is a command called chmod chmod is
a command to change permissions for
files and directories and the
permissions can be changed in two
formats one a symbolic mode another one
would be absolute mode symbolic mode is
nothing but using numbers and absolute
mode is nothing but like using
characters okay like rwx or seven five
five or six four for the Delp of chmod
you can change permissions okay
in order to change ownerships you have a
command like CH own and chgrp in order
to change ownerships for files and
directories okay see here the command
chmod is to change permissions and if
you would like to change the ownerships
you can use the command CH own and chgrp
okay on the left pane you can see some
representation here user groups others
and the permissions are read write and
execute
okay bless is to add permission - is to
revoke permission and is equal to to
overwrite the existing permissions okay
the permissions can be changed in two
different modes symbolic mode and
absolute mode symbolic using like
characters or debris X absolute is using
numbers okay combination of numbers the
read value is for write value is to
execute value is one you can either use
characters or you can use numbers okay
symbolic mode or absolute mode yes
you're right Prakash chmod 7 what is 7
read/write/execute applicable for owner
0 means none permissions applicable for
group 0 again none and this is
applicable for others okay and coming to
the next question what are symbolic
links very interesting question ok
symbolic links so in Linux basically we
have two types of links one is symbolic
link which is also called as the soft
link so symbolic link you can always
compare if you take an example like in
Windows we have shortcuts ok we always
create a desktop shortcuts now if
instead of going to the lengthy part or
navigating into directories into
directories and directories we can
better create a shortcut on the desktop
ok for easy access in and easy way of
interacting with the operating system
similarly in Linux it is called as a
symbolic links or soft links so this is
one special kind of file that points to
another file that gets compared with
Windows red we have shortcuts but please
remember symbolic link does not contain
the data ok symbolic link will not have
the data all the data we have in the
target file but not in the shortcut ok
and what are the benefits of using
symbolic link it just allows instant
access easy of access of application or
a program ok without having to navigate
to multiple directories here let me show
you one practical example here for
example I just want to see the
configuration file of my LAN card
network
interface card the command would be cat
slash EDC slash this config network -
scripts and the configuration file would
be starting like this this is my
configuration file for male LAN card en
p0 s3 see the path here EDC's this
config network - scripts under this
directory we have a file called IFC FG -
e and p 0 f3
now instead what we'll do here I'll
create a symbolic link see Ln - s is a
command l n stands for link now what
type of link I'm creating here I am
creating the symbolic link the bath
would be EDC Siskin fit network -
scripts IFC of g - e np0 s3 for this
particular file i am creating a shortcut
under my root directory with the name
called IFC FG enter the link has been
established now instead of viewing the
land information instead of going to
this lengthy path better I can read from
the shortcut now which one is easy to
access either this one or this from the
shortcut I know it is from the shortcut
C the properties here LS - l / is CFG
because this is exactly pointing to the
original file the target file this is a
linker file the symbolic link file which
is pointing to the target file now
instead of using this lengthy part here
I can better use my shortcut okay so
these are called symbolic links please
remember symbolic link does not contain
the data all the data we have in the
target file we don't have anything over
here okay what are the qualities of
symbolic link now both the files will
have different inode numbers will
discuss about eye notes both files the
source file and the target file will
have different inode numbers will have
different permissions and the different
size also okay soft link will always
have different name same content both
will be having same content but the
different name okay and remember soft
links can be created only for files and
directories when you compare with hard
link hard link can be created only for
files but not for directories
soft links can be created for files and
directories and soft link can cross the
five systems also you can establish a
link between five systems where as hard
link
you cannot span across five systems ok I
hope you got me about symbolic links
here see the qualities of soft links
what we have discussed ok both files
will have different inode numbers
different permissions different size but
the same content but with a different
name ok what are hard links now in
computing a hard link is a directory
entry that Associates a name with a file
on a file system all directory based
file systems must have at least one hard
link giving the original file for each
directory ok the hard link is usually
only used in the file system that allows
more than one hard link for the same
file ok hard links can be created only
for files but not for directories and
hard link
you cannot span across partitions it
should be created within the file system
ok so these are some of the differences
between the symbolic links and hard
links here ok and coming to the next
question like what is the maximum length
of a file name under Linux this is also
one of the important question which is
frequently asked in Linux interviews
Linux has the maximum file length of 255
characters ok for most file systems like
ext3 ext4 in those file systems you can
have a file up to length of 255
characters ok and the maximum path of 4
0 9 6 characters ok so what we have
discussed here the maximum path you can
have up to 4 0 9 6 characters and one
particular filename you can have up to
255 characters okay coming to the next
question which type of files are
prefixed with a dot so generally in
Linux and UNIX operating system if any
objects starts with dot or prefixed with
dot those are called hidden files I am
on the super user home directory if I
want to see all the files here you can
run a command LS -
a including all the files you see one
particular file prefixed with the dot so
this is exactly a hidden file this is a
regular file which is not starting the
dot and this is the file which is
prefixed with dot this is the hidden
file okay and you see a directory also
which is prefixed with dot and you see
the regular directory public is a
regular directory dot cache is the
hidden directory so these files can be
sometimes called as the configuration
files also which holds some important
data if you see one example here cat
Bashar see some aleosis has been
mentioned here for that particular
environment right so mostly in Linux and
UNIX operating system if any objects
begins with dot those are called hidden
files and hidden directories coming to
the next question like what is a virtual
desktop which will desktop like whenever
a user's desktop environment when I talk
about users desktop environment like
icons wallpapers windows like folders
toolbars okay is stored in a remote
server rather than on a local PC then
it's exactly called as a virtual desktop
okay
the desktop virtualization software
separates the physical machine from the
software and presence and isolated
operating system for users desktop
virtualization tools include like
Microsoft Virtual PC VMware Workstation
and parallel Desktop for Mac operating
system the main benefits of desktop
virtualization it just includes like
cost savings because resources can be
shared and allocated as a needed basis
and more efficient use of resources and
energy improved data integrity because
backup is centralized and centralized
administration okay this is about the
virtual desktop but we have discussed
the benefits of virtual desktops okay
and what does the nameless empty
directory represents empty directory as
you know empty directory name serves as
a nameless base for the Linux file
system
deserves as a attachment for other
direct
files drives and devices okay
empty directory how can you create
folders and files using the terminal so
in Linux operating system if you want to
create a directory you can use the
command mkdir and to create files we
have many such programs for example like
VI cat command or you can use graphical
base editors like G edit and edit Pico
nano you have many such programs to
create files okay you even have line
editor screen based editors graphical
base editors to create files in Linux
and UNIX operating system ok but if you
want to create a directory you want to
create a folder use the command mkdir ok
and next question would be what is the
different ways to weave the contents of
the file ok to remove the contents and
file once again we have many such
programs here we have many such inbuilt
Linux programs you can either use
graphical based editors or text based
editors something like cat VI VI M G
edit you have Pico Nano you have many
such programs ok what our environment
variables one important and interesting
question what our environment variables
environment variables are global
settings that control the behavior of a
shell ok software packages installed in
Linux and other processes the path where
the various software's are installed
will be stored as a environment
variables environment variables are used
to pass information into processes that
are spawned from the shell shell
variables and variables that are
contained exclusively within the shell
in which they were set or defined
while interacting with your server
through a shell session there are many
pieces of information that will come
pies to determine its behavior and
access to resources some examples if you
want to see in environment variables
also we have different types we have
system variables and we have user
defined variables in the case if we want
to see the system variables you can run
the command env env is a command to
display all the environment variables
which are set by default with the
operating system okay
one good example of an environment
variable would be path okay this is a
system variable which has the
information about the path of all your
binaries all your executables okay if
you take one more example you see the
environment variable called home what is
the superuser home directory which is
slash route okay these are some examples
here environment variables okay system
variables and user defined variables
what is the functionality of a tab key
in see a light we were discussing above
the features of bash shell right I was
talking about c'mon aliasing command
completion by using tab keys and command
history let me show you practically here
in the current working directory called
slash root I have a file called anaconda
Keys dot CFG let's take one example here
there is a file called anaconda J's dot
C of G if I want to see the contents of
this file I can run a program called
less or more or cat you can do anything
here but I have to type the complete
file named cave dot CFG rather what I
will do here
I'll simple type few letters I'll use
the tab key here automatically the file
name would be completed same cat
anaconda cave store TFG I am not typing
the complete file name I am just using a
few letters and then I am using the tab
keys enter to see the contents of this
particular file similarly there are many
programs in Linux starts with the
character C albeit free here I'll use
the tab key I can see with the C letter
I have 162 possibilities that means I
have 152 programs here you see one such
program called cat if we want to see ca
use the tab key here with the ca we have
this many possibilities here one good
example is scat one good example would
be calendar okay so these are the
features of the bash shell okay too
need a commander to complete a file name
or the directory name okay so please let
me know if you have any questions any
queries
okay what is redirection in Linux is
this is also one of the frequently asked
questions in the next year okay so what
is exactly a redirection so in Linux
redirection is used to pass the output
of one operation as input to another
operation in the same command if you see
one example here as an administrator I
would like to find out like the users
who logged in with my operating system
who currently using my operating system
I can run the command called W with the
W I can have all this information okay
since when my PC is up and running okay
for how long the PCs up and running how
many users are connected and what is the
load average of my computer
and you see the remaining information
here the users the terminal they logged
in from bit system they logged in you
see the login time you see the idle the
J CPU P CPU and what exactly they're
doing what commands they're executing
okay I just want to send this report
through one of my lead manager so that
he can have this information here W and
I would like to save this particular
information in one particular file so
this is exactly called as a redirection
okay so redirection is nothing but which
is used to pass the output of W command
okay output of one operation will be the
input for another operation okay W will
display all this information and this
will pass to this particular file see
catalog all this information has been
passed here this is exactly called as a
redirector the greater than symbol okay
it is called as the redirector the
redirector symbol the greater than
symbol okay
they give one more examples here the cat
file file1 file2 the contents of file1
file2 will be in 5/3 okay if 5/3 already
exist the 5/3 would be overwritten and
if you don't want to overwritten if we
want to append you use double
redirecting to okay
and what is grep so this command is used
for searching for a particular string or
you can also call it as a word searching
for particular word in a text file okay
it also supports pattern based searching
the pattern based searching is done by
including options and parameters in the
command okay one such example is the
command is grab I have a file here the
file called testing in this particular
file I have some words and characters
and numbers here I would like to grab
this word the command is grip the word
you want to search for from the file
called testing see grep the string or
the word you want to search for from the
file called testing here okay
if we want to see with the line on this
you can pass an argument called - n at
line number 17 I have the word called SD
if we want to see the count of the word
you can use an argument called - see I
just have only one bird called SD in the
file called testing the count like this
we have many such arguments and grip
okay
the pattern based searching is also
possible in grep command okay and coming
to the next question like how to
terminate on ongoing process in Linux
here so in Linux every process in Linux
operating system is identified by a UNIX
process which is called as a PID number
okay
PID is nothing but the process ID to
terminate any process we can use the
command kill you can either use the
process name or you can use the process
ID okay you see the command kill and if
you want to terminate all bosses at once
you can use the command kill zero okay
it shouldn't be executed on production
environments kill zero not recommended
command but only for information sake
and how to insert comments in command
prompt so this is a very basic question
carbons are inserted by using the hash
symbol before they come in text you see
any such configuration file for example
if you take /et see slash grab gone
or slash EDC slash profile for example
okay you see the comments here the
comments can be provided by using the
hash symbols so these are the commented
lines and these are called uncommented
lines okay so can you insert several
commands in a single command line entry
if so then house it's a very good
question so this is also called as a
command chaining like you can execute
multiple commands one by one okay by
using a semicolon
okay if I give you one practical example
here the first thing is I would like to
create a directory called directory 1
and then I want to go to this directory
then under this directory would like to
create all this files so this is called
command chaining one after the other the
commands would be executed the first
command is to create a directory and the
second command to execute a directory
under this directory I am creating all
this files with the names called JK and
L ok this is exactly called the series
of commands in a single entry you go to
this directory
see the files has been created here ok
write a command that will display all
the txt files along with its permissions
ok write a command that will display all
the txt files means we have to use the
regular expressions and the common
extension we have to use this dot txt so
I'll use a command LS - al star dot txt
ok so in this particular directory I
don't have anything here that's a dot
txt but this would be the command the
command is LS - al star dot txt it would
display all the files including hidden
files with the properties ok see here I
got Geetha dot txt report dot txt along
with the properties here ok and the next
question would you write a command that
will look for files with dot txt
extension and has the occurrence of the
string a dareka in it ok so we have to
use combination of commands here and
that combination would be I'll give an X
sample here of find /search from the
complete directory here I would like to
search the txt files here from the txt
files
I would like to search for a word
pattern called ed Eureka okay the
combination of commands fear first it
would find all the files which has the
extension txt and then using the
advanced command called X arguments I am
running a command called grep - I I am
searching for the word path and called a
Eureka okay fine
will list all the files with extension
dot PHP and grep is used to search for
the string a Eureka
this is how you can do it same thing how
to find the status of a process if you
want to find the status of a process in
Linux operating system you can run the
command called PS - aux ok so you see
the status here the status of a process
if it is s it is interrupt ability state
that means it is waiting for an event to
complete ok if you find be somewhere
here B that is uninterruptible sleep
state usually it is waiting for ru
operation to complete if it is R that is
a running state if it is Z that is
nothing but the defunct process which is
also called as a zombie process okay the
process which is terminated but not
reaped by its parent if it is T all of
you that is it is a stop the state
either by a job control signal or
anything it can be okay you can also see
some code meaning here you have the
greater than symbol and you have n you
have L there a greater than symbol is
nothing but the process which is of high
priority you see here okay intercept
able sleep state which is of high
priority if it is n here somewhere you
see n here n is nothing but the low
priority if it is L means the process
where the pages have been logged into
memory okay like this you can find out
the process states by using the comma
PS - aux the status of a process you
should look into this column the stages
of the process okay and what is the
command to calculate the size of a
folder this is also one of the important
question and you can find out with the
command D U which is nothing but the
directory usage and with the arguments -
SH of the directory boot you see for the
directory boot it is occupied 135 MB
okay the command bu is to find out the
directory usage of a particular
directory okay how to check the memory
status of the system it is a repeated
question again the command is free - M
or free - G okay same thing and how to
login as root in Linux from the terminal
I have already logged in as a root here
let's say for example I have a user
called ed Eureka this is a user logged
in with the user ID Eureka
I want to gain access to super user okay
I want to log in as root simple I can
run the command sudo su - and I think I
don't have Suda's configured here as
simple run the command su - and then I
need to provide a super user password
then I can login as a root say here
the brunt has been changed from the
dollar sign to the hash prompt dollar
sign is the prompt provided for all
users and the hash prompt is the prompt
only provided for super user ok the
command su su stands for substitute user
with the user ID Eureka
I gained access to the operating system
as root user okay like this you can do
the command su and the next question is
how can you run a Linux program in the
background simultaneously when you start
your Linux server this is a very very
important question and this is
frequently asked in interviews and the
command would be no hop ok the command
is no hop by using the no hop command
the process will run in the background
ok any process which receives the no hop
signal ok will
terminated when you log out the program
okay until then the process could be
running in the background all the time
okay please remember the command would
be no hub okay
by default it just placed the process in
the background which demand tracks
events on your computer events on a
Linux system okay we have the demons
like syslog B we have domestic arses log
we have so many tracking events in Linux
and UNIX operating system okay the
answer should be syslog B or ours this
lock okay so what is partial back so
partial backup is nothing but a type of
backup where the complete operating
system is not taken as a backup okay
only certain files certain folders have
been backed up but not the complete file
system that is exactly called as a
partial back ok so when you select only
some portion of a directory okay in a
single partition that is exactly called
as a partial by partial backup is not
the complete backup only certain files
and folders have been backed up okay so
in Linux we have many such backup
programs like tar cbio dump restore ok
using this you can take a back either
complete file system backup or the
selected files and folders based on the
requirement and next question would be I
note very very important one
inode is nothing but the contents of any
file will be stored in data blocks
whereas information about that file will
be stored in I note so when we talk
about data data has two parts the
contents the contents will be stored in
the data blocks and information about
the file what we called as metadata that
metadata will be there in the inode ok
so information of what type of
information is stored in I note like the
file size the permissions the user
ownership the group ownership the link
count then exactly the file was last
accessed or last modified ok all that
you can see in I note so an inode number
points to an inode table which is the
data structure that stores all that
information
the size of the file the device ID the
user ID group ID the file mode
permissions everything okay
so which command is used to set a
processor intensive job to execute less
CPU time very very important question
and the answer would be the command nice
andrey nice okay these are the programs
which are used to set a priority okay
you can change the process priority
using nice and renoise programs so nice
command will launch the process with an
user-defined scheduling priority three
nice command will modify the scheduling
priority of a running process okay
so the process scheduling priority
ranges from minus 20 to 19 keep this in
mind this is very important okay the
process scheduling priority range from
minus 20 to 19 we also call this as a
nice value okay a nice value of minus 20
represents the highest priority and the
nice value of 19 represents the least
priority of a process okay if I show you
one practical example here let me just
create one particular file cat
redirecting file one I am creating a
file okay so in the back end when
process would be invoked because I'm
creating a file here let me open other
session here let me show you by just
running the command psi n SL and the
process name called cat ok see this
particular process by default you see
the nice value the nice value is d is 0
whenever you submit a process by default
every process will have a nice value 0
ok see you similarly if I submit a
program with the less priority for
example minus 10 ok minus 10 cat
redirecting file 1 here now you see the
nice value let me open the other sir
this one let me recall the same command
now you see the nice body for cat
command the next value is 10
ok the nice value ranges from minus 20 -
19 - 20 being the high
preppy and 19 Bing d-list pratik see I
launched a program with a nice value
with the least value called
10 okay if you want to launch a program
with the highest priority
I'll give minus 10 okay do not get
confused here it is not - - it is minus
10 now you see now it is minus 10 okay
that means this command requires more
CPU time okay similarly unlike nice if
there is already a running process that
can be changed by using the command
called
renoise okay the command is real nice -
n the priority you want okay and you can
give the process name or the process ID
you can do with the renoise 3 nice can
be used if the program is aldeen used ok
very important programs see here the
priority ranges from minus 20 to 19 - 20
being the highest and 19 being the
lowest priority and the last question is
like what our shadow passwords and half
they are enabled so shadow passwords are
given for better system security every
users passwords will be stored in slash
EDC / password file and by implementing
shadow passwords all passwords will be
stored in encrypted format in a new file
called / z DC / shadow ok the passwords
in the original file will then be
replaced with X in multi-user
environments it is very important to use
a shadow passwords ok if I give one
small example like in Linux we have two
such database files here one database
file will have information about users
and other database file will have
information about users passwords / EDC
/ shadow ok we have two such database
files here which keeps information about
users and users passwords okay so this
is to improve the security in earlier
days in earlier versions of Linux and
UNIX operating system there used to be
only one particular file which has
everything user and the users file see
an example here
example calls password converts
cat / etc' / password used to have
everything like this in one particular
file you have uses the users passwords
and everything but the problem is this
particular file is readable by everyone
see you
/ ATC / password is owned by root he got
full permissions here even others got
read permissions okay which does not
impose security on this particular file
okay so that is the reason there are two
database files maintained one is EDC
password and EDC shadow finds now you
see the shadow file is only has three
permissions for root for others you see
we have none permissions okay so this is
us we have two database files your EDC
password which has information about
users and EPC shadow which has
information about users passwords okay
not only pass which we also have
information about the password age also
for how long we can use this password
when password would be expired all this
information can be used in EPC shadow
fight okay so this is all about Linux
interview I hope the session is useful
