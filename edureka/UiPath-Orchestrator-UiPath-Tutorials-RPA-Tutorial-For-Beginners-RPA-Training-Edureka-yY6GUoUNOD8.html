welcome to this live session on uipath
Orchestrator today in this session I'm
going to teach you guys how you can use
the uipath Orchestrator which is nothing
but how you can deploy robots and clank
machines using your servers now I'm also
going to try to make this session more
beneficial for beginners who don't know
what RPA is who don't know you i pathes
so you guys are going to get a crash
course on what our PA is and what you
have path is in this session alright so
let's start with the session and see
what is our agenda for today and before
starting guys if you guys have any
doubts during the session please put it
in the comment box my team is here to
help you out and they shall be answering
your queries all right so let's start
with the session with the agenda so guys
this is my agenda for today I'll start
with what is our PA and then move on to
the different tools which I use to
implement this technology after that we
are going to pick one tool out with
these tools which is UI path and I'm
gonna teach you guys how you can use the
UI path studio after that I'm going to
teach you what UI path Orchestrator
Community Edition is and how you can use
it and towards the end we'll be doing a
demo where I'll demonstrate it to you
how you can use the orchestrator to
deploy a robot on client machines
alright so guys this is our agenda for
today I hope it's clear to you so
without wasting any time let's move on
to the first topic of today's discussion
which is what is rpm so as you guys know
our PA is an acronym for robotic process
automation so let's see these three
words closely and see what they actually
mean right so robotic is basically an
entity which can mimic the human ash
actions right it's a computer entity
which can mimic the hoopin and human
actions and any entity entity like that
is known as robotic then comes process
so any sequence of steps that you do
that lead to a meaningful task is known
as a process right so it could be the
process of you know making you're taking
a dog outside your home so you have to
you know put the leash on him and then
you
came outside the home it could be the
process of making tea you put water in
your kettle then you put tea leaves and
then milk and then your tea is ready so
it could be any process so any sequence
of steps that lead to a meaningful
activity like I said is known as a
process then comes automation so
whenever a task happens without any
human intervention it is known as
automation all right so if you were to
summarize these three words mimicking
human actions to do a meaningful task
without human intervention is known as
rpm all right so for those of you who
don't know about our PA any tasks that
you want to do which which involves
humans and you know it involves
repetitive or rule-based tasks if those
kind of tasks you want to automate that
can be done using our PA all right
moving forward guys now this our PA
technology can actually be implemented
using a variety of tools which are
implement which are available in the
market now what are these tools you have
uipath you have blue prism and you also
have automation anywhere so apart from
these there are quite a lot of tools but
these are the top three tools which are
available in the market right now and
today in this session I'm going to teach
you guys what is your iPad how you can
use your iPad and why am i talking about
you a path today the first reason would
be that I also want you guys to be able
to practice the demos that I'm doing
today right so UI path has provided us
with Community Edition which is free to
use and anybody who is an RP
enthusiastic EA can use this tool by
using the Community Edition
if I talked about the other tools which
is blue prism and automation anywhere
they don't have the community editions
or they don't give a trial version
automation anywhere does give a trial
version but you know with Community
Edition in UI paths you don't have any
boundaries you don't have any
limitations in you know creating and
executing automations and that is the
reason we'll be using UI paths today all
right now moving forward let me get
started with the UI path tool right
me let me give you an introduction to
uipath so before creating any automation
in your path before starting any
automation in UI path you have to be
acquainted with the key concepts which
are there in this UI path video all
right so what are those key concepts you
should understand water activities and
what are sequences all right so let's
discuss these terms one by one so what
our activity is so an activity is the
smallest action in UI path
alright for example you know the click
of a button of your mouse is also an
activity you know you typing into a text
box is also an activity all right you're
closing an application is also an
activity so all these tasks all these
small tasks are known as activities now
these activities when they combine
together they then lead to a sequence
right and this was water sequences so
when you combine these activities to do
a meaningful task is it is known as a
sequence right for example for logging
into your Gmail the the sequence would
be to first open the Gmail page enter
the user name then the password and then
clicking on login right so all these
activities all these small activities
that you just did let to logging into
Gmail right so it becomes a sequence
alright now if you were to talk about
the UI of your iPod studio the user
interface of your bar so this is how it
looks alright
so let me quickly switch to my tools so
that I can show you how the UI power
tool actually looks like so give me a
second
alright guys so I hope you guys can see
my tools guys this is the you iPad
screen this is this is how the tool
actually looks like now if I were to
show you guys how my you know how you
can actually create projects inside your
UI path so this is the main screen guys
this is where all the magic happens
right so let me create a new sequence
for you guys so that I can show you how
easy it is to actually create an
automation inside you iPad studio right
so this is this is basically the design
space this is where you will be creating
all your automations in the UI path
studio on the left side you can see
these are all the activities or these
are all the small tasks which are
available to you which you can simply
drag-and-drop and use them so let me
create a sample automation for you let
me you know start with something very
basic for example you want your computer
to you know take an input from you and
you want it to be displayed back from
message box alright so if you want to do
this using coding guys this would be
very difficult but I know most of you
guys must not be from the developer
background offer also for those of you
who are from the developer background
you will be amazed to how simple it is
to do this particular task alright so
I'll click on search activities and the
smallest you know task that I want to do
right now is take my input so I'll type
in input dialog all right I'll drag and
drop the input dialog over here I'll
specify enter text I'll specify enter
the message all right and then this
message that you'll be entering it has
to be stored somewhere right so we have
to declare a variable for this so
declaring a variable is very simple just
go here in the variable tabs click on
string right not saying that let it be
say a word cool and then you know you'll
click on input dialog you will go into
the properties and inside output so this
is the page this is the part of a
program
where it will you know assign the value
to variable so over here you have to
mention the variable inside which the
value should be stored so let's specify
it as you know the variable if it's just
created which is word alright so this is
done the next part is you know
displaying it on a in a message box so
let's search for a message box all right
let's drag and drop it over here and
let's enter the text if we want to see
so say this is we will enter this is the
text that you entered : you know space
and just add the variable to this which
is wood alright and it's set so let's
run this particular program that I just
created in UI part I've hit run it'll
ask me for the message right let me
enter the message as say my first
automation and I'll hit OK alright so
now you can see the message box says
this is the first this is the text that
you entered and it says my first
automation alright so this is this is
how simple it is to actually create
automations inside uipath studio now let
me let me do something very much complex
that you guys will like so I have
created this particular program which
which does scraping which which
basically involves extracting
information from a particular ecommerce
website and storing it inside an excel
file alright so let's see how this goes
how this is actually happening all right
so let me edit some part of it and let's
see how it happens all right so I will
hit run and you know it will ask me for
the search term now what what is the
product that I want to search on the
e-commerce website say I want to search
for a blackberry all right I'll hit and
I enter blackberry I click on OK and it
go on and it will now open the ecommerce
website it has searched for blackberry
over there right and now it will go over
there and search for each and every
product on that particular website once
it's that got that product it will store
the information inside an excel file and
that is what I'll be getting all right
so let's see how it ends all right so I
can see there are along around 1 lakh
results for this let me try some other
search term because this will take a lot
of time so let me close particular
automation
let us run this program again with this
different search term all right so let's
enter the search phone search term s a -
that's such wife and I hope there are
not more iPhones than blackberry so
alright let's see how this is running
alright so there are only 133 results
which is a good thing for me so now it's
running the automation and once it
reaches the end page of the pair of the
of the search it'll recognize this page
and you'll say ok that my search has
ended now it will take all the results
which has just scraped from the website
and now store it inside an excel file
now imagine guys if you were to do this
manually if you were to do this manually
how would it do it so for doing this
manually guys you know you will go to
each page you will copy the name you
will copy the price and you will do that
for each and every product which is
there on the sea commerce website right
and doing that will take a lot of trying
right and we don't and we have AV guys a
very short of time right it took around
I guess a minute to actually get
everything so let's check if we caught
CSV file so this is the CSV file as you
can see it's 814 right now and it's just
been modified
open the CSV file here and yes as you
can see the name and the price prices
have been extracted from that particular
website and now I have a list of iPhones
with their prices right so this is the
kind of automation that you can create
in your iPad and I think it only took me
around 15 minutes to create this
automation and don't worry guys I'll be
teaching you guys how do you how to
create this automation maybe in some
other session right but today
listen sits an introductory session and
it should be about the uipath
Orchestrator i'll teach you how you can
you know execute this particular project
on some other client machine without
even downloading this project on that
client machine right and for that what
I've done is I've created an AWS server
and I've installed you a path on it now
what I'll be doing is I'll be I'll be
running the command from this particular
machine to to my UI path okay schraeder
and my program will run then on the AWS
machine all right so this is our agenda
for UI pockets later but before that
let's understand what you have are the
orchestrator actually is all right so
you a path Orchestrator typically has
this kind of process which is designed
around it so first inside the
orchestrator you have to define robots
so what are robots robots are nothing
but the the part of your automation
which would be executing everything for
example in what the automation that has
just shown you there was a there was a
part of the program which was scraping
everything which was clicking on next
right and then in the end it shaved
everything in the excel file and then
ended the automation right so that
entity is known as a robot now I have to
define inside the orchestrator where
matter what actually is what is the
which machine it is running on right so
I have defined all of that and I hence
create a robot so once a robot is
defined and you know your Orchestrator
is connected to you
machine the next thing that you have to
do is create an environment now what is
an environment an environment is
basically a playground where you have
put your robots now the next thing that
you will be doing is inside that
environment you will be putting the
project that you want to run all right
so that project in uipath Orchestrator
is known as a process so you'll be
putting the process or you will be
putting that project inside that
environment and then the robot is able
to see that project right and it is
inside the environment and then you go
to jobs which is the third part of your
UI path environment or the UI part
user interface and inside jobs you just
try to run the project and define which
robot should execute that product
project now the robots are nothing but
machines there are different client
machines that you have defined in your
path August Reiter and whatever machine
you specify it will run on that
particular machine the project that you
have specified or you have uploaded
inside your environment all right so
this is basically the whole story behind
uipath Orchestrator and don't worry if
you don't understand anything what I
just told the story that I've just told
we'll be doing that in demo and I'll
teach you and take you from each and
every step for you know creating your
environment you're creating your robots
and hence executing your jobs inside you
a path Orchestrator all right now let's
move out guys so this is the you
orchestrate a page this is where your
Orchestrator is actually located so you
have to go to this URL which is platform
dot uipath comm once you have reached
this URL you will have to register
yourself on the orchestrator so it is a
very simple straightforward process you
enter email ID you know you put your
password and you know the relevant
details and you just click create and
once you click create you will be
prompted with the screen this is
basically the dashboard of your UI path
studio all right so let me quickly show
you the path of the plot at the the the
user interface for UI bar the
orchestrator in
in my browser so give me a second
alright so we'll go to platform dot
uipath com I'll hit enter and guys this
is the user interface for your UI path
Orchestrator
right now you have robots here you have
processes you have jobs you have
schedules assets queues what are these
I'll be explaining in a moment alright
so the first thing like I said if you if
you would refer to the diagram is you
know creating a robot so let's create a
robot first so for creating a robot you
will go to the robot tab by clicking
over here and you will be clicking on
the Add icon once you click on the Add
icon this is the screen that you get
prompted with this is the key that you
have to copy and paste on your machine
so that you are you uipath Orchestrator
can recognize ok so this is the machine
I have to connect to alright once you
connect to your UI your robot that is on
your machine you can you have to specify
the Machine name over here so machine
name you can get your machine name
basically by going into start computer I
click over there properties and you know
you'll have the Machine name over there
so let me quickly show you the machine
name from my computer so if I click on
properties this is the machine name for
me the computer name is the machine name
which is Eddie rate of 41 all right so
I'll be entering that over here and then
you know if you want to rename your
robot something you are paying that the
name of your robot then the domain so
domain basically means the account name
that you have for your computer
for example my domain name would be
human right for you it would be the
username that you have used for your
Windows machine after that you have to
enter the password over here for your
machine and then click on provision
alright so let let us do that for my
machine first so let me quickly show you
how you can launch the uipath studio or
the UI robot on your machine right so by
default guys your UI robot service is
not
on your computer if you want the UI
robot so it should run on your computer
there's a little something that you have
to do extra which is you will be going
to you know the the path where you iPods
to do exe is located for that you know
just go to your UI pass your I can
right-click on it and go to properties
so this is basically the shortcut that
you will have on a desktop right and you
have to take this path and you have to
go to this particular path right I'll
copy the path I will go to this
particular path let's go from here
alright this is the this is the place
where your UI path has been installed
now you will be going inside the app
folder so let's go inside the app folder
and once you are there inside the app
folder you will scroll down and you will
find an icon which is known as UI robot
right once you find it double click on
it to run it and it will run as a
service in your system tray alright so
as you can see I have a UI path robot
running over here right so now I have to
connect this robot to the orchestrator
so for doing that I will right-click on
the robot I will click on settings and I
will get this page so this is the page
where you will be entering the robot key
that you will be getting from
Orchestrator and you have to enter the
orchestrator URL over here which is
platform but uipath calm all right so
let's try to connect this robot to my
office traitor so I'll go to my office
traitor I'll copy the key I will again
go to this page I will paste the key
over here alright done
now I will go to orchestrate a URL and
now over here I have to specify this
particular URL right so let's specify
the URL over here done now robots is not
required all you have to enter is
platform dot uipath calm alright so once
you have created your robot over here
you will click on connection let's
create the robot here so let's
ed Eureka 41 which is the machine name
for me right the name that I want to
give to my robot let me give it as a
local system right the domain is payment
that is my account name and let me give
the password now so in my password is
this alright now let's go down and that
is it that is all you have to configure
for creating a robot once I click on
provision it will list my lab robot over
here with the name local that I've given
to my robot and the street is right now
disconnected alright so what I'll do now
is I'll go here I click on connect now
if all the information that we have
entered is right you will be
successfully connected to your uipath
Orchestrator so it takes some time to
connect alright so it has connected and
if you see here the status is available
now so you have successfully connected
your robot to your Orchestrator now
let's connect the AWS service as well
right so this is my ec2 instance so this
was the easier instance that I'll be
connecting to right now the UI robot
service is running over here so let's
connect this UI robot to my Orchestrator
so I'll click on Add icon I will add the
machine name so I have to get the
machine name from there but I have the
key here so let's copy the key and paste
it inside my UI robot which is running
over here let's go to settings alright
this is where I'll be entering the robot
key now this is the Machine name that I
have two copies let's copy the machine
name let's go back to my UI path
Orchestrator let's paste the machine
name over here alright done now let what
what name do I want my AWS machine to
have so let's give it the name as EWS
what is the domain name for this it is
administrator so that we control
and put administrator over here alright
now I have to give the password so let
me get the password for my ear a blessed
console I come back here I put the
password and that's it now let's click
on provision all right so my a SS robot
has also been created but it is right
now indeed disconnected stage so let's
create let's connect our uipath robot to
orchestrators for that i'll just against
verify the aqua freighter URL so let's
copy the orchestrator you are from here
which is this right let us go back paste
it here
remove the slash from the end and click
on connect alright so it will again take
some like 2-3 seconds to connect and as
you can see it says disconnect over here
which basically means my robot has
connected let's verify that in my
Orchestrator page so all right so my AWS
machine now is saying it is available
which is awesome now I want to since my
robots have been deployed now I don't
have an environment right now which I
have created right so I'll go to
environments so this is an environment
that I created earlier let me quickly
delete it so that I can teach you from
fresh all right so I've deleted the
environment now let's create a new
environment and name this environments
to say as Eddie rekha 1 all right and
let's get create so this will create a
new environment now what robots do I
want in this particular environment to
be deployed
so let us deploy the AWS server and my
local machine as well alright so when
you just have to click on the check box
and this will deploy your robot in your
machine in your environment and you can
click on close after that alright so
your environment now consists of two
robots which have been deployed now what
is left is a project which has to be
assigned to your environment for that
you will go to processes right and you
click on add now once you click on add
this basically points to a common
repository which which uipath Community
Edition or you about Orchestrator
community relation has provided us with
all right so whenever you publish your
projects to the UI path Orchestrator it
will get published inside your this
particular repository right and whenever
you upload your project you will get
your projects listed over here alright
so this is the list of projects that
people have uploaded or you know people
like you who were trying to use you
apply the orchestra Orchestrator I've
uploaded alright so these are the pages
now there's a glitch in UI power
Orchestrator guys let me point that out
that it can only show a limited number
of names over here alright so you when
you're naming your project anything you
have to be very sure that the naming
convention is such such that it get
listed over here alright so for example
the sort of guy he he made the name as
triple zero triple zero one and it was
sort of and it caught on the top and
maybe that is the reason he'll be able
to use it but if you scroll down guys
you cannot see anything beyond a right
so these are all the projects that
people have uploaded anything beyond is
not being reflected and that that is
because you know this this particular
list can only show few names so like I
said you have to give the naming
convention very carefully so that it get
lit it gets listed over here so before
deploying a project let's create a
simple project that we want to upload
alright for that lets go to my uipath
studio and let's create a new project
let's name it as say zero zero zero zero
zero zero and let's give one more zero
that is seven zeros and then one
underscore and you rekha all right so
let's give it give it this name and hit
create
all right so this basically creates a
project folder for me now I want to
publish this project folder to my office
later which I will do once I have
created this particular automation
alright another cool thing that you need
to notice and Orchestrator geysers that
you'll be creating a pure project only
once you don't have to copy your project
one each and every robot that you have
deployed in deployed inside Orchestrator
all right we'll be creating a project
once you'll be uploading it onto the
repository and any robot that you want
to be that you want your project to be
deployed on you just select that forward
hit run and it will run on that
particular machine without even being
downloaded over there
alright so let me drag and drop
something some some kind of automation
all right so let's let's try to run an
automation on an a tableau server so
let's run a very simple automation that
I created earlier let's first drag and
drop a sequence so let me search for a
sequence it's here let's drag me to drag
drop it here right then let's ask for an
input let's enter let's say enter
details type your input here
and let's create a variable for your
input let's give this variable as an
output over here all right and then
let's create a message box let's drag
and drop it here let's specify that this
is your texture and you entered
alright let's specify the variable with
it which is input all right done
so it's complete let's save this project
and let's now publish it to the
orchestrator so for that I have to click
on publish and this will basically
publish the project to D this is this is
basically the repository where it's
being saved on and this is the package
name that is triple zero
triple zero zero one underscore ad Rekha
all right so we have come as
successfully did that let's click on OK
and now let's hope our package gets
listed over here alright so let's try to
add a process so it's a refresh in the
list alright so the list has been
refreshed so as you can see my project
is listed over here now so I click on
the project alright my environment is
area Rekha one
so let's hit on create now so this will
basically import the project that is
there on the repository to your
environment
alright so this is what I was telling
you so now your robot and your process
is inside the same environment
now the next step for you would be to
execute a job so let's do that let's go
again to our uipath Orchestrator and go
root jobs all right let's try to execute
a job now I have to select what job do I
want to win the cube so this is the
project that I have deployed all right
so these are servers where I can execute
my job so let's try to execute it on the
AWS o so I'll select AWS and I'll click
on start let's see what happens so if I
go to my uipath Orchestrator so as you
can see it automatically launched the
message box over here alright it will
ask for my input let me specify the
input say I am on AWS server
alright let me click ok and this is your
first
your text that you entered I am on AWS
server all right so I I created my
project on uipath studio which is on a
local machine
I upload it or it on the repository and
then I deployed that particular project
from my machine from my Orchestrator to
over there and you know it just gets
executed automatically so this is what I
wanted to do so congratulations on your
first project on Orchestrator now let's
try to do something more interesting
let's try to you know create one more
project here let's try to create a gmail
login all right so let's see how we can
do that
so for creating your gmail login guys
the thing that you have to do is first I
would want a sequence all right so let's
drag and drop the sequence over here
and then I want to open a browser right
let me specify the browser over here now
what browser do I want it don't want my
project to open let's select it as
Chrome and let it us open it in a
private window alright and what is the
URL that I want to go to I want to go to
gmail.com so this has to be inside
quotes alright once I'm on gmail.com I
want to click on the enter your email
address text right so I'll search for a
click activity I drag and drop it here
alright so now I have to indicate it
inside my browser so let me open it
inside the private window alright so
let's go to my UI path it is asking me
where do I have to click so it has to
click inside this particular text box
once it has clicked over there I want to
type something like it should type
search for an activity called type I
drag and drop it here radio type want to
type into I want to type into this text
box so let us specify the email
so we're here so what is the email
address that I want to log into it's
Ament at the rate at a record co all
right okay so once it has entered here
it again has to click on next so I can
drop an activity for that let's indicate
it inside the browser so this is where I
have to click once I have entered the
URL or once I've entered the email
address so let me in to say my email id
and click on next
this is next screen that I get now I
have to enter my password all right so
this is something very interesting guys
now what you can do is you can go to
your Orchestrator alright you can click
on assets and once you click on assets
you you can create your own variables
over here which have which you do not
have to mention in your projects alright
so for that I will click on plus right I
will give my asset name the type should
be credential and my asset will be gmail
underscore login right okay so the user
name is human ad rate at a record or
coke and the password is this alright
let's click on add awesome
so it has now you know created a gmail
login asset for me which basically is
the off tribe credential and has user
name this let me quickly check if this
is the current password for me I ought
to forget my passwords very frequently
all right so yeah it was the correct
password so I went to the it over here
and now all I have to do is I have to
come back to my project and over here I
have to go to the main screen and over
here there is an activity called
Orchestrator I'll go inside Orchestrator
I will find
and activity called assets coincide acid
and there is a thing called get
credentials all right so let me drag and
drop it over here awesome now it is
asking me the asset name so the asset
name is email address called login that
I mentioned in my Orchestrator alright
and the password where should the
password go the password should go
inside a variable so the variable should
be pass right so I have a specified
variable for my activity so let me
define was not saved
so it's pass all right all right now
this pass has to be of the variable type
password right so let us try to let me
quickly show you how you can you know
come around or you can see what type of
how do you identify which type of
variable type you have to define so
whenever you will enter a wrong type of
input it will show you this blue icon
right so it says value of type string
cannot be converted to a system dot
security dot secure string so this give
basically gives you a hint okay so this
is the kind of activity or this is the
kind of variable that you have to
declare so we'll go to variable type
we'll go to browser types
we'll go to system dot security dot
secure
string all right so it's just about
security don't secure string I'll click
on okay and now if I go here you can see
the blue icon has gone and has
successfully you know xyx s Phileas my
variable inside the password alright so
why am I doing this I am doing this
because I want to get the password
directly from the orchestrator rather
than going to my you know defining it
over here in the system okay so I have
done that now the next step is putting
this variable that is passed inside my
let me quickly open one more incognito
window so that I can show you where it
has to be entered alright so this is the
email so let me specify the email first
alright and this is where my password
will go right so I have to tell you
apart this is where you will be saving
the password so let me type type secure
text so because we are entering a
password we have a different activity
for entering the password inside my
password field which is type secure text
where do I want to enter that password I
have to indicate that inside this
particular activity so I indicate
element inside browser which is here
right and then I have to specify the
secure text over here which is pass all
right
this basically will enter your password
on that page and now you have to click
on login to successfully execute your
automation Hall for successfully logging
into your Gmail so let's select next
over here so this will basically make
you enter or this will basically log you
into Gmail so my activity is done guys I
have successfully activate created my
activity now so let us try to publish
now and let's see how it actually
happens alright everything seems fine
let's publish it so it will get
published in under the same time which
is this so it has been published with
this particular repository with this
name so now again again a very important
concept inside uipath Orchestrator which
is you know once you update your package
what do you have to do once you update
your project what should you do so once
you have made your project guys you
again have to go here inside processes
and go to this particular tab which
basically means view versions all right
I will click on View versions and over
here you can see that a new version has
just been published a few seconds ago so
I will use this particular version and
now my project or has been uploaded has
been updated inside my environment let's
try to run this process now on my AWS
machine alright so I'll select the
process which is this I'll select the
machine where I wanted to run on and
I'll click on start and let's hope for
the best
let's hope our project runs so I click
on start now so the command has been
sent so let's see let's wait for it ok
so basically over here we are getting a
different kind of window so I'd have to
update the URL that I've plated in my
page because this will not work so to do
that let us close this automation right
now and let me again go to my uipath
page let's see which if I type in
mail.google.com how does it actually
function so if I type in mail com ok so
again I'm getting this page so I have to
click on sign-in
all right so this is the page that I
have to go to all right so if I again
enter gmail.com here let's see if it he
direct me to this page okay so let me
enter this URL then so what I do is I
will go to this page that is gmail.com
and let me tell my automation that you
have to click on sign in alright so let
me copy this particular URL copy it and
let me go to my project so basically
before you know going here I have to
enter this particular URL and once it
goes to this particular URL let's see
how it looks on my browser alright so
this is the page now I have to click on
sign in first right so let us specify
that let us include one more click
activity and drag and drop it here and
indicate where do I have to click on so
I have to click on sign in so once I've
clicked on sign in I will reach this
page and everything seems the same after
that all right so let's update our
project which we have just modified so
let's save this project and click on
publish so the project has been updated
in the repository now we'll go to uipath
Orchestrator which is here and see where
you got faulted because it could not
execute successfully so now I go to
processes I'll update my version by
going to view versions and it basically
takes time to get reflected over here so
what I do is I click on refresh and it
takes some time let's wait for our
version to be reflected over in the
poetry
okay so my version is now updated over
here let's click on use and let's click
on yes so this will update my project
inside my environment let's again go to
jobs again let's try to execute it by
going to my project and executing it
inside the AWS machine let's click on
start ok ok there seems to be some
problem let me quickly refresh it
alright that's good jobs again
alright so the command has been sent now
let's go to my AWS server and see if
it's working fine now
alright so it has come here it has
clicked entered my email so it is now
not entering my password
all right the system seems to be working
a little slow all right so I guess that
is it
my automation completed successfully it
is asking me one more sign in because
you know it is being logged in into some
other page some other server which is in
a different region and that is why it is
asking me to verify myself but the but
the thing is we successfully executed
our project on a different machine that
was you know in a remote location we
executed from the orchestrator and we
were able to execute the project from
our end by you know publishing it onto
the repository and then executing it
from the orchestrator so with that guys
