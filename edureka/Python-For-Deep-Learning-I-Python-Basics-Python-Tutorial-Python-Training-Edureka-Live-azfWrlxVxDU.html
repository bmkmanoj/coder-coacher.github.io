I'm very excited to be here on Eddie
raker live with you guys
so today we'll be looking at Python code
basics which are required for
implementing deep learning models after
that there'll be one more session on
machine learning and then I'll be
telling you about tensorflow which is
nothing but a deep learning library so
there'll be total three sessions the
first session will be about Python code
basics which is happening right now then
I'll be talking about what is machine
learning and then finally in the third
session I'll introduce a tensorflow
which is nothing but a deep learning
library present in Python now before I
begin guys you can throw all your doubts
in the comment section
me and my team will try to answer those
as soon as possible so let's begin so
here we'll begin by understanding the
use case that we'll implement in this
session after that I'll be discussing
the fundamentals required to implement
it so people who already know Python can
be a bit patient and wait till the end
and people who are not familiar with the
basics of Python and just follow me
through the session so let's begin and
understand the session understand the
use case that we have so here our use
case is about analyzing the WHI data of
life expectancy for all the countries
from 2019 60 to 2012 but the question is
why are we doing it so let's understand
the importance of this use case so by
analyzing the pattern in life expectancy
we can understand how poor countries
with low life expectancy is catching up
with rich countries over the span of
1960 to 2012 so basically it helps us in
understanding the extent of health
equality after that we can use this
knowledge to understand a lot about
health social and economic condition of
these countries now that we know the
importance of this use case we should
focus on how to implement it so for
implementation we'll quickly go through
Python code basics but first let us
understand what is Python so python is
an object-oriented high-level
programming language with some
procedural concepts as well and trust me
guys unlike Java and C++ the syntax of
Python is very very easy it is very easy
to learn and it comes with wide
idea of application you can use Python
for testing you can use Python for
automation you can use Python for
machine learning for deep learning so
there are wide varieties of application
and it is there in demand right now
alright so let us go ahead and
understand the code basics of Python so
we'll begin by variables so variables
are nothing but reserved memory location
to store values what does this mean this
means that when you create a variable
you reserve some space in memory and let
me tell you guys unlike Java and C++
here you don't need to specify the data
type of your variable that means it is
basically a loosely tight lose-lose-lose
retype a language right you don't need
to specify the data type to which that
particular variable belongs to next up
we'll see what are various theater types
available in Python so python supports
various data types these data types
defines the operations possible on the
variables and the storage method
so there are numeric data types list
Topol string sets and dictionary I'll
discuss each of these data types so for
that I'll open my pycharm first alright
so we'll start with numeric data type so
what has numeric data type as a name
tells basically numbers it is there are
integer numbers there are float numbers
and complex number we know what are
integer number whole numbers which
actually include negative values as well
float values are nothing but any
rational number which can be represented
in P by Q for now when I talk about
complex numbers they have two components
one is real another is imaginary so in
Python you can perform typecasting that
is you can convert an integer value to a
float value and vice versa but you
cannot convert a complex value to a
float value or an integer value neither
you can convert a float or an integer to
a complex value all right so let us go
ahead and I'll show you that so I'm
going to define a variable a and I'll
store a value 10 in it then I'm going to
define one more variable and I'm going
to store a float value inside it alright
so now what I'm going to do I'm going to
convert the integer data type into float
data type so I just need to type F float
and the integer value which is stored in
my variable
let us go ahead and execute this so you
can see that the integer value was 10
but we have converted that to a float
value which is equal to 10 point O now
similarly you can do that and the other
way as well you can convert a float
value to an integer value as well so let
me just show you I'll keep it as B which
is nothing but a variable that contains
my float value let us go ahead and run
this now say up instead of 10 point o 1
we have got 10 which is nothing but an
integer value now this is all about
numeric data type guys next up we are
going to discuss what are list so you
can consider the list as our agency
button list you can store elements of
different types but in arrays all the
elements should be of the same type so
if you are familiar with any other
programming language you must have heard
about Harris so in a particular array
you can store the elements of one single
data type but when I talk about lists
unless you can store multiple data types
you can store strings you can store
numbers you can store different data
types so I'll quickly just create a list
for you and I'll show you how you can do
that so just type the name of your list
then the elements that you're going to
define just put that inside the square
braces alright so I'm just going to
create a student list and I'm gonna put
in some dummy names here
raus Emily Joey so all the people who
like watching friends you can actually
relate to these names right so I'll just
quickly go ahead and print this student
list so you can see that the list has
been printed now there are various
operations that you can perform with
this list you can find out the length of
this list you can find out or you can
perform a slicing over here you can find
out the index value of a particular
element so let me show you how you can
do that first I'll show you how you can
print the length of your string just
type in length and the name of your
string name of your list I'm sorry just
go ahead and execute it so yup it has
three elements as you can see is obvious
as you can see in the output as well
next up you can perform slice
well let me show you how you can do that
so I like like any other programming
language indexing in Python also starts
from zero so this will be my zeroth
element this will be our first element
and this will be my second element so if
I want only loss and Emily to be printed
what I can do is I'll just type in her
friend students and then the range of
the index so I'm gonna start from zero
ten decks and I want to include the
first index but I don't want to include
the second index so he'll go it'll 0 it
will start from zero till till the
second index so Joey won't be printed
here only Ross and Emily let us go ahead
and execute this so yep you can see that
Ross and Emily has been printed now if I
want only one single element to be
printed from my list I can just go ahead
and do that so if I want only joy to be
printed I'll just type in here the index
value of Joey I'll go ahead and execute
this yup you can see that it has
appeared now I can even reverse this
particular list let me show you how you
can do that so I'll just type in here
colon colon minus 1 I'm going to reverse
the indexing so it actually starts from
0 1 &amp;amp; 2 right so when I go in the
reverse order little salt 4 minus 1
minus 2 and minus 3 so I'll just go
ahead and execute this and yep at you as
you can see that my list has been
reversed so this is all about less guys
next up we are going to discuss tuples
so a tuple is a sequence of immutable
Python objects when I say immutable what
it means is I cannot make any changes to
my tuple once I have defined it
unlike lists which are mutable I can add
an element I can you know delete an
element in a list but when I talk about
topple I can't do that once I've defined
a tuple I cannot make any changes to it
and that is one major difference between
a list and a topic apart from that when
I talk about syntax also in a topple you
need to enclose your elements within the
parentheses not these square braces all
right so this has now become a student
topple for me and you can perform all
the operations that you can that you
have seen in list the same operations
you can perform with tuples the only
difference is you cannot add an element
and either you can delete an element
from a topic now there is an obvious
question that must be therein or your
mind is why
using tuples when we have lists so
tuples are faster than list if you're
defining a constant set of values and
all you are ever going to do with that
is I trade through it that's when you
can use Topol instead of less because it
is faster than lists all right so yep
this is all about tuples next up we are
going to discuss sets so what is a set a
set is an unordered collection of items
and every item in a set is unique now
let me just define a set for you I just
named it as set equal to and the syntax
is I need to enclose the elements within
the curly braces so I'll just put in
some numbers here 1 2 and 3 now let us
go ahead and put in this set so yep it
has appeared here now what I'll do I'll
repeat 3 twice and I'm going to execute
it and we'll see what happens
so we're here also you can see that 3
has appeared only once although in my
set it is there twice so as I told you
earlier as well set is nothing but an
unordered collection of a unique item so
every item in your set should be unique
now there are various operations that
you can perform it's said you can
perform same at symmetric difference you
can perform an intersection you can
perform a union there are lower for lot
of operations that you can perform with
set and I've shown all these operation
in my Python programming video so you
can go through it next up we are going
to discuss dictionary so let me explain
you what exactly are dictionaries now
I'm guessing all of you must have heard
about a Zarkon for those of you who
don't know what it is it is nothing but
a unique ID which has been given to all
Indian citizens so for every other
number there is a name and few other
details attached now you could consider
this other number as a key and the
person's detail has a value attached to
that key and that is what dictionary is
dictionary basically contains key value
pairs so they'll be a key and to that
key there'll be a value attached now let
me create a dictionary for you so I'm
just going to type in here date equal to
and like set only I need to enclose all
my elements within a curly braces so my
first key will be name
just gonna type my name here and my
second key will be age and I'm gonna
type in here my age now let's go ahead
and print this dictionary so you have as
you can see that dictionary has appeared
now so these are all the data types
available in Python next up we are going
to focus on operator so for that I'll
open my slides once more so python comes
with these very operators or a
comparison operator is identity logical
automatic assignment bitwise membership
so for this session I'll only focus on
arithmetic operator comparison operator
and assignment operator although I've
discussed all these operators in detail
in the Python programming video so you
can go through it now what I'm going to
do I'm going to open my Python once
again and I'll explain it to you
automatic and as well as assignment and
comparison operators so arithmetic
operators is basically used to perform
all the automatic operations it can be
addition subtraction multiplication
division modulus and exponent alright so
what I've done here I've defined three
variables a b and c with values 21 10
and 0 respectively now over here I'm
first performing addition I'm just
adding two values a and B and I'm
storing it in in variable C and
similarly I am performing subtraction
multiplication division calculating the
remainder as well and then finally
exponent value so I can just go ahead
and execute this quickly for you so
these are all the values 31 comes after
addition then subtraction multiplication
division remainder an exponent next up
we are going to discuss the comparison
operators so these comparison operators
are used to compare the values on either
sides of them and decide the relation
among them so it can be equal to it can
be not equal to all those kind of stuff
so again over here as well I have
defined a three variables a B and C with
values 21 10 and 0 respectively now over
here I'm using conditional statements a
phenyls although you'll understand this
conditional statement later in the
session but over here I'll just give you
a brief introduction a small
introduction of
what it is so when I write if and the
condition here says that a should be
equal to equal to B then only the
subsequent statement will be executed so
here it is a print statement which says
that a is equal to B and when this is
not the case I mean when the condition
is not true
then the else statement will be executed
similarly this actually shows that a is
not equal to B they show that is less
than B this is for is greater than B
less than equal to greater than equal to
all right so I'll just go ahead and
quickly show you how the output looks
like so this is the output guys next up
we are going to discuss assignment
operator so an assignment operator is
the operator used to assign a new value
to a variable let me explain it with an
example so for assignment so for
assignment operators as well we have
taken our three variables a B and C with
values 21 10 and 0 respectively so we
have initialized this C with the
addition of a and B with the addition of
a NP and we are printing that particular
value after that what we are doing we
are just typing in as C plus equal to a
which means that C is equal to C plus a
so basically after adding C and a the
value will be stored in C similarly
after multiplying C and a the value will
be stored in C same goes for division
modulus and exponent as well just go
ahead and quickly run this for you so
these are all the values that comes
after addition subtraction
multiplication division modulus exponet
cetera et cetera so these are all the
three these are the three operators that
I'll actually discuss today that I've
actually discussed if you want to know
more about these operators you can go to
python programming video i'm saying this
again and again so it's a very detailed
video you can you can understand all the
way different types of operators that
are there in Python all right so I'll
again open my slides now we are going to
understand conditional statements so
conditional statements are used to
execute a statement or a group of
statements when some condition is true
and in Python there are namely three
types of conditional statement if Elif
in else now let me explain to you with
the flowchart so the control will first
check whether the if condition is true
or not whether if
X is less than Y so when this is true
it'll execute statement underscore a and
then it is false it will check the L if
condition whether X is greater than Y or
not and when this is true it will
execute statement underscored P but then
even this is false it will go and check
the else condition and then after that
it will execute statement underscore C
so I'll quickly open my PI charm and
I'll show you that so over here I have
two variables x and y and in X I have
assigned value 11 and why I have value
10 so the first if statement says that
if X is less than Y print X is less than
Y L if X is greater than Y print X is
greater than bi and else you don't need
to specify any condition here it will
take the default condition which is X is
equal to Y all right so we know that
actually X is greater than Y so it
should print X is greater than Y let us
go ahead and execute this and we'll see
what happens so X is definitely greater
than 1
now what if I make Y greater than X then
it should print X is less than Y and yup
it does and I can make it equal and it
will execute the else statement and yep
x and y are equal so this is all about
conditional statement guys and let me
open my slides once for and we'll see
what is next now we are going to
understand what our loops so Alex I'll
first explain why we need loops now in
general statements are executed
sequentially the first statement in the
function is executed first followed by
the second and so on right this is a
general scenario but there might be
situation when you need to execute a
block of code several number of times so
basically a loop allows you to execute a
statement or a group of statement
multiple times so I'll explain it with
the flowchart so the condition so the
control will first start and we'll check
the condition here so the loop condition
this condition is true then we'll go
ahead and execute the conditional code
the code which is written inside the
loop then again it will check the
condition if it is again true then again
it will execute the conditional code and
this process will keep on repeating
until your condition becomes false and
the moment it becomes fall the control
will come out of the loop so you can
actually create an infant
Lupe's we're now in Python we have a
three types of loop while four and
nested and explain each of these for
that I'll open my pie charm so a while
loop is basically excuse me so in a
while loop first the condition is
checked and if it's true control will
move inside the loop and executes the
statement inside the loop until the
condition becomes four but the question
is when we use this loop so we use this
loop when we are not sure how many times
we need to execute a group of statements
or you can say that when we are unsure
about the number of iterations all right
so let me explain you this with an
example so over here we have define a
variable count and we have initialized
value 0 to it after that I'm using the
while loop and inside that value of the
condition says that count should always
be less than 10 so the moment my count
becomes greater than 10 it will come out
of the loop and it'll print goodbye but
when it is less than 10 it will enter
the loop it will print that particular
count value then it will increment the
count value by 1 save it in the count
variable again and then again it will
check the loop condition whether it is
still less than 10 or not if it is still
less than 10 it'll it will print the
count value and the moment it becomes
greater than 10 or equal to 10 it will
come out of the loop and ill print
goodbye so let us see if that happens or
not so up you can see that 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 has been printed and since our
condition says that count should be less
than 10 so that's why it came out of the
loop after 9 and it has printed goodbye
for us now we are going to understand
for you so like the while loop the for
loop also allows a code block to be
repeated certain number of times only
differences in for loop we know the
amount of iterations required and like
while loop where hydration depends on
the condition right so I've taken an
example of students again here Emily
Ross enjoy and I'm I'm using this list
so I'll I trade through this list only
so I'm typing here for index index again
index starts from 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 in range a
length of my students list
print the student index that means if my
index value I'll start from zero and it
is within the range of my list then what
will happen it will print the value that
is associated with index zero in my list
student again it will go it will take
second index but that is that'll be in
the next value one I can't check whether
it is in the range of the student list
and if it is then it will print the
value associated with index value one
and similarly for two ways well let us
go ahead and execute this so yep Emily
Ross enjoy he has appeared here so this
is all for loop guys now when I talk
about nested loops nested loops are
nothing but using a loop inside a loop
so you can use a while loop inside of
for loop of for loop inside a while loop
a for loop inside a for loop and a while
loop inside of a loop that is nothing
but your nested loop and yeah nested
loops and I have explained nested loop
as well in my Python programming video
now we are going to discuss what are the
various functions so what are functions
basically so for that I'll again open my
slides so functions are a convenient way
to divide your code into useful blocks
and this allows us to order our code
make it more readable and reuse it so
let me explain you with an example
suppose in my code I need to add two
values multiple times so I have to write
that logic to add two values how much
ever time I want to I want it there to
be in my code but an easier way will be
I make a function that adds two value
and then it will return the value that
comes after adding those values alright
so I'll make a function like that
that'll add two values and then whenever
why I want to add two values in my code
I can just call that function feed in
the values of feed in the values those
two that function and then it will
return the value that comes after adding
those two values all right so I'm going
to create the same function in our
Python so the syntax here is def name of
your function and then parameters given
a colon and then just
a plus B right so now this is a function
that will add two values now what I need
to do is I need to feed in two values so
I create a variable C and I'll just call
this odd function and feed in values to
this odd function so I'm going to feed
in 10 and 20 finally go ahead and print
C and you will see that the values have
been added and we have got the output as
30
all right fine guys so I'll go back to
my slides once again and we'll see what
is next now before we talk about before
we actually implement the deep learning
models using tensor flow we need to
understand a lot of Python libraries
namely our three most important
libraries I can think of right now so
there are there are three libraries
which are very important when you are
executing your deep learning models with
tensor flow the first is numpy then
pandas then matplotlib so I'll discuss
each of these libraries one by one but
before I discuss that let me tell you I
have a detailed tutorial video on numpy
pandas and matplotlib so you could go
through that anytime you want if you
have any doubts so what is numpy numpy
is the fundamental package for
scientific computing which python it
contains a powerful n dimensional array
object and it is very useful for linear
algebra Fourier transform and a random
number capabilities now I have taken an
example of a multi-dimensional array
here which has a four rows and it has
three columns alright and again like
other programming languages indexing
starts from zero so when I'm referring
to a zero zero that means this
particular value which is one so always
when you are providing an index value
you need to provide the index value of
your row first and then you need to
provide your index value of column so
when I write 8 2 comma 2 it is actually
pointing towards this particular value
which is 10 all right so let me just
quickly open my pycharm and I'll show
you how to create an umpire array and
various operations that you can perform
with numpy so before I explain numpy
before I execute the before I actually
practically show you how to create an
umpire a and a varies
operations at number let me tell you
guys a lot of people ask this question
why do I'll be using the umpire when we
have lists now let me tell you guys
numpy is very better than list and what
fact on what terms I'm saying that is
because it occupies less memory it is
faster than lists and it is more
convenient than lists I have actually
practically proven these three points in
my numpy tutorial video so you can go
through that now I'll just take this
convenient factor here and I'll compare
less than umpire so when I actually
write list l1 plus list l2 that will
give me a list which would be
combination of both lists so it will
concatenate both the lists but instead
in numpy array if I have two Nampa
arrays n1 and n2 and I type in n1 plus
n2 so it will give me the values that
comes after adding both the numpy RS so
that way it is convenient similarly it
is faster and occupies less memory so
you can go through that video and where
I've proven it practically why it is
that alright so let me first comment
these lines so that I can show you how
to first create an umpire and then we
will see the various operations that you
can perform with it
alrighty then fine the first thing we
need to do is import the numpy mode you
or the numpy library as NP and TNS
whatever you want I'll just keep it as
NP so import numpy as NP now if you want
to install any module through Python
what you can do is go to file click on
settings project interpreter click on +
and type the name of the module that you
want to install say if you wanna install
a lamp I just click on the pile scene
dump I hear it click on install package
and it'll be done for you alright so
I've already installed numpy so I don't
need to do it so important umpires numpy
after that I'm going to create an umpire
array and the values have to be there in
my lamp IRA are these values and then I
have defined the data type of these
values which will be float 64 bits now
over here if you can notice that we have
three rows and we have two columns so
let me just show you by running this so
yep we have three rows and we have two
columns now what I can do is I can
actually convert this three rows two
columns to two rows and three columns
for that I just need to
all this Ricci the reshape function that
I've written him and the the value that
you want off basically how you want to
reshape it so I want only two rows and I
want three columns instead of three rows
into columns let us see if that happens
or not so this is our original umpire
and this is an umpire if we get after
reshaping it so it has two rows and
three columns
perfect guys now what I can do is I can
actually calculate the minimum and
maximum value from my numpy array as
well so my minimum value is definitely
one and my maximum value is four which
has appeared here right next up we can
actually perform the sum of all the
columns as well as rows so when I write
access zero it represents columns and
when I write axis one it represent rows
so when I add so when I add columns the
value that should be printed will be 1
plus 1 and plus 3 which will be 5 then 3
plus 2 plus 4 which will be 9 and when I
add rows it should print 2 plus 1 3 plus
1 and 4 plus 3 let us see if that
happens or not so yep we have got the
values that come after adding the
columns 5 and 9 and after adding the
rows we have got 3 4 &amp;amp; 7 then what I'm
going to do I am going to calculate now
the square root and let me show you how
you can do that just call in this sqr d
function and it will display the square
root of all the elements in the lump IRA
as you can see it over here that I'm
highlighting right now so square root of
1 is 1 2 is 1 point 4 1 4 then 1 is 1
again square root of 3 is 1.73 similarly
square root of 3 is 1.73 square root of
4 is 2
all right now I can even find out the
size of my lump IRA as well as its shape
so when I talk about size basically
talks about the number of elements
present in your lump IRA so when I
execute this the size of my entire a is
6 that means worth the total six
elements of Mille ampere in the shape is
three rows and two columns now comes
another part where I am going to define
a numpy array so basically what I want I
want a particular shape and that shape
should be filled with zeros and it
should be an umpire area so the shape
here that I have defined as 3 comma 4
which means 3 rows and 4 columns and all
of these rows
golems should be filled with zeroes let
us see if that happens or not so yep you
can see that we have a four columns and
3 rows all are filled with zeros now I
can even fill it with ones as well so
for that I just need to type in here
once go ahead and execute this and yep
you can see that all ones have appeared
here all right the final thing that I'm
going to explain here is line space so
basically if I have say a range or for
example 1 to 5 and I want suppose 10
values to be printed between 1 and 5 so
I just need to write in the range first
1 to 5 then how many values between that
range that's all so it'll print 10
values between 1 to 5 so let us see if
that happens or not yep it has printed
10 values and if you don't believe me
you start counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and
10 all right guys so done with numpy
I'll open my slides once more now
matplotlib is basically used for
visualization so any sort of graph that
you can think of path plot histograms
scatter plot pie chart everything that
anything that you can think of any sort
of graph you can think of you can
execute that to the help of mark or flip
so I'll explain this when I'm talking
about the use case implementation part
all right and there's again a separate
tutorial video and math module 8 so you
can go through it now we are going to
discuss pandas so basically the pandas
module uses objects to allow for data
analysis at a very high performance rate
in comparison to typical Python
procedures and with pandas we can easily
read and write from and to a CSV file or
even theta basis and from there we can
manipulate the data by columns create
new columns and even pace the new
columns another column data so again I
have a separate tutorial videos and
panels you can go through it
so for now I'll open my pycharm so first
thing you need to do is import pandas as
PDP LPN whatever you want to write I'll
just keep it as speedy and I've defined
a dictionary here the neighbors are
is wave under school starts so it has
various starts about our website say
number of days 1 2 3 4 5 6 number of
visitors so visitors in the fall on the
first day were 43 on the second day were
34 similarly on the sixth day were 76
now there is one more key which is
bounce rate so bounce rate is basically
few people who actually go to a website
and suddenly they realize that this is
not what they're looking for so they
directly move out our website right so
they will directly leave the website so
that is nothing but bounce rate so this
is a dictionary all right and what I
will do I convert this dictionary to a
panda's data frame how I can do that
just typing in PD and calling in the
data frame of function and over there
I'll just feed in the value of this
dictionary so let me just comment these
lines right and now I'm going to execute
it sorry I just forgot to print this
data frame yep so yeah now you can see
the difference between the two so over
here we have a over a way of define a
dictionary but here we are we have
created a pollinator frame using our
dictionary now over here if you notice
these are nothing but index values 0 1 2
3 4 and 5 now as far as you can change
this index value you can remove this
index value if you want suppose any of
the columns become your index and also
our suppose if I were on my day to
become high and exited and also happen
so there are white like multiple
operations are leaving for homes Farnaz
so you can go through the palace rural
explain properly how you can reform
those operations so now I'll stick to
very basic operations
all right so what if I only want the
voice 5 called first five rows of my
data frame to be printed so the pod I'm
just going to use his head function and
the moment I execute it you can see that
only 0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 husband did it not 5
but of course I have I want only five
rows to be printed and hot to the power
5 now similarly if I wanna say I wanna
print the last five values I just need
to type in the head or tail so you can
see that instead of 0 all the values
have been printed now they might in a
situation where only one is starting
through values all right orienting to
values so I just need to define that I
will write that basically so this
basically one blue it will actually
print the last two values of my days
offering so let us see if that happens
or not set up only the last values for
and fight similarly I can make this as
head and it'll print he starting two
values for me yup is here and one has
been printed so this is all about power
locks I'll go back to my slides once for
so now is the correct time to emblem in
the use hey that I was talking about in
the beginning so the Frog are again I'll
open my rom so I've already written the
code in order to execute the UCAS over
here what I'm doing is first of all I'm
importing important libraries importing
foreign Osborne a number I and even
importing style from our trip then I'm
using ggplot after that earlier in the
CSV file through policy frame this is
how you can do through Panos this is how
you can do that so clearly taught early
underscore see Ashley and just leave the
path to your dataset
alright I after giving the power this
use call basically it is that I only
want to use these three columns country
or area here and value
you
sorry I saw disturbance so I'll again
actually near the skirt as hard from
beginning over here for usually ways the
first step is to import the libraries
are required with a limp or power loss
for reading the dataset then you're
going to import path clip we will report
motley or visualization then we are
going to import numpy as nd for you know
multi-dimensional arrays and we also
import Stein from the matplotlib
library and what I am going to do is I'm
going to leave the CSV file and for that
I'd need Luis this write clearly dot
legal analyst for CAC and within the
parentheses just give the path to your
dataset
alright just give the path to your data
set and once you are done with that I
specified the columns that I'm going to
use from that data set so I'm not going
to use all the columns I'm just going to
use country or area then here and value
so these three columns I am going to use
you
fine sir once I'm done with that what I
need to do is I am defining a numpy
array and in that numpy array what I am
doing is I am trying to get all the
unique countries all the unique
countries from my dataset so my data set
has a lot of countries and over there
what happens is a country has been
repeated say 52 times because from 1960
2012 it is calculated there's one more
column which tells about the life
expectancy of these countries from 1960
to 2012 so every country has been
repeated 52 times but I want to create
an umpire array which has only the
unique countries in my data set right
once I've done with that I am creating a
data frame DF 2 which will be now which
will actually include the country which
has index value 0 in Milan pile so I
know it is Afghanistan because R is the
first country and similarly I'm going to
define one more data frame DF 3 which
will have the first country which will
of the country which has the first index
in my lump IRA similarly I have done
that for a few of the countries and yeah
and after that what I have done I have
just used the ple door plot function and
over there in my DF 2 data frame - I
just want the ear value and I want the
life expectancy value and after that
this is basically it tells a color of my
line so it will be red even if you don't
specify it it doesn't matter all right
it will automatically take the unique
color and linewidth also you don't need
to specify it I'm just showing you it's
just for the demonstration purpose I
have done it here alright similarly I
have done with DF 3 as well I only want
the ear and value and a color you can
you don't need to do it you can just
leave it lying it's just close the
parentheses after your value all right
once you are done with that I have
defined a legend so basically this
legend will describe two of which line a
country belong to right which color line
a country belong to once I am done with
that I am going to use gridlines so it
is basically to add a bit of style to my
graph you can just skip that part if you
want to all right and then I am use I am
giving a title to my plot which is
whu-oh and I'm defining why label Alex
labels my Y label will be life
expectancy and X label will be here and
finally show the plot so let us go ahead
and HD
you this so yeah this is how our plot
looks like guys so over here we can see
that there are few countries in which
the life expectancy was pretty decent in
1960 as well and they have not improved
as you know they have not improved
drastically there's there's no drastic
change in their life expectancy but
there are other countries if you seek
Cambodia here so in Cambodia in 1977
their life expectancy was around 20
because of political condition and we
held issues with the people out there so
because of multiple reasons but from
there they have picked up and their life
expectancy is somewhere around 70 above
70 actually so this is a drastic change
guys similarly you can see for
Afghanistan is well we understand their
life expectancy was around 30 in 1960
and you can see how well it has how how
how much they have improved right so
this is how you can plot the life
expectancy versus the ear plot all right
let me just give you a quick let me just
give you a quick recap of what all
things or we have discussed in law for
that I will open my slides once for all
right so we started with the use case we
understood what we are going to
implement in today's session after that
we understood what exactly is Python and
we saw various code basics we started
with variables and data types
operators condition statement loops
functions all those things then we saw
how to actually implement the use case
for that we use three libraries pandas
Marcotte lib &amp;amp; numpad and I've given you
a small introduction on all of these
three libraries
now guys that is it for today's session
so what I'll do I'll just quickly open
the ADA rakers course landing page for
Python and deep learning alright so this
is basically a Python certification
training so if you want to enroll for
live online instructor-led training with
24/7 support and lifetime access you can
enroll here it will teach you all the
basics of python and various libraries
as well like pandas numpy all those
things will be covered in detail in a
Python certification training and if
you're a bit comfortable with Python you
can go for deep learning with tensorflow
as well and over here also if you want
to take it directly you can do that
because we provide a complimentary
self-paced course for Python essentials
for tensorflow all right and again all
the classes here are live online
instructor-led training and you'll get
24/7 support as well as you will
actually get the lifetime access as well
alright and I let me show you the
playlist for deep learning video so this
is the playlist or where you can find
all the deep learning videos or pyloric
available on youtube similarly we have a
playlist for Python tutorial videos as
well alright and the after that we I'm
going to show you a blog series on deep
learning so it will include some five
six blocks so you can just go through
those blocks and let me just show you
the Bell button so basically you need to
first subscribe to our Channel and click
on this Bell button so that you'll be
notified if we so that you'll be
notified if anything is uploaded on
YouTube or any notification by the
channel you'll be notified about it
alright thank you guys for attending
today's session and the next session
will be on what machine learning with
Python so in the meantime you can go
through the videos of numpy panda's
mascot leg and python programming so the
link will be shared in the comment
section so just go through all these
videos before you attend the next live
session on machine learning thank you
and the happy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
