webinar on the topic refactoring react
components from es 5 to ESX I am
repulsion so a brief introduction about
mine I have seven years of experience I
have experience in SharePoint office 365
and Microsoft Azure
I have also experienced in latest
client-side JavaScript libraries like
react and angularjs so let's get started
so the agenda of this particular webinar
is as follows first we'll talk about to
the introduction of react components
then we talk about the component is
structure using es 5 class which is the
previous version of the latest class
library that is es6 we'll see what are
the various pros and cons of the es 5
class along with the core examples with
a demo then we'll talk about the
benefits of es 6 class that is a new
version of the ECMAScript version we'll
also talk about the advantages of es 6
class and then you will see a demo of
es6 restructuring using a code example
and how we can refactor an es 5 class to
a es 6 class and finally we will see a
very basic application of tic-tac-toe
program so before getting started I am
assuming that all the participants were
all the viewers of this particular
webinar are having a basic knowledge of
react.js
since this is an advanced topic of react
that's why I'm assuming that all the
concepts related to react for example
what is component what is props what are
states life cycle events etc are known
but still continue with the introduction
of react components are very basic
components to the react so everything in
react is a component so components lets
you split the UI into independent and
reusable pieces and we can think about
each piece in isolation so each piece or
each component in react works and
isolations all together so conceptually
components are like JavaScript function
they accept arbitrary inputs and those
inputs are called troughs in react and
the return
react elements describing what should
appear on the screen so each component
basically it generates our HTML which is
rendered by the
Tom and Tom here is document object
model now what are the benefits of using
company components enables the user with
a modular approach where small pieces of
code are isolated which enhance the
reusability and the readability of the
code
also while refreshing the page only the
components English the changes have been
awkward Cutts updated which is a concept
of virtual Tom which has been introduced
in react.js so let's talk a little more
about the components and props so as I
said components lets you split the UI
into independent and reusable pieces
they accept the arbitrary inputs which
are called props now there are two types
of components well is a functional
component and the other is the class
component the functional component is
the one where the use function and the
class component is one where we use
classes so as you can see is an example
of the functional component where we are
declaring a function called welcome and
it is taking the input parameters which
are called props the likewise we have a
class component so the class component
it extends reactor component which is a
feature of es6 class which we are going
to see and original feature also which
are going to see and discuss later
now how we render a component so when
react sees an element representing a
user-defined component it passes the j6
attributes to this component in terms of
props so first of all what we do when we
talk about the component we call react
Dom dot render method with the welcome
name equal to here you can see people so
the name of the function is welcome
react calls this vital component with
name ripple as the property or the props
this welcome components reacts hello
ripple which is written over here hello
and the props dot name so this name
props dot name and the component
attribute which is name shall match and
finally react Dom efficiently updates
the gown and react on when I talking
about it is the virtual Dom which
efficiently updates the Dom to match the
hello people or the h1 tag now let's see
the very basic hello world example so
before going into any the coding part or
the practical scenarios I always use
just J's bin this J spinning is nothing
else you can google it if there is
nothing but a collaborative JavaScript
debugging app you can say it is a
collaborative app develop
debugging tool so going to this Jail
speed if you go to this chase thing you
can have the html/css
reactors where you can write the react
code you can see the output now I will
start with the basic HTML two-stage tml
where I've included the react like the
required react libraries and I have a
div element where I will be displaying
the output and this div element is
having a IDs route now let's talk about
the very basic code example of react is
it is saying where hello message we have
dot create class this is again a es5
class since we are talking about in this
webinar we've had bring from es 5 to es6
so let's first understand the es5 code
examples which we can refactor to the
es6 examples so here it is saying a
function render render is the required
function which renders the output on the
screen so it is returning
hello this tour drops short message and
in the react dom dot render it takes 2
arguments 1st argument is your component
and the other argument is the place
where you want to display the output so
my component name is here hello message
which is this hello messages message
equal to world hello I've already
returned as hard-coded so in the output
it is printing as hello world so this is
a very basic example of using a
component in react chips now let us go
further now component is structure in
Facebook as we all know that Facebook
and other applications are using react
other applications if I'm talking about
these are like Instagram what super
Yahoo all these applications nowadays
are using react after 2009 in 2011 it
came as open source project and further
in 2013 into the open source project the
reactors which is a facebook library now
in the Facebook we have search for
notifications for at post chat window
these are the multiple features which
work on react in Facebook now component
is structure using es 5 CENTAC what
happens in es5 so we in es5 we have
react on create class and a method
called get initial state these two are
combined as functions and component is
rendered so in es5 we use react or
create class method to define the react
components just like we saw the example
before we declared a simple hello
message component using the react or
create class
where keyword is used to declare
variable whose values can be manipulated
this is very important point to note
here that in es5 we are using fair which
works as a global declaration of the
variable and then third one is the
method used to define the initial state
values so we can get the initial state
in get initial state method now here at
one point which i want to make so when
writing code and react should we use
react or create class which is es5
specification or the es6 class syntax or
maybe neither react can be written
perfectly well in es5 or es6 so the
whole agenda of this webinar is not
compelling you to work only with es6 you
can very well work with es5 classes as
well it is just like two ways to do the
same thing so react traditionally
provided you can say that traditional
programming of react is we had create
class method to create the component
classes and had released a small Celtic
sugar update to allow for better use
with es6 modules and now it is extending
to react dot create component which
extends the component class instead of
calling the create class itself
now each component in es5 class as we
saw in the demo each component has a
render function which tells the Dom what
needs to be displayed on the screen now
let's talk about the pros and cons of
es5 centex now what are the pros of es 5
syntax it has a browser support which is
a huge plus since es6 it's very new many
browsers not supporting as of now the es
xcode explicit binding of this keyword
is not needed in es6 class we have
explicit bounding of this which is
required and the latest version of react
which is 16 point oh and before 15 point
5 so explicit binding is not required no
need to use any transpiler like table
babel is just like a transpiler and you
can say javascript compiler so there is
no need now what are the points we have
to use commas to separate methods within
the classes so there is a provision or
there is a way where you can have
multiple functions or methods which
needs to be separated by comma which we
will see in one of the ten the one of
the most important cons with related to
es 5 class i will say that the code is
very lengthy it affects the readability
inability of the code in react.js when
we talk about es5 classes that also
we'll see in one of the demo very
quickly now let's talk about the demo
now now we are going to play the
application okay
I show you how we can build an
application using es 5 + es 6 class what
are the various differences how we can
refactor it but what we are going to do
in this demo just a quick overview of
that in the demo example we are going to
create three buttons one is the single
click button which on a single clip will
increase the counter let's say from 0 0
to 1 1 to 2 2 to 3 and so on
we will have another button which is the
double click button it will increase the
counter on double click of the mouse and
we will have finally the third button a
Homer button which will just increase or
increment the counter by opening of the
mouse so these buttons will increment
the counter when a particular mouse
gesture or event is made and then the
count will be displayed in the output
screen we will also demonstrate the use
of props to display a message on the
screen so let us talk about that how we
can create the react components using
es5 code examples these are the various
code snippets in the PPT which are
included and after this I will show you
the live demo that how we can use this
so first of all what we are doing so
here what we are doing we are creating a
component class in react using Create
class method this is the es5 syntax
where button equal to react dot create
class we are creating a component using
Create class method then we are using
very key word is used to declare the
variables since this is a ver keyword we
are using it pretty clear the variables
here the state variables the state
variables are getting initialized in the
gate initial state method and since you
can see if it is a function or a method
there needs to be a comma separated into
the function it is used to validate the
prop types there is a comma which is
added to and of the each function now
continuing to this we have another
function which is called ink recount
this is a function to increment the
counter and at last we have a render
function now these two functions again
separated by a comma over here each
component in react has a render function
which returns the HTML to the top I
repeat each component each component
means every component whatever
components you are declaring in your
reactors code it
needs to have a render function minimum
of one function should be there and all
the other functions needs to be
separated by comma then this keyword is
used to refer to the props value as you
can see over here if I have a props
value which I'm passing to a component
then this keyword is used to refer to
that prop value so this store props dot
name will be used to refer to the props
value now again continuing to this code
we have three components we create more
component classes this D button is for
the double click of the button react or
create class if I go to the previous
slides if you see here this is a button
which will show the increment counter on
a single click
now this is again a component the second
component we have got create class D
button which will show the increment
counter on the double click of the
button again it has an increment counter
it has another event called on double
click so it says button on double click
we define our increment function over
here inside each button component and
finally we have one more component for
the holding of the button so as the
number of components increase as you can
see as I said the code is getting
lengthy in es5 so as the number of
components are increasing in es5 code it
is very difficult from a readability and
maintainability standpoint to maintain
the es5 code because the complexity in
es5 code or the class is getting
increased so for the whole button same
hour likewise we have get initial state
function then we have entry count
function all these functions are
separated by comma and finally we have
the render function which is returning a
button and on mouse movement of the
mouse or the cursor the increment
counter will work and finally we define
another component which is a compo which
is used to render the output to the dom
so this is the main component this is
the component which will be used to
render the output to the dom because the
previous three components which we
created the first one was the button the
second boss was the D button and the
third one was the whole button
so all these three components we are
going to use in our main component which
is used to render output to the top so
what we are doing over here let's see so
this is a component we are creating it
using react dot create class which is
es5 send X and here I am using only one
function which
since it is the only required function
in an es5 class so what we are returning
over here we are retaining freedoms
having three buttons and finally I am
saying that react on the render rendered
this component wherever I want to render
in my particular tape or the page so
this is a complete code example step by
step code example I will repeat very
quickly once again that what we did how
we started we started by creating a
component for a button that will be a
single click button because we are using
here on click event of that button and
we created another second component or
another confident for the double click
of the button and be used on double
click even for that then we created
third component which is Homer BTN for
showing the increment counter when the
user will over on that particular button
and we are using here onmousemove
even and finally we created the fourth
and the final component which will be
used to render output to the Dom in
which we are calling all the other 3
components and this component is getting
called using react on tort render and
the second argument for this is where I
want to display so before going into the
what are the benefits of the es6 let's
see a demo of this particular example ok
so again I am in the J's bin the HTML
remains the same in HTML I am having the
root element when I will be displaying
the output let's see
whatever we saw in the PPT we will see
in this chip in that what we have
written so here is the first component
so this is the first component the
button it is having three functions get
initial State separated by comma ink
recount and 10 printer rental is the
most important one in writer we are
creating a button with the onclick event
the second component which we are
creating is for the double-click that is
the D button so this is the second
component the same functionality one
important thing as you can see that in
yak initial State the initial state of
the object is found the property count
is zero and in the ink recount function
what we are doing is that we are
increasing the counter by using this dot
state or com+ one now the third
component talked about button the whole
button component is this which is having
again the same functionality only the
other difference is that we are using a
different event for the whole button
which is on mouse wounds and finally we
are
like all these three components in
another component the fourth component
with the name compo react dot create
class all the three components which we
created earlier getting bundled in the
fourth component and finally we are
calling this fourth component to show in
our tom using react tom for friend of
which takes two arguments first is the
component name and the other is the
place where we want to test me so that
is how we wrote the code using es5
syntax and let's see the output now if
you can see the output it is displaying
me the three buttons if I click over
here the clicking single time so it is
getting incremented if I click again it
says two three four and so on
now this for the first component for the
single click of the button now if I talk
about the second button now second
button if I click at single nothing is
happening the reason be we are using it
for the double click of the button and
we are using an event called own double
click so let's double click we find
double clicking on it it's getting
incremented Wow so from 0 to 1 from 1 to
2 I am doing a double click from 2 to 3
and so on and the last one so last one
walls the whole button see whenever I am
hoovering it is getting incremented by 1
so that is how we write the pool in es5
so i repeat from this bin that whatever
I have written so we throat component
with a button for the single click and a
double you click component and then over
of the mouse component and then the
final the main component which will
bundle up all the other three components
and finally we are calling using
reactant or render whatever we want to
display on our tom so let's go back to
PPD again and then we'll talk about now
the es6 what are the benefits of es6
components this was all about the till
here it was about the es 5 I am assuming
that you have now the fair understanding
of es 5 class or years 5 components
which includes mainly specifically the
reactor create class from where you
start writing the code and then you call
the cat initial state where you set the
initial state of the component and then
finally there is a render function where
you fry it whatever you want so that was
all about the es 5 we'll come back to es
5
very quickly now let's talk about es6
components because since the main agenda
of this webinar to see the here six
component and how we can refactor our
existing code which is written as of now
in 15.5 version of react.js
using react or create class and how we
can refactor it to es6 Centex so what
are the main benefits let's talk about
first of all the first benefit is the
compactness the compactness the ESX
components are very compact they are
JavaScript centric when I say Chava
scripts centric they are not API centric
we'll see that then there is use of
Const and let keywords will I talk about
a little later of these keywords which
has been introduced now and ESX
components to use pure function so there
is no need of commas to separate the
functions and now the stateless
components can be converted to pure
functions leading to a minimal for sites
and then more specifically es6 adopts a
JavaScript centric approach now we are
passing the state values inside the
constructor so this is more of a
JavaScript approach and not the API
approach which we used to do in the es
file and now the component is now a
function this is very important to note
here component is now a function prop
Taizo are a property on the function
itself this is very important as I said
that the where keyword in es5 was
globally scoped so now the global scope
where keyword in es5 is replaced with on
stand lag which are block scoped in es6
this is very important we use Const for
constant values and let is used for
variable values and korn supports
immutability that is because it is
constant so it's well you cannot be
updated in react with es6 we are able to
affect the state away from our
functional components for this we
utilize the stateless functional
components it is as simple as the pure
functions or the props in and props out
so before going to the demo let's talk
about more about the advantages of ESX
components so let's talk more about the
advantages of
ESX components in detail so es6
specifically I will say that is the 6th
edition of the ecmascript which got
standardized in 2015 it brings many and
grossing features that were not seen in
the previous version like es
for example the let as I mentioned the
lead and the Const keyword and they are
the block scope declarations they are
not prone to the common errors which are
caused by misunderstanding in the code
itself es6 is able to tackle most of the
cold language the cold languages
shortcomings which are there in other
frameworks also for example type script
and CoffeeScript so let's go one by one
what are the basic advantages of es6 so
I talked about the arrows first of all
arrows are the functions these are the
functions shorthand using the equal to n
greater than syntax there is a
similarity between the syntactical
features of c-sharp of his script in es6
both statement block bodies and
expression bodies are supported by them
which return the value of the expression
at the same time at all shared the same
lexical this as they are surrounding
code this is very important so es6 is
different a little bit different because
it has introduced a new syntax which
we'll see in the demo which needed a
transformation extension in the
JavaScript now let's talk about classes
in es6 if I talk about class having a
single declarative pattern makes the
class pattern painless thing to use and
it boosts interoperability they are very
simple to write over the prototype
because they are very simple to write as
compared to the prototype tastes Oh
pattern object-oriented pattern so
inheritance instance and static methods
are supported by classes which makes ESX
more good virtual or I'll say the
perfect version of the java script then
we have enhanced object literals so what
is the purpose of object little first of
all the purpose of the object little is
to support setting the prototype at the
construction so when the mind they bring
different object literal in clastic
relation close together and benefits
object based design from some of the
sliminess is probably yeah so let's talk
about modules how es6 is advantage
genius in terms of modules so in ESX
modules provide a course to load and
manage dependency to the new keywords
which has been introduced in es6 which
an import/export import exclude keywords
here even after having good solution
like third-party libraries in es5
there was a problem called modularity
modularity remains an important concept
for large applications ESX it allows
smooth interoperability with
existing J's module systems like no J's
common J's etc it is it have become a
standardized protocol for sharing the
libraries and it also has easy
asynchronous external loading with the
external libraries now I talk about the
block scoping scoping becomes a very
important affair for developers who has
background of c-sharp Java or maybe C++
yes so when I talk about scoping es5 the
previous version of es6 it lacked a very
essential feature of block scooping
which is now declared as component
comparison to es6 though neat became the
mother of dimension as we know and
plucks open came into the scenario in
es6 so es6 emerged out with this feature
block scooping using the lake and Const
keyword of course now I'll talk about
promises so es6 is a promising language
where there are asynchronous operations
and there are promises to handle the
results and the errors so there is very
good you can say improved readability
and very good energy end link as well so
many languages or libraries I will say
javascript libraries nowadays are using
promises for example let's say RSVP no
chains angular JS all these are using
promises so these were all about the
advantages of es6 now let's go to the
demo once again now in this demo again I
am using the same HTML now this demo is
specific to the es6 class syntax it's
very important to understand the syntax
first of all we'll see the demo that how
our is 5 class which is here which was
using react dot create class has now
been converted to class extends react
third component this is very important
to understand it what we did in the es6
code and then we will see that what are
the various important things which needs
to be done to refactor es5 class to a
es6 class so let's start so what we have
done what are the changes first of all
let keyword
earlier we were using the VAR keyword so
where has been replaced by let in es6
and now react dot create class has been
replaced by because that has been
deceived in deprecated i will say so it
has been replaced by class extends react
taught component now here what I am
doing I am doing a constructor and
creating a constructor
with a super keyword and initializing
the stage in constructor itself at the
same time I have one function which is
incrementing the counter and a render
function a very simple code now I am
creating three components over here it's
a button for the single click for the
over button and for the double click and
that's it and then I am just calling my
base component that is the base cone
which I declared as a class and then I
am calling all the other three component
and finally this is my fourth component
which I am declaring which is saying
comp click and then in the react on
Turton either I am calling the fourth
component along with the second document
and as you can see if I am clicking a
single time it is incrementing the
output of the code remains the same but
the way I have written the code in es5
which was very lengthy it was not
maintainable it was not profitable the
readability was not good which has been
improved tremendously in es6 class
syntax so when I am clicking once it is
getting incremented when I am clicking
twice it is getting incremented when I'm
holding over the button the counter is
getting incremented now how this was all
working we'll see again so let's start
from here so what are the basic
differences between es 5 and es 6 class
this is very important to understand so
as we saw that es 5 it calls react or
create class with an object and es6 on
the other hand it uses class extending
react dot component in es5 create class
accepts an initial state using the
catenation state function that gets
called once when the component is
mounted instead es6 class it uses the
constructor after calling super it sets
the state directly which we saw in 210
now when I talk about the binding of the
functions with create class it's very
easy every property that is a function
is automatically bounded by yeah and in
the bounding of function when I talk
about es6 class it's a little bit
trickier functions are not auto bound we
have to explicitly Auto bound a function
so with create class define prop types
and default props as properties we
define prop types and default drops as
properties on the object which we pass
while with the es6 class these become
the properties of the class itself there
is a very big difference over here so
they need to be tagged or tattooed on to
the glass after it is defined
so let's see one by one what are the
differences between es5 in year six
first of all the syntax differences as
we saw that it uses react dot create
class and here we have class with
contacts extends react or component so
in es6 we are using basically a
constructor where we need to call the
super to pass the props you are using a
super where we need to pass the props to
the react component we now create a
class we are not using react or create
class now we have to create a class and
extend from react component instead of
accessing the VF dot create class
directly this is first difference or you
can say the syntactic difference between
es5 or es6 now let us talk about the
other differences the prop types and the
candy filled props in es5 this is the
es5 code and this is the es6 code on the
right hand side in left hand side in the
es5 code in react dot create class words
in the prop types as you can see over
here in the code the prop type is a
property the prop type is a property is
an object in which we can declare the
type for each prop the get default props
to get default prop property is a
function that that is returning an
object to create the initial property in
es6 es6 uses prop types as a property on
the actual class instead of a property
as part of the create class definition
of check the Gaiety fill props has now
been changed to just an object property
on the class called default props as you
can see over here the get default props
is nowhere it has now changed to just an
object property on the class called
default props and it is no longer a get
function it's just an object because a
get function it was returning something
but now it is not a get function it's
just an object this is the second
difference now let's talk about the
third difference this is again very
important which is estate differences in
es5 for declaring the initial state we
are having a function called get initial
state in es5 it simply returns an object
it simply because it's a function it
should return something it simply
returns an object of the initial state
values but in es6 the get initial state
function is deprecated and now we
declare all state as a simple
initialization property in the
constructor it sets so it is more of a
JavaScript and less of a API driven
functionality in ESX
this is the fourth
difference to diss differences so react
or create class automatically binds this
values correctly so as you can see they
start handle click and the values can't
find but there is a trickier code in ESX
with es6 classes properties of the class
do not automatically bind the react
class instance there are two ways in
which we can find the right context
which we'll see in the next slide so
binding the context in es6 so as you can
see over here what I am doing is I am
creating the class with react or
component extending react or confident
having a constructor which is taking
properties and there is a function
called handle play so what I am doing is
I'm using a bind function over here this
thought handle click thought mind this
this is full of the way of finding the
context in es6 this is the second way
now binding the context inside the
constructor here we have binded the
context outside the constructor and here
we have binded the context inside the
constructor itself so we could change
the context because we have changed the
context of this toward handle click
inside the constructor so to avoid the
inline repetition of the code and it
seems that this is a better approach if
moving to the syntax to avoid touching
JSX at all so what we are doing here
that there is a constructor and we are
calling the bind function bind property
inside this constructor itself so this
is one of the P now mix-ins mixels if I
talk about mix-ins are not supported
anymore in es6 classes they were used in
es5 syntax which takes an array array of
the values and these can then extend the
component class they are no more
supported in es6 centex now let's go to
our so we have seen the demo of the ESX
so these are again so whatever we have
seen that the demo or the es6 class that
now we are using lead we are using
constructor we are declaring the state
in the constructor get cells and instead
of react or create class we are using
class which exchange react or component
so this is all the recap of whatever we
have seen just now in the demo and in
the other slides so you can see here
that the function keyword is propped int
render we are using object spread
operator to load all state variable at
once
corn States used to declare the
constants and prop type prop types as
you can see here it is seen as a
built-in property it is not returning
any value it is the
creating value of the button or the
built-in value or the property instead
of a return value now just like we
created in the demo the to increment
counters for the two buttons here we are
using for the whole button and the T
button this is the same code which we
saw in the demo now we have
understanding of the es5 and es6
components and the classes now we'll
create a very simple application with
the tic-tac-toe with react using es6
features and in this tic-tac-toe program
we will use i/o functions classes let
and const elements or statements heavily
because these are the features of es6 so
we will will create three components
basically for the board one will be the
for the bowl one will be for the square
and one will be for the game so for each
player term will shift between x and no
as sweet usually two intact at all so
we'll start with the nine empty squares
which are rendered by the board
component because there are three
components as i said food square and
game to display this tic-tac-toe program
so we have used a pure function which is
a stateless square function which we'll
see in the demo just after tears and
which receives the profile use from its
parent port so the parent of the square
is poured and it notifies the board when
it is clicked so board component
basically tells each square what to
display that is why the state is
residing within the bowl component so
there is a function called calculate
winner which which is required to find
the winner will pass all the square
combinations 0 1 2 3 4 5 all these are
the square combination and then on which
we can loop to identify the magic
squares and then finally we'll return
null if any condition fails else with it
one extra row so there is a function we
have seen which is calculate winner
function and we have handle click
function and where we manipulate the
state variable then finally we use es6
LED to declare a variable status LED
status which prints the winner in case
of player wins or indicates the next
player turn and finally inside the board
render function we will be returning
nine squares using the render square
method see this from a demo perspective
then we will have a better understanding
at how it is working so as i said there
will be a function called square so this
is a component called board and this is
rendering and this is component called
game which is having the handle click
and other functions as well and as i
about that there will be different
combination mutations combinations of
the boat where we are using the
calculator with calculates in a function
and finally we are calling the react or
not render where we are displaying the
game component so this is the game
component as you can see over here in
the code this is the game component so
if I look at the output for this I am
using a particular CSS also yes and HTML
remains the same which we are using so I
am using a particular CSS to render the
squares over the DOM and so let's play
this game let's start the game let's
click on one of the cell I click it says
move one I click again it says oh this
is the move to let's say I click this
here this is the move free this is move
four and let's say this is 5 and let's
say the winner is o so once we have the
winner you are not able to click
anywhere on the screen if you want to
play it again you have to click on the
game start so in the six moves it is
telling us that in how many moves to
clear or dope in order to player who has
won tic-tac-toe game so let's see once
again let's start the game again so if I
click on game start it says X oh this is
the second player chance and again X if
I place over here and if I place X over
here so it says the winner is X now
because X has completed this particular
cells just particular line so in the 5
moves we have the winner s X so that is
how this tic-tac-toe program works so
again I am repeating what we have done
so we'll see this using the slides what
we taught in the basic tic-tac-toe
program I will start again with the
basic functionality what we did ok I
start with here so what we did we start
with 9 empty squares and then when the
first player is clicking on this square
the componentry renders state value to X
so he will see an X in the grid so this
is a 3x3 grid where the person will see
X or oh in the correct then what we did
we created your function with a named
square to define the square component
and this function it receives prop
values from its parent port so the
parent is poor it notifies board when it
is clicked and what we did we pushed it
into the board component and fill the
squares with null values for picnics so
basically we have created a
component it an import and then we are
passing down to props from po2 square
value and on Twix then we have a
function calculate winner which is used
to find the winner as you can see over
here we have a function calculate winner
this is the calculate winner function
which is used to find that who is the
winner whether the winner is X or
whether the winner is
o then we have multiple other functions
to handle click which returns either the
winner or the next player then finally
we have a variable with using the let we
have declaring a variable status which
prints the winner that whether the
winner is X or the whether the winner is
o if you can see inside the board render
function we will be returning the nine
squares using the rendered square method
so these are the nine squares 0 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 which are actually rendering on
the output screen or on the top so all
we need is to make three-dose since we
have to make 3 those that's why I
implemented some CSS and then we are
good to go and finally we have third
component which is the game component
which is getting finally displayed which
is used to render the poll component so
in the game we are displaying the board
component as you can see over here we
are displaying the board component so
that was all about the refactoring of es
5 to es 6 and we also talked about
advantages of es6 in detail so I just
want to quickly repeat that what are the
basic differences on how you can
refactor your code from an existing es 5
to es 6 so I will just quickly repeat
that what are the basic differences so
the first and foremost let's get started
again very quickly first difference 8x
difference no more react or create class
as it was there in es5 now we are going
to use react or component or
specifically class contacts or the class
name which extends reactor components so
this is the first difference the second
difference the prop types and get
different props the prop types
property which is the object in which we
can declare the tie for each prop so the
property on the actual now we are
declaring this prop types inside the
constructor now we have a constructor
over here the third difference tie state
differences in earlier in es5 we have a
method called gate initial state where
we used to declare the state initial
state and es x the gate initial state
has been deprecated and now we take your
all state in a single or a simple
initialization property
in the constructor itself so I will say
the es6 is more of a JavaScript driven
API and not of API driven now the other
difference is related to that this this
differences that taste or handle click
which we use to put in the render
function now we can put it in a
constructor so I will say that
ECMAScript is an emerging star which is
going to encompass and use all the other
libraries and frameworks with the course
of time and more and more of production
libraries and frameworks used to create
applications or win profit and using es6
syntax probably so at the end I want to
conclude at yes Facebook does suggest
the future removal of this react dot
create class completely in favor of the
es6 classes but for now use whatever
makes sense to you because they are both
just syntax with different semantics
that do the same things and then and
they are both classes yes
es 5 + es 6 at the end they are both
classes so thank you thanks a lot for
