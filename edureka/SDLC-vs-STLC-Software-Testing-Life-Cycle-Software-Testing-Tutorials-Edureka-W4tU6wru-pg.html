SDLC and SDHC and SPLC okay so in sdlc
is nothing but the verification phases
you must have heard about the
verification and validation and study
and the SPLC is any validation phases
I'm sorry cuz there is one mistake you
may still see is validation okay and
sdlc is verification there is some type
of error here I'll get that corrected
okay so validation phases now so what
what is that a sdlc and it is a
verification phases and what do we do in
sthe face f there is nothing but the
testing phases and the tester will be
doing some testing in t SPLC so all
these things all these things especially
system testing and integration testing
it is a part of that testers so who will
go do unit testing let me ask a question
please type we will do unit testing the
unit testing is done by the developers
okay but it is a good to have skill to
have a knowledge on testing a solid on
knowledge on coding to do some unit
testing and now let me know who does the
system testing and integration testing
all these are the functional testers
that would be this system testing and
integration will be carried out so who
is going to do the user acceptance
testing okay so the user acceptance
testing will be dusted by the client or
the business analysts who are being
appointed by that customers you
understood sometimes I said it is also
testers not exactly because your testers
job gets over with system testing and
integration testing but your tester can
help the user or the business analyst to
do some tests help them in in testing
because of the timelines or the
stringent Indian timelines or the
deadlines which they will not be able to
meet okay but basically it is tested by
the business analyst or the client and
now tell me one more question
so when is this user acceptance testing
done is it before production or after
production
the after production there is no
requirement for our testing right after
production is what everything is done
and the system is new and the
application is moved
ok so user acceptance testing it is a
sign-off from the client where they
would give you a sign of saying yes even
we have also tested the application can
move to production assume if the
production if you are doing user
acceptance testing okay don't get
confused with a word user user is
nothing but the client okay you might be
thinking the customer is if it is a
banking software you and I are the
customer we are not the bankers so don't
confuse with the terminology usually the
user acceptance testing is done by the
business analyst or the users who have
been appointed by the client or the or
the stakeholders understood so this is
done before the production after
production it is not recur after
production it will be a showstopper
where it would create I have work that
would being a bring it back into
reputation on the company brand you
understood yesterday I gave you one
example as well so project manager left
me and gone you remember
so that would create a bad remark on the
product and the user as well so ensure
it is understand this user acceptance
testing is done before the election okay
thanks guys you are a wonderful audience
I like your response okay now let me
just explain what how is the process
happening in the testing side now so as
we told you the test plan is prepared
based on the requirement analysis and
the design and then we prepare the test
cases okay preparing the test cases or
writing the best kisser and now creating
test data now you may wonder what is
this creating test data now I'll tell
you let me take this example okay so
when I write my test cases I would say
you have given some expected result and
actual result all right how did this
expected result and actual result came
up okay
so how did this come expected result you
may not be knowing what I'm what I will
do when I write notice B says I will say
input data I will say or input and
a column as an input data I will say
when I am trying to do when I write my
test cases I would say input data enter
seven in D okay and then in my next data
I would say enter five in be you
understood what is the a and B guys a
and B is nothing but this is the one
okay whatever you're seeing on the top
okay so I am saying enter seven in a and
enter 5 in D so now tell me what would
be the expected result from me expected
result is what seven plus five right
seven plus y is what well so the
expected result what I am expecting is
twelve and now now comes your testing so
when it comes to your testing now I will
be writing actual actual results so what
is it actual to serve all about when you
will do once when this application comes
into your hand then you will do your
then you will give the result what was
the actual test now based on the
requirement specification you have
prepared your place case this is what I
am expecting now application has come
come into your hand now what is
happening here okay now I'm saying
enter seven what is the value so I have
to enter seven in a and then what is
written here and tan Phi in be the enter
am I am fine in B now enter now what is
the expected result is pull what is
actual result I am getting this one
point for array are my test cases fail
what is the status status is fail you
understood okay now see now the actual
result is what it is 14 which means what
had happened they expected result rest
well actual return results 1.14 and what
is the status of your test case so what
you what you will say is it pass or fail
or
so the status is fail what is now how
did you allocate it because the actual
result is not matching with the expected
result and your status is fail you
understood
so now tell me what is that input data
in the test case that you are preparing
input data is nothing but the value that
you have 10 to give at the time of
execution on input data input data is
nothing but the value that you have data
mined to give at the time of your test
case execution or whatever it is return
ok so now the create a state has done
but in real time how do we connect to
databases because you always understand
when you are doing this testing there
are different environments okay so this
testing that you are doing will be done
in your testing and we're on month ok
your testing environment which will have
a separate pack meaning your testing
environment will have a front-end the
application that you are using okay and
the database that you are connected okay
and along with that and the developer
will have their own environment which
would be called as development
environment and we Norman les the
application they are developing plus the
database okay so this databases will be
in a separate environment they will have
separate server everything but for
production this understand please
understand these databases are nowhere
related or connected to the collection
server because what will happen if you
guys are trying to do some testing and
if they are connected to production
server then it will be a big flop for
example let me tell you and you are
trying to do some testing on the account
deposit okay for one particular customer
let's say that customers are having a
balance of around 300 $300 okay
so during the time of testing if you
enter some value of around dollar 3
lakhs what what do you what will happen
if the database is connected to this one
you're testing and we're on one database
is connect to the production then the
customer will immediately withdraw the 3
lakhs of dollars and you will run away
you understood what I'm saying so this
testing environment database will be
within the limits only for the testing
environment only for the testing
purposes or it will be a dummy database
it will not be nowhere connected to the
production and we're on man
so here you can give any kind of values
for your test data and you can you will
also have the rights to delete insert
modify anything in the testing
environment see what we have identified
ok if you get any text as output ok let
me just say this is called a be fake ok
what is a defect actually see my
expected output was this 12 but the
actual result was something else because
and this is a defect so what is a defect
all about it is an external behavior or
it's an internal the the requirement was
not it is it has got a deviation from
the requirement now as a tester simply
you can't go and tell them one point I
gave some a 12 yeah simply you can't go
and tell the dollar per se I gave 7 and
5 and the result came it as 1 point 4
you should also try to do some analysis
saying why that one point four has come
okay so that's the smart work from the
pester so then you can do some
calculations take a calculator why it
has come at some point way so okay so it
is because I have there is a division
that has at me it has come as one point
four now you tell me is this a defect or
a failure failure is what failure is
nothing but
there is a problem in the system or
there is a problem where the application
itself as boertie connected with the
issue like to the databases okay or the
module is not working properly which
means the as soon as you click on the
more the the application may not login
or it may not open you cannot get you
into the screen itself that you can call
it as a failure you understood and
defect is nothing but a deviation from
the requirement so what is the
requirement my requirement is it should
add the value but rather what is the
deviation I which is happening here
which is dividing so now we saw the test
data executors to itself a test we saw
so we had seen each other also analyze
the result what is that analyzing the
result now is the analyzing the result
so why hours analyzing Maira self what
it was giving it does not it is having a
deviation my expected result was 12 but
actually within this one now I'm
analyzing and came to a conclusion
instead of summing up it is gone it is
dividing so this is an error
you understood so that's what is
happening okay that is the analyzing the
result so what you should do now once
when done and when the result is faith
or the status is well what is that you
are as a tester you should do okay what
is that as an another and tester you
should do you have to we have to log
that the fake correct so reducing you
should lock the defect we have to log
the big fake how do you log the defects
impede is not just going and to the
developers bay and saying boss I have
found a thing you you have done a
mistake please rectify it's not going
and doing a verbal communication they
will quote get irritated so now we have
some process that are there in the
companies yesterday I told you about
there are certain tools where you can
raise defects in an to called quality
Center we call it as QC and you have
defects like tools like Quintana
Quintana when I was using this
application and I was in u.s. opening
for some time okay and I didn't see that
application anywhere and then now there
is something called Jireh JIRA and these
are all the defect logging tools
okay using some defective tracking tools
so or some companies if they are not
able to offer to buy all those tools
they go for Excel okay and they'll put
it in a shared basis or they'll send out
a mail okay so you will then race or
defect and say this is what the result I
got please rectify and send it to me I
will I'll teach you about how to log a
defect when we come to defect management
okay so once when the defect is done do
you think the everything is done no the
job is not at over still what what what
you need to do you have to follow up
with the developer until the defect is
fixed and you have to once when the
develop
the effect is fixed you have to give
them plication back you have to retest
the defect and ensure there is no
problem or there is no failure or defect
which is arising again okay once when
you are through and when you are happy
with the result then you can move it to
the firaon hm understood so this is the
process which most of the companies
follow click
so in short let me summarize this so how
are we doing planning and control under
the requirement and then we are
preparing a test plan analysis and
designing and then we are executing and
during the execution anything defective
that arises defects that will have to
refix it and then exit criteria is
nothing but the reporting disclosure
reporter before before the sign off that
will have to prepare how many test cases
we have developed how many have been
executed how many defects have been
closed how many are still open how many
defects will be resolved for the next
thing is all those report you have to
clear please mention and prepare a
report and then you have to give a
sign-off from your testing activity you
understood these are the testing
activities that we will be doing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
