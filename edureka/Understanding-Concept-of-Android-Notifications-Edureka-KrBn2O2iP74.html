right how many of you have seen the
notifications like whenever a message
arrives you see a message notification
on under the top window right whenever
you get a new email already you get a
notification that you have a new meaning
right so how are we going to achieve
this up with the help of Android
applications you'll see this up in this
example so we have a class alright we
have a class in order to use the
notifications right so the notification
manager is the class that provides us
the notification services right so that
we can use any sort of service in order
to notify the user let me also tell you
about something which is very important
to understand we use a pending intent
here let me tell you about pending
intents the pending intents are the ones
between register for the device in
memory right it's like I create an
intent with my application that does not
need an activity to launch just let me
know if there is any sort of questions
and understanding this because this is
very important to understand the pending
intents are the ones that do not mean
any activity to launch them up they are
the ones that are running with this
system I just registered a pending
intent and as soon as a time appears the
pending intent will show up on the
screen let me give you a small example
for this we have alarms we have alarm
managers in our devices we set up alarms
in order to wake up in the morning it's
not correct you also done arms in order
to wake up in the morning but if I try
to set alarms how does the system know
when I have to call you up or say when I
have to wake up what it does is is it
registers of pending intent right it
registers us appending intent with the
application so that whenever you have to
raise the alarm the pending intent will
notify you that the alarm was set up for
some and some time and you have to wake
up at some and some time everybody can
understand or make
out of the example that I'm quoting here
for example I'll show you another
example I'll give you another example
how many of you have seen whenever the
time zone changes you'd see a
notification that the time zone has
chained tell you whenever you're
traveling and your device comes into a
new time zone all right it automatically
notifies you that this is a new time
zone do you want to say change it change
this toward the new time zone or not so
that is something which is again a time
zone the fritz so you can receive the
activity we are the pending intent gate
activity so which activity associate and
the pending intent or created depending
engine if you want to happen that you
can the user to using the pending intent
or gather get up
show you an example for it what we'll be
using is we'll be using a notification
builder so the notification builder is
the one that allows to define actions to
do notifications like on click off the
notification what you want to do
something that you can take care of in
the notification builder as I said a
pending intent itself is simply a
reference to the total maintained very
system I hope everybody now agrees with
me what I was telling you and it also
means that heaven if it's owning
applications processes scale right the
pending intent itself will remain usable
from its own processes just like that
I'm talking about it if you want to have
some actions like when you click on the
notification if you want to allow an
action on it then you will be using a
notification god builder interface
alright so that is what the first line
says the second line says app any intent
itself is simply a reference to otoku
maintained very system so whenever I
associate a pending intent I'm saying
I'm having the reference of something
that I have associated with the Android
system alright and that ultimately means
that even if the owning application for
example I'm having an application
running all right now I have closed this
application but my application had
registered of pending indeed with the
system
all right so that pending intent will
again be reusable from other processes
right for example I set up the alarm
manager all right I set up the alarm
manager from within my application and I
close my application down in this case
the alarm when we said all right because
I have roaches registered this or now
with the help of defending it all right
so not as what d39 speech here let's see
a working example so here I have created
a notification click that every and a
half to another node finished so let me
tell you about this I'm recalling a
notification
plegh not Tiffany alright whenever I
take any action on out of the
notification so what does it going to
show me is I'll just show you showing
that what is contained in the example
here and it's just displaying a text
view which says you can display new
things to the user here also this
activity will run only even if the
application is closed as I have told you
because once I have registered depending
intent this will always work now let's
talk about notifications dot Java so
this is my first activity my
notifications class extends the activity
I have a button notification let me show
you this so what I have is let me do
generate a notification button I go down
there I create a button listener in
surrending but new listener see what am
i doing first of all I'm creating an
intent the intent that I'm creating here
is going to launch the second activity
of mine you all can make this with the
help of this intent declaration I hope
this is clear to everyone it's like
something that I'm creating in order to
launch the second activity let me know
if this is not clear to anyone then I'm
creating a pending intent all right so
the pending intent is making use of the
actually parameter so the activity that
I'm using for the spending in Dennis
notification start this let me show you
it creates a context the request code
since I'm using only one request here so
I have kept at a zero they intend that
it needs to use in order to launch the
activity alright and if lab if your add
variable is something which you can
associate like you can make choices
between the various plants like if the
flag is one you can associate a
different kind of an action that is if
you want to launch an act when you can
launch an actually if you want the raise
of broadcast you can raise about us so
something that way either
associated with the help of flag
wearables so here create independent
intent after creating the intent for
launching the activity I'm passing you
know it on to the pending in tip now
what I am doing is I'm following a
notification object in order to build
the notification for me everybody
understands what I mean by building like
sending the text sending the header
setting the drawable all right so this
is all the actions that I'm taking here
when they help up the notification
builder I'm saying send the content idle
supported and you reckon or iron send
the text Android class and this small
icons and the content intent that is
which intended has to use in order to
launch up so I'm associating the pending
intent here to the notification wheel
finally call the bed so that when
notification is ready when my
notification is ready I just call the
notification manager and ask them to
notify using my notification made here
it also takes an integer identifier
since I'm only using one notification so
I'm just making use of one identifier so
this is how you will be building up
notifications let me run this up
so I click on like me to generate a
notification and as you see on top I get
as notification I'll just drag this down
here you can see the notification title
and everything
if I click I'll be getting on launching
activity similarly if I just go back it
will again take me to D click me to
generate a notification if I click again
again another notification gets
generated if I click on it it will
launch the activity this is normally
what happens with the Gmail application
that you have inside your devices as
soon as a new email comes up what
happens is you get a notification once
you click on the notification it
launches the Gmail application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
