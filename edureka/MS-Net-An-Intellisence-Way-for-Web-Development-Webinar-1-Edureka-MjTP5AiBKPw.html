okay so for example let's coming to the
object will stay in this session will
understand whoa view of garnet okay how
daughter is going to be work what kind
of applications we can develop using the
garlic ok and how to simplify the
current requirements with garlic and
will understand a small case study okay
and we'll also see how the jobs are
there is a lot first of all what is
Dartmouth c.net stands for generally
network-enabled technologies it's a any
do network-enabled technologist why do
we need doctor actually it's a
technology what do you mean by a
technology technology in listens it's a
not only the programming language it's a
collection of some libraries programming
languages okay references etc to develop
any kind of software applications
related to any requirement I repeat
profit is used to develop any kind of
applications related to any kind of
requirements okay so any technology like
a chihuahua is a technology donít is a
technology PHP is a technology all these
are the technologies right now in the
industry every client or every company
need a software applications and their
requirements to develop any kind of
applications so my daughter native were
referred to develop any kind of
applications okay next see you it's one
of the powerful technology from the
Microsoft you know the micro subject and
the surface I mean what we call you the
microsoft windows operating system the
world windows operating system okay same
place the technologies from Microsoft
okay and it's a very very powerful
framework used to develop any kind of
applications okay a simple example I'll
tell you for example it's yeah
see us let's say I want to develop an
app equation related to any technology
protects itself there is a scenario like
I want to handle banking transactions
let's see all the hunting banking
transactions how to handle a banking
transaction for example I want to
operate in two people to my occupation
in bank so we need to have an
application which can be operated in the
back in the same way I want to operate
from NZ my bag at home in my roommate
okay using okay same thing I want to
operate my bank account using my mobile
for the same thing all the operate my
bank account okay using my ilysm the
power you can say we hire a service
interactive voice response okay we think
or I want to operate my bank account
using another banker knock another time
today but I'm not able to see the video
get me not able to see the video no
we're just showing you everyone can see
okay right so the concept is here let's
see a scenario like this I want to
operate my bank account in the bank or
using the web using the mobile phone
using the telephone idea that is using
another bank account or anywhere this is
my sanity ok now if you want to develop
these kind of applications ok now you
can understand that Ebel's in is
rocketing above scenario it cannot be
using a program knowledge we can be not
going to use in a single programming
language
okay we need to have technology what
need to have a technology can understand
that dot metric okay if God who is a
powerful technology okay helps you to
create if you need kind of applications
like you can develop a console
application you can develop a windows
application he can develop into the
publication okay you can develop a class
library okay you can develop something
policies services anything if you are
able to see this okay these kind of
scenarios are required will develop
different different types of
applications no my thing is I want to
leave it in the system desktop I'll use
a Windows application if you want this
one to be operated in the web I need to
have a very publication if you use up
using the another bank i'll be using the
web service or if you want to use your
application in your smartphone or a
mobile phone i'll be using the mobile
application I repeat ok so these days
the requirements are completely
different we need to have a keep an
application to be operated in any case
okay let's see there are some doubts
again how do we include Orton it in all
these years dotnet is one of the
technology which helps you to develop
any kind of application now ah rather
your doubt is how do we float right yeah
I'll tell you so darn it is a powerful
technology helps you to create any kind
of applications i can write a console
application which can interact with my
requirement directly interacted with to
my left arm entirety okay directly
without installing the application
without installation of application on
without load application here windows
applications user to create a desktop
application
desktop application okay and it is see
the scope of vacation Nate able to
operating system am i clear and web
application you can operate through
internet can be operated to fix
chemically hope your doubt is cleared
mr. Rocco okay you are asking another
one like our coach is asking what is a
web source venture is ok actually web
service web service in essence it is
with a service okay user to develop an
interoperable application in with our
honorable application what do you mean
by interoperable application let's say
an application there will hopefully
using one technology an application
developed using one technology let's see
which are barking candy consumer body
let's see an application or you can see
Li will be pretty developed using on
technology same java can be consumed by
another technology ugly ah like doc okay
this can be done with the help of a web
services so web service is a service
user to develop the interoperable
services no obligations i repeat i can
give you real-time example example for
web services let's say amazon okay if
you have chase amazon okay see an item
purchased in them or you become
ecommerce website from you come across
it okay baby will be processed using
bank gateway if you remember you will
not be paying the money to autism give
you pain the
scientific to ban it so Amazon might be
declared yet in the breeze in Java bang
gateway developer using the doctor now
Mike you this can be done with the help
of them their services hope you
understand right here the cerrado very
good for us so you can understand that
my Dartmouth is a technology helps me to
develop any kind of application what do
you mean by any kind of application it
can be consoled application windows
application web application mobile
application class library in case if you
want to develop these kind of
applications we have a solution called
let's head technology so technology in
the sense of not only the programming
languages it helps to it contains the
services components libraries etc which
makes your application development very
easy be effectively right so you
understood what is a dotted and what we
can develop ok let's coming to features
of dollars so you may ask a question not
why do we need to go for a dotnet when
we have different technologies okay by
rich language da genetics develop why we
triangle eyes dotnet is developed what
you mean by that question the alternate
is a framework developed with the help
of sm b and c sharp daughter none
engines dotnet is developed with the
help of a programming language called as
sm v later dotted 2.0 onwards and
implementation happen using the C sharp
ok c sharp is developed at the HC chef
is a main key thing in the dark here
will sadhana understand dhananjay right
so dotnet is yeah assembly language here
assembly is one of the language where we
can interact with the system which
right now let's come into the question
what are the features of torrance CA Lee
said that there are many programming
language of technologies are available
in your industry there are many
technologies available in industry like
the technologies called Java is there HP
is there ok we have dotnet is here ok we
have defended and other technologies of
further when we have multiple
technologies why do we need to go fer
doc ok there is a pastor question as a
fresher see people if you are going for
experience you may not get cocky but but
the answer is is for dotnet is famous
because of five points i can give you
five points here and the pasta two
points of view what is the first one the
first point i can get europe multiple
language support so the first feature
related to.net multiple language support
what do you mean by multiple language
support very simple in order to work
with darling your daughter it is not
asking you who write a coding particular
life I repeat you can use any language
which you know I read it there are more
than ok more than 40 languages more than
40 languages ok exist in the invested
more than 40 language like this in
industry ok to develop an application
the car gets to dhaka technology example
we have if you know BB there is a video
dog better if you know we c plus plus
you have a vc plus restaurant in OC shot
you can use C sharp outlet if you know
something like deja deja cosmetics etc
and there are some plugins also like HP
the ordinate is there cobalt or net is
there like we have four and ordinary
user s
suffer no more the point is in order to
work with the darknet you need not some
more particulates i wreck it if you go
for a job are they'll not to really get
a big issue hold it if you don't know
the shower your novel oh the job
each bid ordinate is a pompous do you be
a chemist which helps you to convert the
pH before we do the dotnet course I
did it mr. robot if your PHP programmer
if you know he hated he holding you
right the PHP code take the support of a
PHP or which we go into the garden
understand come on right coming to the
nick this one as I said you that there's
likely be ornately see christopher
jeburk attention up coming to the
plugins there are some forgives all sins
php.net cobol does it or not at Exeter
those plugins what is lose the converter
or the you're up early I know see where
is often support see yes you don't have
CL C distance is it and we have
something called as interval some
components at the yes you can do it here
there is some c programming you can you
have some interoperable I breads if you
are operated legacy code will you
already can we convert Java to doc yes
it is possible yeah java to.net is
possible with the help of the j-shot
they shall put is article right here is
to the possible features multiple
language support there are more than 40
successful languages in the industry you
can use any one language to develop the
dot dot net will not ask you to write or
using a particular language doctor is
telling that you can use any language
what do you know I'll tell you how it
works there is a logic behind this point
yeah will I understand the logic with
enough liquid ok next coming to this
second feature first feature hope you
are left one of the language support
second feature is language
interoperability can we convert Java
or.net recluses that's not the right
questions in yet you can use Java code
can be consumed by daughter
okay but the same syntax if you want to
use we have something called say jay
sharp G sharp is almost similar to java
or data point right coming to the next
one language interoperable what do you
need the Latin interoperable let's say
I'm asking to change to do my work ok
let's say theme one is working to be bid
on it team two is working with vb vc
clusterstorm they can communicate
without any migration ok any integration
I bit still exceeds acorn conan they
will appear using one language c eb door
i repeat i am going to be developing a
full confidence let's say it developer
using you get up there ok can be
consumed ok a confident avella pues in
one language say vb.net can be conjured
traffic file another tape it up not
using another language ok sing it PC
Chris Christopher it is alone this is a
second feature each language
interoperability this feature we will
seek form only using in your regular
example let's say a scenario a little a
result in your situation yep ok one of
my client one of my point they're having
two teams team one team one walking from
USA ok and they are using C sharp and in
be working in UK they are working with
the BB door now the question is if the
conference which were generated using
this and we consume what this thesis is
possible our here a comment which was
developed in c-sharp and we communicated
it a component developer in vivica it is
possible so this is feature is fall as a
language in probably
hello right so the concept is see the
voice cut off problem pocket right now
the constant is multiple language
support and language interoperable oops
other two unique features why clients
are interacting with the Dartmouth ok
any other programming language or a
technology like Java PHP etc ok are not
the availing this facilities there is a
reason behind these two features ship
will be understanding the reason behind
these two messages coming to the third
feature the facility which is said use
multiple language support where you can
use any language which are of it second
feature is languid interoperable there
you can do sorry a hassle ok next one
coming to the third one you'll be having
thousands of emailed libraries am i
clear so the first to feature what did
excite you multiple language support
second feature is language interoperable
terrific theorists thousands of for
ready-made libraries thousands of
ready-made libraries in distance you
have ready to use for yourself using the
paramedic libraries you can interact
with files you can interact with devices
you can interact with the databases ok
you can perform your regular italic
tastes like mathematical calculations
come if you look at a time ok you can
design the GUI tools UI elements etc ok
so this feature is also one of the
powerful feature we have behind them or
that success coming to the next one
are very worker so before a powerful
flavor he said you should understand
what is this a framework what is a
dreamer frankly speaking Dartmouth is
nothing but just a framework okay what
is the freedom see you can simply say
that the framework is a software
infrastructure I repeat it's a software
infrastructure okay why do we need a
three you may ask a question that's why
do we need dream very simple okay
framework helps to fill up the
application okay framework helps you to
develop the application from your
requirement okay it need not to do it
from the scratch this is the main
advantage related to three so three
inver is a software infrastructure where
it contains a inbuilt ready-made initial
things we take an office on geek and
irregular so who's having doubt like who
is hang out yep how ambiguity arises in
multiple inherited it's a former like
here there is an open circle account it
will be here arises in Haleakala
terrific time even though inheritance is
a problem in all the places yeah it
should be ready to fire it nearly be
better okay Oh cases ok how many types
of saying work braga book there are two
types of three books or less in
development frameworks and deployment
framework ce sera gov you answer is how
many types of frameworks are there there
are something called acid development
framework okay and deployment flavor to
the people there are two types of a work
surface okay right Vincent of here a
framework which help you to develop an
application is called as a development
finger okay so he'll ask me questions
what are the different types of frame of
different types of frameworks here there
are two types of frameworks and
this development framework okay second
one is a ploy went to framework what it
means this framework okay use it similar
to the application okay debug the
occupation and also run the application
developed application debug the
application and run the application okay
and this framework contains with which
one development framework and reigns
programming languages okay class
libraries and RT oil as run line okay if
you see a lot ok c.l.r come and help you
to a below the application debug the
application and what will be called run
the application it's called a
development for obligation and this
framework is frame of which one
developments a working ok will it come
ok well come along wedding we should the
studio this is develop what is
deployment framework inside this place
simberg is used to run the project
Montford debugging or not first
developing ok it should be ok install it
from software on it downloaded from
Microsoft Archer ok and development
framework contains only a lil at one
time CLR only lucky ok and it is not
available and it should be here mr.
putter yeah why dotnet framework is 13
you are asking not related to this
person okay dotnet framework is not a
platform-independent how you know I
let's be very simple yet dotnet
framework ok is
a platform-independent okay is this your
question right he is don't let that all
keys or net framework okay a
platform-independent is your question
the ions will strike it's a partially
okay independent why partial independent
i will tell you the reason it is
specially sign into my trying to work on
Microsoft operating system microsoft
windows operating system system as for
this hundred percent independent okay
here i repeat framework contains see
allowed CLR runs only on Windows
operating system that is the reason it's
partly dependent but what happens to
know the people who are not related to
dotnet and they are very happy with the
darknet they formed a community called
the same MO no community there is a
community chorus in mono community more
they created a CL are called as mono
Sheila runs in hee hee haw operating
system runs on linux operating system if
it turns on then i saw a material it
works on unix and also talked about some
not okay mol osceola runs on linux linux
and mac so using moro clr facility on
you is immune osceola write this so hope
if your doubt is clear ok y dot net
platform by dotnet framework is but from
independent it's not platform
independent it's partially
platform-independent that this is your
answer next in case of production issue
can be not debuggable how can you give
our see this is not the correct question
else in the production issue we cannot
be able the application in there deploy
deliver on the prior dinner on one is
different you will be having a
development in review how to what would
be called debug the application in the
development environment
okay the climate is different there will
be having something called accepted
issues out there logging the issues
involved that will be different we
cannot develop anything MMA cannot debug
eating in the deployed its are bringing
it back to the development here guess
and that's correct so the answer is we
see how to go about it development
environment is a place where he can do
his vision zodiacsociety but yes
obviously usually is only way we usually
I said I see that part victim okay hope
you understand what is a framework right
let's come into the features I said you
right there are features multiple
language supports language interpreter
interoperability thousands of ready-made
class libraries for lesbian rights right
and powerful framework okay you're
powerful framework what you behold with
microsoft support this offer support
okay with microsoft support and i've
created depends upon the requirement can
you tinia sleep will object depends upon
the record and what is the last kitchen
is diligent application developments of
the what is intelligent application
development of their visual studio
visual studio ID is intelligent
application developments of them which
makes your dotnet very very I mean which
we mix your application development very
very easy with the help of these five
features we will be telling you dot net
is very powerful in the industry right
now ok dot net is a top most of ink and
we chill it you to develop any kind of
applications and services oh my dear so
the people who are very happy with the
Java because Java is the one of the
whole subject in your academics the
people of containing in Japan okay but
comparing to Java the application
development is very very faster in.net
okay both are ok but application
development is very very fast up with
this pie unique features okay so this is
what exactly call it why you need to go
for it on this and ask me any questions
if you have questions like any questions
yes Visual Studio access jireu for.net
there is any questions can I continue
what I write his visual studio is free
yes good question sit in order to work
with us at all that you have a software
policy visual studio express edition
okay you need to have use for your
express edition okay you can get it 2012
13 15 etc okay visual studio express
edition is frizzy okay for 30 days to
pray today that it is it's free okay
from active one day onwards it will ask
you for the product up to 30 days if
you're nasty okay you can use visual
studio exponential I repeat visual
studio express edition 2013 if you
install at the top okay you can install
you can develop the console application
you can develop the windows application
okay you can develop the class libraries
and you can develop the windows services
so the following four different types of
applications can be done with a helper
this soft for example if you have been
visual studio express edition for a
dozen for example we can develop the
other publications you can develop the
web services you can develop the WCF
services okay we can develop that class
libraries okay for example if you use
this one for Windows visual studio
express eration 2012 on Windows we can
develop apps for Windows 8
is ok and windows mobile OS am i clear
in the same way there is something else
examine if you install it stammering
software ok we can develop application
for android iOS consider clearest so you
can understand that depends upon your
requirement you can use what application
you want nice any other doubts fear how
will we practice our exercise for dotnet
majorica provide a successful
relationship HC c add your economy not
to provide allegiance to you i'll show
you the link so you're at the end of the
session Bailey is hearing you some
documents you ok let us say I have the
daughter native introduction so in this
each and everything has been clearly
mentioned what we have and here I also
provided you the links if you click on
the link you will be getting the Windows
desktop software click on the link will
be written up there if you click on the
link you will be getting the dotnet
framework and if you click on the link
you'll be getting that sequence ever ok
for practicing I need not to support you
your system should have a minimum
configuration when you click on the link
it will die it will take you to the
installer file just to double click on
the file with a basic instruction you
can install ok you need not to be here
what would be called very good
administrator to install the software
but if the basic ok instructions you can
develop applications easily am I here
can we develop applications for Windows
10 what do you mean by Windows 10 or
Windows 8 you are going to be developing
applications for color is the operating
system whatever we have see if you are
instead if you working with windows 7
your applications will be windows setup
what operating system you have for the
operating system we will be developing
it's not like a Windows 7 or Windows 10
or me can you define xamarin xamarin is
one of the Sam ring is one of the what
will be called as I said you write the
people y dot net is not a
platform-independent
since dot that is specially designed a
Microsoft but dotnet become famous and
the people outside of dotted also want
dot net so what they happen you know
they form the community coalition Muno
community mono is a community which is a
are very happy with the door and they
want dotted they don't want to be they
don't want to lose your face looking so
they developed a framework for lysates
or if they develop or something called
semana SI ella de tamano still are you
can run the application at unitec ok and
here Sam reason is a product of mono
it's a product of Moon moves amrit okay
if you are this moves a marine in your
visions to grow we can develop okay so
sleazy and develop applications persons
android iOS Android and applications we
can develop clear is any doubt any other
out here right this is the day and do
remember darknet helps you to Microsoft
allows you to develop any kind of
something we don't have any restriction
that we can develop only concern
obligations or Bigelow's applications or
their publications we are ready for
anything as a client you come with your
requirement i am ready to develop
anything in your environment i have a
very good support of facilities like
that or raid arrays infractions and
valiant effort and we can hi guys you
can get it if links right so these are
the links to develop your install your
software okay these are the links with a
click on a link automatically come it's
open I need not to give okay when if you
come in for the a little soft heavily I
mean install in your system ok this is
what exactly call it up how idea let's
come into that kinda ish so how this
dark net is going to be supporting these
facilities then here talking about this
coordinate ok so we are telling the
dotnet is used to develop any kind of
application right it's a console
application or a Windows application or
web application how it is working very
simple it is fall
simple logical what is the project
already okay c.net framework they'll
understand okay then understand only one
language would called il what is il I n
stands for intermediate language I get
intermediate language so you can
understand that this is the standard
code another dotnet framework will
understand I the automator understand
only IL so as I said you at 40 plus
languages all 40 plus languages like C
char will take the support of its
compiler CSC and it generates IL when
you talk about a vb it take the support
of visual basic compiler and we generate
IL when you talk about a b c plus this
it is having something called a safe
easy easy ok VCC ok it is Annalise I a
so everyone is going to be generating IL
all the 40 language rather see char for
V V or V C++ or jay sharp of php.net
they are generating IL where IL is a.net
understand of equal hope you understand
it so with this facility the two unique
features are powered whether of them I
repeat it dot that is famous because of
this features in these features faster
two features of the unique features
multiple language support and language
in proper values these two language
these facilities are available with a
help of this festival disks I L stands
for intermediate language in case if you
know CeCe place place we will be calling
them as object support we will be
calling them as one or two to four if
you know Java we will be calling them as
a bike foot let's ride a bike or
something like a yeah I photo ok so il
is a.net understandable code with the
help of that mr. Gilbert we can interact
the corner now dot that is telling that
anyone who is ready to convert IM you're
welcome for the darkness if you know any
language if you can convert though IL
you are eligible ok this is what
exactly called dot neck oh hey I unique
features I have been provided
let's coming to our concept we are going
to be developing the console
applications we are developing the
business applications updates we will be
working with the C sharp I mean sequel
server database concepts like sequel
server database queries sequel server
stored procedures okay and we will be
also handling 14 m citizen of the link
with the info the link will also have
think of all see as I said you that
banking application banking application
etc when you go for a buying little race
of the time okay you have to be in the
fuse involved I can develop any kind of
applications related to solving this
requirement band-aid solutions okay
right I do wonders for applications web
applications you can develop the web
application windows applications you can
develop the control applications web
services see I can tell you a simple
example you have an ATM card which is
related to I say seven you can operate
in the head ships or you have I say
seven on your own you can transfer funds
into his gypsy it is possible might be
the applications are dependent in
different countries it is so the concept
is you can develop the console
application windows application web
application web service mobile service
okay routing applications using a yummy
see any registration ok this is what
exactly it can be possible you can use
web applications in the supplication as
I said you right you can develop any
kind of applications okay web services
also popular and here i just said you
that more than 40 to calangute sounded
like you get off next Lisa plus this
confrontation are not enter sepa but I
ask for our program we are teaching C
sharp the reason is maximum clients are
living from the sea shack okay we have
to do the parity for the client
requirement also so as for the client
requirements the requirement is
completely on the sea shop so our main
language is zeeshan even I'll tell you
one example and we build on it also we
can consume we will all take off from
reducing the seizure it is possible
right and you know that the market ok
Java is having very good market ok there
is a huge market for java or we use
market for Dawson ok only accommodate
for the door it is Java but working with
the dotnet Lee is very very easy
comparing to java so Java and.net are
having very good market but thought it
is very easy that's the reason there is
a huge market for
working with Java in the sense that and
it should be very strong in Java they
should know the Java syntax and of
dotted such kind of rules are not there
you know any language if you are able to
convert to iron please come to we are
welcome and coming to our aid Eureka
model actually exists 60 our program our
elevator program is 60 our cliffs
project and 60 in the 60 hours 30 hours
theory and andrea was practical i repeat
in our project we are going to be having
in our program it's a 60-hour program
here 60 our program will be having 10
models each module is three of us
practically I was three and three hours
practical three of us theory and three
hours practical will be giving you an
effective exercises and we leave
solutions also okay in the first module
we will be understanding in da arc
addiction of the.net what is not in it
why do we need to do a vitamin e dot net
what we can do return it the basics what
we have been covered okay in needle
architecture we do there in the module
one and also we'll see how they install
religion for you what the software's are
required what programming language are
there how to create a project how to add
a project working the distillation
project and all will be covering in the
model one coming to the more you do we
will be learning the programming basics
and oops concepts in c-sharp ok so the
module one is we ask the model is also
playoffs in the three RS will be taking
the three concepts and we'll be giving
you lot of examples and you have to
practice the past which vehicle to the
problem and the third model is
completely on the windows forms and the
fourth module single songs with a reward
or tech interacting with the sequel
server communicating to the database
okay flip the model is class libraries
okay collections assemblies we will be
working with lot of collections here
when you work with any programming
language any technology should be very
very strong in the collections so we
have been given a dedicated section on
collections and les amis okay the half
of the subject will be computed in the
collections and their families coming to
the second half web application
development will be working with a
spirit introduction architecture
navigations master pages etc will be
there in that model is it says periodic
masterpieces seventh model will be
having the web server controls
interaction again with the eight erase
everything will be there coming to the
modulated link will be there and also
linked to secret link to link to sequel
and war and will be there ok and warm
link to sequel will be there bit
modeling eight it's a current days every
programmer should be very very strong in
the link and link to sync up for that we
have dedicated session on eight model
then a trader architecture followed by
an example ok and ninth modulus state
management techniques and ejects ok what
is a link link is a language integrators
work ok language integrator pari enable
us to communicate with any data source
using schemes I love fashion ok so what
is link link is in Sanskrit language
integrated equal ok user to interact
with a needle tassels ok any data source
like Mary collection xml file a tacit
sequel server etc ok let's similar style
similar fashion ok it's so this will he
we will be explaining in detail in the
link right and your question is what
what will be covered in this sea shop in
c-sharp who will be covering the c-sharp
programming ok like we'll be having the
programming basics programming basics
will be really ok and we'll work with
the built-in classes ok we'll work with
arrays lucky will work with collections
when we work with everything you're
exceptional hanging ok properties
properties in detail oops using C sharp
ok and the Lord's work with legal forms
so each and everything ads for the
industry requirement what is it taking
time for modules a 10 times forum
Orioles will be their generally
we'll be on weekends okay sessions will
be on sat and sunday okay then leads
sorry five weeks ok so the session will
be from morning seven to ten or evening
832 given that the highest next any
other out what is the difference between
visual studio and visas today we can
offer to our our session recording yeah
reference will be available in the idea
of hotel oki Printers too low its place
ok three sauce ok work for tequilas all
right yes any other routes how will we
practice our exercise ok it's free to
download software lets play at all in
our routes
like this so the concept is you can
develop any kind of complications
related to any requirements inja dot and
these are the things and the asp.net
also will be covered in detail seashore
content will be covered so at the end of
the program will be confident in the
console application development windows
forms interacting with database using a
reward or net the publication
development and no RM call us a link
link to sequel statement and ethnic and
also will be discussing the web services
but the cost of the course and all that
they will be discussing here okay you
can see in any requirement you can rip
reach to support a big you Rica okay
support a video recorder hope ok they
will give you the complete information
ok so that is a lota you guys can ask me
any questions in case if you have how to
his door Nate insecurities and lips yeah
we have it we have with different types
of securities okay see how to use
security ESP dotnet provided security
okay will provide something called a say
authentication vacation and
authorization okay asp.net provided
something called as a anonymous not an
indication we have a different types of
authentication anonymous authentication
like we have something called as windows
authentication okay we have something
called self the board indication with
this facility you can provide the
security asp.net applications are fully
secure okay SPF not applications are
felicity what is Amal extensible
application markup language sam'l okay
is an extensible application programming
language okay user to develop what we
call the WPA okay windows presentation
foundation
windows presentation foundation we are
not into with W windows phones we will
be developing windows forms we will not
work with XML Samuel is not a narc or
component WPF is entirely different okay
zamel is used in the wp okay next any
other loves next clear what is the
meaning of what is unwilling / NBC in
profit yeah in daughter did you like
only sees it the dying part of you is a
design pattern the occupations okay
pattern so I by engine comes
automatically my people will okay can we
see the design pattern user to develop
their publications okay which can be
which is used to make which provides
mean durability ok you're going to be
working late and we amine VMS is not in
our content okay MVC is not going to be
in our enemies is entirely different
it's another one is ok so the
prerequisite after the orchid will be
working with a mix okay MVC is not into
our program as okok body what what is
your goal is not you got it tell me
assembly assembly he here project
compile it okay a project compile okay
in.net will generate NSM okay NSMB an
assembly and b or d ll or 38 so you can
say a library or eight if i generated in
the ordinary small necessary oh my dear
reusable component yeah pocket
but next one yeah every language in
darkness how must have a compiler see
shaft is having a CH c compiler vb.net
having a vb c compiler every programming
language must have a compiler is
everything is a managed for in the 50s
Alton e it's not like a managed for yer
a program right you can say is here a
language the copy ah in.net ok language
in.net like C sharp or alternate ed
talking of cake like these little
short-legged extra ok our generate
manage course our internet manage them
managed code innocence manage sport ok
manager for we generated using SI ella
oh my dear SI ella plus other than 16
Eclipse place etc ok will be not
generated easily see a lot ok and call s
unmanaged rope ok so manage for staying
communicate together unmasked or cannot
come in I mean it's not a concept of
seizure onset don't you text can be
either up Scott can we use tor net in
cloud computing security tell me once
what is it up can we use use tor net in
cloud computing security yes we have
Azurill yeah it is it any till and I
know we can you can vary here to say
that dotnet is ready for mitigating
there is no Ruth in daughter there is no
first of all there is no restriction in
doubt that there is not a city and we
learn about deployment what's yes oh I
will show you I will teach you ok is
that application deployment into is
flowing into is
that we will be there difference between
dll andhc seed dll is a library file
contains reusable code okay which can be
consumed by any yellow or he get see
where dot exe is a standalone H good
alpha standalone it 0 to the shop I'm at
your executable file okay you come to
run the project okay so you can say dll
innocence it is it class without making
it no startup okay a THC in essence it
is a glass with make me understand what
is a manifest what what what is your
manifest lynnie guess you have many
class yeah any yeah no no no no no many
pairs press em a ni a PSD manifest so my
customer of an information about your
assembly earth okay assembly information
will be policin mind if it's okay it I
about dr. yeah in assemblies concept
welcome having you'll have a detailed
session on assemblies I have a dedicated
slots for assembly ship so we have a
dedicated slot for assemblies on class
number five if it's the model
approximately five into kitchen in tower
you'll be aight with 14 15 our subject
will be having this amazing yeah ok so
that is about your small introduction
here will be having very advanced
concepts ok in detailed descriptions
will be here and we will be available in
the support ok using the supporting you
can approach us at any time okay okay
laser and your decision what our
recollections ellipses an affair
Demaryius you can see oh one day ARS
mini collection what our collection okay
the fictions
readymade Oregon City ready to use data
structures data structures use it to
store huge amount of data umbra okay you
can sit program boy is he he'll
understand but this can be using the
action thought that yes of course okay
of course I did this is a financial
technology without RX we cannot imagine
Tornetta see an application submission
with blind requested to server with the
help of a post max the target is used
for the partial perspective a total Jax
will not be doing okay we'll have a jack
says no vocal so I Jax will be there in
our session ok and the last but one
session will have a jack okay so we have
a9 session with a jacks we have a jets
what we'll do is we'll see I just like a
small examples they have parcel post
back using timer controls partial post
work and we can run the time and we'll
also have a small slideshow program in
Ajax right we'll have purchase then you
give some class in collection or now we
have it elections okay so we have a
dedicated gasps educator class for
collections environment collections
dotnet we have a dedicated parts yeah
thnkx clear anything else oh I cleared
all your doubts it's not like
ninety-nine percent here one hundred
percent satisfaction will be there from
our program okay it's very clear ok ok
see you thanks ok ok my gonna good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
