to do a certification for PMI why should
I not go for PMP why should I decide a
CP C PMP is a project management on a
very broad area it's a broad spectrum
thing it will give you a concepts of
project management it will not talk
about the concepts of agile so if your
interest is just agile you need to go
for a CT but if you were thinking of
Journal project management if you want
to learn journal project management
right B and not just agile then you need
to focus on PMI PMP sorry and also if
you are planning to move out of IT or
you are no more interested in i-80 and
you want to change your line and or
maybe you're getting into your own
business and you want to learn how to
manage it how to execute efficiently
then PMP is a p.m. pace for you but yes
if you are wanting to learn agile and
you want to be agile you you want to
learn agile methodology ACP is equation
PMP would help you understand a project
management on a very top level it will
help you calculate the ROI from a
journal project management terms but ACP
is the subset of the project management
one is the agile project management and
is one is the higher level of the
project management I don't see PMP
getting obsolete because PMP teaches you
the bigger terms of project management
they it talks about lot I mean in a July
you would learn the risk management from
a agile prospective but PMP would give
you or would give you insight of risk
management or a journal basis right even
yes as as we are talking that agile is
getting into every industry even
construction industry is getting Ajay
one of the best
is gone other days when the constructor
vendor would say that the possession of
the buildings or the problem in the
houses would be given when the complete
project is ready now they focus on one
tower at a time they complete one tower
all the cosmetic and all those
construction things related to one tower
are done when though it's done the
position is given then only they move to
the second tower in most of the cases
their focus is giving the possession of
one toe so that they have the name and
the fame okay okay okay people are
getting into where people are the people
see the construction happening right
it's very rarely these days that they
are working on five six hours at a time
and none of the devil comedies get
people are getting both position of none
of the tower so you need to decide what
is your future plan how I mean how you
what is that you want to get into right
so agile could be if you want to ensure
efficient delivery but EMP could be that
how you can integrate different forms of
project management and how you would
want to solve the dependency out of it
so PNP is at a very higher level a CPH
would only focus on agile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
