here so whenever we will be doing some
web interaction where in where in will
be what we'll be doing is we'll be
having a client so the client which will
be having is a device will be acting as
a client and then we'll be having a
server request so what we do is we'll be
using the htl recreating the HTTP client
object all right and we what we'll be
doing is will be creating those extra
deep clients to excuse the HTTP requests
so it's like the hypertext Transfer
Protocol request will be doing them will
be getting the HTTP GET kid method which
will be retrieving information defined
by the requested URI and that is a
uniform resource identifier and then
we'll be saving it up in an HTTP
response object so let's I think it will
be more clear to you when we will be
doing a working copy of it for now you
can just take a look at this code
snippet here it says whenever I will be
creating an HTTP flight I will be
creating it like this i will be cutting
the default HTTP glide then i will be
passing in a uri which is the uniform
resource identifier do with us and here
i can pass me the URL than I have so if
you want to get all the all the HTML
content that is present on the website
Eddie I reckon on iron so what I will be
doing is I will be using this this
particular you want to give me all the
data alright then one I will be doing is
I will be creating the request which
will be the new HTTP GET request so i
will be getting this objects here that's
correct leave that we are creating the
object in the first line here send this
particular URI if we have just created
and get the response all right so we
will be getting the response after this
complete execution so let's take an
example for this here what I have done
is I have created at HTTP sample
classroom so here i have created a
textview if i go on to the main window
here activity main here you can see i
have got a graphical representation if i
say see if you see here I have a text
view which says loading data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
