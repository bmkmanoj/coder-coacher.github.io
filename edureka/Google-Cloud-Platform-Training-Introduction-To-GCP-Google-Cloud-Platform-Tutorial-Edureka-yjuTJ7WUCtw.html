Eureka and today we will be discussing
about the Google cloud training so if
you got the topping in mind you want
iterate that to cover just put it in the
comment section below and we'll be happy
to put up a video soon so coming on to
the agenda of today's session
first of all we'll be starting with
cloud computing will understand the
various cloud services provided and the
various providers of these cloud
services we'll see why TCP is important
and using the industry a lot moving
forward we'll learn about the various
certifications offered by the Google
cloud platform the tcp training here at
adhirata
and then we'll learn about the Google
cloud platform and its services in depth
and finally we'll end our session with a
hands-on demo on the Google cloud
platform services so let's get started
so let's understand what is cloud
computing now cloud computing is
basically getting the services you
desire on your computer via cloud you
don't need to buy thousands of servers
or system to work everything is managed
by the cloud service provider so cloud
computing is the on-demand delivery of
compute power database storage
application and other IT resources
through a cloud service platform why are
the internet with the pay-as-you-go
pricing it is the use of remote servers
on the internet to store manage and
process data rather than a local server
on a personal computer now third party
cloud enables organization to focus on
the core business instead of expanding
resources on computer infrastructure and
maintenance now there are various cloud
services which are offered and among
these there are the three main services
which are infrastructure as a service
platform as a service and software as a
service
now these models offer increasing
abstraction thus they are often
portrayed as layers in a stack now
starting off with infrastructure as a
service infrastructure as a service is
where the consumer can deploy and run
arbitrary software which can include
operating systems and application the
consumer does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure but has
control over operating system storage
and deployed application coming on to
platform as a service the platform of
the service vendors offer
or development environment to
application developers the provider
typically develops toolkit and standards
for the development and channels for
distribution and payment in the platform
and the service models cloud providers
deliver a computing platform typically
including operating system programming
languages execution environment database
and web server now coming on to our
final service which is software as a
service the capability provided to the
consumer is to use the providers
application running on the cloud
infrastructure the applications are
accessible from various client devices
through either a thin client interface
such as web browser or programming
interface the consumer does not manage
or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure which includes Network
servers operating system storage or even
individual application capabilities now
as you can see here we have so many
cloud providers we have digital oceans
VMware Rackspace wool cloud platform
Amazon Web Services Microsoft Azure joy
net IBM cloud enter a Mac now what makes
Google stand out from this crowd let's
see now who cloud platform is a suit of
computing services that runs on the same
infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end-user products
such as Google search Gmail Google
photos and YouTube and we all know how
big is the database of Gmail YouTube and
Google search and I don't think in the
recent years Google server has ever gone
down in the bottom here you can see that
Google is the only company which has the
highest growth rate the growth rate is
even more than 100 percent now let's
have a look at some of the features of
GCP to understand what really gives it
an upper hand over other vendors first
of all it is cost-effective there are no
upfront cost needed and on an average
you have to pay 60% less than any other
company which uses the same instance for
compute networking storage and others it
is highly scalable it can be scaled
easily according to your needs with
virtually no cost no custom machine
types is a feature of Google compute
engine that lets you easily create a
machine tab which is customized to your
need with custom machine tests you can
create a virtual machine with optimal
amount of CPU and memory for your
workloads you can create a machine with
as little as one CPU up to
as much as 64 CPUs now coming to the
Internet of Things Google cloud platform
has an IOT specific intelligent platform
that unlocks business insights from your
global device network now Google Cloud
IOT is a set of only man is an
integrated services that allow you to
easily and securely connect manage and
ingest ìit data from globally dispersed
devices at large scale you can also
process them visualize them and analyze
it in real-time now coming on to API
platform an ecosystem Google cloud
platforms cross cloud eBay platform
enables businesses to unlock the value
of data deliver modern application and
power ecosystem now coming on to big
data analytics TCP provides fully
managed data warehousing patch and
stream processing data exploration with
added Hadoop and spark specific
configuration and reliable messaging now
coming on to cloud AI Google clouds AI
provide modern machine learning services
with the pre-teen models and a service
to generate your own tailored models
their neural net based machine learning
service has better training performance
and increased accuracy as compared to
other large-scale deep learning systems
our final point is server lists now GCPs
services this doesn't mean that there
are no sir was used by Google let's
understand first what so will this means
a surveillance is a new paradigm of
computing that abstracts away the
complexity associated with managing
servers for mobile and API parents all
you have to do is put in your code and
Google will dynamically provisioned
resources as needed
no management or servers now
applications with rapid time to market
and unpredictable skill requirements
benefit the most from being server less
now here you can see there are various
companies which use DCP for various
purposes we have coca-cola Spotify
snapchat Wix and Philips these are some
of the major and big companies which use
GCP now cloud train professions are high
in demand and for a good reason
understanding the high of cloud
computing requires a broad knowledge
across a number of fields so Google
provides certifications through which
you seem to be eligible for the perfect
role you desire in the cloud environment
so
in total there are four certifications
offered by Google we have the
professional car architect professional
data engineer the g-suit administrator
and the g-suit among these the most
important certification in accordance to
cloud computing is the professional
cloud architect now a cloud architect is
an IT professional who is responsible
for overseeing a company's cloud
computing strategy this includes cloud
adoption plans cloud application design
and cloud management and monitoring
these architects oversee application
architecture and deployment in cloud
environments including public cloud
private cloud as well as hybrid cloud
cloud architects may also be involved in
legal areas of cloud computing by
negotiating contracts and working
alongside legal and procurement
departments architects ensures service
level agreement requirements are met now
at Eureka offers a detailed and
comprehensive course on Google cloud
architecture certification training
which is aligned with the certification
of Google to train you in such a manner
that you understand everything in depth
and pass the certification with flying
colors
now it's a 12 module course so the model
one is the Google cloud platform
introduction in this model you will
learn about Google and the global
infrastructure you will also learn about
the regions zones and the projects that
make up the tcp environment coming on to
module 2 we have managing DCP services
in this module you will learn how to
manage ECP using console and command
line tool the cloud shell G cloud gsutil
and also you will learn how to install
and configure cloud SDK now the next
module is DCP networking services in
this module you will learn about the DCP
networking concepts and how to set up
network topology how to connect
different DCP resources with each other
and isolate them using network policies
and firewalls
coming on to our fourth model which is
the TCP I am and security features in
this module you will learn Identity and
Access Management I am and the several
management tools which are offered by
Google cloud platform now the next
module is TCP compute services in this
module you will learn how to create and
manage virtual machines and work with
compute engine in the next module which
is storage and it every services you
will learn about the different
storage and database services offered by
Google learn how to choose the
appropriate database in what situation
now the next module is containers and in
this module you will learn how to deploy
manage and scale containerized
applications or kubernetes now cloud
dataflow for data processing in this
module you will learn how to develop and
execute a variety of data processing
patterns using the data flow processing
and how to manage cluster using the data
proc service now model line is the TCP
API and development services and in this
model you will learn how to use TCP for
application development deployment
debugging and monitoring coming on to
our tenth model we have TCP devops
services here you will learn how to use
gcpd our services for CI CD using
Jenkins and how to debug using
stackdriver in devops environment now
designing and implementing DCP migration
this model is also very important as
here you will learn how to check
different metrics and take decision to
migrate from other cloud services to DCP
or to migrate from on-premises - tcp now
our final and last module is the tcp
archetype exam case study understandings
in this model you will learn the
official case studies which are provided
by Google for DCP architect exam and
practice on these with the hands-on
environment so that these case studies
help you to clear the exam with could
score and it will also practice on these
case studies with sample exam problem
statement so as you can see for the past
five years DCP trend has been increasing
with a very good rate the average salary
for a cloud computing professional or a
cloud architect is around 150,000
dollars and there are more than 10,000
jobs in this field so let's understand
what is GCP now what cloud platform is a
suit of computing services and
management tools which are offered by
Google alongside a set of management
tools it also provides a series of
modular cloud services including
computing data storage data analytics
and machine learning now here are the
major 10 service areas or the services
which are provided by Google we have the
compute services storage and database
services network services
the Google Big Data service we have
certain developer tools we have identity
and security Internet of Things cloud EA
which is Google's machine learning
service we and finally we have certain
management tools and data transfer tools
now Google cloud platform services are
available in location across North
America South America Europe Asia and
Australia these locations are divided
into regions and zones you can choose
where to locate your application to meet
your latency availability and durability
requirements now regions are independent
geography areas that consist of zones
location within regions tend to have a
round-trip network latency of just under
5 millisecond now as zone is a
deployment area for cloud platform
sources within a reason so let's have a
look at the various locations where the
servers are located and the number of
zones for that particular regions here
you can see that there are a total of 15
regions used by Google with at least 3
zones in every reason now that we have
understood the importance of cloud
computing and the roles of cloud
architect along with radius cloud
features and the service of GCP let's
have a look at an industry based use
case where you need to set up your
machines and database on the cloud and
connect them so that all your
requirements are met so for that all you
need to do is log into your Google cloud
platform account and go to console so
here I'll create a VM instance
just go to compute engine
click on the VM instance button
enter the name of the instance and
select the zone which you want to use
now you here you have the option to
select the machine types here I'm going
to use select a single CPU machine now
coming down you have the option to
select the boot disk image now I'll
change it to Center seven and just by
that tapping on the create button within
seconds your instance will be create
so as you can see within seconds my
instance was created now all I need to
do is create a sequel instance which is
my requirement
now usually you have the option to
select between the fourth generation and
the second generation but the second
detention is recommended as it has seven
times the throughput and the 20 times
the storage capacity than the first
generation and is less expensive than
the first generation for most use cases
in the instance ID select the root
password
and select the location you warned this
instance to be located stop on the
create button and within minutes your
sequence instance will also be created
so now you can see that my sequel
instance was created now if we had go to
home you will see that under the
resources tab we have one compute engine
instance and one cloud sequel instance
so we can use these instance separately
but our requirement here is of a compute
engine which also needs a cloud sequel
instance as my company say for instance
works only on sequel so I need to
connect these two instances right so
just go to this compute engine instance
and you see this is Erica training you
have the external IP address copy this
IP address
go to your cloud sequel instance select
the instance and tap on the Edit icon
authorised Network section and I just
need to add a network paste the IP
address of the VM instance and the name
is optional
the moment you add it and save the
sequel instance and the VM instance you
created are not connected and you can
access the sequel instance
why are the VM instance you've just
created
so let's fire up this VM instance
so this is a center is based VM so first
we need to do the yum update and see if
all the software's are installed or not
so let's update the system first
so let us install Java
now that we have installed Java let us
check the Java version I think it is
going to be 8 yeah this is Java 8 so
let's install the sequel instance now
because although the sequel is connected
this system doesn't have the sequel my
sequel
now that I have sequel installed in the
system and the sequel instance is also
connected so in order to connect it to
the sequel instance you need to put in
the command
my sequel - - the host now here you have
to put the IP address of the databases
you created that is the sequel database
so where we can find it you can find it
under the sequel instance
see the public IP address just copy this
one
visitor
now here you have the option for to
select a user root and password so
let me first create a user and a
password apart from the default username
and password
so now that I have created another user
from my name and a password it will be
easy for us to manage so because it
provides a certain amount of security
also if you create a username specific
so in the user I'll put in my name and
in the password section so as you see
you've been reacted to this my sequel
instance now if I write show databases
it will show me the three default
databases which are already there which
you can see here - in the sequel
instance information and Scott schema my
sequel and performance scheme now let me
create a database
now when I show databases the four
databases and
same will be reflected here just let me
refresh this page
the honor of databases you have another
database is a database added which is
the training database now in the same
way you can add any table or any other
query you want to do anything you do
under my sequel instance can be done
through it and here you have your VM
instance and sequel instance uploaded
and up and running on the cloud you can
stop this instance mint and we're
required according to your requirements
so now that we have seen all the twelve
modules covered in the Google cloud
architect certification training
provided by a Drakkar let me quickly
take you through the LMS which is the
learning management system here at a
drea so when you are for this course you
will be redirected to this LMS page in
this elements page as you can see here
we have the course content section which
contains all the content related to our
Google cloud architecture course it
contains the presentations the case
studies and the class recordings and it
has a life tracker to track your
performance now in case you miss any
class by any reason you need not worry
here in the class recording sections you
can go through all the recordings of
these classes which are already
available there finally here in the
personal library section you can upload
any document file or any data set which
you think is will be required by
learning this course so guys if we want
to know more about the details of this
Google cloud architect certification
training you can mention it in the
comment section below so guys this is it
