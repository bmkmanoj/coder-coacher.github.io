and welcome to this Raspberry Pi
tutorial session now this session is
going to be slightly long in comparison
to most tutorial sessions that you see
out there on YouTube but this will give
you a complete understanding as well as
an in detail with respect to Grass
Valley pi3 now looking at the agenda for
today we will talk about what is
raspberry pi and the radius hardware
configuration of raspberry pi which has
changed over the years we'll also be
comparing them with respect to the
different models that has come out after
that we'll be looking at how to install
an operating system on raspberry pi and
then we'll be looking at a tutorial
using one of the major additional
components to raspberry pi with a sensor
following which at the end of the
session we will be looking at a demo
using raspberry pi which is going to be
a motion detection camera now in our
science hat tutorial section as well
we'll be looking at five different demos
thereby giving you a complete
understanding as well as a good learning
experience from this session now I hope
you guys are definitely interested for
the session let's move forward to the
first topic which is basically the need
for raspberry pi now raspberry pi today
has become so common that you can find
it across most households as well today
it has become one of the most cheapest
and common computing device that can be
found almost everywhere but let's
actually go back to understand the
ideology which bought raspberry pi into
development itself now raspberry pi
basically was bought by the Raspberry Pi
foundation to introduce or to bring in
the information technology back to the
schools wherein students can learn how
to program from scratch the growth of
technology today has grown to such a
level that everyone today has easy
access to do anything on a computer but
back in the early and late 90s and
2000's for using a computer you needed
to know how to program and how to work
around with respect to it so this in
turn helped to build a very strong
foundation for programming knowledge and
with the growth of UI everything has
become so easy that today you don't need
to learn programming to do much but at
the same time this has made it harder
for people to identify and understand
good programmers from those who are not
so in order to build a
generation which starts with a very
strong programming foundation and
fundamentals the main ideology was to
introduce or take back IT to the basics
and make it accessible across every
school as well now again as I said it
was introduced by the Raspberry Pi
foundation in 2012 as much now moving
forward what exactly is Raspberry Pi now
this is one of the questions most of you
would have across your mind as well
because you might have heard about
Raspberry Pi but you might still not
have a clarity so let me help you
clarify that right away now as per the
definition Raspberry Pi basically is a
series of various small single board
computers which actually have additional
features as bluetooth Wi-Fi USB
capabilities general input/output ports
and so forth now it basically is a very
small low-cost credit card computer
which actually can be plugged into any
monitor as well as you can include a
keyboard and mouse and it increases the
opportunity for people to explore learn
and understand how to program as well
now the latest version of Raspberry Pi
is Raspberry Pi 3 which was released in
February 2016 as well now Raspberry Pi
basically is a combination of Raspberry
operating system and Pi who is basically
stands for Python programming language
but before we move forward let me just
show you a very simple video which
Raspberry Pi has put up so that you can
understand the ideology of Raspberry Pi
foundation as well this is a Raspberry
Pi it's a credit card size computer that
costs around 25 pounds designed to teach
young people's program and is capable of
doing all kinds wonderful things
back in the 80s kids had to learn how to
code computers to use them and as a
result these kids grew up with an
inbuilt understanding of how computers
work now we need more programmers than
ever before so to deal with this problem
some clever people came up with the
bathroom pie to reignite this bar it
trans linens a free operating system
from an SD card just like the one in
your digital camera and it's powered by
a USB phone charger you just plug in a
mouse and the keyboard connect it to a
TV or monitor and you're ready to go in
schools not only is that very pack a
great way to learn programming skills as
part of ICT there are also dozens of
cross-curricular
applications next science a music and
all over the world people are
experimenting with raspberry PI's and
attending raspberry jam events where
people of all ages are learning what can
be done with a Raspberry Pi since the
first Barbary pirate ship we've seen
examples of people using the PI in a
variety of amazingly interesting
projects taking advantage of its size
portability cost program ability and
connect ability so whether you want to
learn to make in the robot or even teach
about pear-shaped with Raspberry Pi in
the sky's the limit
great so I hope you guys had a great
learning experience with respect to that
that was basically the ideology of the
Raspberry Pi foundation on introducing
Raspberry Pi into the market as well
moving on some of the capabilities that
Raspberry Pi enables you to do is that
it helps you to browse the Internet as
well as what complete HD videos on the
same device as well so all you need to
have is a HD supported display as such
apart from that even basic operations
like making spreadsheets creating words
presentations all these can be done on
Raspberry Pi and you have a huge set of
games that are available which can be
played on Raspberry Pi making it quite
interesting and easy as well for people
to enjoy the component as well then you
have various add-on capabilities like
infrared cameras and security system
which can be built
keeping Raspberry Pi as the core
hardware as well then you can also use
many music machines as well as detection
of weather stations which we actually
had done in a previous session as well
now these are just some of the top
capabilities that I have picked up from
the list Raspberry Pi today has become
one of the biggest component that has
enabled users to achieve and create a
lot as ba 3 the capability of Raspberry
Pi is restricted just to your
imagination whatever you can imagine can
be done using Raspberry Pi given the
amount of effort put into that now
moving on let's look at the Raspberry Pi
hardware as well before that let me show
you and I would be using a Raspberry Pi
as part of this tutorial session so let
me just give you a simple overview of
the component as such now what you
basically see is that the Raspberry Pi
hardware so let me just switch over the
camera and let me show you the last free
path now here what you're seeing is the
Raspberry Pi 3 hardware as such and this
is your processor and system-on-chip
which is an Arduino a 53 processor now
two important ports here is the CSI port
which is the camera serial interface
where you can connect camera directly to
the Raspberry Pi and the DSi port which
is the display serial input port okay
now let me just flip this over slightly
and if you see this is a 2.5 mm microUSB
connector so your standard mobile
charger can be used to charge the
Raspberry Pi and this is a standard HDMI
port for display so your standard TVs
and monitors which have an HDMI support
can be used to become a video interface
for that then you have an audio jack
which is used to connect your audio
input now let me just flip the slightly
over and let me the zoom out a bit
now if you see we have an Ethernet
connector following which there are four
USB slots as well
so when you see here there's a flippin
general input output pin present here so
this is something that's quite
interesting and configurable from your
Raspberry Pi a software well you can
configure for what each purpose pins can
be used which we'll be seeing a little
ahead now the final thing that I want to
show you is behind here when you flip
back sides there is a microUSB slot
present here this is mainly to insert
your memory card and when I say memory
card I would generally recommend at
least a 16gb memory card
this is mainly because the operating
system in itself is about 4gb and if you
use an e 8gb then what happens is
there's very less storage space for your
operating system to work on as well so a
16 GB memory card would be really
helpful and one thing that you won't see
is this is an Evo class which is
something similar to a class 2 memory
card so if you're getting a memory card
make sure it's at least a class 8 or
class 10 memory card so that you can
have high disk read and write processing
now coming back
now moving ahead let's just came through
the various changes that has happened
over the hardware of raspberry pi now we
are not going to devote too much time
into this because this is a completely
in detail session how I would be
stopping at these slides for 10 seconds
so if you wish to know more you can
pause the video and get a complete look
as well
now talking about the processor the
first generation of Raspberry Pi
initially came with a Broadcom BCM - 835
SOC and it basically was similar to the
first generation smartphone chips and
the architecture that was used also was
an AR m v6 architecture now over the
years raspberry pi 3 has grown a lot and
today it has a capability of 1.2
gigahertz which basically is because of
the AR m cortex a53 64-bit processor and
is considered to be 10 times faster in
comparison to Raspberry Pi Wow now
talking about the change in Raspberry Pi
over the years as you can see here the
various models have been listed and the
architecture change has also been
mentioned here as well so in case if you
are interested to know more you can
pause the video and take a look at this
now when you come to the memory the
first model of Raspberry Pi came with a
256 mb ram and which basically were
shared by the GPU but today with
raspberry pi version 2 and 3 you have
four times that you have about 1 gb of
ram which again is shared by the GPU as
well now the default split was at 192 mb
ram for the CPU basically which was more
than enough to play a full HD that is a
thousand ATP video or performed simple
3d operations but again not to
complicated operations as well now going
forward when you look at the networking
capabilities now in terms of networking
capabilities the model a of Raspberry Pi
did not have any such features but from
model B of version 1 itself
you had an Ethernet port which was
introduced here and from version 3 you
also have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
capabilities introduced here as well now
talking about the peripherals in
Raspberry Pi there are basically 4 USB
ports now this has been introduced in
model B version 1 plus onwards and today
you have a lot more that you can do with
respect to that even audio input ports
and audio output ports have not changed
over the years but the onboard storage
has changed a lot with respect now again
when you look at the video capabilities
video controllers basically here you can
wash complete hesti videos but Raspberry
Pi does not have a
2:56 decoding hardware but the cpu in
itself is very capable and helps you in
decoding the H 256 encoded videos
through software operations now in terms
of GPU the GPU in Raspberry Pi 3 runs at
a higher clock frequency which is about
300 or 400 in comparison to the previous
versions which was at about 2/3 six
megahertz now in terms of video input
you have a 15 put CSI connector that has
always been present with the Raspberry
Pi and video output has have changed
over the years you have a HDMI port you
have a DSi port and now you also have a
3.5 mm trrs jack as well now now in
terms of the connector capabilities
there are 17 pins of the GPIO port which
can be configured as per your
requirements as well now moving forward
these are the various details with
respect to the general input output pin
this data has been taken from Wikipedia
so in case if you are looking for more
information you can definitely check out
wiki space or the official Raspberry Pi
documentation as well now coming down
let's begin the Raspberry Pi
installation process hum parts first let
me help you understand the different
operating systems that are available at
present ok Raspberry Pi in itself
supports multiple operating systems are
such but will mainly be working on
raspbian ok so these are some of the
most for applo operating systems
supported on Raspberry Pi so you have
RISC OS you have FreeBSD operating
system you have net BSD operating system
plan 9 is again from Bell Labs as well
as Windows has its own Windows 10 off
IOT version okay so for this session we
are not going to go into the Windows 10
we stick to the core Raspberry Pi
operating system now for downloading the
operating system you can go on to the
original site that is Raspberry Pi dot
o-r-g
and there in the Downloads tab you can
download the operating system let me
just show it
okay so this is the Raspberry Pi
homepage and here if you go on to the
download section you can download the
operating system now if you are starting
off with raspberry Pi an Internet of
Things trust me this is the best place
that you can find a lot of informations
with respect to it okay most people
actually publish their details with
respect to the projects that they are
working many of your projects are also
available you can find a lot of help as
well as good information here okay so
this is definitely the place to go to if
you go onto the download section here
okay this will either show you two
options you have noobs or you have
raspbian I would recommend that you go
with notes because this is a complete
package with respect to the different
operating systems as such so here again
you have noobs and noobs like so my
recommendation would be you download
notes and make sure you using a 32 GB
memory card but if this would be really
helpful because it gives a lot of memory
for your operating system
so in case if you're going for a 60 GB
or below I would recommend you go with
the noobs line but make sure you keep
the bare minimum of 16 GB in case if you
are working with Raspberry Pi but do not
mistake me when I say use a 16 GB memory
card you can install it on an 8 GB s1
but again the operating system has less
memory to work so at least go for 16 or
higher 32 is what I would recommend so
once you download this zip file or you
can even download it by a torrent ok but
I would recommend download it as a zip
file let me show you the file so this is
the noobs file let me extract this ok it
may take some time it gets about a 1.5
GB file okay the Lites version is
slightly lower in comparison but this is
something that I would recommend in case
if you're working with Raspberry Pi
ok so I have my noobs folder here so
what you need to do is that you need to
copy everything inside the noob folders
and then paste it inside the SD card ok
make sure you are not directly copy
pasting the folder that you have extract
so what happens is if you do that it
does not actually recognize the
operating system as part of the
Raspberry Pi so copy everything that
you've extracted and then directly paste
it inside the SD card now again this is
why I recommend that you use a
high-speed memory card because in case
if you are not using it then what
happens is that it takes a lot of time
with respect to fetching the data ok now
as I had mentioned if you're going for a
memory card for your Raspberry Pi you
can use something like a 16gb at least
and make sure it has a high transfer
speed so this in turn will give you a
lot of memory area to work around with
as well as I would recommend you take
something like a class 10 memory card
that is available in the market today so
these have a very good read and write
speed ratio so definitely this is
something that you should consider while
you're getting a memory card for your
operating system ok now once you are
done copying with this let's go on to
install this memory card on to a
Raspberry Pi and let's begin the
installation process okay so now we've
successfully copied all that is needed
for our operating system so safely
remove this make sure you're ejecting it
safely but then sometimes what happens
is if we do not safely eject it the
files get corrupted before you load it
into your Raspberry Pi this is certain
issue with respect to the memory card so
just eject this ok so this is my
Raspberry Pi and if you actually flip it
over
this is the slot where you have to
insert the memory card now we've copied
the noobs folder into this memory card
again let me just insert this into this
and let's begin with respect to the
installation process
let's begin installing this memory card
on to my Raspberry Pi and start with the
setup
so let me just turn though on my
Raspberry Pi
okay so this is a screen I'm getting by
default
now what happens is the installation
steps initializes so the Raspberry Pi is
getting loaded
now there are two operating systems that
are present here by default and we want
a raspy and so let me just select
raspbian and click on install option
present here now if you see here it
basically is telling me that it requires
4.5 GB so this is why I was recommending
you to get at least 16 GB or more
because if I have an 8 GB memory card a
4.5 GB goes off with the operating
system itself then there's not much
memory left for me to work around with
now let me just click on install
that incase if you are using a different
language or if you want to use a
different keyboard as well you make sure
you are specifying that okay so there
are in languages present here so choose
the corresponding language as per your
requirement once you selected that this
click on install and this is just
basically going to ask you whether you
want to format your data and install the
operating system on top of this so click
on yes and the installation process has
begun now it may take some time so I
request you to be a bit patient because
this is an operating system installation
process so please be a bit patient and
hope you have fun meanwhile
so now as you can see the operating
system installation has completed
successfully
once you hit on ok it's going to ask me
whether I want to reboot or it would
automatically reboot as per ok so yeah
it's automatically rebooting at this
point
you
okay now as you can see the Raspberry Pi
operating system has successfully been
installed okay so this is what your
Raspberry Pi operating system would be
looking like okay so this is raspbian as
such so there are different operating
systems that are available today for you
to install that we have discussed
already now that we've installed her as
being on our system let's look at some
of the accessories which can be used
with raspberry pi now one of the most
popular and interesting accessory to
Raspberry Pi is the sense hat okay so
that basically is a hardware attached on
top there are various hats that are
available but Censored is the most
popular because you have various onboard
sensors present here you have a
temperature humidity and pressure sensor
present here as well as a gyroscope and
a joystick also present here apart from
this the reason that it is quite popular
is because it has an 8 cross 8 LED
matrix display that is present to it so
let me just switch over and show you the
sense hat component as well and ok so
here you can see the sensor now how it
is slightly different from the other
accessories is because it's got an 8
cross 8 LED matrix present here which
can be used for displaying various
things and we will also be seeing how
you can display this as well now coming
on to the other components here now if
you see here it's already got multiple
sensors here it's got an axle ohmmeter
our gyroscope meter present here it's
also got which is this part the axle and
gyro meter present here so you can see
it's got a labeling asma then you have a
humidity pressure and temperature sensor
onboard with respect to this and it's
quite interesting and useful as well now
one of the easiest things with respect
to this is that it can directly be
placed on top of the raspberry PI's GPIO
pins and thereby making it quite easy to
assemble it as well so it directly sits
on top of the GPIO pins as well so this
is something which makes the entire
Raspberry Pi eco system quite easy and
effect one other interesting key point
or factor that makes the sensor quite
interesting is that it's got an on-board
joystick as well so in case if you are a
gamer and you want to try out the games
on Raspberry Pi he didn't use this
joystick as such now another additional
component that most people use with
Raspberry Pi is the camera now in 2013
itself one year after Raspberry Pi 1 was
launched it had introduced a Raspberry
Pi camera along with the
we're update as well now the respite
camp is basically an 8 megapixel camera
and can directly be connected to the CSI
port present on the Raspberry Pi itself
now it's also very interesting and can
record up to thousand ATP videos as well
so moving forward let's also look at the
infrared camera so this is a very
interesting thing so this was something
that helps you capture video in infrared
mode and it's called pine oil ok so
again these components can be bought
online and is one of the most easily
bible now the final accessory and one of
the most interesting and essential
accessory to the Raspberry Pi is the
GERD port now basically it is used for
educational purpose and it helps you
expand the operations done using the
general input/output pins here so using
this you can connect to various LEDs
which is analog devices sensors and much
more this also helps you connect to
Audrina
which is also another dy I hardware
device which has gained a lot of
popularity but in comparison to
raspberry pack original is still growing
stitch moving on let's begin with our
sensor tutorial and what we'll be doing
is we'll be exploring five different
demos to understand how the sense heart
component can be used effectively now
the first thing that we'll be doing is
we'll be implementing a very simple code
and we'll be trying to display a certain
letter on top of the sensor ok so I'm
going to display E and D but the value
of that color is going to be generated
by random ok so let me just run you
through the code that's present here so
the first line is from censored import
cells so what it basically is doing is
that it's helping you import sensor and
establish a connection to the sense hat
component we're going to use time for
mainly sleep function and random for
generating a random integer now what I'm
doing is that I am initializing the
sensor which is sense equal to sense
that basically initializes it then what
I'm doing is that I am generating a
random integer between the range of 0 to
255
now for those of you who would have
guessed why I'm doing this
definitely this is because the RGB value
lies in this range so it's somewhere
between 0 to 255
then what I'm using is that I'm using a
censored function which is show
and then I'm specifying which letter it
needs to show and I'm going to specify
the color combination so this is the RGB
values present here okay so it's going
to show the letter E and it's going to
create a random input with respect to
that same okay then it's going to sleep
for one second again generate a new
random integer and then it is going to
show D okay so again it will sleep and
then it's gonna clear so let me just
show you this do you practically so now
what I'm going to do is that I'm going
to connect to my raspberry pi using VNC
Network so it's a virtual network which
I'm connecting it to because it's not
quite easy for me to record the video on
the Raspberry Pi so I'm going to use VNC
server for that and I'll just give you a
simple idea of how you can connect to
VNC server to your Raspberry Pi as well
now one essential thing that if you are
connecting to the VNC server then you
both need to be on the same network okay
so what I've done is that I have used a
hotspot connected both my raspberry pi
and my laptop to the same network so in
case you are wondering how to connect to
your raspberry pi wire remote server
this is how you do it just go to your
settings go to preferences you have
raspberry pi configuration here now in
your interfaces make sure that V and C
is enable once you've done this then VNC
server gets enable and on to your system
just download VNC server and we and C
viewer and you can connect your
raspberry pi quite easily okay so let me
just show you the code which we're going
to be executing now it's the same that
we have seen earlier so let me just make
a small modification to this
so this is our code again as we have
seen we are first initializing the sense
ID with sense equal to censored then we
are generating a random integer and then
we're showing a letter e on that so let
me just change this let me just set it
to zero
and let me just copy this once more and
I'll also show a third combination here
as well
so I'm just generating a random value
between 0 to 255 and I'm displaying
based on that color letter II D and F
okay so let me just save this once so
let me show you the output that is going
to be displayed on the sense hat as well
so so let me just execute the program
okay now let me just switch over to the
sense art so that you can see the output
it's a red e a green D and a blue F as
well so this is what so based on the
inputs that I have given it has
displayed a certain letter on the
censored LED display as well so let's go
back to our presentation and look at the
next program that is involved here so
the next program basically is going to
display an image now what it does here
is that it basically is going to display
an image that gives you a complete idea
of the various color combinations
possible on the sense at as well so what
I've basically done is that I've
identified the RGB colors red orange
yellow green blue indigo violet and E
stands for empty which is not OK and
based on this I have created a random
matrix here but each of these values
defines for a pixel of the sensor now as
I have mentioned to you earlier this is
an 8 cross 8 LED matrix so each of these
values is for one of the individual
pixels themselves and with respect to
how they start the numbering starts from
left top position so accordingly it goes
in a row by row manner okay so let me
just show you the output for this as ba
so this is our program and let me
execute this I'm sure
and now let me just switch over to the
Raspberry Pi
so here you can see the different color
combinations that are present on the
Raspberry Pi sensor the first row was
left completely empty the next row has
two R values present here so this is how
it has been defined if you notice the
code here there are two R's
following by three empty spaces and
before that also if you can consider
three empty spaces that is one row so
every specific value is pertaining to
one specific row as such now coming back
to our presentation so the third one is
quite interesting what we're basically
going to do here is that we are going to
rotate a letter based on the different
orientation of the screen so let me show
you how this is done rather than just
tell it you
so what we're basically going to do here
is that we're going to rotate a letter J
on different angles as well so we've
defined the different angles 0 90 180
270 and these are the various angles
which is going to rotate for okay I'm
going to run a for loop where it rotates
the same on different angles as well so
let me show you that so just let me add
some start here here now the reason I'm
doing that is mainly to ensure that the
sense hat is cleared after the rotation
process so let's execute this let me
switch over to the raspberry pi and if
you see here a J has been displayed and
it's rotating okay it has stopped so let
me just rerun this once again so what is
happening here is that I am rotating the
letter J by 90 degrees and it's
completing two complete circles on the
raspberry pi okay so it's a very simple
thing but it's important that you
understand how this is done because what
we're basically doing is that we are
setting the rotation using this sensor
okay and then we're sleeping at point
zero five milliseconds as well now I did
you can increase the delay here you can
change the letter here you can even
change the angle to understand how it
works as well so this is something that
you should definitely explore about and
get a better understanding with coming
down the next and most basic thing that
you can do using sensor is that you can
measure the temperature pressure and
humidity so we've already tried to do
this in our previous session as well
where we've measured the temperature the
pressure and the humidity now here I'm
just rounding it off and based on a
specific value I am going to ensure
whether the display is going to be red
or green as well so let me come back to
my sense at let me just open the code
and we will modify this on the go to get
a better understanding
let me explain the code once again so
first I'm establishing a connection to
the sensor then I'm running an infinite
loop where I'm getting the temperature
the pressure the humidity I'm rounding
it off and if the temperature is about
36 so this is just a value that I have
set then the background color should be
green and the color of the text should
be complete white ok so this is a simple
modification I have made else in normal
situation if it is less than 36 degrees
then what it should be is that it should
have a background color of blue and the
text color should be yellow so this is
basically to help me identify the
different radius then I'm creating a
message variable which is storing the
following format where temperature is
equal to temperature value pressure is
equal to pressure value and humidity is
equal to the humidity back finally I'm
going to show this message on my
censored LED display screen so let's
just see how this works
and execute the program so let me just
execute the program and let me also
switch over to the Raspberry Pi so here
let's begin with the execution of the
code so now you can see by default it is
having a blue background and the text is
actually in yellow ok so if you would
have noticed the temperature is about 34
degrees centigrade so to this letter or
scroll once more let's just validate the
value of temperature you can also print
this into the screen you can also send
it by an API and much more
so if you can see it's thirty four point
two degree centigrade now to this what
I'm going to do basically is that I'm
just going to introduced a hot water
source okay so I'm just trying to raise
the temperature here so let me just
shift a little bit and please keep a
note on the temperature value
so the temperature has started rising
you
so it is taking some time I think the
water has cooled down a bit
I all right so it's started now the
color background color has changed from
blue to green and the text color has
changed from yellow to white as well now
these can be used in critical measure
environments as well so let's say you
are in a situation or in an environment
where you need to have a constant
monitor and constantly be aware with
respect to the environment change in
example like space or any other
environment that you're working with
definitely these are certain things that
can really be important and helpful as
well
so coming back lets us look at the last
program of the sense ash tutorial which
is basically detecting the motion of the
sense at now what I'm basically going to
do here is that I am going to rotate my
sensor and I'm going to identify the
value of pitch rule and Jana basically
these are the orientation with respect
to the x axis y axis and z axis and this
is just from the orientation of the
sensor as well now this is mainly done
using the gyroscope but to get a better
understanding and more precise value
will also try to include and incorporate
the accelerometer as well so let me come
here let me just show you the program so
this is the program as well so let me
just stop the execution here so as I had
mentioned this is going to run infinite
number of times because the while
statement here is indefinite so let me
just stop this and let me just run the
orientation program and let's just see
the default values of pitch yaw and roll
first so now by default if you see pitch
is about zero rule is about 96 and yawn
is about zero itself now let me just
switch over to the sense at and what I'm
going to do parallely is that let me try
radiating the value of the sensor as
well or let me try rotating the sensor
to give you a better understanding of
how it works simultaneously you can also
see the change in pitch yaw and roll so
if you see here I am slightly lifting it
and the value of which has risen from 0
to 6 roll also has changed John also has
change I'm going to try elting it see
him pitch roll and yaw also has changed
so I'm just tilting it with respect to
various accesses and you can see the
change here
do you notice the changes I definitely
hope you do okay so now let us actually
stop the execution of this program
because this is also an infinite loop
and to same orientation program let us
actually try to incorporate the axial
ohmmeter and understand how more precise
we can make now instead of just taking
the pitch roll and yaw on I'm here going
to directly take the value of
acceleration here we had taken the value
of orientation and here we want to take
the value of acceleration okay how
basically the first is with respect to
the gravitational force that acts on us
so now let me just show you the code
here now again what you need to
understand the difference between gyro
measure and axelrod measure is just that
it senses both the static as well as
dynamic change with respect to that but
your gyroscope mainly measures the
rotation of a specific device as such
okay so let me just execute this program
as wha
so let me just first begin by clearing
the screen and then we'll execute the
code once again so let's just execute
the acceleration code to get a better
understanding and simultaneously what
I'll do is that I'll just show you how
the change with respect to the accesses
or how you if you change the raspberrypi
how the value will also change so by
default if you can see the value of x is
0 the value of y is also 0 and z is 1 so
now what I'm going to do is that let me
begin by slightly rotating the raspberry
pi now if I change the raspberry pi into
a vertical position like this okay so
it's a perfectly vertical position but
if you notice the value of x it has
become minus 1 okay Y has become 0 and Z
has become 0 same time if I rotate it in
such a manner I'm just keeping it on
different axis the value of x becomes
plus 1 instead of minus 1 same with
respect to Y if I change it in such a
horizontal way it is minus 1 and if I
change it in such a manner then it
becomes plus 1 ok
if you flip it completely over then the
value of Z becomes minus one as well so
if this is the vertical err position
then the value of Z remains one I hope
this is clear for you guys so again
these are all different parameters today
what I have done as part of this is that
I have just helped you understand how
you can explore the various parameters
and various components that are
associated to the raspberry pi sin site
as well now how you use it and what you
use it for is completely left to you
these are just some of the basic things
that you can do using raspberry pi the
limitation of raspberry pi stops where
your imagination stops now moving
forward let's look at the most important
part and the interesting part of today's
session which is basically the demo
using raspberry pi so what we're going
to do here is that we're going to try to
create a motion detection system so
we're going to build a security camera
system which detects the motion in front
of it and it captures an event based on
this so how it does is that first you're
going to store an initial frame so this
is going to be my reference so here
image is going to get converted to the
option blur image so this is going to be
a grayscale image actually hadn't going
to get converted to Gaussian blur and
simultaneously it's going to take a
frame with object once the initial frame
is set then what it's going to do is
that it's going to take the frame with
any changes and then it's going to
convert it to Gaussian blur image so
this is going to be my reference so once
I do that then I'm going to take the
difference between the initial frame and
the converted Gaussian blur image and if
there is a difference detected I'm going
to save this image if not I'm just going
to keep checking for any change with
respect to that so let me just show you
the code here
now for this we are going to use Android
IP cam web application okay so this can
be downloaded from the Google store let
me just show you so this is the
application that we are going to be
using for this demo it's IP webcam so
you can check it out on the Play Store
and I'll show you how you can identify
and connect with this so let me come
back here
so here what you're going to do this is
the program that we are going to use for
motion detection now firstly you're
going to use import user live this is
basically to connect to the Android
device now like I had mentioned if you
want to know the IP address just launch
the application click on start server
and you'll be seeing the IP for address
which I have specified here ok then
you're going to use CB 2 and time which
is most important libraries as part of
it see we do this what we're going to
use for the image processing and I'm
also using numpy so all the images that
we are going to be storing are going to
be processed by numpy this is basically
to help us create a pixel image with
respect to the initial image taken now
as specified the URL of my IP cam and
what I'm doing here is that I am
connecting to that then what I'm going
to do is that I am going to convert it
to an umpire array and then speak in my
CV 2 dot image decode so I'm going to
begin the decoding so this is just for
your reference you can also remove this
and it will still work the same ok now
what I have done here is that I have
initialized my value of I to be 0 now
this is something that is quite
interesting and important to remember
then I'm going to run an infinite wire
loop now here I'm just doing the same
thing I'm just connecting to my IP camp
I am going to take the image into an
umpire format and I am going to decode
and then what I'm going to do is that
I'm going to convert the initial color
image to grayscale now before I create a
Gaussian blur I need to create a
grayscale image so that's why I'm going
to first convert the color image to a
gray image then what I'm going to do is
that I'm going to create a Gaussian blur
image where it I'm going to specify the
grayscale image then 2121 is basically
the frame size and 0 is just a parameter
then what I'm going to see is that I'm
going to first check if there is a first
frame define if there isn't then the
Gaussian blur image is going to become
my first frame and then I am going to go
back into the loop to
take the next image if not then I'm
going to execute the following code
now once I have identified this then
what I'm going to do is that I'm going
to find the difference between the same
okay so if I have not defined the first
frame then I'll assign the greyscale
image I have this taken asked the first
image if not then what I do is that I'll
identify the difference between the
first frame and the greyscale image that
I have taken then what I will do is that
I will define a threshold here now the
idea of defining a threshold is that if
an object does not occupy a minimum of
30 pixels okay then it's not worth
capturing in camera so what I am
drilling is that if it is less than 30
pixels then make it white that's what
this function does here okay so if it is
less than 30 pixels ignore it and change
it to white color okay and then what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to dilate
the image using the C v2 dot dilate and
what I'm doing here is that I'm just
making the image a slightly more sharper
and precise image with respect to that
now the function C v2 dot fine contour
is what it does basically is that it
helps you make your image sharper
basically it creates a curve that joins
all the continuous points or the
boundaries and make it a sharper image
with respect to that same
so I've dilated the image now I need to
sharpen it with respect to that and then
what is happening is that it's going to
show me the frame of the image as well
so I'm just going to define a condition
where if it is less than 1 lakh then I
am NOT going to take the picture but if
it is then I'm going to define a
boundary okay and then I am going to
capture it with respect to an image ok
so let me just run this and first let's
establish the first frame and it will
show me the frame as well okay so the
first frame is getting initialized here
let's just have a look at the first
frame
all right so what it is doing at this
moment is that it's actually
initializing the first frame so that it
can have a reference with respect to
that say okay so I have a friend who is
just opening the door and we are trying
to capture the detection from that and
let's just see how this I said now we've
defined cue to exit from this frame so
let's just come back to this and let me
just try to close it okay
this certain times does happen that it
gets stuck because sometimes what
happens is the reference frame slightly
becomes different but let's just look at
the images and it has started capturing
the images okay so let me just show you
a simple idea of how it has captured the
images okay so as you can see it has
captured all the motion that was beyond
the frame as well and it is also created
a frame in respect to the motion
wherever it has detected so this can be
further modified for any future
references wherein you can also improve
this for a face detection system and so
forth as well so let's go back and with
this let's come to a conclusion of this
