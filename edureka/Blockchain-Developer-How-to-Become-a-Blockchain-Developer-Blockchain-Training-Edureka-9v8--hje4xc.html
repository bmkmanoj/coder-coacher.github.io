Eddie Rica I welcome you all to this
demo session revolving around the topic
of blockchain developer now before I
proceed into the session could all of
you just put a quick confirmation as to
whether you can hear me or not
okay so seems like pretty nice right II
octa T is ready a shank is ready it
seems like everybody's ready so perfect
so let's jump into today's session so
let me give you guys a quick brief on
the topics I intend to cover by the end
of this session we will be discussing
who a blotching developer is the
different types of blockchain developers
companies hiring blockchain developers
and their pay scales apart from all this
we'll also be discussing how you could
bootstrap your own career as a
blockchain developer now let's begin
today's session so who exactly is a
blockchain developer I've been asked
this question quite a few times and it
seems like there's some sort of
confusion as to what kinds of
development does a block scene developer
really do and in all seriousness it's
pretty easy to get confused with so many
types of developers in the industry
right now so a blockchain developer is a
person who is generally developing
applications using blocks in technology
apart from that rock scene developers
also develop new design features for
blockchain networks they are constantly
tweaking the blocks in architecture for
performance optimizations and many such
development related stuff regarding
blockchain so basically a developer who
develops apps using blockchain
technology and the people fiddling
around with the architecture and design
models of blockchain account blockchain
developers now that I've told you guys
who are blocks in developers let's go
through the types of blocks in
developers as you can see there are two
major types of blockchain developers
core blockchain developers and
blockchain software developer core
blocks in developers generally are
involved in developing the architecture
for blockchain networks and dealing with
the different protocols and design
features on the other hand blockchain
software developers use the architecture
designed by the core blocks in
developers to build decentralized
applications running on blockchain
technology the two roles can be compared
to a cold web developer and a web
developer where code of developers are
involved in the development of protocols
like HTTP and SSL and the network
architecture while simple web developers
use this architecture to build
applications on top of it
okay so it seems like Brianna here has a
really interesting question she is
asking whether a blockchain software
developer can become a core blockchain
developer so to answer your question
pray now yes a blockchain software
developer can purely become a core
blockchain developer but this only
happens after a lot of time and
experience this is because their
respective rules are quite different
while blockchain software developers
tackle blockchain from an application
perspective the core blocks in
developers stop the blockchain from an
architectural perspective I hope I was
able to answer a question free enough
now let's discuss the different rules of
the types of blocks in developers that
we discussed so starting off with core
blockchain developers these are the guys
that create the blueprint of the entire
network they create the block schema
which basically means what kind of
information goes into every block above
that they also create the protocols that
run the entire network building
generalized and flexible protocols is
key to the stability and success of a
blockchain network leaving all this
aside a code blockchain developer also
acts as a supervisor of the development
of the whole network so as you all can
see a core blocks in developer is a
pretty integral part of any blockchain
development theme moving on to
blockchain software developers these
guys are generally involved in making
applications using blockchain technology
their roles include developing smart
contracts creating interactive front-end
designs for their applications they also
develop the backend for their
applications and the supervision of the
entire stack of frameworks and
technologies comes under these guys ok
so it seems Vishal here has posted
another question in the chat box I find
myself coming across this question from
a lot of people so Vishal here is asking
whether a non-technical person can
pursue a career in blockchain well which
I'll it should be pretty obvious that
someone from a non-technical background
will have a really hard time
understanding the development
perspective of blockchain so choosing
blockchain to make a courier would be an
unwise decision I hope that answers your
question Vishal
okay so moving forward with the session
let us discuss the technical skills
required to become a blocking develop
first and foremost people striving to
become a blockchain developer should
definitely know the general blocks in
architecture the best way to do this is
to go through the white paper written by
Seth
nakamoto regarding the Bitcoin
blockchain network the white paper has
explained the working of the entire
technology to the tiniest detail
secondly an in-depth understanding an
applicative knowledge of data structures
is a must
blockchain uses a lot of data structures
in conjunction to create a secure and
immutable system without understanding
how things like Merkle tree is linked
lists and starts work it is impossible
to become a blockchain developer along
with data structures basic knowledge of
cryptography is also required to
understand concepts like this -
signatures and proof of look I hope you
guys are keeping up with me a quick
confirmation in the chat box will be
trade ok so it seems like everybody is
on the same page as I am so moving ahead
with the session we also need to learn a
language of telephone for smart
contracts smart contracts allow logic to
be implemented on the blockchain which
opens up blockchain technology to be
used in fields where it was not
previously possible smart contracts are
generally developed in network specific
languages for example if helium smart
contracts are written in solidity while
hyper largest Marc contracts are written
in chain code learning these languages
should be fairly easy if you have any
experience with object-oriented
programming last but not the least you
must also have some basic knowledge of
web development your first step as a
blockchain developer will be creating
applications that use blockchain
technology so for this you guys should
know things like API handling request
handling setting up interactive UI is
handling your back-end and such are the
work now that I've told you all how to
become a blockchain developer let's see
the companies that are interested in
hiring these guys
studies have shown upward trends and
fortune 500 companies like IBM Accenture
and Capgemini with job openings for
blocks in developers not only fortune
500 companies but even startups like Pia
Nova applied blockchain and BTL are on
the hunt for blockchain developers and
these companies are also offering some
really generous salaries the average
salary of a cold blockchain developer is
somewhere around $100,000 a year while
blockchain software developers own
somewhere around an average of $70,000
for you now that I've told you all who
is a blockchain developer and how to
become one yourself you guys must have
realized as it's definitely not an easy
job
there's a lot to learn and it's really
easy to get lost Adira cast blockchain
course provides you with a structured
and modular way to learn blockchain
development you will be topics ranging
from blockchain architecture to smart
contract development and even setting up
your own private blockchain network
