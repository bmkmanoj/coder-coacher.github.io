first need to know what a computer is
and how it functions so what is a
computer the
definition says a computer is an
electronic device which can perform a
set of tasks based on the instructions
given to it sounds really complicated
isn't it but he can think of a computer
to be very similar to a friend let's say
you want your friend to do you a favor
you would just tell him what he needs to
do and how it should be done now if
you're not clear in communicating to him
as to what he needs to do that he might
just land up doing something totally
different from what you wanted him to do
let's say you wanted your friends help
to propose to a girl you really like but
you messed up while pointing the girl
out but he meant just land up proposing
the wrong girl and for all you know this
girl might even be someone you hate so
you really don't want to mess up while
trying to tell what you really want
computers are also very similar if you
want the computer to perform some task
then you need to tell it clearly as to
what it needs to do so what do we mean
by clarity to have clarity in any task
there are three components involved
there is the input
that is the task itself and then there
is the output in this example input is
the girl the task is proposing and the
output could either be a slap or a smile
now there is one small difference
between a computer and your friend
computers are really really stupid
they are like three year old kid so even
if you have told the computer as to what
it needs to do you would have to tell it
step by step as to how it needs to be
done so the task that the computer has
to perform has to be explained to it in
every step so for example in Kayla
proposing a three year old kid does not
know what proposing means you'll have to
exactly tell him as to what words to
tell the girl how to do it maybe take a
chocolate maybe take a bunch of roses
but you will have to tell him every step
that he needs to do that's exactly how
computers are so the function of a
computer is very simple it's a device
that can perform tasks for you really
fast but you need to instruct it every
step that it needs to do now we know
what a computer is let's see what is
inside this computer okay so what is a
computer made of we know that the heart
of the computer is the CPU also you can
see that you have something called the
keyboard or the mouse right in front of
you
so the keyboard or the mouse are the
input devices and then you have the
monitor which is the output device also
you have heard of the term called RAM or
random access memory which is also
called the main memory now we know what
the computer is made of so let's see how
these components interact with each
other the CPU as you know it is the
heart of the computer and it is
responsible for executing all the
instructions that are given by you in
the form of a program or an application
the program or the application could be
sitting on a hard disk the hard disk
acts as both an input or an output
device because you can get instructions
from the hard disk and at the same time
can also store the results on the hard
so let's say you have a program stored
on the hard disk the CPU would fetch the
instructions from the hard disk and copy
the instructions through the main memory
it would then fetch one instruction at a
time from main memory and execute it
during this whole process the CPU also
uses the main memory to store
intermediate results now you might
wonder as to why do we need the main
memory when everything we need is
already present on the disk the CPU
could just read the instructions from
the disk directly and stow intermediate
results on the disk - then why do we
need the main memory the speed of the
main memory is many times faster than
that of the hard disk making
applications run really fast if the CPU
were to fetch all this from the hard
disk every time then the applications
today would be a million times slower
now what is the purpose of the input of
the output device the instructions of
the CPU needs to execute is gonna come
from the input device which could either
be directly from the user from the
keyboard or it could come from a hard
disk - and finally after all the
processing the CPU needs to send the
output somewhere which could be a
monitor or the hard disk again which is
again an output device now the input
that comes to the CPU consists of two
parts the input pencils of the data and
the instruction what do we mean by these
two terms let's say you want the
computer to add 45 and 56 the
instruction that you're giving to the
CPU is add two numbers the data you're
sending the CPU are the numbers 45 and
56 so any instruction or any input that
comes to the CPU always comes in two
forms that is the data part and the
instruction part I have now given you a
quick summary or the basic components of
a computer
now while writing programs the most
important part you need to worry about
is the main memory that everything
finally sits in memory before it is
executed by the CPU so let us try and
understand what the memory looks like
for this let's imagine a huge piece of
land
okay consisting of equal size plots
let's say there are about 200 plots on
this piece of land
and each of these plots are numbered
starting from one so this is block
number one have plot number two your
plot number three and so on and took
plot number 200 so now a house
constructed on plot number one we'd have
the address 1 similarly house
construction on let's say plot number
20 would have the address 20 of course
some people want a bigger house so they
may buy four plots together so let's say
somebody wants to consider a big house
by the plots 65 66 67 and 68
how's it races of course 65 because his
plot starts at number 65 the next person
who once purchase a plot by his plot
number 69 and his house address is 69
the main memory looks exactly the same
it's like a huge piece of land consider
multiple plots but in this case it's a
equal sized equal size plots are called
cells or bytes so the main memory also
consists of equal sized cells and they
call bytes the difference is the
numbering here starts from 0 so the
first cell is 0 then 1 2 3
so if you have a memory of one kilobyte
in capacity one KB is nothing but one
zero two four bytes in that case the
numbering would go from one start from
zero and will go up to 1 0 to 3 the last
byte would have the address 1 0 to 3 0
to 1 0 to 3 is nothing but finally
thousand 24 bytes so this is what the
memory would look like for a ram with 1
KB capacity now each cell or byte in
memory consists of 8 bits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8
each of these bits get either stored or
0 or a 1 so if you look at the entire
main memory it only consists of zeros
and ones is these zeros and ones
together that give us meaningful data
that is stored at a particular location
so let's say I want to store the number
15 at address 6 so we have 3 we have 4 5
6 so at this location address 6 would
mean it's actually the 7th byte 2 3 4 5
6 7 because the numbering starts from 0
the 6th address is actually the seventh
byte so let's say I want to store the
number 15 at address 6 then what you
will see is that cell or byte would be
the number 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 that is the
binary equivalent of the decimal number
15 so finally at cell 6
the 8 bit would contain the first bit
will be 0 second bit will be 0 third bit
will be 0 the fourth bit will be 0 the
5th 6th 7th and 8th bits would all be
once so as you can see the main memory
is similar to a large piece of land with
multiple plots with each of the plots
number in sequential order
now that we understood what the memory
is made of let's move on to understand
the heart of the computer which is the
CPU
you might have heard of
bitch
64-bit CPUs to understand many concepts
of programming we need to understand the
difference between a 32-bit and 64-bit
CPU the meaning of a 32-bit CPU is that
the CPU itself to do the CPU has about
32 bits to store an address location 32
bits means 4 bytes so we have about 4
bytes in our CPU
to store some address location which is
in memory now why is the purpose of
these four bytes to understand this we
need to understand some basics about
bits a single bit can either store or 0
or the one I cannot represent the
numbers 2 3 4 X which are using a single
bit because to represent the number 2 I
need 2 bits to represent number 3 also I
need two bits to represent number 4 I
need
three bits and so on so we're just one
bit I can only live in the number zero
or the number one the largest number I
can represent is one which is nothing
but two to the power of one minus one
the symbol over here is ^ now similarly
let's say we have two bits it's two bits
I can represent the numbers 0 0 0 1 1 0
1/1
so I can represent four different
numbers and the largest number I can
represent is the number three that is 1
1 which is nothing but 2 to the power of
2 minus 1 similarly let's say I was
given 3 bits
as per this mat the largest number I can
represent is two to the power of three
minus one
the 4/4 to the 8 minus 1 is 7 which is
also correct because the 3 bits largest
number you can represent is 1 1 1 in
decimal this is equal into 7 so going
with the same math if you have n bits
the largest number you can represent
using n bits is 2 to the power of n
minus 1
to have a better understanding of the
binary number system kindly go to the
Wikipedia page for the binary numeral
system now if you CPU has 32 bits to
store an address the largest address it
can store is you just learnt the 32 bits
the largest address you can store is 2
to the power of 32 minus 1 this is the
largest number the CPU can store in the
4 bytes that it has this is nothing but
4 - 9 4 9 6 7 2 9 6 this means we can
have a memory with so many bytes which
is nothing but 4 GB hence with 32 bit
CPU you can only have a maximum Ram of
4gb but these days 4gb is hardly enough
to play games or make movies this is why
we now have 64 bit CPUs this has helped
us to have memory that can go beyond 4gb
and can go up to 2 ^ 64 minus 1 which is
extremely large number and should
suffice for a number of decades to come
the CPU basically fetches all your
instructions or the data from main
memory the address from which has to
fetch are stored on these four bytes
so we're just a little bit's the cpu can
go up to an address of 4gb if the main
memory was greater than 4gb it can never
access that part of the memory as it
cannot store that address in the in his
memory location you understand this
better let's analyze that your life
scenario let's go back to our example of
the land so I have a huge piece of land
with about 200 plots now I send a
three-year-old kid to this huge land and
asked him to go to plot number 145 let's
save it over here the plots are all
numbered sequentially so it should not
be a problem finding plot number 145 the
problem is that this three-year-old kid
does not know counting beyond 99 so if
you send into this plot he would go
sequentially and he would stop at plot
99 after that the number 100 101 102 etc
do not make any sense to him so he has
no idea what to do
exactly how a 3-2 bit CPU is 32 bit CPU
knows counting until 4gb
after 4gb the CPU cannot store the
address in his memory so all the memory
beyond 4gb would be useless so now you
understood the difference between a
32-bit CPU and a 64-bit CPU to be a
great programmer you really need to
understand the binary number system so
please don't forget to go through the
Wikipedia link provided earlier
this chapter we're gonna teach you the
basic difference between giving an
instruction to a friend and giving an
instruction to a computer as they
discussed in the previous chapter you
need to think of a computer as a
three-year-old kid
and break down your instructions to the
smallest step possible so we're going to
take a real-life example to help you
understand what I mean by breaking down
their instructions to small steps in
this chapter you're going to learn two
basic concepts one given a task how to
break it down into small steps and the
necessity to actually break it down and
write it down as an algorithm
so before we start explaining the
concepts let's take out your life
example okay so let's say the semester
results have just been announced and
you're unable to go to college to see
your rank so you ask your friend to
check your rank on the college board so
you have a board in college basically
starting from rank number one
it'll have names the first name has a
rank number one second name has ranked
number two and so on and so forth and
the task here is your friend has to go
up to the board search for your name
check what the rank is decided so this
is like one two three four search we all
named this board check what the rank is
and come and tell you so let's see how
will you give these instructions to your
friend I'm going to split the screen now
in two halves to show you in 1/2 as to
what the steps are going to be to your
friend and the second half we're going
to talk about how the steps are going to
be explained to the computer okay this
half we're going to have the
instructions to a friend and here
my right side will have instructions to
the computer
ok so let's first start with the
instructions to a friend the first thing
you're gonna tell them is go to the
College Board what the second step he
needs to do search for my name on the
board and finally check the rank against
my name that's it and the task is done
so these are instructions you would give
to a friend you don't have to explain
anything more than this now the same
instructions will not work with the
computer let's see why go to the College
booted okay
you can if a computer understands this
or even let's say we're talking about a
three-year-old kid you can tell them go
up to the college Budaj is fine now the
problem is the second step when we say
search for my name the term search does
not make any sense to a computer he does
not know what search means well let's
say a three year old kid who is then
understand the term search what are you
gonna tell him how do you explain to him
if you just tell him go search for my
name what does he do he doesn't know
give me the random me stare at the board
and come back so the second step needs
to be broken down into smaller set of
steps to explain what we mean or how to
actually search for the name on the
board so now let's see how we write the
instructions to the computer okay the
first step to the computer is similar
let's say go to the College Board the
second step like you mentioned search
for my name will not be understood by
the computer so you will have to break
this down how do you break down search
for my name we go tell it one by one
what does it need to do read the first
name on the board
now if this name that is red is your
name then good check the rank and come
back if this is my name see rank and
come back now if this is not your name
what does he need to do needs to read
the next name so read the next name what
happens after visa next name he needs to
again check whether it's your name so
which is nothing but step 3 again so
we're gonna keep repeating step 3 and
step 4 till what time till you find my
name so we repeat the above two steps
until you find my name so these are the
instructions to the computer so as you
can see we had to break down steps 2 &amp;amp; 3
into 3 extra steps so now instead of 3
steps we have 5 steps but then the whole
term search had to be explaining how do
we search so as you can see we have now
explained the steps or how to search for
a name breaking down of a task into
smaller steps is called an algorithm so
basically an algorithm is the steps of
how to solve the problem so any program
that you're asked to write you should
know of 3 things
what is the program need as input 2 what
is the task to be performed by the
program and 3 what is the output
expected from the program once you have
these three things you can write an
algorithm in plain English for the task
that needs to be performed so in the
example above input was my name
the task was to search for my name and
finally the output is my rank it's
always a good practice to write down the
algorithm before you start writing the
program itself as an algorithm is always
in plain English and as humans it's
easier for us to think in English rather
than in the programming language so once
you have an algorithm in place each step
in the algorithm would get converted to
a line or a set of lines in your
programming language okay to get the
concept of algorithms more clear let's
try a few more examples
the next example would be to tell a
friend how to boil water in a kettle
boil water in a kettle
before we start writing the algorithm
for this we first need to figure out
three things like I mentioned earlier
first we need to know what the input is
in this case we know that the input is
the kettle itself and there is water now
what is it tasks to be performed there
are two tasks here boiling water is one
task and what is the other one you need
to fill up the kettle with water fill up
the kettle
and finally we have the output in this
case the output is boiled water like in
the previous example you're going to
first start with instructions to a
friend the instructions to a friend are
pretty straightforward one is ask him to
fill the kettle with water water to
place it on the stove and turn on the
burner and finally three turn off the
burner
then the water starts boiling starts
boiling the last two steps basically
tells you about the task of how to boil
the water the first step does tells him
to fill up the kettle with water now
again like I said earlier these three
steps will not work for the computer why
mainly because the task fill the kettle
with water does not make sense when you
say fill up the kettle with water the
computer does not understand what you
mean but fill up a fill-up could be 100%
to the brim it could be 98% of the
kettle 90% of the kettle it could be 50%
of the kettle when you're talking to a
computer you need to specify exactly how
much water you need to fill up so the
first step needs to be broken down place
it on the stove and turn on the burner
is straightforward
then finally turn off the burner when
the water starts boiling to the computer
you need to define again what is boiling
in this case we say it turn off the
burner and the water it's hundred degree
Celsius so let's see how the
instructions to the computer so first
task fill up the kettle with water we
need to break it down so if you have to
break it down one of the first starts
now put the kettle on to the top
under the top now what's the second step
turn on the tap the third step will be
check if the kettle is filled with water
would we mean by filled with water in
our key we'll say 90% of the kettle then
we turn off the tap so check if the
kettle is filled to 90% if it's not we
just say repeat the above step so you'll
keep bringing the above step until it's
filled with 90% of water
once that's done say close the tap now
you've done the first step of filling
the kettle with water what's next
place the kettle on the burner the
burner then we have turn on the burner
now the final step again we will specify
what we mean by boiling so we just check
if the water is 100 degrees Celsius if
it's not repeat the above step either
what has touched hundred degrees we
should have a turn off the burner so
these are the steps that are going to
tell the computer if you need it to boil
a kettle of water so I'm sure it
explained earlier first we started
breaking down the problem into input the
task and the output once we had the
three data in place we then sat down and
wrote the algorithm for the task to be
performed the two tasks were filling up
the kettle earth water and boiling the
water so we wrote the algorithms of both
of them and you put the steps together
you had the entire problem solved okay
so let's do one final example the reason
we are doing this so many times is
because beginners generally have one
tough problem which is grasping the
concept of steps or algorithm they
always wonder why do you need an
algorithm given a problem they start
thinking of writing the program directly
and fail miserably because your brain
does not work like a program so once you
break down the given task into a set of
steps in plain English the mapping each
step to a code makes it very simple so
let's take one final example which may
go for the ladies so let's say we want
to go shopping on NZ road we want to buy
a red colored shoe but maybe a boar on
it and from the butter showroom 1mg road
so let's call this shopping on
MG Road well the first thing that we
need to do we need to know what is the
input the scale input is but I should
rule that is the name of the shot and we
have mg road so we have the name of the
road then we have the color of the shoe
which is red we could describe other
stuff like shiny let's not make it
complicated so let's stick to a red shoe
and let's say we one size five to size
of the shoe so we have the input or the
task the task is to go shopping and
finally what is the output output is the
shoe itself if you find it now before we
start writing the algorithm for the task
let's look at the problem
diagrammatically so let's say this is
your road
this is mg road and you have shops along
this side you know multiple shops and
this is your friend who's gonna start
shopping from start off mg road so
what's he gonna do he's gonna basically
walked on MG Road looking at one shop at
a time and when he finds let's say this
is the bala showroom when he finds the
Polish butter showroom he goes in ask
them for the shoe that he's looking for
and walks out if he finds it the task is
simple so we had to ask a friend to do
it he's just gonna tell him go to mg
road go to the Bala showroom find me a
red colored shoe size five and come back
simple and straightforward so I'm not
gonna spend time writing the algorithm
for the friend so let's start with the
algorithm for the computer okay so what
are the first thing that the computer
needs to do walk through the first shop
and MG Road where the next step check if
this is a Potter showroom if it is then
you enter the shop and ask for or let
shoe size 5 if he has it you buy the
shoe and come back now what if this was
not a bata shoe room in that case you
just go to the next shop and the new
back two step repeat from step two go to
the next shop I gave me check it to the
Bala showroom if it is enter the shop as
further let's choose size five buy this
shoe and come back if it's not about a
showroom you again go back you come to
step five and then you go back to step
two okay the reason I'm making you
practice writing algorithms is that
given a problem for a programming
language you don't have to really write
down the algorithm on paper but if you
have the algorithm in your head you can
easily convert to a program but without
an algorithm writing a program becomes
extremely difficult
so getting the algorithm in your head
directly is not such an easy task so the
best way to start doing it is given a
problem start writing it down on paper
write the algorithm like what is the
input required to the program where is
it tasks to be performed by a program
what is the output
required from the program now write the
algorithm for the tasks that you're
going to perform once you have it all on
paper converting it to a program becomes
a very simple task and make it a habit
to always put down the algorithm on
paper so that over a period of time it
just comes to your head automatically
and you don't have to worry about
thinking of every step every step will
be automatic in your head just to get
used to this just pick up any of your
life example and try to convert it to
steps that you have to give to the
computer to perform the exact same task
practice it with daily tasks like so
shopping for vegetables break it down to
task just try a few examples on your own
and see if you satisfied with what
you've written that is small enough say
if you give it to a small kid and ask
him to read it he knows exactly what he
needs to do if it works then you're
almost getting there then when we start
talking about the C language or any
other programming language you easily
know how these steps get mapped into the
programming language
