Eureka and welcome to today's session on
what is machine learning as you know we
are living in a world of humans and
machines humans have been evolving and
learning from the past experience since
millions of years on the other hand the
era of machines and robots have just
begun in today's void these machines or
the robots are like they need to be
programmed before they actually follow
your instructions but what if the
Machine started to learn on their own
and this is where machine learning comes
into picture machine learning is the
core of many futuristic technological
advancement in our world today you can
see various examples or implementation
of machine learning around us such as
Tesla's self-driving car Apple Siri
Sophia AI robot and many more are there
so what exactly is machine learning
well machine learning is a subfield of
artificial intelligence that focuses on
the design of system that can learn from
and make decisions and predictions based
on the experience which is data in the
case of machines machine learning
enables computer to act and make
data-driven decisions rather than being
explicitly programmed to carry out a
certain task these programs are designed
to learn and improve over time when
exposed to new data let's move on and
discuss one of the biggest confusion of
the people in the world they think that
all the three of them the AI the machine
learning and the deep learning all are
same you know what they are wrong let me
clarify things for you artificial
intelligence is a broader concept of
machines being able to carry out tasks
in a smarter way
it covers anything which enables the
computer to behave like humans think of
a famous Turing test to determine
whether a computer is capable of
thinking like a human being or not if
you are talking to Siri on your phone
and you get an answer you are already
very close to it so this was about the
artificial intelligence now coming to
the machine learning part so as I
already said machine learning is a
subset or a current application of AI it
is based on the idea that we should be
able to give machine the access to data
and let them learn from themselves it's
a subset of artificial intelligence that
deals with the extraction of pattern
from data set
this means that the machine can not only
find the rules for optimal behavior but
also can adapt to the changes in the
world many of the algorithms involved
have been known for decades centuries
even thanks to the advances in the
computer science and parallel computing
they can now scale up to massive data
volumes so this was about the machine
learning part now coming over to deep
learning deep learning is a subset of
machine learning where similar machine
learning algorithm are used to train
deep neural networks so as to achieve
better accuracy in those cases where
former was not performing up to the map
right I hope now you understood that
machine learning AI and deep learning
all three are different okay moving on
ahead let's see in general how a machine
learning work one of the approaches is
where the machine learning algorithm is
strained using a label or unlabeled
training data set to produce a model new
input data is introduced to the machine
learning algorithm and it make
prediction based on the model the
prediction is evaluated for accuracy and
if the accuracy is acceptable the
machine learning algorithm is deployed
now if the accuracy is not acceptable
the machine learning algorithm is
strained again and again with an
argument a training data set this was
just in high-level example as there are
many more factor and other steps
involved in it now let's move on and sub
categorize the machine learning into
three different types the supervised
learning unsupervised learning and
reinforcement learning and let's see
what each of them are how they work and
how each of them is used in the field of
banking healthcare retail and other
domains don't worry I'll make sure that
I use enough examples and implementation
of all three of them to give you a
proper understanding of it so starting
with supervised learning what is it so
let's see a mathematical definition of
supervised learning supervised learning
is where you have input variables X and
an output variable Y and you use an
algorithm to learn the mapping function
from the input to the output that is y
equal FX the goal is to approximate the
mapping function so a lot whenever you
have a new input data X you could
predict the output variable that is why
for that data right I think this was
confusing for you let me simplify the
definition of supervised learning so we
can rephrase the
understanding of the mathematical
definition as a machine learning method
where each instances of a training data
set is composed of different input
attribute and an expected output the
input attributes of a training data set
can be of any kind of data it can be a
pixel of image it can be a value of a
database row or it can even be a audio
frequency histogram right for each input
instance and expected output values
associated the value can be discrete
representing a category or can be a real
or continuous value in either case the
algorithm learns the input pattern that
generates the expected output now once
the algorithm is trained it can be used
to predict the correct output of a never
seen input you can see I am age on your
screen right in this image you can see
that we are feeding raw inputs as image
of Apple to the algorithm as a part of
the algorithm we have a supervisor who
keeps on correcting the machine or who
keeps on training the machine it keeps
on telling him that yes it is a Apple no
it is not an apple things like that so
this process keeps on repeating until we
get a final train model once the model
is ready it can easily predict the
correct output of a never seen input in
this slide you can see that we are
giving an image of a green apple to the
machine and the machine can easily
identify it as yes it is an apple and it
is giving the correct result right let
me make things more clearer to you let's
discuss another example of it so in this
slide the image shows an example of a
supervised learning process used to
produce a model which is capable of
recognizing the Ducks in the image the
training data set is composed of label
picture of ducks and non ducks the
result of supervised learning process is
a predictor model which is capable of
associating a label duck or not duck to
the new image presented to the model now
once trained the resulting predictor
model can be deployed to the production
environment you can see a mobile app for
example once deployed it is ready to
recognize the new pictures right now you
might be wondering why this category of
machine learning is named as supervised
learning well it is called as supervised
learning because the process of an
algorithm learning from the training
data set can be thought of as a teacher
supervising the learning process if we
know the correct answers
Gorem iteratively makes while predicting
on the training data and is corrected by
the teacher the learning stops when the
algorithm achieves an acceptable level
of performance now let's move on and see
some of the popular supervised learning
algorithm so we have linear regression
random forests and support vector
machines these are just for your
information we'll discuss about these
algorithms in our next video now let's
see some of the popular use cases of
supervised learning so we have Co Donna
oh Donna or any other speech automation
in your mobile.phone
trains using your voice and once trained
it started working based on that
training this is an application of
supervised learning
suppose you are telling ok Google call
Sam or you say hey Siri call Sam you get
an answer to it and the action is
performed and automatically a call goes
to Sam so these are just an example of
supervised learning next comes a weather
app based on some of the prior knowledge
like when it is sunny the temperature is
higher when it is cloudy humidity is
higher any kind of that they predict the
parameters for a given time so this is
also an example of supervised learning
as we are feeding the data to the
machine and telling that whenever it is
sunny the temperature should be higher
whenever it is cloudy the humidity
should be higher so it's an example of
supervised learning
another example is biometric attendance
where you train the Machine and after
couple of inputs of your biometric
identity beat your thumb your iris or
your earlobe or anything once trained
the machine can validate your future
input and can identify you next comes in
the field of banking sector in banking
sectors supervised learning is used to
predict the creditworthiness of a credit
cardholder by building a machine
learning model to look for faulty
attributes by providing it with a data
on deliquent and non deliquent customers
next comes the healthcare sector in the
healthcare sector it is used to predict
the patient's readmission rates by
building a regression model by providing
data on the patient's treatment
administration and readmissions to show
variables that best correlate with
readmission next comes the retail sector
and retail sector it is used to analyze
a product that a customer buy together
at
as this by building a supervised model
to identify frequent itemsets and
association rule from the transactional
data now let's learn about the next
category of machine learning the
unsupervised part mathematically
unsupervised learning is where you only
have input data X and no corresponding
output variable the goal for
unsupervised learning is to model the
underlining structure or distribution in
the data in order to learn more about
the data so let me rephrase you this in
simple terms an unsupervised learning
approach the data instances of a
training data set do not have an
expected output associated to them
instead unsupervised learning algorithm
detects pattern based on init
characteristics of the input data an
example of machine learning tasks that
applies unsupervised learning is
clustering in this task similar data
instances are grouped together in order
to identify clusters of data in this
slide you can see that initially we have
different varieties of fruits as input
now these set of fruits as input X are
given to the model now once the model is
trained using unsupervised learning
algorithm the model will create clusters
on the basis of its training it will
group the similar fruits and make their
cluster let me make things more clearer
to you let's take another example of it
so in this slide the image below shows
an example of unsupervised learning
process this algorithm processes an
unlabeled training data set and based on
the characteristics it groups the
picture into three different clusters of
data
despite the ability of grouping similar
data into clusters the algorithm is not
capable to add labels to the crop the
algorithm only knows which data
instances are similar but it cannot
identify the meaning of this group so
now you might be wondering why this
category of machine learning is named as
unsupervised learning so these are
called as unsupervised learning because
unlike supervised learning ever there
are no correct answers and there is no
teacher algorithms are left on their own
to discover and present the interesting
structure in the data let's move on and
see some of the popular unsupervised
learning algorithm so we have here
k-means Apriori algorithm and
hierarchical clustering
again these are just for your
information sake we'll discuss about
these algorithms in our next video now
let's move on and see some of the
examples of unsupervised learning
suppose a friend invites you to his
party and where you meet totally
strangers
now you will classify them using
unsupervised learning as you don't have
any prior knowledge about them and this
classification can be done on the basis
of gender age group dressing education
qualification or whatever way you might
like now why this learning is different
from supervised learning since you
didn't use any past or prior knowledge
about the people you kept on classifying
them on the book as they kept on coming
you kept on classifying them yeah this
category of people belong to this group
this category of people belong to that
group and so on okay let's see one more
example let's suppose you have never
seen a football match before and by
chance you watch a video on the internet
now you can easily classify the players
on the basis of different criterion like
player wearing the same kind of jersey
or in one class player wearing different
kind of jersey are in different class or
you can classify them on the basis of
their plane style like the guys are
attacker so he is in one class he's a
defender he's in another class or you
can classify them whatever way you
observe the things so this was also an
example of unsupervised learning let's
move on and see how unsupervised
learning is used in the sectors of
banking health care undertale so
starting with banking sector so in
banking sector it is used to segment
customers by behavioral characteristic
by surveying prospects and customers to
develop multiple segments using
clustering in healthcare sector it is
used to categorize the MRI data by
normal or abnormal images it uses deep
learning techniques to build a model
that learns from different features of
images to recognize a different pattern
next is the retail sector in retail
sector it is used to recommend the
products to customer based on their past
purchases it does this by building a
collaborative filtering model based on
the past purchases by them I assume you
guys now have a proper idea of what
unsupervised learning means if you have
any slightest doubt don't hesitate and
add your doubt to the comment section so
let's discuss the third and the last
type of machine learning that is
enforcement learning so what is
reinforcement learning
well reinforcement learning is a type of
machine learning algorithm which allows
software agents and machine to
automatically determine the ideal
behavior within a specific context to
maximize its performance the
reinforcement learning is about
interaction between two elements the
environment and the learning agent the
learning agent leverages two mechanism
namely exploration and exploitation when
learning agent acts on trial and error
basis it is termed as exploration and
when it pacts based on the knowledge
gained from the environment it is
referred to as exploitation and this
environment rewards the agent for
correct actions which is reinforcement
signal leveraging the rewards obtain the
agent improves its environment knowledge
to select the next action in this image
you can see that the machine is confused
whether it is an apple or it's not an
apple then the machine is trained using
reinforcement learning if it makes
correct decision it get rewards point
for it and in case of wrong it gets a
penalty for that once the training is
done now the machine can easily identify
which one of them is an apple let's see
an example here we can see that we have
an agent who has to judge from the
environment to find out which of the two
is a duck the first task he did is to
observe the environment next he selects
some action using some policy it seems
that the machine has made a wrong
decision by choosing a bunny as a tack
so the machine will get penalty for it
for example - 50 Boeing for a wrong
answer right now the machine will update
its policy and this will continue till
the machine gets an optimal policy from
the next time machine we'll know that
bunny is not a duck let's see some of
the use cases of reinforcement learning
but before that lets see how Pablo
trained his dog using reinforcement
learning or how he applied the
reinforcement method to train his dog
Pablo integrated learning in four stages
initially Pablo gave me to his dog and
in response to the meet the dog started
salivating next what I did he created a
sound with the Bell for this the dog did
not respond anything in the third part
it tried to condition the dog by using
the Bell and then giving him
seeing the food the dog started
salivating eventually a situation came
when the dog started salivating just
after hearing the bell even if the food
was not given to him as the dog was
reinforced that whenever the master will
ring the bell he will get the food now
let's move on and see how reinforcement
learning is applied in the field of
banking healthcare and retail sector so
starting with the banking sector and
banking sector reinforcement learning is
used to create a next best offer model
for a call center by building a
predictive model that learns over time
as user accept or reject offer made by
the sales staff fine now in health care
sector it is used to allocate the scarce
medical resources to handle different
type of er cases by building a mark of
decision process that learns treatment
strategies for each type of er case next
and the last comes the retail sector so
let's see how reinforcement learning is
applied a retail sector in retail sector
it can be used to reduce excess stock
with dynamic pricing by building a
dynamic pricing model that are just the
price based on customer response to the
offers I hope by now you have attained
some understanding of what is machine
learning and you are ready to move ahead
