Eddie Rica and today's session is going
to be about DevOps
engineer so thank you all the attendees
for joining today's session if you all
can hear me fine kindly drop me a quick
confirmation on the chat window so that
I can proceed okay Jamie says yes
addresses yes Mayank Nathan okay thank
you guys so let us begin today's session
by looking at the agenda for today so at
first we'll look at the demand of DevOps
in the current IT industry we'll also
learn why do we actually need a DevOps
engineer and the demands of a DevOps
engineer and we'll also take a look at
who is a developed engineer because it
has always been kind of admit that
whether a role like a DevOps engineer
actually exists or not and I'll clear
all your doubts for you that it actually
does and we look at the roles of the
develops engineer about what kind of
things they do actually in a company
you'll also know the skills required to
become a DevOps engineer and the
learning path that you need to follow if
you are in a pursuit of becoming a
DevOps engineer and finally we'll see
how all the develops in Deenie are
getting paid across the globe by looking
at the salary scheme so I hope that the
agenda is clear to you guys are we good
to go okay Jamie says yes Nathan says
yes so let us begin today's session and
our first topic is demand of DevOps let
me begin by saying that DevOps is really
high in demand in today's IT scenario
almost all of the big companies have
adopted devoxx
and the rest are grappling out to
develop and why is that because DevOps
actually brings in a lot of things for
you and there are six of them in front
of you right now and the best thing
about is that everything is interlinked
so let me take you through all of them
so the first thing that develops
actually avails is cross team
collaboration if you look at the name
DevOps you would know that it is a merge
of the two words development and
operations this is the main aim of
DevOps
to integrate all these things together
in DevOps there is only one team and
everyone knows what is happening in the
company or
your software or application is actually
getting developed and deployed onto the
production server so a member in a
development team would know what is
going on in the operations and testing
and similarly personally a testing team
would know what is going on in the
development team and the operations team
and so on and what happens with a cross
in collaboration is that it gives you
agility I'll tell you how because let's
say you are a developer and you're
developing your software so if a person
in the operations team already know that
what source code or what is getting
developed what kind of code they're
going to deal with later after the
development is over they can start
configuring their servers the test
servers and the production servers
according to the code that the
developers are producing and in similar
way if the developer already knows that
how the operations team has actually
configured all the server's they can
start writing the code that is
compatible with the configurations of
the servers that the operations team
mates so there is transparency everyone
knows what is going on in what team and
how the software is getting deployed
from the start to the end and hence you
can actually achieve better agility not
only in the developer side but in the
testing and operation and everywhere and
tests have actually shown that the code
is actually deployed almost 30 times
more faster with DevOps and DevOps also
gives you another facility which is
known as the continuous delivery of your
product so if you see this diagram here
you'll see that it evades you with
continuous development build test deploy
release everything everything is
continuously done you're making faster
deployments with continuous delivery now
if you're using the old method where you
have to finish developing first and then
go to testing and production it takes a
lot of time but if everything is
happening continuously newer releases
are made even more frequently and it
actually makes your code and your
product more reliable and if you see the
results you'll find that there are 50%
less failures of the new releases with
DevOps so obviously that is the reason
DevOps is very high in demand and every
other companies grow
onto it so hope you have understood why
DevOps is important and why the demands
are so high for any questions on this
okay so now questions so move ahead and
now we understand why do we actually
need a develops engineer and we'll
understand it with the case study of
Alice now I'll tell you it not Alice
from Wonderland I'm sorry to disappoint
you guys but I'm very sure that you'll
like this one as well so what is Alice
it's not Alice from Wonderland it is
actually a hotel management application
so this can be used by the hotel's staff
members and also the guests as well so
suppose you are a guest and you enter a
hotel and they're using Alice as their
management application you can order
anything let's say if you want to order
any kind of service in the hotels like
housekeeping laundry spa food anything
that you need you can just go to the app
or go to the website or just to SMS you
can just directly contact every staff in
the hotel you can book any kind of
service without contacting the desk
every time you need something and the
reason that these people who has
actually started to develop Alice
thought that and every hotel can
actually just buy the service of Alice
so and it manages all the services that
our guest orders so every time a guest
orders something in context directly to
the employee and it gets all included in
the account and when they're checking
out they can just directly deliver the
bill to the guest with all the services
that the guest actually availed in the
hotel and they could just buy the
service and that's why it's getting very
popular right now and most of the hotels
in Europe and United States are using
Alice but you must be wondering that why
am I telling you about the story of
Alice about this application because
actually the development stories that
when people actually started developing
Alice it's a very interesting story and
it's related to DevOps
so we'll understand it by looking at the
problems and how they actually solved it
so at the early stage when they were
developing Alice and when Alice was
getting deployed for the first time they
were not maintaining automation neither
they had any kind
the production supporting our
infrastructure updates and they were not
researching for new tools because pretty
much everyone who was working with Alice
was very concerned about and only focus
on just developing the product they were
not thinking about automation or any
other kind of thing or they were not
thinking of including new tools into it
because they would have to go on
research on new tools and how to
implement this it would actually take a
lot of time and they were actually
maintaining a monolithic structure and
they did not have any kind of solutions
for configuration management continuous
integration and continuous delivery of
the product but as they started getting
popular the new clients came up with new
requests and everyone wanted new
features in the application so that was
the time when they realized that they
could not just carry out developing with
such a monolithic structure ok so jamie
has a question he asked that what were
the problems with a monolithic structure
now there were certain kind of problems
now thank you Jamie for asking that
question so let me just explain it to
you in terms of the application Alice so
let's say in Alice and the application
since you're booking services let's say
you have got certain kind of services
like let's say you've got laundry some
writing L for laundry then you've got
housekeeping and let's say the other one
is food I apologize for my really bad
handwriting with this pen I'm not really
good with the mouse but my real
handwriting is actually very good ok
anyway so I was talking about the
services you have got laundry
housekeeping and food now if you have a
monolithic structure everything is
actually interconnected the housekeeping
the food the laundry so if at any time
that if you want to update let's say the
laundry servers you want to update
something in the application if you want
to do that and since they're
interconnected they're going to be very
dependency issues because when you're
updating this particular service your
entire application is going to go down
the user cannot use any other services
even if you're just updating or just
there is a bug in any kind of services
now if you have a microservices defined
this won't be interconnected at all
so the laundry service will be a one
micro service that housekeeping would be
another and the food would be another so
let's say now when you have micro
services defined if there is a bug in
the laundry you can still go on and use
the housekeeping and food services it
will not be affected at all nothing will
be hampered when you have micro services
so this is actually what they needed in
Alice to solve all this problems because
they had to make constant updates
according to their client request and
they wanted a micro service architecture
for their development but the question
was how to include micro services and
they finally found out a solution and
the solution was DevOps now a DevOps
they could actually do all these things
define a micro service architecture make
continuous delivery because they were
actually lagging behind in making their
software releases faster to their
clients and it was actually hampering
them a lot so they wanted to include
DevOps to avail automation continuous
integration contribution management and
continuous delivery of their products
but again finding a solution is one
thing and implementing is another thing
so the question was how do they do that
so they first started adopting DevOps
and they were trying to carry out the
use of new DevOps tools but since
everyone in Alice we're a full-size
developer if they were trying to do the
things to include DevOps it was actually
eating up a lot of their time so what to
do now so they actually needed a DevOps
engineer a person who will be solely
doing these kind of things include all
the DevOps tools then actually implement
automated deployment and vise
configurations for all their servers and
an available among the testing team and
the developing team and hence making
continuous delivery possible so this is
when alice realized that they need a
person as a DevOps engineer to carry out
all this stuff because the developers
were too busy developing the code the
testing people were busy on just writing
the test cases and testing out the code
that the developer write and the
operations team and were too busy
configure
the server's to deploy it on to the
production server and making releases so
they needed a person would actually
include DevOps and carry out all the
operations for continuous integration
continuous testing and continuous
delivery so I hope that you've
understood the need of the develop
engineer with this case study so any
questions on this okay so mine says no
questions is pretty cleared so thank you
man so I'll move on to the next topic
and now we'll see the demands of a
DevOps engineer so now these are the big
giants in the IT industry we're actually
adopting DevOps and they're hiring
DevOps engineer to carry out all their
tasks so we have got this five big
companies in front of you yeah okay man
go on if you have a question
okay so Maya gasp a question he has that
how many DevOps tools do we need to
learn to be a DevOps engineer well thank
you man for asking that question I'll be
covering this in the learning path when
I will tell you about how to actually
prepare yourself if you want to be a
DevOps engineer what kind of tools that
you need to master so let's ask you to
hang in there until I reach that topic
and you understand that so just have
some patience man okay my answer is okay
so let us move on and let us see that
how different companies are hiring
DevOps engineer and for what purpose so
we have got HP here and HP wants to
develop engineer to build DevOps
solutions using relevant tools and since
their office is all about using tools so
HP wants someone who have got expertise
with these tools and include all these
tools in order to produce releases more
faster using DevOps
and similarly with Tesla they wanted to
adopt advanced system engineering and
and in order to do that they wanted
DevOps to achieve advanced system
engineering and they are hiring devoxx
engineer for that purpose similarly with
SAP they want a divorce engineer to be
end-to-end DevOps strategist they want
the divorce engineer to plan everything
and make a proper strategy so in order
to achieve agility reliability and
everything else that develops brings you
similarly with Cisco there one divorce
engineer for virtualization using DevOps
now whenever we talk about
virtualization the first thing the tools
that actually come to your mind are
darker and vagrant so disco wants the
developed engineer to include these kind
of tools or virtualization and with
Amazon they want the divorce engineer
for DevOps development now Amazon
actually provides you with DevOps
services so obviously they want the
DevOps engineer for DevOps development
so I hope that you're all clear with
this topic and there are other companies
also looking for the DevOps engineer and
they're actually hiring divorce engineer
in their company and and they're
performing some kind of roles we'll be
talking about that later on so any
questions on this slide ok my answer is
no questions so now the question is who
is a DevOps engineer and I'll be
covering that who should you be or what
kind of traits that you should possess
in order to become a DevOps engineer so
the first is you need to be a DevOps
evangelist it means that you need to be
a person who is actually going to
support DevOps and who is going to
embrace the change the DevOps brings in
now this change can be taken place in
two ways either it will be a top-down
approach or a bottom-up approach now if
you're one of the top bosses in the
companies all you have to do if you want
to include DevOps you just have to pass
an order and everyone is bound to follow
it it's going to be very hassle-free
but if you're one of a team lead who is
not one of the higher bosses in the
company what you can do is that you can
just take up that initiative that I want
to implement DevOps on my team and let's
see what happens
and you have to make everyone realize
the benefits of DevOps what DevOps
actually brings into your company and
what kind of benefits you can actually
achieve you have to support the DevOps
movement and you need to be a debauch
evangelist for that purpose after that
you need to be a quality assurance
professional so if you're working in an
IT company the main thing that you
should ensure about is the quality of
your product because this is what will
go to your customer and at the end
everyone wants a happy customer and if
you fail to fulfill that you are not
doing it successfully your company is
not going to be successful if your
product is wrong and your customers
don't like it so you have to make sure
that your product is of the best quality
and you have to make sure that when your
testing team or your testers are writing
the test cases for your product they are
proper and you always have to keep the
customer needs in mind so that you can
test your product properly and according
to the customer needs and since I'm
talking about the products our DevOps
engineer should be a successful release
manager as well because releasing your
product in time is also very very
important you don't want the customers
to wait along for the product because
they will actually find out different
ways to get their product or they will
just find out other people to evade
those services if you actually delay the
release of your product so you have to
make sure that the product is actually
leased and it's of the best quality and
as a DevOps engineer you have to design
all the test cases and the plan for when
is actually going to get deployed on the
production server and into the hands of
your customer and he also needs to be a
software developer because the core of
an IT company is the development team
because this is where your product
actually starts evolving and this is the
core thing of your product and if you
are a divorce engineer if you're going
to take care of the development team as
well you need to understand how a
software developer actually develops the
software you have to understand how to
code and you have to think of ways to
improve the quality of the code so that
it does not include redundant data and
redundant line so that the runtime is
small you have to know to develop the
software as well
need knowledge on that too and also you
need to be a utility technology player
now technology is moving very fast there
new tools and new technologies coming
every day so you must be a person that
is going to just grab on just a have a
grasp on every new technology that comes
so that you can improve is there system
more and you need to be very fast in
understanding new technology so that it
can include more tools in your system to
make your system and your software life
cycle even more faster and better and
finally you need to be an automation
architect because you might not know
everything of everything you might know
a little bit about development but you
know everything about operations but if
you want all your deployments to be
faster everything starts from developing
then testing and then deploying the
software onto the production server so
you have to rely on automation for that
you have to define how this entire cycle
would carry out from the start to the
end so you need to be able to define
automation as well and you have to lay
out all the plan about how this tasks
are going to carry out one by one and
define automation for your system so I
hope that it's clear to everyone that
what are the qualities to be a divorce
engineer okay so my yang says that there
is a lot to know obviously Mayank you
have to know a lot you don't need to
master everything let's say that you can
choose any of this and master on one of
them but you have to be a person who
could just grasp on things very quickly
because if you're adopting DevOps and
you are a DevOps engineer and DevOps
takes care of the entire lifecycle of
your software you obviously have to know
everything about how your software is
getting developed and deployed so that
you can actually implement tools there
so but my on don't be scared I'll be
actually telling you a systematic way of
how you can start knowing all of these
things so any questions on this ok max
there's no questions
ok so we'll move on to the next topic
and we'll see what roles a DevOps
engineer actually plays in organization
so the first rule that a DevOps engineer
plays is maintaining the codebase with
version control because your software
starts with developing it so as a DevOps
engineer the first thing that you need
to do is define a version control system
in your software development lifecycle
this is where you'll be storing all the
source code that your developer makes
and it will store it in different
versions so that your developers will
actually make changes onto the source
code many times and you have to define a
system that will take care of all the
changes include the changes and store it
in different versions and in order to do
that the developer might be using let's
say tools like and get our sub versions
there are other version control tools as
well and as a DevOps engineer you have
to maintain that those tools are working
fine and they're storing versions so
that even if a developer makes a mistake
if you want to make a quick rollback you
can do that because you want your
software to be very reliable so that you
don't lose any kind of data so you have
to store it in one place and since
DevOps ensures that it is a one team so
you'll be not only storing the source
code that a developer makes but all the
configuration scripts that is running on
the operations team you have to maintain
this in a same repository or the same
data space as well so you have to take
care of the source code and all the
files that your operations team code and
your developers code and since the main
aim of DevOps is to make all your
releases more faster you have to define
a continuous integration and continuous
delivery pipeline and version control is
the very first step to do that the next
rule is you have to make software bills
and tests with continuous integration
now since I'm talking about continuous
integration you need a continuous
integration platform and the first thing
that you need to do is pull out the
source code that the developers have
coded wherever your story whether it's a
git repository or a subversion
repository just you need to pull that
code first and you can use tools like
Jenkins or Travis for that and it will
just pull out the source code make a
build compile
to make a build and you can use building
tools like an maven Gradle etc and after
a build is made is you send it to the
test server for testing it out and if
the test is successful it will give a
feedback to the developers that it is ok
and they can start working on a
different version or a different feature
as well and if it's wrong they will also
get the feedback and they can quickly
make changes so that it works fine in
the test server and in the production
server as well so this is how to cite
Jenkins you can actually define our
continuous integration and continuous
delivery pipeline you can plan how the
things will carry out compile test and
deploy on the production server and
Jenkins actually does not do anything on
its own it actually integrates other
tools together like I've told you that
for maintaining codebase with version
control it is using git and maybe in the
production server they're using other
tools for configuring so Jenkins is the
tool that actually integrates with all
these tools and make these tools
compatible to work with each other after
that you have to apply configuration
management now configuration management
system actually takes care of all your
inventory all your servers about how
they need to be configured you can write
configuration management scripts for
that and you'll be using configuration
management tools like ansible salt stack
puppet chef these are all configuration
management tools that will allow you to
configure all your servers at once by
writing scripts and you must be
wondering that why to actually include
configuration management because let's
say if you're working on a very big
company and you've got thousand servers
so the developer team actually came out
with a code and you need a certain kind
of software to run on the test server
and the production service you have to
include that and install that software
on all of the thousand servers so as a
devoxx engineer you have to think of
ways to how to do that you cannot just
go this manually login to every server
and install it in every other servers so
additive oxygen you will be using tools
like ansible and chef's puppet who is
actually going to configure and install
all
necessary software by provisioning it as
one spy writing scripts so this is what
you need to do as a developing denier to
apply configuration management and
configuration management actually
applied on the entire software
development lifecycle so you need to
configure even the dev server broad and
test server at once and you have to
implement tools in order to do that and
after that you have to manage cloud
servers and nowadays everything is done
on cloud everyone prefers a cloud
platforms like AWS in order to develop
their product and build their product on
a cloud platform and why because it
offends you with Auto scale up and scale
down let me explain this to you with an
example let's say that if you are
working on a ecommerce website let's say
Flipkart now they are hosting big
billion days every now and then so
obviously when you are trying to host a
mega sale for your e-commerce website so
obviously you will be expecting a lot of
traffic you might need more servers to
handle that kind of request and you
might even need load balancers for
distributing the traffic on to all your
web servers so you cannot just always
rely on buying a bare-metal server and
doing that and because after your sale
is going to be over it's just going to
lie there without any use without any
purpose and you like spend a lot of
money on buying the new hardware and its
of no use after the sale is over so
that's why you want to shift to a
elastic cloud infrastructure that will
allow you to auto scale up when you need
so you can just include new servers or
load balancers in your system so when
you're expecting a lot of traffic and
after your sale is over you can also
scale down you can just discard all
those that you don't need them so you're
not you're saving a lot of money and
you're saving a lot of time also because
you don't have to configure new hardware
again a cloud platform like AWS or
as your they will do that for you so
that's why you need to understand how to
manage your cloud servers as well and
after that you have to adopt automation
for continuous delivery because if you
want continuous delivery of your product
I was talking about a continuous
integration and delivery pipeline you
have to make sure how this task will
actually lay out how
all the tasks will execute in order you
have to define that - in order to
achieve automation and so that your
product is delivered continuously onto
the production server and finally it
goes on to the hands of your customer so
you have to make sure that all the tasks
are in proper order and they are
properly orchestrated well this process
is actually called orchestration so you
have to define them as well so I hope
that you've all understood the roles of
the DevOps engineer any doubts on this
okay so Jamie says no doubts so I'll
move ahead and we'll understand the
skills required to be a DevOps engineer
the skills the companies are looking for
when they want to hire a DevOps engineer
now since I was talking about the role
where you have to maintain code base
with version control well there are
certain skills that you need to possess
for that like if you want to maintain
version control you must be using
version control tools like git or
subversion so you need to have expert
knowledge on how to use the source code
management tools like git and subversion
and you must include code branching best
practices like get slow and get slow is
actually a branching model forget that
avails collaboration and since I was
talking about that you need to include
the ops code in your source code
management tool you have to include all
the scripts that your operation scheme
read whether they're in Yama
let's say python scripts or Ruby so you
have to include them in your source code
management as well and you have to have
the skills of how to manage all these
different files together at one place
and for that you can use github because
github lets you host repository where
you can store all your source code files
in there so you need to have expertise
in using these kind of tools and these
kind of platforms like github and next
one you're making building and testing
you need to use a continuous integration
platform and you can choose either
Jenkins or Travis for that and Jenkins
and Travis are actually tools that
avails continuous integration they let
you define our continuous integration
continuous test and continuous delivery
pipeline for you you need to have an
expert knowledge about using these tools
about how to include built
like aunt maven Gradle and performing
unit testing using these tools and
defining how to go into the test server
how to pull the code from the source
code repository and then finally you
have to define how these kind of
platforms like Jenkins and Travis Travis
will actually pull the code from the git
repository or the source code repository
that you're using and how it will
perform unit testing and finally be
deployed on the test server for testing
it out completely and then after that
how will you get actually deployed on
the production server and you need to
also have the skills on how you'll
actually configure Jenkins and other
tools of continuous integration to pull
source code repository and how it will
actually interact with all other tools
that you're using because like I told
you Jenkins does not exactly do anything
it only integrates the different tools
together so you have to have knowledge
and skills on how to actually configure
Jenkins as well after that since you're
going to apply configuration management
you need to have experience using any
configuration management database
systems you must understand how to
configure your servers properly what
kind of scripts that you write and when
exactly to run them and how to use
different configuration management tools
like I was telling you like ansible chef
puppet salsa etc and some of them are
agentless and some of them use agent so
you have to have skills to understand
them as well that how to actually drive
configuration management tool that is
agentless and if they're using agents
how to use them as well you need to also
understand how to baseline or inventory
also about according to the architecture
that kind of tasks each of your
inventory is going to perform if their
node machines they should be separated
in one list if there are web servers and
the other so you have to have the skills
for that too
ok so mind has a question he asked that
can you please explain configuration
management in brief ok thank you for the
question man well my and let me explain
you configuration management in brief
well configuration management is
actually the management of your software
and your hardware it is a management of
your entire infrastructure because that
what makes up your entire infrastructure
right the software and the hardware and
it defines how each of your servers and
each of your node machine should work it
provides them with a baseline according
to their architecture according to the
tasks they are going to perform and it
actually documents everything so that
you can roll back to a previous version
of your infrastructure and in that
context let me just give you an example
of the NYSC now NYSC we're using
configuration management at one time
they actually installed the particular
software but it actually stopped working
it failed on eight of the node machines
out of 20 machines and their system was
down for almost ninety minutes they were
actually successful to roll back to the
previous version in just 90 minutes you
know even though it sounds like it was a
failure that they were down for 90
minutes it is actually a success story
that because of configuration management
they were able to roll back to a
previous version because fixing all
those problems may have taken a lot of
time and they would have suffered a lot
of loss so this is why you should
include configuration management so I
have actually told you what is
configuration management the need of
configuration management as well so I
hope it's clear to your Mayank
okay it is nice example ok thank you my
ankh so since I'm telling you need to
apply configuration management now you
have even understood the importance of
it so you need to have experience with
these kind of tools so when these kind
of problems arise in your company were
able to handle them and you have a
proper configuration management defined
and after that while you were managing
cloud servers you need to have expertise
on core cloud computing and storage
components and you have to understand
most of the virtualization technologies
like VMware OpenStack you need to have
the skills on how to use an elastic
infrastructure like AWS is your digital
ocean so that you can avail out of scale
up and how to scale down like I was
talking about so you need to have an
idea about these kind of platforms so
that you can implement it so that when
your company needs more servers they
want to include more instances you can
actually work on these kind of cloud
platforms and manage it whenever you
need new things or if you want to
discard some old servers that you do not
need or if you want to decrease the
number of instances that you're using so
you need to have an expert knowledge on
how to actually manage your
infrastructure on cloud as well and
after that since I was talking about
automation you need to have proper
knowledge on how to use automation as
well we're going to skills that you
require are to orchestrate code push
using configuration management tools you
need to define how this task will carry
out in order and that is called
orchestration like I told you so
you have to write scripts you need to
have the skills to write scripts about
how to define the order of the different
tasks and for that you need to have a
bass skill and a vast knowledge on which
task to perform first you have to
analyze that as well and you need skills
of using tools like ansible and jenkins
is also an automation tool jenkins
Travis and Sibyl chef they're all
automation tools you need to have expert
knowledge on using this automation tools
as well and you also have to know to
write code using scripting languages so
these are the skills that you require
and most of the companies desire for
when they're looking for a developing
junior so does any of you fulfill all
the skills right now
okay you may or may not answer this
question and so should I move ahead do
you have any kind of questions on the
skills section any questions guys or
should I just move ahead
okay so Jamie says no questions so these
were actually the core technical skills
that is required but apart from that you
need some more skills - you need to have
operational skills because you will be
working with the ops team and it is said
that a DevOps engineer is actually a
software developer who knows something
about operations or he is a system admin
who has been working on the operations
team and he knows something about
development so you need to have all the
skills you need to have an operational
skills you need to understand how your
software is getting deployed you need to
understand the concepts of it and since
DevOps is all about
munication about collaborating and for
collaborating you need to have good
communication skills and also analytical
skills as well you need to have a very
good knowledge about deductive reasoning
maybe not like Sherlock but you close to
that so you need to analyze things
properly so that you can take steps that
is actually going to benefit your
company make your software delivery even
more faster so you need to have these
kind of general skills as well I hope
it's clear to everyone and I'll move on
to the next topic so that I can tell you
that if you are in a pursuit of becoming
a DevOps engineer this is going to be a
learning but this are the things one by
one that you need to master on in order
to become a DevOps engineer so let's
take a look at them so the first thing
you need to do is learn version control
you need to learn about the concepts of
version control learn why do we need it
learn how does a version control work
and since you'll be using tools you
learn about the most popular version
control tools like get our subversion
there are others like mercurial CVS
everything just master on any one of the
version control tools and learn how to
use github because all of the companies
right now most of the companies right
now are using github to maintain their
code ok so jamie has a question he says
I am a Linux administrator where should
I start from in order to become a DevOps
engineer well since I was telling you a
divorce engineer is usually a system
administrator who knows something about
development or a developer who knows
something about the operations so since
you are already a Linux administrator
you are almost halfway there so you just
need to cover the part of the
development process and you can start
with version control I'll be telling you
I'll be going through all of the things
that you need to master on free just you
can just check that which of the things
that you already know and which are the
things that you need to understand in
order to become a de box engineer so
someone asked the question at the end
after I finish this learning path to you
Jamie that what are the things that you
need to master on after you have seen
the learning path is that okay with you
Jamie again he says yes
so we'll move on and I was telling you
to learn about version control and learn
about the version control tools and
learn about how to use github so these
are the things that you need to master
on learn what is continuous integration
and learn all the concepts of it because
you'll be doing everything with
continuous integration this is going to
start pulling code from the repository
like a totally and deploying on to the
other servers so these tools are very
important these tools are important for
automation as well so you have to
understand how to use a continuous
integration platform and tools like
Jenkins or Travis and also build tools
like ant maven cradles so learn about
all of them mastered in any one of this
tools or any one of the build tools any
one of the continuous integration tools
through all you don't have to master all
of the tools but choose the most popular
ones and the most popular one is Jenkins
right now so I'll advise you to focus on
Jenkins if you're reading about
continuous integration and learning
about how to use continuous integration
after that you have to understand the
concepts of configuration management as
well and you have to understand how to
use tools like ansible chef puppet and
since you've been using these kind of
tools they use a kind of scripting
languages where you define the
configurations you should learn how to
define them as well let's say that if
you're using ansible they write all the
scripts and play books in Yammer code so
you can learn gamal or you can learn XML
JSON for writing definitions for your
scripts as well okay so Jamie asked can
I get all this knowledge at EDD Eureka
yes of course Jamie at Eureka has a
course defined where you can learn all
of these things you can learn version
control continuous integration so
they've got a course just defined for
DevOps so you can just buy that course
you can learn about all this and the
very good thing is that they start with
a project so you'll actually be doing a
real-life project from day one to the
last day while you're learning it so
it's not just the concepts but you are
actually going to do real industry work
while you're taking the course if you're
interested you can take that too
ok now coming on to plough
the things that you need to understand
is first learn all the networking basics
and learn about all different cloud
platforms because at some point of time
your company will be using a cloud
platform in order to maintain their
servers or instances because like I told
you everyone wants an elastic
infrastructure and with the cloud
infrastructure you can avail there to
learn about cloud infrastructure as well
how a cloud infrastructure is laid out
and learn how to use platforms like AWS
Microsoft Azure digital ocean and so let
me just tell you Jamie since you asked
me about the course that you can take up
from Ed Eureka
if you're planning to take up the DevOps
course and now since I'm talking about
cloud you can also take up the AWS
architect course as well because that
will teach you how to use AWS and you
can how to manage your projects on an
AWS platform as well and since you also
have to learn programming for cloud you
have to learn how to use the AWS CLI AWS
command line interface so you can learn
that there as well so you can choose
wherever you want to learn from just
learn all the basics of it dive deep
into the concept of everything and I'm
pretty sure that you will be ready for
an interview of a DevOps engineer and if
you could master about all of this
concepts I'm pretty sure you'll be very
ready and it'll be a DevOps engineer
very soon and finally you can thank me
later when you get that job so is it
clear to everyone this is the learning
path that you need to follow and
Jamieson to ask me can I ask you again
there what are the things that you need
to master on right now that you don't
know ok so Jaime says that he needs to
learn about version control and
continuous integration so Jaime I will
say that it gets started with learning
all these things so I'm pretty sure that
if you can master you've already
mastered the others so if you can master
this - you'll be all ready to become a
de Vaca jr. so Thank You Jaime does
anyone have any other questions
ok so Jaime says he'll yes I'll be ready
so good luck to you Jamie so I'll move
on to the next topic and let us see the
salaries
can let us all talk about the money so
now your salary can be based on certain
factors it can depend on your experience
that you have the geographic location
that you are currently working on and
the team size that you handle so I have
actually collected all this data from in
capsule comm they have done a survey and
and the graph that you see here these
are the stats of the 2016 dev ops survey
that they did on a devoxx engineer so
this is actually the money that a
developed engineer is running this is
the annual salary breakdown of all the
divorce practitioners and I have to spit
out the salaries of a devoxx engineer in
particular so if you can see here that
there are 21.7% people that are earning
less than $60,000 and there are 17.9%
people that are earning from $50,000 to
$80,000 and 18.4% people are earning
from $80,000 to $100,000 16.9% people
are earning from $100,000 to 120
thousand dollars and you can just check
out the rest of them I think it's no use
dictating all of them that you can
already see and think that you must be
wondering is that why these variations
and it is because of these three because
your experience matters your geographic
location matters and your team size also
matters okay so Nathan asked a question
how much can I expect after learning
DevOps so since I'm going to talk about
experience you'll know that if you just
learn the box and if you just want to
step on into being a DevOps engineer so
let's say that it'll be less than one
year of experience so we'll see that
chart right now Nathan so I'll give you
the answer in a moment is that okay with
you
okay so nathan has a question how much a
fresher can earn learning DevOps now
since I'm going to talk about experience
right now so as a fresher it means that
you have got zero years of experience so
let us see that right now about how your
salary can actually vary according to
the experience of you have so I'm just
going to answer your question in a
moment Nathan so is that okay with you
okay she says
all right so the first thing that
matters is your geographic location so
now I have laid down the world map so if
you can see in the asia-pacific region
the average salary is $25,000 for a
DevOps engineer per year and it's the
same thing with the Eastern Europe part
which is also $25,000 per year now 15
Western Europe they're actually paying
all the developed engineer a little more
not to fill in more almost double of
what Asia is paying them so they're
earning from about $50,000 to $75,000
and with the Latin countries it's the
same like Asia and Eastern Europe
they're also paying the devoxx engineer
with a salary of just $25,000 but if you
see in Australia they're paying the
DevOps engineers almost $75,000 to
ninety nine thousand nine hundred and
ninety nine dollars and the scenario in
North America is a little better well
actually it's a lot better than Asia and
the other Latin countries you can see
that Bay in Canada they are paying all
the developed engineers about $75,000 to
ninety nine thousand dollars per year
and it's the highest in United States of
America where they're paying the devoxx
engineers starting from $100,000 to
$125,000 so if you want to earn a lot of
money as a developed engineer maybe you
should just shift to the United States
of America but good luck if Trump allows
you to enter American soil
yeah Jaime says Donald Trump won't allow
yeah so that's the sad thing about going
to America right now so anyways so I
hope that is understood how a geographic
location is actually matters in your
salary as well so now let us see how
your salary can vary according to the
team size that you're handling so if you
see this graph if you have if you are
handling a team of only ten members your
salary can start from one hundred and
four thousand dollars per year and if
you're handling let's say eleven to
fifteen members and 51 to 100 members in
between hundred members your salary
actually stays in between one
and $10,000 and if you have a team of
more than 100 plus members it is going
to be around 120 $9,000 and now if you
feed by the years of experience now
since you are asking me in Athens that
if you are a fresher so you'll fall into
this category which is less than one
year of experience so your salary can
range from about $65,000 to 91 thousand
dollars it actually also matters on the
skills you have and the geographic
location and your team size also but
this is a general survey of less than
one year's experience and if you have
one to ten years of experience your
salary might start from 101 thousand
dollars to one hundred eleven thousand
one hundred and eleven dollars did I say
that correct okay so basically six one
and if you have more than ten years of
experience
your salary will start from about one
hundred and thirty-five thousand eighty
seven dollars to one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars okay so my answer is
nice survey so you can thank the people
of in capsular who have actually done
this survey so yeah it's a pretty
informative service so I hope you have
all understood how your salary can vary
according to geographic team size and
experience is that all clear to you okay
so my yang says yes and I would also
tell you that it always matters on the
skill set that you have if you are an
expert in divorce if you have if you
possess all the skills that your company
wants and it also depends on the company
the kind of company if you're just going
for the bigger companies were who are
earning a lot of money obviously they
are going to pay you a lot according to
your skills as well so but this is the
general survey of the geographic and
team size and experience so even if you
are in the asia-pacific region don't get
disheartened that you are just going to
earn $25,000 so if you have all the
skill sets that is required and if you
go into a company that is making money
so I'm pretty sure that are they're
going to pay you even more than $25,000
so I hope it's clear to everyone
so any questions okay so now questions
so this is what we learned in today's
session so we understood the demands of
DevOps and who is a DevOps engineer we
have also seen the roles of the DevOps
engineer the skills required to be
devolved engineer and I've told you the
learning path that you need to follow in
order to become a devoxx engineer and
finally we've seen the salary scheme of
the DevOps engineer across the globe and
according to experience and also the
team size that they are handling so I
hope that you have all understood every
of the concepts do you have any
questions on any of the topics that I
just discussed about okay so jamie has a
question he asked that how can I enroll
for DevOps in ED Eureka well Jamie who
want to enroll for a course in DevOps
you can just drop a query to sales at
the rate at Eureka CO and they will get
back to you about the course that you
need and they'll provide you with all
the details of the course and so you
just can drop a mail there so is it okay
for you Jamie okay it says cool so this
is what we learned so thank you all of
you for attending today's session if you
have any kind of questions or any
queries or any kind of feedback that you
want to give me so drop a comment in the
