blockchain is the technology that
transmitted coin before understanding
blockchain and Bitcoin let me take you
through the issues we face in the
current banking systems banks judge huge
transaction fees fake currencies create
the problem of double spending there is
a long time involved in banking and
finally banks cancel at any time such as
the 2008 financial crisis digital
wallets such as PayPal citrus and PDM
solve some of these issues they allow us
instant transfers nevertheless they are
still dependent on banks Bitcoin was the
first system to solve all these issues
it is the revolutionary cryptocurrency
which is a digital payment system
running on the blockchain technology
Bitcoin has the following features no
transaction fees are required all
transactions are completed within
minutes it is decentralized in that no
one person owns the blockchain network
it can never be manipulated or hacked
because of the basic structure of a
blockchain let me now show you a simple
Bitcoin transaction we have James who
wants this and 500 bitcoins together
this transaction is verified by miners
Lisa and Robert they then start a race
to solve a complex mathematical puzzle
called proof of work suppose Lisa here
sauce it first she adds her block
containing the transaction to the
existing blockchain she is given 12.5
bitcoins as a reward
this is what we call as Bitcoin mining
blockchain is a public distributed
database holding encrypted Ledger's this
means a blog is the current part of a
blockchain which recalls the recent
transactions once it is verified it
becomes a permanent part of the growing
blockchain blockchain run some three
important technologies distributed
machines on the peer-to-peer network has
maintaining the consistency of the
public ledger blockchain uses private
key cryptography the secure identities
and hash functions to make the
blockchain immutable the mathematical
principle of proof-of-work ensures that
the nodes automatically and continuously
a link to the current state of the
ledger now that we have understood the
basic concepts let us explore a few of
the real-life applications of blockchain
follow my vote aims to change the way we
would becoming the world's first open
source online voting solution our kids
is the groundwork for a true
decentralized ride-sharing service often
called uber killer show card stores your
identity onto bitcoins blockchain for
easy verification learn more about
blockchain and master the concepts of
cryptography blockchain networks
smart contracts and the hyper ledger
