us take one area of these studies and
see how we go ahead so the first chapter
is about the basic concepts and
obviously this project management's and
we are talking about what is a project
the PMI definition is a project is a
temporary endeavor undertaken to create
a unique product service or hazard so
the first thing is a project has to be a
temporary endeavor that means it has to
have a definite start date and an end
date so a software project
we have a definitely neighbor we have a
start date when we start doing the
project we have a ended by which we need
to complete and implement the project
and it creates a unique product that is
your software that you will be
implementing it can be a service like if
you are doing a ERP implementation the
service is configuring the tool and
training and handing it over to the
customer now what is a result we have
seen product we have seen service so
what is the result in some cases we are
called as on a mainly on a consulting
engagement where we have to only give a
feasibility study report now that report
becomes a result that is not a product
that is not a service it is a result
if in in our day-to-day lives we also
see our children doing projects at
school which has a definite start
definite end we plan our vacation and we
go for our vacation the vacation itself
is a project and
we need to understand progressive
elaboration that is at the beginning of
the project we know or we have a overall
idea about what we want the scope of the
project but gradually as we start
getting into the project we know more
and more about it and accordingly we
have to change our design
our development based on the overall
scope that we have already defined we
are not here we are not talking about
the commercial aspects because for that
we will need to look at the change
management and other areas which we will
see when we are into the details of the
different knowledge areas
any questions so far
you
you
okay so we will proceed
so what is we know what is project what
is project management now project
management is applying the combination
of knowledge which you will get in the
course the skills that is your
experience that you have gathered the
tools and techniques which you use and
what you will learn more during the
course to the project activities to meet
the project requirements so this is the
application of the skills knowledge and
tools and techniques for meeting the
project requirement
management requires or has a lot of
generic management skills a lot of
general management skills like
negotiation conflict management people
management
all these are part of general management
skills which is required on a day to day
life of a project manager now one thing
I would like to just add at this point
of time based on my experience of my
students is that one of the problems
that we face during the exams is we
start thinking in terms of what we do in
our offices in our organization
when you come to this course when you
are sitting for the exam do not think of
what you do in your office how you do it
because that might lead you to a wrong
answer you have to think only from the
perspective as specified in the p.m.
Bock as specified or as I will specify
during the class it is very very
important for you to understand this and
be conscious about it
most of the time if you start thinking
and comparing with what you do in the
office is where you will get your quick
answers wrong
now a project management managers the
project means what he has to balance
various constraints or competing demands
to ensure that the success of the
project is achieved
the only objective of the project
manager is successfully completing the
project and when we saying successfully
complaining what does it mean it means
that balancing the competing factors
like scope time cost quality there are
two other factors also which has been
added which is this and resource all
these are constraints all these are
competing the ones all these requires
the project managers attention to manage
that in a proper manner we all there
will be a scope which is defined when we
start doing the things we might find
that there is more things coming up we
need to change through a proper change
management procedure there is a schedule
if there is I increase in the scope it
will impact either either or in both
cases I mean in both like time and cost
both now we have to balance those
through proper change management
practices or see if that scope is
actually required or not we have to
ensure that the product that is
delivered the service that is delivered
is as for the expectation when we see
quality quality does not mean something
different quality means that you give
what you have agreed upon
resources we don't always find all the
resources as we want we need many
experience sources but we get some
experience resource on our team we get
some freshers but we have man we have to
manage with that give them the necessary
training that is required to make them
productive it is project managers
responsibility to take care of those
things
so the project manager it is
is duty to balance and achieve the three
not often competing goals not only three
it's six basically scope time cost
quality risk and resource
you
questions
okay now a chronic manager manages
actually two things the project manager
has to deliver the project
and the project manager also has to
deliver the product we need to
understand the differentiation between
the two now what is the product in our
example of these software implementation
the software is the product which has to
be as per the functional requirement
specified by the customer that is your
product whereas the project is how you
will do the execute the project to get
that product out that is managing your
team managing your resources managing
within the triple constraints or the
competing demands that is your project
now in case of product
there is a product lifecycle and that
product lifecycle goes beyond the
project life the project like product
lifecycle starts when the project is
conceived and gets into life so you
start executing or initiating the
project your product lifecycle starts
your project life cycle starts when you
deliver and handover the product to your
customer the project life cycle ends but
now the product still is life the
product is handed over to our operations
to run it
and II will run it maybe for five years
10 years 15 years in that time the
customer does not want to use that
product anymore and once our new product
the time this product is sunset this is
the product lifecycle and we calculate a
product lifecycle cost to understand
what is the overall expense and what
benefit we get today we are talking a
lot about benefit realization now when
we are developing the project the
benefit does not come it is during the
operation and the output of the project
the product of the project starts being
used is when we get the benefits so in
our business case we compare these
things
okay
can operations come under project
management or is it as a process
management okay operations by definition
we said project has to have a definite
start and a definite end date operations
doesn't have a definite start and a
definite in state operations is a
continuing activity and a repetitive
activity so it is not a project part of
the project management it is operations
management
why in this particular slide you will
see project development is the overall
project management part of it
operations is a separate activity
now where do we do the project we do the
project in organizations if we are doing
the project on the organization we need
to consider the organization itself to
do the work
need to understand the values the norms
the beliefs the expectations of the
organization the policies and procedures
say for example you have your you have
got a new project now that new project
has to be
executed in
Iran
this company that you are working is in
India and let's see currently your
organization does not allow people to
work in this particular end
can you take that project no you cannot
you have to go by your organization's
policies and procedures if the
organization has a policy that the women
employees of the organization cannot
work after 7:00 p.m. you cannot plan to
take those resources in
a project which requires you to work on
a B shift or a C shift that is in the
night shift because that will be beyond
7 o'clock
you cannot go deviate from those
policies and procedures
your company has certain policies of
travel
when you are calculating the cost
calculating the travel processes you
need to consider those to make sure that
there is no hiccup for the project to be
executed because of these policies so
you need to understand those policies
and procedures on top of that today we
work with a lot of virtual team where
the people are not from only one single
location we have people from various
countries who comes from various beliefs
who has various beliefs who comes from
different cultural background we need to
understand those cultures in India we
may you will see that we have a lot of
habit of nodding our heads all across
it confuses
in the West where we understand the
front nodding as a yes and I mean
horizontal nod as a No
need to be careful about those we need
to understand the authority relationship
we have to get approvals we need to get
resources from various functional heads
department heads we need to understand
what the structure is and accordingly
work with them
so work ethics and work hours
organizational structure now work ethics
we will see a lot of questions around 20
questions in BMP which is about work
ethics this is a separate
code of conduct and code of ethics which
you need to sign for PMP
there are questions on this which we
will discuss when we are going through
the course in details
any pension on this
you
okay so now
when we are looking at this based on the
organizational structure PMI has defined
it into six different
or models of organization at the two
ends we have two extremes on one side we
have the functional a functional is a
typical classical organization which we
see anywhere where everything is under
different departments so you have a
legal department you have HR you have a
finance you have a manufacturing you
have
planning all these are separate and each
research and development and each one
has a department head all the resources
reports of the department reports to the
department head the pressures are done
by the department head wherever they
work so you as a project manager when
you go to them you need to get those
resources from these departments
but even though they are working on your
project we will still be appraised by
the functional head now that is
functional organization on the extreme
other side we have something called
project eyes Department a project Geist
organization now in a project eyes
organization everything works as a
project
so that there is a common pool of
resources there is a specific Department
called project management department
where all the project managers reside
every work is as a project which is
which is under the authority of a
project manager from this project
management group and the various
resources comes and joins and forms a
project team who will report to the
project manager he'll detain the project
is complete the project team will be
released at the end of the project and
they will go back to the pool here the
appraisal is done by the project manager
we will and in between this we have a
matrix organization which is more like a
mix of the two where we have a weak
matrix - a strong matrix in case of a
weak matrix what happens is resources
are taken from the different departments
functional departments and one of them
is given the responsibility of project
coordination only reporting still
remains with the department heads the
issue with this is that we keep have to
we have to keep going to the functional
heads to get the resources first of all
to get the best resources out number two
the appraisal will be done by the
functional head so there might be
conflict of interest which needs to be
resolved at all the times there is a
balance matrix where we have the
resources coming from the various
functional department there is a project
manager assigned but the power of the
project manager is not very strong the
project manager only gives inputs to the
function as ahead for the appraisal
situations
and then we have a strong matrix where
as far as the project management part is
concerned
project management is done by the
project manager
these people will have a dotted line to
the project manager as well as 2d and a
direct line to the functional manager
we look at these we have to understand
as a project manager what kind of
organization structure this is and based
on this we understand what is the
authority of the project manager and
accordingly handle the situation so any
question on this particular topic
okay so there are 47 project management
processes in the fifth edition of the PM
bak which is currently running and these
47 processes are spread across five
process groups and the five process
groups are initiation planning execution
monitoring and control and closing so
these you can also say as the five
phases of a project you initiate a
project where you assign you say that
yes this project is not going to happen
you assign a project manager you create
a project charter and take it forward
from there once you do it the next thing
that we need to do is plan
so we decide that okay we will go for a
euro vacation
decide on it and we say okay we will
have this much of fun for
this vacation that is initiation
planning is where we start talking to
the agents to the travel agents to the
hotels and plan out where all we will
want to go where we will do what how
many days we stay and plan out or how we
go by fly it by train whatever all those
is at the planning stage execution is
when we are actually going and doing the
work or where we are on vacation where
we have bought the tickets where we are
now traveling and we are moving at all
you will always see that even in such
cases we go to a hotel we don't like the
hotel maybe we change the hotel the
location is not good are we trying to go
in in train but we find that it is
better to go by car to certain
destinations we plan to visit particular
places but instead we heard that it is
better to go to some other castle or
something
we plan that now that is progressive
elaboration where on the regular basis
we get to know more about the place
about the work and we make changes to
our plans now when we are doing all this
there needs to be a control a monitoring
and control so the parent will always
the father will always be doing some
monitoring in control to ensure that you
don't spend money more than what was
planned
and finally once it is done we close we
pay back all the agents we paid all the
vendors with whom we have interacted
like hotels car whatever it is and we
come back put our photos in the album
put it on the Facebook and all those
that is closing 10 p.m. I always says
that once you finish your project you
should also party with the team that is
basically for the motivation of the team
for the hard work they have put in so in
each process what we will see is there
is inputs there are some tools and
techniques to execute that process and
the process will generate some output in
a softer
project we have the scope we have the
contract all those will come as our
inputs to the our requirements gathering
once we do the requirements then
gathering by interviews and conference
room pilots and all these we will then
generate the output which is your
approved requirement specification
documents and the acceptance criteria
so that is how all the processes will be
the whole p.m. Bach is also arranged in
similar manner
for you to study there are n knowledge
areas which is covered in the pima first
is the integration management
integrates all the pollak areas together
we have scope management time management
cost quality management human resource
management communications management
risk management procurement management
and stakeholder management
so p.m. Pok one day
Rupa what is the PM Bach stands for PM
Baucus project management book of
knowledge
that is your basic standard which is
published by EMI based on which is all
the certification
