morning everyone welcome to a DevOps
entry preparation webinar conducted by a
greater myself I am Pradeep I have been
working with IT industry for almost 15
years
I have gave up to experience for several
years I have been working on various
different projects I've seen multiple in
organizations transitioning from a
classical background to a DevOps
practices and I already part of various
transition programs and transformation
projects programs or DevOps this is a
privilege for me to give this a webinar
so we'll start with the first one which
is demands of DevOps why we need
actually DevOps what is actually
trending and develops what is driving
faith factor for DevOps so two primary
concepts if you see the first one team
collaboration agility code is deployed
30 times more frequently then all these
three different boxes are basically
talks about the agility or the speed of
the deployment so it's actually
considering the speed so code is
deployed six times more frequently
nowadays then be usual so that's
actually possible by DevOps so if you
have devups practices in place agility
is possible you can deploy code 30 times
more frequently and the next one is talk
about reliability or the quality and it
talks about 50% fewer failures of new
releases using adopting DevOps practices
and principles you can reduce the
failure rate of new releases to 50
percent so both agility and the quality
can be maintained by using DevOps
practices will see DevOps market the
DevOps is actually trending nowadays so
according to recent research the market
rates DevOps market is growing to 20%
every end of the decade which is
actually a huge number so if you see it
started in 2012 and it's with very bare
accountable numbers and then the numbers
have been encouraged ever since 2015 put
on 16 and the tremendous growth is
expected upcoming years so there's
actually a good opportunity for the
DevOps professionals and there was
practitioners that also have paid very
well if you see on the US it's actually
the starting cell there are 100,000
between
one twenty thousand USD per annum which
is actually a quite good and also there
was practitioners are played very well
in UK and Australia and some of the
parts I know like the way that I work
with you know they are also K very well
almost close to the UK salary and also
some of the places like you know
Singapore and in Hong Kong there also
trending a lot so if you feel like the
markets are trending quite well the
practitioner there are engineers like
the ops engineers as senior DevOps
engineers develop leads level objects
all these various rules are coming AWS
cloud engineers cloud engineers cloud
support engineers multiple organizations
are starting various new rules for the
DevOps practitioners with very good
salaries bedrooms so and it comes to the
adopting DevOps by various organizations
we only don't know I call it the recent
survey when we only don't know 77
percent of the organization what they
are doing but the rest of them are
actually most of them are adopting
DevOps company-wide so the organization
is actually moving towards DevOps and
some of the organizations like to do a
person is actually adopting all for a
particular business unit for example I
work on an organization with my business
unit right now is actually is trending
towards DevOps and some project and
teams are also independently adopting
DevOps like they have their own DevOps
tools DevOps practices and etc and at
one percent they are not adopting DevOps
but sooner or later they will probably
go for DevOps because it talks about
speed and agility and then the best
quality so there is actually quite a lot
of girls that the organization can
expect adopting DevOps
so today we're going to discuss some of
the basic interview questions again
these questions are basically coloring
on a very high level and to have a more
depth of understanding of each topic you
have to involve to DevOps class that
provided by Erica
we're going to see some generalize there
you know questions and questions based
on topic so these questions are actually
divided into various topics so general
questions are actually applicable for
any anybody like project managers table
first queue ways these questions will
others like you know what is DevOps
what's the need for DevOps what is the
driving factor for DevOps and etc and
symbol you know internal concepts like
you know what are the source code
management questions continuous
integration questions in the
configuration management and continuous
monitoring containerization
virtualization has been divided in
several subgroups and there most of
these questions are relevant for anybody
it's not just the developer or DevOps
engine it can be for developer or
project manager or a project lead or
somebody is actually the management
course somebody is just starting the
carrier irrespective of the level these
questions and answers are applicable for
any of the person who's actually
venturing is clear into DevOps area so
if you see on the left side there's a
small picture about the SPLC so it
starts with planning stage and then once
the project is planned and we actually
code and build the code testicle release
the code deploy to a moment and start
using the code application and then keep
monitoring so this is actually a general
sdlc lifecycle and the various tools are
basic basically used for each of these
and you know phase of the SPLC so if you
leave this planning stage out then you
start with coding so once you start
coding you just need to store that code
in a repository in a version control
system so for that purpose you can use
git or SVM subversion now get being the
popular modern version control system
we're going to cover some of the topics
about get today and get the reports the
source control management system or
source code management system or version
control management system all these
terms are pretty much interchangeably
used and it's actually used to store the
code that you're actually writing now
once the code is written so basically we
also use tool called JIRA and JIRA is
basically to track is called a issue
tracking tool or it can be call it a
defect tracking or it can be called as a
you know requirement gathering tool so
this tool basically used to track the
development activities so for example
you want to define you want to develop a
a project and you want to develop a
small and you know GUI application and
that application development can be
divided into multiple paths so for
example one of the tasks would be to
design a
GUI interface was a login ID and
password screen so this can be actually
recorded as a task in JIRA and assigned
to a developer and then right actually
estimated time in the JIRA so that you
know the Stars can be assigned to the
developer and the developer will start
working on the activity start coding it
and once the coding is complete it will
change the status of that particular
task in the JIRA as close or probably
development complete or something so
it's basically a tracking of tasks the
issues can be done using JIRA and it's
actually for my class iam it's a license
tool but it can be used for free for
small organization like you know five to
ten developers for free but if it is you
know an organization-wide you need to
actually procure the license from
Atlassian again eclipse is ID integrated
development environment and it's
actually used by developers to write
their code into and then compile the
code so if you're writing java code or
darknet code you can actually use this
you know Eclipse plug-in as our Eclipse
IDE what was plugins and then write your
code and you can compile it actually
shows you basic deck servers and
actually it helps you to debug in
compile so widely used free open-source
to also intially duty another option for
you know for the developers as well okay
once the code is still live the next
stage is to build a code and in order to
build a code we use several tools such
as and and being the most popular and
very being used for is there in the
market for several several years and ant
is basically a build tool ultimately
mavin mavin actually is a you know to
use for Java based project and very
popular and very powerful
maven you can actually run your you can
compile your java bills or any other
bills alternative liquid a little bit
modern build tool it's actually built
has a lot of out of box features for
example or the Gradle you can actually
run a build in other parts with
absolutely no code at all for example if
you want to run a maven build maybe you
write hundred lines of code the same can
be achieved with ten lines of code in
Cuero because it has a lot of otterbox
features
that's about built and once the build is
done you need to test the code and for
that you can use the various testing
tools
selenium is one of the testing tool that
can be used very well for the based
applications or you know GUI you know
testing and at your functional testings
and gear you need is basically for unit
testing for Java based application so
this testing is you know after once it
is tested then actually you all can
combine all these code build and testing
in a continuous integration tools the
the little man you see here is actually
Jenkins tool and Jenkins is a continuous
integration tool ultimately bamboo is an
Atlassian tool for a continuous
integration has a very good
you know features for graphical
interface and it's actually a licensed
version so you need to buy license for
this one both for Jenkins is a free
open-source widely used by across all
organization means continuous
integration tools can be integrated with
this source code and then build in test
phase so you can automate this you know
building and testing and using the
continuous integration tools you also
can use it for deployment purpose all
right the next thing is the deployment
so if you see at this one the deployment
is basically before you deploy any code
you need to provision the environment so
you can use puppet chef ansible
or salt rack for provisioning the
servers and you know various instances
and then finally you can use you know
configuration management principles or
practices to kind of make sure those
provision servers are up to the mark or
have required prerequisite packages
installed as required prerequisite
configuration is complete and so forth
and then you also can deploy using these
computation management tools we're going
to cover each of topic in detail you
know in the next upcoming slides so once
the deployment is done then your so
which is an operation the next thing is
monitor so the monitoring can be done
using various tools so makers want to be
while you use open source tool has very
powerful features in build within it and
ultimately loose plank sense and new
really core you know the other
applications some of them you need to
buy a licenses for so you know this is
the whole stack of the dev ops and we
would cover you know in details the next
topics so the first topic is generate
DevOps questions right so what is
exactly DevOps now DevOps
if you ask anyone about the definition
of
de vos each person and will actually
define in its own way the reason is
because there is no particular
definition for DevOps right so but the
actual understanding is if you ask me I
would say that DevOps is actually a
practice that actually brings developers
and operations and HR and testing and
baile operations or their activities
together in a collaborative fashion
using proper processes and techniques to
achieve the fastest and reliable
software releases and that's what I
actually define it for because the
ultimate purpose of the collaboration of
course DevOps is for collaboration and
DevOps is actually using the right tools
and techniques but the ultimate purpose
of the DevOps is to actually give a
faster releases with high quality that's
the main purpose and that's basically
where the return on investment is there
right so if you bravely principles and
practices into various segments so here
is a small example source code
management is one of the area continuous
integration is another area continuous
testing is one of the areas
configuration management which also has
a infrastructure as code is one area
continuous monitoring is another area
all these areas together combined and
can be called as a DevOps practices so
the next is how is the ops different
from agile
all right so agile is basically a
methodology all right and the DevOps is
basically a practice the difference is
we a John has a methodology for example
if you talk about scrum framework which
is a widely used as agile methodology
framework the scrum framework a finds a
particular processes and rules right and
all the development has to add her or
fit into that framework so the scrum
defines the development activities you
know as a sprint repeatable a tradable
sprint so each spring has a number of
tasks that actually we define so there
are some framework defined in the agile
methodology and then development
practices would actually will fit into
that framework so that simple and agile
say for example framework or methodology
only deals with development search they
will be installed in development and it
doesn't deal with how you have to test
it
how you have to release the code how the
operations and production support work
ongoing and support will continue it
doesn't talk about that but whether it's
DevOps DevOps talks about you know the
whole end-to-end SDLC lifecycle starting
to the development testing operations
and production support so it actually
calls quite a lot of wide topics and it
is not a framework where you actually or
it's not just a methodology and it's
actually more of a practice and that
each organization has its DevOps
practices you know defined and uniquely
for each to meet the needs of the
organization right so it's different
it's quite different from agile
methodology right church not a
methodology it's just the practice okay
so what is the need for DevOps why we
actually need their labs or some of
these example actually the first thing
we have seen increased deployment
frequency so we have seen the first
slide where it says like 50 times more
frequent than the actual usual
requirement so if you see the
traditional end moment traditional
software companies they were probably
doing two releases or three villages for
you or maybe four releases per year no
actually the things are changing
nowadays that in order to sustain in the
market we need to do respond to the
change as quickly as possible so that
means a new change means new deployment
and new release the faster you actually
make your own product or the changes
ongoing changes in the market the better
you know return on investment is of the
better you know benefit for your product
so increase department and only possible
by using DevOps principles not by any
means right and the lower rate of new
releases the number of releases that
you're doing actually can into is a
potential risk for service failure or
release failure so it can be reduced
lower drastically by using the web's
practices right the next thing is
shorten lead time between fixes so if
you identify an issue and how much time
will take for you to fixes and then how
fast you can identify those a nation
right this is possible by their webs
practices then faster means to recovery
in time of a new release failure so
that's possible by the webs because
you're using continuous monitoring
they're actually money
during the application after you release
is complete to proactively you actually
check whether the application is
providing you know giving a required
results or not and the instead of
waiting for you know at the end of
failure which will probably cause a
potential business or a reputation
damage for your organization you
actually particularly identify these
small issues with gaps and then you fix
them as early as possible and that's one
of the you know important factor of
DevOps and so continuous monitoring
actually deals with this particular
topic where it shall increase faster and
then reliable software and then shortly
times to fix the issues and then
recovery time is actually is much more
faster in the event of an incident or a
failure
the next question is name some of the
DevOps tools and how these tools work
together right so this can be a you know
an important question like you can put
this question in another way like some
person can ask you the question like you
know you are a DevOps professional and
then the organization has given you the
flexibility of choosing the budget and
choosing various tools so if you are the
DevOps lead or double architect or
engineer what tools will you choose so
to answer the question is this one first
thing we start is with a source control
tool and there a resource control tool
available if is one of the popular
because it's the way it works and the
creatures that it provides so you choose
it it is a distributed version control
management tool and we actually see what
you know detailed questions about this
gate but get will use it for version
control and then maven use for building
and compiling your code and that most of
the code is actually build in Java and
so you actually can use maven because
maven provides out of box features for
compiling java code and then store the
artifacts in a proper way for example
Nexus is one of the artifact management
repository solution and that is very
well integrated with maven so once you
compile you can actually store the
artifacts in a nexus repository for
example so all these things can have to
be integrated with a continuous
integration tool called Jenkins Jenkins
is widely used open tools so it's
actually best in the organization as far
as I see
it has a lot of features and plugins
available now Jenkins can be integrated
with the test tools setting is one of
the examples for the web interfaces
testing and functional testing and and
various other testings involved it can
be decrypted with Jenkins as well and
the next thing is you have actually you
know identified tools for your source
code management your building purpose
and your testing your continuous
integration the next thing is to deploy
this application in a particular
environment so to have an environment
ready up and running you need to have a
provisioning system and also the project
system should be capable of deploying
the application as well so for that
purpose you can use puppet chapel
ansible
these you know tools can provide can be
used to provision the servers and then
deployed application and provide the
same consistency ultimately you can use
docker for the micro service
applications so docker containers
provide consistent computing and warming
through the SDLC the Dockers basically
if you don't need a virtual machine and
because you're running a small small
applications like micro services and
then you can actually use it with all
quite your application so docker is also
will be a best in our project it's not
an alternate approaches but is one of
the approaches so that's actually about
the question number four the next thing
is source code management question so
here we're talking about it because git
is the most widely used modern software
source control management tool what
function did our forms in DevOps so if
you see the SDLC this is the picture of
SDLC we're talking about planning the
project and then start coding it and
that coding when you start coding it
unit is so that code in a repository and
then you also should be able to share
your code with other colleagues of your
team so for that purpose we use code
reuse gear to store the code and then
share the code with other app people in
your organization who are working on the
same project and there and then we can
further integrate that source code with
continuous integration tools so that
every time you do a change to your
source code it will trigger a build
automatically and then triggers tests
automatically and then apply some
configuration changes and deploy it in a
moment and then can be monitored so all
these things can be further automated so
so we can actually use continuous
integration say
every time a comment is made to get
repository continuous integration server
proves it and composite and also deploys
it onto the test server for testing
purposes so that's the control gate
actually performs next plane gets
distributed architecture another
question right now how did it work so
gif is a distributed architecture
unlike SVM the difference between HTML
and gate if somebody arts is this one it
is distributed version control system
SVM is a client-server base origin
control system what is distributed
version control system is the repository
which has the all the source code it can
have multiple copies in multiple areas I
will explain that now if you see the
remote repository or a centralized
repository for example or it can call
the original repository is actually the
original one the initial depository and
then the each collaborator or the
developer actually take a copy of the
entire repository into is local data or
laptop and then start working on this
local repository commit the changes and
then push the changes to the remote
repository so that other developers
other contributors can pull the changes
and then start working on them so if you
see that repository is having multiple
copies right that's actually the
distributed version control system but
when it goes to subversion to centralize
version control system which means there
is a Central's depository that's
available in a centralized server and
then each collaborator or each developer
actually copy only the contents required
to the desktop called workspace it's not
the entire repository it's just the
workspace it's just a view that you can
see only certain branch on the certain
files you copy into your workspace and
then commit the changes so that's key
difference between hvn and get now
indeed how the user wrote a comment that
has already been pushed and made public
so indeed how do you rework a comment
that has already been pushed and made
public so let's say you have actually
using git and then you can run git
commit and then you commit the change
and you push it say how Jim how you want
relocate so there's a get rivalled
command available to revert the change
so for example using get comet - gem
comment restoration so the first command
comments the change and then you have
the use another command called git push
to push the change from your local
repository to visit motor position and
once it is push the remote repository if
you want to revert the change you have
used get a rework and then the commit
name so income it has a hash name to it
you just provide the name and then it'll
G work be comment alright like I said
the question and answers I actually
leave to the end so feel free to type
the questions and then at the end I'm
going to answer all the questions right
so that way we will not break the flow
right the next question is how do you
find a list of files that are that has
changed in a particular coming right
it offers rails commands git diff tree
is one of the commands that we can use
to see the files that are changed so get
different - are recursive and then hash
hash is basically the comic hash
so here the commit number actually means
called hashing because it's just not the
number it's a combination of characters
and numbers so you just stated coming to
hash and then provide it so that it
shows the list of files that have been
changed now
they give district provides the foolish
like the origin the person the author of
the comment and the timestamp and then
the commit message and whereas other the
differences and all but don't want to
see everything you just want to see the
file so the next command git diff drink
- no comic ID - name only - our hash it
gives you only the list of files
nothing else not even the commit ID or
the hash arrived of this particular
comic so it just shows you all the list
of files that have been committed or
changed in that particular comment all
right and we go to the next question
which is how abuse clash last and
connect into a single coming a this is
very very interesting any where we
unique feature offers it in the
traditional version control system
once it is committed you cannot change
the history but let's get it allows you
to play around with your original
history or version graph it cut into
your knee now what is question squashing
means combining multiple comets into a
single kind of tree for example you have
committed for cabbage one two three four
and you realize that also commits
supposed to be committed in single
commit rather than in having multiple
comments because you wanted to share
that coming ID or the files with
somebody else so for that purpose we use
force watching this is called squash we
use git reset command the reset actually
research the version history and what it
does see for example you want to commit
change combine all the last four comics
then in that case you need to use git
reset - rock head tilde n n stands for
the number of comments from the head
head is related the top tilde n means
the last n number of comments which
means Lecce if you give four then it's
going to be last for comics so once you
give this command and then run and get
comments so it actually combines all the
comments into one single comment so you
have to provide a new comic message so
that new comment that is committed will
have all these four comments the files
are change so you're basically playing
it on webcam so similarly you can
actually do another thing that you fear
for example you wanted to edit you know
the change it it be you know the edit
message so you can use a you know - M
and then provide some command like for
example get clogged - for my person is V
- rivers and shows basically they're
actually taking the same commenting
message of all these previous comments
and then adding it to this dis command
so that you don't want to even lose me
the comment messages that were committed
in the past so another interesting
advanced topic of a gate so that's
actually mod G and we actually now move
forward to continuous integration now
before actually I continue this topic I
just want to take a look at the question
answers because I see some of the
questions people
and it may be related to this same topic
so let me just open the keyword window
and see what are the different questions
about the gig okay I see there are
gender question I'm skipping I'll just
talk about the gift questions can two
people collaborating it without pushing
the goal into a market apology see if
you have to this question is from cherub
so if you have to elaborate your changes
you have to push to somewhere so for
example either you can push it to the
origin or you can push this change to
the other remote repository so it can be
your colleagues the repository so you
can push the change or the best way is
actually push it and there are
alternative ways without pushing to the
reporter position but you still have to
push to somewhere and that is actually
to the another local repository so let's
being answer questions in the best way
or the solution is to push a call right
it's possible but it's actually a little
bit tricky and it'll mess up something
now the next thing is can we reverse
this comic back to four different
comments I didn't understand this
question very well can we reverse this
coming back to four different comments
so see this crashing means we can
reverse a coming to four different
comments I mean we can reverse a
particular commit to any comic that we
want to for example you have like done a
ten college and you want to go revert
back to can't commit as possible she
just use a reverse and then do the comic
name so that actually is the answer to
the question so now again there are some
other questions provided by a guy so I
cannot give up if the company requires
DevOps that's actually right every
complete actually requires if they
wanted to sustain in the market they
actually have to be Arabs and that's
what my understanding without DevOps
even though some companies they don't
call them up they have some sort of
practices so you know some where the
other they are falling developer
basically DevOps talks about more about
the these topics so the next thing is I
will actually sleep the questions now if
you have any questions we'll see at the
end I will go forward to this continuous
integration topic
what is meant by a continuous
integration so continuous integration is
defined basically based on the commit
that you're doing so every comment that
you do to a repository or every change
that you do has to be immediately
compile and build and integrated so
that's called continuous integration so
the continuous integration best
practices that you do a commit on your
own branch for example but continuously
integrate the change to the trunk or to
the master or to the main line of the
code so that it can be compiled
immediately and then the feedback will
be given back whether this fail or
successful so for example you're a
developer you're working on one single
feature and for that purpose you created
a separate feature branch culture and
then you actually done your recording
you have compiled it on your desktop
perfectly fine but how sure you are that
that code actually works with the code
that the other developers are actually
doing it so that's actually is what
integration means you integrate your
code with other developers and then that
integrated code has to be compiled has
to be tested whether it's working or not
so that's actually continuous
integration so you commit your change
and then you integrate your change to
other people's changes and then you
build it and test and deploy it so those
are the best practices if you read the
called continuous integration by just
humble which is a very famous book it
actually talks about there is best
practices for the continuous integration
one of them that I like is that all the
code by all the developer has to be
committed directly on to the trunk and
then the trunk or the main branch or the
master branch and that master branch has
to be integrated with a convenience
integration server for example Jenkins
or bamboo that actually should pull all
the number of comments and for each
coming the bill should trigger and then
there should be an automated test that
trigger and there should be a deployment
that should be followed by this
particular comet sure each comet is
actually the result your build and a
test and optionally a deploying right so
that's basically is about continuous
integration and then mention some of the
commonly is junking plugins Jenkins is
our focuses Jenkins here which is a
continuous integration server and
Jenkins will not work without plugins so
by default if you install Jenkins
it's just the shell without installing
plugins you cannot use it so one of the
basic entry questions about okay again
the question that this session is
basically covering only the basic
interval questions not the in depth the
topics of each level because if you
wanted to have any questions related to
getting in depth our specific topics
feel free to enroll into elapsed cause
and we're we're going to discuss you
know several hours on each topic
extensively and all the questioners
answers can really or well answer so
some of these plugins that will Jenkins
uses this get plug-in or HTM something
essential because it has to be connected
with a source control system but to
monitor and necessary plug-in a very
very invasive plug-in to log into remote
machines to do something more execution
of commands and copied files etc and
then build pipeline plug-in shows
basically the pipeline is actually a
convention mechanic that you can use for
you know to create an option when
downstream connections so basically so
pipelines basically you can actually
build you can see the entire you know
view of your building and deploying to
different environments and staging and
production etc so for that purpose you
can use build pipeline and then email
ext plug in that space for the different
notifications as soon as you get some
result out of the build and the HTML
publishing plug-in also to publication
reports multi slave configuration
plug-in and this is basically to allows
the administrator to you know configure
ways things are basically the agents of
you know changing agents to run the jobs
remotely on a remote server and to
manage them you can use multi slave
configuration plugin and parametrize to
trigger plugin is another planet that
actually lets you build based on the
parameter I can pass various parameters
during the building in phase and there
are several more I mean these are just
you bugging them that way there's other
plugins like for example you want to
position you can use in a check you know
or if you're probably connector with
eight of yes you can easily eight abbi
as a plugins and if you wanted to use it
for example docker images you can use
docker plugins and these are the plugins
and you can also use the some of the
basic plugins such as you know native
plugins or Jenkins for example and Lomb
and dashboard release dashboard all the
dashboards and you can use advanced
topics like job DSL to kind of manage
all your jobs and to script your whole
infrastructure of Jenkins ever call you
can use job DSL plugin and whereas other
plugins that can use it so these are
some of the basics are the next question
is explain
Jenkins distributed our code
architecture what is the need for this
architecture why so Jenkins is basically
is a distributed architecture as you can
see there's a master server that
actually can be configured with all the
jobs and the requirements and everything
and then you can actually choose a
particular job to run on a different
server right why because you know it's
because your for example you want to
deploy a code you know on a Linux box
and then we want to deploy the same code
on a Windows box for example or you know
on and a different Linux distribution so
for that purpose you need to connect to
that server and then do it as activity
so this all can be automated by actually
installing Jenkins slave on each of
these nodes and then running it so
that's where and then you have like
village in moments you know each
environment can be treated as a separate
combination of separate place so Jenkins
master is not just enough you just need
to have Jenkins slave and you can use as
many slaves as possible because it's
open source tool and you know you're not
paying for this right so that's actually
the distributed architecture of Jenkins
the next question is how will you secure
Indians in other words you know what are
the best security practices sort of
Jenkins and you know so the question is
your being sure that the global security
is a parameter gained in the
configuration settings of Jenkins you
actually set that on so that not anyone
like anonymous users can access it so
you're actually restricting and
animus users and you're enabling
actually you know security and you can
integrate probably very well with your
you know exterior of your company but
that's also one of the best ways and
actually it's a good way of doing
securing your drinking's and then the
next thing is you have been able
something called project metrics in
jenkins so you can actually choose who
can access which projects so that's
actually possible by project metrics in
Jenkins alright you can also automate be
you know setting rights and privileges
on Jenkins using custom control script
that's possible that you have to do some
you know scripting activity for that one
also you can limit the physical access
of Jenkins data folder and some of the
folders so only Jenkins users can have
access to that one if you log in to the
server and then open Jenkins folder you
have something called Jenkins data
folder and then jobs folder and these
folders can be also can be used to
secure as well and the next thing is
periodically run security audits and you
know that's one of the things that each
of organizations to do kind of I mean it
looks like a really complicated but it's
not you just learning to server
every time and just see who is having
access is there any change in the
excesses or run some script that
actually monitors these does these
audits automatically right so explain
how you can create a backup and copy of
files in Jenkins so this is also one of
the ways you can also migrate Jenkins
from one instance to other instance
right the same process is applicable the
way that we can do is actually there's a
folder called jobs and then inside the
job directory all the jobs will be stood
she had probably can take a copy of the
whole jobs folder right and it actually
takes that means you're actually showing
it actually you can copy it or you can
clone it in a different machines and
then reuse it so that's basically for my
gosh
or changing or when you rename an
existing job for example name then you
have to also make sure the underlying
jobs are in it so to answer quickly
these questions it's a copy of the jobs
folder that actually does the work all
right next is Configuration Manager for
I go to this configuration manager let
me take a quick look at the questions so
somebody asks like what is the meaning
of by sector means see git command
actually it's used for binary and you
choose some sort of a binary
algorithms to kind of find which
comments in the projects introduced a
bot so it's actually a little bit
advanced kind of topic but it's actually
you can use this for you know finding
the bad comments was just the good
comments and Chitra so again this is
actually a little bit in depth topic and
so we're going to put a colorable detail
of this one the next thing is on the
continuous integration the question is
is nightly build a part of continuous
integration we actually nightly builds
or marketing is integration continuous
integration means you comment each
comment should trigger a bill when
that's actually controversy explosion if
you read the book urges humble and just
humble clearly face that Michael bills
are not continuous integration right so
that's a famous but all most
organizations actually adopted the
principles defining that that will make
sure I also you know work for that one
so the answer is now the next question
is what's the difference between CIN CD
continuous integration and continuous
deployment actually very good question
there's actually a difference between
continuous integration and and then the
continuous integration and continuous
deployment say continuous integration is
talking about filling your code as
quickly as possible to get this feedback
whether the build is successful or not
right now so each comment will trigger a
build and then the corresponding test so
that's actually continuous integration
right and then the next phase is
continuous deployment wins every bill
that is run will generate some artifacts
like a jar file or the Muslim sort of
fact that particular new artifact the
result of the D bill has to be deployed
continuing and a moment to kind of test
it and that's actually continuous
deployment right and we also have
something called CD also stands for
continuous delivery which means it
actually talks about the whole large
picture like as soon as you build your
code you have to continuously deliver
that to production she talks about you
know deploying continuous delivery
continuous deployment to your testing
moments and then the automated trigger
definer workflow that actually
automatically test the environment test
environment and make sure if it is done
then continuously deploy that to
production
so there are organization that follows
continuous deployment or continuous
delivery for example Netflix does you
know maybe 30 deployments per day and
they do quite a lot of deployment so the
wave to the productions they way to do
is each commit will actually trigger a
continuous integration bill and actually
create an artifact and that artifact
will be automatically deployed to a
testing moment and then the testing
moment will actually you know that the
automated tests will run against a ten
bomb and a very successful and it will
be promoted to production immediately so
if it is filled then actually feedback
will go back to the developer and then
they will I get fix it and go so this
process will goes on this is actually a
continuous delivery rather than
conventionally planner so the next stop
begins continues configuration
management questions like explain the
various configuration management company
now this is not a neutral configuration
management so basically your management
configuration information of each of
your resources or
SS right of your organization for
example your this server is an asset and
that each server has a its own
configuration information right and then
it has to be managed properly so the
phases of the configuration management
is first configuration identification so
identify what are the configurations for
your resource for example or effort so
let's say you have a server and then
commonly cities it has what is the
memory and how many packages installed
what are the conveyors can provision
files of the particular server and what
it is used for the purpose that it's
been used for service things its mean
you know where is quite a lot of massive
information about each node and actually
is the first beginning part its
identification and that information has
to be stored from there and in the olden
days we used to call tmdb
configuration management database where
they all information is stored now with
modern things like you know using chef
puppet or ansible
so it's actually quite a lot of things
are automated so if you install these
tools these configuration management
tools to the fetch the information
automatically installs into B into its
central server right or just a great
thing so and then once the configuration
identification is done then then you
have to manage the change which is
actually change management
and change management is like each
change has to be deployed properly and
rolled back in the evil topic radio so
that's actually confusion change
management and configuration shapes
accounting so that's what actually it's
a it provides the stages whether the
configuration item is working properly
or not
right and this is used for reporting
purposes and then the next thing is
configuration audit verify the
consistency of the documentation against
the actual product these are the
principles of configuration management
you know it's just for the third purpose
and then when it goes to the
configuration management the actual
management of the tools like
reprehensible share of the picture will
be a little bit different okay another
question is put into question is what's
the difference between asset management
and a configuration management now as if
management talks about more about money
it's about logistics it kind of thing so
but when it comes to configuration
management we're talking about
more from an Operations perspective it's
ITIL based right it's basically for
troubleshooting if there are any errors
like the lifecycle is just to deploy in
the determine right but when it comes to
the city management
it's just concerned with the you know
finance like how much each will cost and
in a who owns it and then what is the
purchasing and leasing processes terms
and also how to maintain the servers and
etc such as basically licensing and all
these things will be part of this asset
management thing whereas configuration
management is about deployment
operations right so that's a different
key difference ok the next thing is part
of this what do you understand by
infrastructure as code the
infrastructure has Co has been very
popular in fact there are the whole
practice of DevOps is being or the
DevOps evolved from the principles of
configuration management and the
infrastructure is code so what it
exactly means that you're provisioning
and environment should start with a code
so if you wanted to provide a provision
a Devon moment or a test of production
or woman everything should be starting
with code so it should contain a code
you have a code and you trigger the code
that'll actually pick your program and
my line so it's basically you're storing
the infrastructure as a code right if
the definition says IAC is automation of
IT operations such as building a plan
managed by provisioning of code rather
than the manual process right so you
provide dev test in production and
moments using the code of a centralized
location that's a infrastructure scope
the next question is what's the
difference between push and pull in
configuration management now why we need
actually push and even pull during the
controller's management is basically
your centralized server actually sold
the configuration information of all
your notes like you know what your note
a contains no beacon they no chicken
things now if there is a change that a
node needs to receive then directly
mechanisms that would be involved either
centralized in silver can push the
change to the required node that's
actually push mechanism or the nodes we
can define a polling mechanism so that
the node will consistently tricks with
the centralized server and then updates
it whenever that is in need right so
that's actually pull mechanism however
actually discussing this one because
there are some tools were kind of push
based mechanism some computer management
tools work on pull based kind of foolish
management for example and Sybil is this
push push method and other tools like
puppet chef and the sauce that uses pull
based mechanism right so the next thing
is how topic works right now puppet
actually has a master and slave concept
so you have a master server
it's a centralized of its server that
will be used for your storing all your
configuration information about all your
puppet
slaves no puppets ladies a clear door
where you probably running an apache or
some kind of an application or database
or somewhere so you actually manage
those servers from the puppet slave so
you install puppet slave on the nodes
and then you install puppet master on a
centralized server to manage your
changes so the first thing is how it
works is the puppet slave when it is
connected to SSL encryption right all
the slaves are connected to mas using
SSL secure layer secure socket layer so
now the first thing is the puppet
actually slaves
and the facts now what in fact fact is
basically the configuration information
everything about the slate like CPU
number of CPUs memory number of packages
installed and the quite a lot of massive
information will be sent to puppet
master puppet master scholarship and in
puppet Marshall also has a catalog
information would actually send to sleep
this catalog is you know number of
packages we made should be install and
so our number of configuration changes
that needs to be done on a particular
shape so slave actually compares the
catalog information see if there is a
deviation say for example there's one
line that needs to be changed in a count
file right so in that kind of file one
line and information needs to be changed
up a slave identifies this change and
then it actually does the change once
the catalog is pushed on the master
server and then the reports back the
result right so the number one of the
traces the node reports back the puppet
indicating the configuration is complete
which is visible a liquid - book so
that's how actually how it works right
now what are the modules and manifests
in puppet so there are two things about
modules and managers so manifest let's
talk about on the light side what is
manifest now every to change the
configuration information of a
particular server or a property node is
actually stored in a native language
called a puppet native language and
these information of actually sorting
manifests so for example you need to if
I install an Apache or a particular
server so that's actually a like called
you know approaching right so this
manifests actually contains the lines of
core to perform some activity on an old
server now module is actually a
combination of such a manifest write for
example you can have a manifest to
install Apache another manifest
installed Maria dB another manifest
let's say to install Tomcat
so all these combination can be combined
together and it is a single module and
this can be reused so the modules so if
you see on the left side a puppet module
is a collection of manifest and the data
for this text files and templates and
they have a specific directory structure
modules are useful organizing of its
core properly and because they allow you
to split your called multiple manifest
you're going to choose which manifests
choose from my particular module such
actually like you're not you're writing
it in a Java project like you're writing
each module so manifests are basically
single individual files and they're
written in public language called
extensions with PP right so if you see
the small example it says node host 2
which is basically to install this on
node hosue pocket slave called host -
and you're calling a class called you
know patching and then the Tecna tree
you're defining various to that image
like you know that apache host module
you're calling a module and then
defining you know the name is
example.com and then you're actually
passing some parameters like resource
port is equal to 80 and then dock root
is equal to as WWE HTML so it's a small
example another thing to note is like
for proper calm it's actually a
community - open source community where
people develop the akkad modules and
then they share with each other such a
good place to go and look for proper
tools instead of writing your own you
can actually choose one of the existing
puppet modules okay now the next thing
is Jeff let's talk about Jeff and how
the architecture explained the chip
architecture now the three key terms for
the chef is chef so Jeff node and then
Jeff workstation three different things
now Jeff silver is like puppet server is
a centralized store of all the
infrastructure as configuration
information was told in Jeff's ever and
then the check node is basically what
just several managers so Jeff node is
basically your civil reader catcher
whatever is install your application is
running and you want to manage those
nodes with your chip server right now
ultimately with Jeff orchestration is
actually your desktop or a server a
virtual box from where you actually
initiate Jeff's commands right then
knife is actually one of the command
that we used to upload configuration
changes to the Jeff server so for
example you want to change is something
called a a cookbook
what is script with cookbook is
basically a place or actually storing
the configuration information all the
your configuration templates and files
and everything on a target in a cookbook
so for example you can write a cookbook
cookbook leader code you write any
jeopardy as a language which is actually
it'll be style and in the cookbook you
actually define what package is needs to
be deployed into a particular chef note
so you define in the create a cookbook
that cookbook as a rules number of
packages required and you know the
services teach you started everything
combined together in a cookbook and that
could book you have defined and you
wanted to show that cookbook in the chip
server so you use knife upload commit
right show that command you use from the
check workstation so you do operations
like changing the chip server
information using chef workstation and
then chef actually server pushes that
information to be chef notes right and
see if you see this here on the left
edge this chip client runs on node at
attainment configuration information for
the chef server and the chief client and
knife uses API clients to talk to chef
server right and knife is used to
communicate with nodes using SSH and
systems managed by Jeff or called nodes
on the left side assist chef workstation
is simply computer with a local chef
repository and they're properly
configured like command so this is how
it works now if you just on the right
side you see all configuration first to
test it on the workstation so if you
write a cookbook you have to test it so
you can use TIFF inspect all check you
can testing tools to kind of test it on
your workstation and then you push it to
the server and then the Jeff server
actually manages automatically you know
pushing the information to the check
nodes you know or some process called
convergence it chooses to kind of make
sure the changes are actually properly
pushed or the state of the chief knows
is in line with what is defined in the
chat server why that's actually the
architecture now just an example to
write a recipe to install httpd and copy
index.html file to the default document
will be come from the installation so a
small example probably all somebody will
ask interview it's very easy so recipe
there's a difference between this again
the cookbook recipe is basically just
like a manifest and
change the resources to bring the server
into a particular state and then when
you actually combine the recipe with all
the templates and variables and all it
can we call it a cookbook and there can
be various recipes so together you can
combine several recipes as a one
cookbook so just like you know manifest
is equal to recipe and then module is
basically like a cookbook
so in a particular module in chef you
can call it as a cookbook and then
puppeteer called manifest the same thing
you could call it the recipe check right
so here's package phase should be
between a package is basically a
resource it's called a resource in check
and it's a predefined resource and when
a defined package hd-dvd actually it
will be ill install package called httpd
and service is actually called another
resource that actually starts or service
or actually stops cells are enabled so
you can actually define doing and do is
basically like open brackets and end is
like closing brackets and you actually
find an action all right so if you don't
do define an action so by default there
is some action associated with that
particular resource and that will be
enabled for example you're mentioning
here action enable comma start which
means you are enabling the service
called httpd and then you're starting
the service so if you don't define so by
default it actually automatically stops
because for service action start is
default we're going to see that later
and the next is you're using a file
research to copy a file to this target
web WWE mell index dot HTML do Open
bracket content you're writing the
content into that file as welcome to a
patch in chat so this is basically test
and then end it this simple kind of a
script all right so the next thing is
what happens when you don't specify a
resource of action so like I mentioned
so for example let's say the first
example is file see users administrator
chapter for setting story and I do
content Green is equal to hello world so
you're actually basically not facing any
action but whereas if you see the next
snippet code it says action : create
which means both does the exact same
thing it creates a file called settings
or omi and then with a content called
creating hello world but the next
thing is you are explicitly specifying
an action called create and if you
specify action color create it actually
create even if you don't define action
creates a default action for file
results so that's why it actually gets
executed
so because create is the file resources
default action should create another
entry question so under the different
question is all these future recipes of
the same so what is the difference
the first one is such as finish httpd
service httpd do action area will start
any the next one is it start with
service into the package and then
starting a service called httpd and then
little it's running package HTTP
installation so by seeing at this the
way the chef works is it was the
sequential ii from the top to down so
the first one is correct because it
installed the package and then started
the second one is included because it's
starting the service and then install
the package but that's actually that's
wrong you have to install package first
in order to start the service otherwise
it'll scale it says the package does not
exist so the first one is correct so the
answer is no they are not because the
chip applies resources in order they
appear so the first recipe ensures the
HTTP packages in the store and then it
configures the service the second recipe
configures the service and then ensures
that the package is installed which is
actually only correct right the next
question is about ansible
in danceable a push based or a full base
cm2 like i explained before edible works
on a push based mechanism not a pull
base well how does it work you have a
server and sibyl's server where you have
actually kept all your playbooks right
and then those playbooks can be version
controlled right and then all we can do
is actually what ansible does ansible
you have to specifically to write a
instable commands to push these changes
to the various other rate nodes that you
have and then by default and Sybil uses
as a switch to connect to this remote as
servers that you are managing all right
and then the other into a question too
famous into a question is that you don't
need to install ansible agent on each of
these nodes that you're managing there
is no such thing called ansible
agents there's only one thing called
ansible server you install Sybil and
that ansible on a server right and then
as long as you
silver is able to connect with SSH and
run remote command or using SSH on to
the remote bomb your server can manage
it all you need to do is you need to
configure your inventory which is
basically the number of hosts that
server is managing and it properly in
the Indian inventory right as long as
you can do that and it can actually
manage it so that's actually a
difference between also you know push
and pull mechanism and also the way and
Civil War the advantage with ansible is
you don't need to install an agent on
each box
so a quick entry caution can be another
enter question can be like how let's say
you can be off like you know you have a
50 different Linux boxes and then you
are able to do a switch from your box to
all these 50 new servers and then you
want to install a particular application
on this all these boxes how can you do
it
so the simplest thing to do is you know
to run ansible it can be one command you
know to install like say Apache on all
these nodes just write a small playbook
now here are the cookbooks and a check
is actually same as playbooks in ansible
so we call playbook financeable
see right the small playbook and that
actually install the Apache and then run
ansible command and specify a number of
hosts and that actually goes connect
where is it and install that httpd
package and then the project the status
are we update about the color course the
next thing is how ansible architecture
looks like right so as i mention like
and sub and mentoring inventory is
basically the house the number of holes
that you're managing and then it has
something called a playable flavor cases
same as my cookbook flavor cache modules
and an API isn't plugging by all these
things so each flavor you know uses some
modules which uses api's and which uses
plugins are able to basically code that
you write and that calls these various
existing predefined module right and
then ansible automation engine has your
on replay book against an inventory so
you define a playbook to install apache
for example and then run the playbook
against an inventory that inventory can
be a you ad servers or development boxes
or production shows like and CMDB is
actually connected which which
configuration
information and then all the host gets
managed so this is a simple very simple
architecture diagram right all right
before we go to the next topic I want to
take a look at the questions I see
several questions here the questions
about if ansible only uses push
mechanism and sibelius uses only push
mechanic for as I am aware my
understanding goes well right and I have
somebody that I have heard it can be
used for pull mechanism as well probably
is server but I have not used it in the
popular way of using ansible is so we're
talking about here not a trick a
question but in true questions what
we're talking about the intricacies and
interviewer asked this question she
probably is expecting pushed from here
right but if you wanted to say if you
can also use as pull then you have to
prove it enough what is the plugin exact
plug-in that uses my experience I have
not used answerable for pull purposes
right I have you only used for push and
that's the most of the people use
ansible for an dance abilities payments
for push Iran cently it should be push
right we're talking about like you know
tracking into a question something
you're probably more wiser than the
person who is interviewing but you just
need to answer your question accurately
what the guys are actually asking you so
that actually gives you success in the
interview right and then the next
question is what's the difference
between tools like TIFF and super puppet
and docker so Jeff ansible probably
configuration management tools like to
manage the Confucian say for example in
the olden days just an example like I
used to manage like various environments
like 10 development in Romans 10
European moments
10 production in our servers like you
know in violently Devyn mom and has
sensor was you would get in service
production has Chancellor's the age of
this sensor it has its own role for
example in the pen Devon Warren's one
server is used for a level application
the other one is used to run some
back-end services the other one is a
database server and then we have a
cluster of all these things like each is
done on our element patients now all is
integrated actually is a very good
infrastructure but what happens is when
we promote code deploy code from one of
these environment to another environment
the deployment is successful but we have
some issues
the plumbing goes what after starting
the service some things doesn't work
some of issues we used in Congo and this
is a repeated problem work because this
consideration of each of these
environments are not identical quite
which means there is somebody has done
some small change to an Apache file or
changed a registry entry in the windows
or probably changed a you know
fine-tuned some memory parameter in
alexey in the database right of the
server and as a result the development
everything worked fine but when it goes
to the UAD it didn't work it is that
small information the configuration
change has never been recorded anywhere
right in that purpose to manage the
consistency between all the environments
we use configuration management why we
do it anything that any change we do we
do is using either if you're using
ansible use we actually do it through
playbooks which is again stored in
origin control if you're using Jeff we
do it using cookbooks and pop it is
actually Quebec modules in manifest
right that's how we show that we
actually reprovision environment we'll
deploy the playbooks all these in a
configuration information to the new
environment or to the existing
environment so it will be automatically
updated it matches with exact you know
exactly what we need
right so that there will not be any
failure at all when we actually deploy
the actual code right so that's why
that's the purpose of the configuration
management tools docker on the other
hand it's actually used for
virtualization purposes right so there's
a different slight difference between
virtualization and darker we're going to
cover that topic or Braco in the next
upcoming slides while the next question
is module fused for defining a classes
can we deploy a module directly on the
on the topic agent yes we can actually
deploy a particular module directly on
an agent right so now a module can have
a default class so basically every
module should have a class and if you
don't specify a class it's actually
takes default class so that module you
can define you can actually run against
appropriate
that's possible all right the next
question is for provisioning
infrastructure on a cloud which tool is
better puppet or chef both are equally
powerful so in order for me to comment
it's a very unwise it depends upon you
know the person's interest and then the
person experience so for example if
you're more experienced with puppet you
can use copper because even the
licensing costs are more or less same of
it if you're using for example AWS club
I can just use an example AWS cloud has
opts works tightly integrated with chip
right so probably your default option
would be to share if you're using club
but pop it also equally powerful you can
still use puppet to provision you know
AWS cloud and most of the people I use
with like you know those who use
OpenStack they actually use puppet
widely should just you know how you
orbit so my understanding is pop it goes
well with if you're using OpenStack and
Jeff goes well if you're using Alyssa
it appears again it's just a default but
you still can reverse it and it works
exactly the same and even much better
sometimes right ok if install the
default action yes it is install is a
default action for packaged resource
right now which is better push or pull
mechanism will actually need append so
for example from case to case so if you
want to do one-time activity right you
want to install provision servers and
then using provisioning servers can be
done by push mechanism because it's a
one-time activity but pull mechanism is
to kind of once your provision and then
it's connected to an environment and you
have to keep on receiving the updates
and for that purpose you can use pull
mechanism why the next question is it
can be done by creating docker images
and uploading it on Tobruk okay I'll
come back a little bit later in our last
section called virtualization all right
the next topic is about a continuous
monitoring
now why continuous monitoring is
necessary continuous monitoring allows
the timely identification of problems
and weaknesses in the software we
actually deploy and it actually reduces
the expenses of the organization because
you are finding the issues earlier
and in after an incident is happening
and financial or reputational damage of
a particular organization because of the
service failure so you're identifying
the potential failures in advance rather
than in you know after sometimes it's
being proactive so this is done by a
traditions the this solution addresses
you know continuous auditing monitoring
end transaction in inch pension you're
inspecting certain things now why we
need continuous monitoring and that's
what we have seen and what does
negatives worker so we're going to cover
here negatives how does it work so
negatives is a open source monitoring
tool and this open source monitoring
tool is used for you know monitoring
your edits applications and basically
negatives it actually the server is a
human in translation centralized the
bagua server you actually install the
india server module in a particular
server that's actually used a
centralized lee to monitor all your
applications all your servers so it's a
server agent based client server based
application and this negros demon
actually has a processor or a scheduler
it has a scheduler that actually sends
the results on a or excuse the plugin on
a scheduled basis on a reoccurrence
basis and so basically all you do is you
install the negative server on a
negative server so that you can monitor
the local resource like all the cpu
memory all the information monitoring or
the service information about the acutal
and you also can use something called a
remote server management so using
negative silver you can also manage a
remote agents and for that purpose you
need to install another plugin called +
RP which will go to shane an extra life
so basically negatives comes with quite
a lot of plugin so right you can use by
default menus when installed basic
module contains nothing but when you
install plug-ins know each plugins or
from data section so you can have a
plug-in to monitor the cps as you can
have it won a trip to plug in the disk
space so all is plug-in based right so
you need to install neglige the
processor scheduler or server and then
energy install negative plugins right
that will be executed by this process
and then that actually gives you the
information right so the first thing is
negotiate here's a project the next
billions plug-in checks the status and
gets the result and the third thing is
plug-in chance result to the negatives
to process and then negatives actually
finally displayed that information in a
web GUI interface right and then this
plug-in can be is in local plug-in all
this plugin can also execute it on a
remote box if you see the second number
two here plug in Texas stages and get so
that those offers remote host right in
order for the remote host to work we
need to have another plug we're going to
see it in a second and notify said
number four is notifies admin about the
status process by the scheduler so
notifications can be sent either by SMS
or by email so in order to manage the
remote host which is very important we
have to install something called Lydia's
remote plug-in executors right so this
remote plug-in we have to install on it
a remote box for example here if you
have a moat Linux or UNIX host with NRP
is installed as another package that we
install this monitoring host which is a
silver mega server actually runs a
module called chicken RP and this
chicken RP actually connects using is a
cell to this n RPC service which will
monitor where is information like
chickadees check load chickity-check FTP
I always check this tick load and all
they are plugins installed locally on
the local box and then here we have
installed a and our P plugin and then on
the remote box we have a chicken and RPE
plugin which actually connects the NRP
and then pulls the information about the
remote box and then shows it on the web
interface okay this is actually concept
or may be used to understanding that we
need to actually install and do some
hands-on right but these questions kind
of can give you some kind of an
understanding and if somebody asks you
about maybe us and easy I'm not worked
on the years probably the best thing is
you can just you know say that you know-
is service to be installed on a server
and with the right plugins that plugin
selection will be run and then give the
information about the CPU or a memory
and stuff and then can be displayed
online megastore and similarly to
one into the remote host you need to
install a plugin called make this remote
execution plug-in like that you can
actually know the status of the element
box right okay what does make yours
check for external commands right now-
check for external commands under the
following conditions
at a regular intervals specified by
command check interval options in a main
consideration fund so actually you can
set up at regular intervals command
check interval option and then consider
some kind of a for example 30 minutes or
40 minutes that actually then negligence
will check for external commands the
intervals and also immediately after
event handlers are executed so when
certain even to actually handlers are
executed you can set up sec check that
you know to run the external commands
and this is the condition to regularly
recycle the commands checks and it's
done to provide immediate action even if
the handle sub which commenced in values
or it will move back to the next
question what is the difference between
active and passive check in maegor's now
actually the major differences at few
checks are initiated by Negus while
passages are performed by some external
applications so you can probably have an
application that actually get order to
pull some information or do some tricks
through menus so you can actually
initiate you know actions or tricks by
third party applications or that's
called passive chicks and your neck use
can do the checks that's actually a
takes a passive checks are useful for
monitoring services there are a
synchronous in nature which means it
cannot be monitored effectively by
polling their status on a regular
scheduled basis right so what happens is
that the negative you can specify an
interval in the negative server that it
can check the status of particular
service on a regular interval but what
if if your application doesn't depend
upon that regular interval but it just
needs whenever there is an integration
so in that case you need to use passive
checks and also if there also was a
located behind a firewall which means
your negatives will not work so in that
case you also have busy passes another
monitoring holds to kind of monitor the
do the passive checks right the main
feature
rejects our initiative managers at the
FT chick servants on a regularly
scheduled basis there are two important
questions like a few checks means
initiative many goals and then run on a
scheduled basis pastor checks mean
initiated by some other application in
the England of where you don't actually
relay on the scheduled information like
flood detection so what is actually
flapping now flapping means flapping
occurs when a server or a service or
remote whole state is changed very
frequently so it becomes ready because
being very frequently so you actually
confused what exactly research basically
it's becoming read one time it's
becoming Queen becoming red green so
that means it's actually very
inconsistent and how it does may use
legal negatives deals it's a slightly
different actually it shows the last 21
checks the results of the last 21 checks
in a is so with analyzing the history
checks of the results so it's basically
it restores the last 41 checks of the
host or the fairies the historical
infections and then the next appears it
uses that state a transition to
determine the percentage of change value
of the measure of the whole server which
means it checks it last 21 and checks
and then next checks it actually
compares the difference like the
percentage of the changes it's been
happening then it actually compares the
person to so if you see it host or
service is determined to have started
flapping
when its present fate change first
exceeds the high flapping trishul so
there's a theory that actually there was
a flapping happen so it stores the
flapping information so the current
state is actually extends exceeds the
clapping state then the services it
reminds to be and flapping if it is not
then it's not flapping so it's actually
the mechanism that actually you know
negatives users right and the next thing
is a host or a solicitor meant to have
stopped slightly when it's posted a
state goes below the flapping threshold
so there's a flapping to so they can
main fight the first e21 checks and then
it actually negatives will actually
compare with that value to determine
whether it is flapping or not flapping
right alright so before we go to the
next topic I'm going to take a few
questions here
which is better Negus or Splunk c- is
widely used and has a very you know why
a lot of support but Negus is a little
bit complicated to kind of install to
manage so people use also Splunk so I
have actually extend to use make use and
it's actually a little bit tricky and
you need quite a lot of expectation to
work in maegor's but frankly I think
it's a little bit easier than and
neglige alright so if you see the tools
like OpenStack users maegor's is a
default monitoring tool it's just very
powerful and it's there from the very
beginning that's where Negus is popular
nowadays what are the containers so here
we have come to the containers and
virtualization techniques so
virtualization pretty much everybody
knows so you have a big box like post
for example a blade machine with 20
processes or an ability hundred
processes and hundreds of jeebies you
can split that and you know box into
multiple virtual boxes so it should be a
project can be used independently of
each of these Virtual Box
so each what you also require some kind
of a little resources like it requires a
memory it requires a CPU requires a disk
space and etc so that we know about the
virtualization but what is
containerization all right what is
continuous that containers can stop a
kind of a runtime environment of an
application all right and all its
dependencies libraries binary
configuration files and everything
bundled into one package and contain
raising an application platform and its
dependencies remove the difference in
the knowledge distribution and drive
infrastructure that's the definition let
me explain this in order quickly now if
you for example wanted to run if you
have only one box and then you want to
run an application that actually runs on
open to so let's say you're using red
hard Linux and you have a host machine
but you want to run a small application
like httpd and I open the box in a
native way you have to use you have to
install you to create another separate
server call it would do and then run it
and that requires the resources memory
and then separate virtualization virtual
box but using containers containers are
lightweight applications that you know
or provides a runtime environment for
your hosts for example you can install a
container called we would do to run your
apache in your host
in itself so they are very lightweight
and they don't need separate virtual
boxes you can run it on your own box
right and all you need is a container
engine running on your host box the
container engine will actually make
should be installed on your host box and
that actually will on top of that you
can actually start multiple containers
and each container has its own runtime
and woman its own runtime variables its
own runtime a Linux kernel and so forth
so how this is possible it's possible
through something called the bootloader
now if you see the images of the
container they are pretty small like 10
MB or maybe maximum under MB but well as
you see a virtual box it's actually can
be up to 500 MB to several gigabytes
right so that's why containers are very
you know require has only essential
information to put that application and
provide separate runtime environment and
can be run on independently on the same
box or so for example you can run F on
binary on the same box and AB to binary
on the same box and F very simple binary
and libraries on the same mission
so actually used for microservice
purposes the next question is imagine a
scenario where large application is
broken into small composable pieces of
each of those pieces and their own set
up dependencies
let us call it dependence these pieces
as micro shows right so micro services
are actually you broke the application
into small small application which can
be run independently and which has its
own dependencies and so you're actually
breaking your large application to small
micro services and in order to run each
of these micro sources what will you use
use containers or virtual machines so
basically we use containers not what
your missions are the reason is because
if you use virtual machine each virtual
machine you actually have to create a
virtual machine for the micro service
you'd have to need several micro
generation which means you need a large
CPU and you know resource unit is
consumed sell lots of jeebies of memory
but if you use containers you don't need
to extend anything your physical
infrastructure can be as good as your
laptop where you can run contain
the EGR application right so each your
microchip is so that's actually the
advantage and lightweight doesn't use
too much CPU memory just runs only the
service if you install it what your bot
it runs so many cities but if you can
observe a container it only runs one
service and it makes right so let's see
a difference like right a docker file to
create image an image into MongoDB let's
observe this example one docker file is
actually storing all your information
about your container in a particular
file so when you actually start this
docker file and create a new content
with all the rules that you have defined
in this dock of I so actually what
you're doing is you're actually the
first thing always in a dock you file is
from Ubben from and then the image the
base we call it as a base image so the
base image can be 1 2 can be read hard
or can be a PLN X Sol Pine Linux or you
know it can be a Windows in average we
have Windows would be so they are very
lightweight small images showing as
something called either a docker hub
which is actually a public registry of
where or docker images are stored so
when you do from Ubuntu first this
actually pulls it will do small image
into your host machine and then it
actually wants various other commands
that you are actually defining so here
this example will install we're running
a container and that actually installs a
MongoDB image so let's see what it does
so first we are downloading or going to
image and then we're updating run
apt-get update we're upgrading to
maintainer is basically the name of the
person who's author of this image right
order of this container and then we're
running adam apt-get update so you're
upgrading your posit or e and then
you're actually doing run is basically a
command that we used to invoke any
commands like you know when they do run
and then specify something that will be
invoked on the image container machine
right so run apt key adb so this command
will remain actually installs a key apt
key into your repository so the next
thing is you're running echo and deb
httpd downloads in this you are
this tendon and then you're actually
piping it to one file called racial
switch to mobile develop so you're
typing this depth information into this
file so that's the main go that's
command the next thing is you are doing
also the run apt-get update which is
actually upgrading your repository and
then finally reinstall MongoDB called
apt-get install - why MongoDB 10gen and
then you're creating your a MK DL and
then you're exposing a port numbers so
this is important because if you don't
expose a code then your host machine
radio to install the container will not
recognize this up to the port right so
for example your MongoDB on the
container runs with port number two
seven zero one seven and what that port
number has to be exposed to the host
machine so that host machine can
recognize the port right and then you're
actually running with CMD with - - port
two seven zero one seven and then
finally you're actually running an entry
point entry point is basically the
process that actually run so us are
being MongoDB movie is the process that
you're running so if you run this
particular docker file and that actually
creates an image right so once the
container is created if you log into the
container using Exe C and you go and run
for the processes you will see only one
process called use or being smaller
babies nothing else so which means it's
a lightweight right so that's actually
about the docker images now the next
question is what is my example explain
how broker is used for SPLC
over this is important question so how
you can use a docker right so let's say
you have an application you're running
and that actually runs an HTTP D httpd
you know service and then you have some
contents for that httpd like in a web
application and let's say you want to
use docker is your application what
would you do so you have a code and you
have to find the code your copy DT or
local desktop or you actually showed it
in an git repository and then in order
to test this or closing whether it works
or not
you can actually use the dollar ization
mechanism so you rise a docker file and
the docker files will run you know from
- you say what we do and then you
install run the commands like you know
if they get updated
we install hd-dvd mm you run a copy
command that actually copies the your
code from your pitch Padre to the
container and then run your HTTP
application so that's a simple circular
edge we have a docker file that is again
in a git repository and then you
actually have a doctor file now you have
a code and then you can actually
integrate that with the Jenkins
so the Jenkins actually once the bill is
done it actually runs the docker file
that creates a container and that
containment can be tested at night it
can be at any testing container that can
be tested you can write and test
selenium tests to kind of catch that
it's working fine or not and it can only
exactly same thing to kind of for this
to shame docker file you can use with
same your code to spin up staging and
production and moments so exact same
thing would actually will be open so for
example you have a host machine like
production post and you wanted a new
container so simply run the new docker
file and that actually spins up a new
docker container so that it is it's
actually used for continuous integration
right so that's about you know as we've
seen how doko provides consistency
computing environment through SDLC so we
have actually seen I've already
explained a little bit about it so let's
say you have a project code and then
that actually has a docker file and okra
file actually has a docker image and
then the docker container and the docker
image actually pulled from a docker hub
for example from able to actually pull
the image from the dock container right
and then run spins of a docker container
and if you run this code docker file you
can actually start a server right in a
staging same thing actually can be
started on the production server so it's
exactly the same type of source that
you're taking to build a container so
see it should also as you think and so
the consistency should be authors right
the man the next questions are letting
this loss it's about what is docker
compose all right so actually one
container can have a multiple you can
actually you can use the docker compose
file to kind of deploy several
containers right now one single dollar
for example what we have seen in just an
example before a docker file is about
one container but how about you want to
do
multiple containers and then we use the
darker compulsion or darker compose use
YAML yet another markup language where
you can actually define multiple you
know docker files like the copies of the
Tokra files whatever you I mentioned the
doctor file
similar thing you can like you can have
a few lines of code for to start your
web application container and then to
Postgres database container and then
British cache and containers so these
three containers can be together locked
up in a one dollar compost file and then
you run docker compose that actually
spins up three different containers with
one single command so that's actually
the is we can run these three containers
with a single command using docker
compose right so you need to install
docker compose for that come into the
box so before I can actually continue I
just want to take a look at the example
so suppose is a question says suppose if
I need a lamp stack on my notes so I can
use tools chef puppet and to do that so
the question is my understanding is you
want to start a lamp stack on your node
and then what would you use a chair for
top it reason actually use any of these
to start lamp stack so what you need to
do is four lamps and they made Linux
which obviously is your application and
for example Apache or take on Ken
Jennings and then MySQL and then PHP you
on the install is the institution write
a for example if you're using czev you
can write a you know cookbook to define
to install package like dependent
packages in a one single cookbook and
then run the cookbook again pepper club
no and leather actually installs the
lamp stack that's actually good example
okay the question is but at the same
time I can write a docker file to upload
it on the docker hub so the teams can
pull the imagine build the containers
that's right so in both cases I can
easily deploy lamps like yes you can so
what the docker file as we can see it's
like lightweight you can have a single
container image or all your lamp stack
together right using docker you can
create your own docker image right that
has a lamps tank in it and there are
actually examples in the docker hub
right or that's actually lightweight
right now not every application can work
on a lightweight it requires probably
you probably have a dedicated server
called for Apache a dedicated server for
MySQL
a dedicated server for your PHP learning
so in that case and they are available
already you're not changing the source
you're not you know poisoning everything
it's collision gallery and there are
physical boxes like the VirtualBox in
that case you use puppet or chip to
manage these dependencies and the
installations right so that's the
difference when I use docker why I need
tools like a potential actually if you
use a docker in this instance well there
is less you don't need to do much with
Chetan puppet but Jeff and puppet
actually it can be used to kind of for
provisioning all together a brand-new so
so basically if you're running a docker
image you don't need actually a check
for puppet for that one but in order to
run the docker image you are probably
running on a host machine and that host
machine should have all the
installations to be done it should have
a docker engine running it should have a
ridiculous like you know public it is
running because you are probably running
docker file that actually copying stuff
from your get image you know so for that
purpose use chef and puppet so check and
pop it or any other and configuration
management tool to the other with docker
actually gives us the best result right
because we are not just talking about
running a small container on a box or
not an entire enterprise wide how you do
it so chef at puppet has its own purpose
docker has its own purpose you combine
them together why to kind of make it as
more enterprise wide you don't print the
practices so that okay the next thing is
before I end up this question I just
wanted to show you what summary of the
sessions we have actually seen and the
generate DevOps questions and then we've
seen the source code management using it
and then we are also seeing the
continuous integration best practices
and also the you know using a little bit
about Jenkins and we have seen the
configuration management pull push and
pull mechanisms and difference between
radius configuration management tools
like suffered ansible and chef
continuous monitoring we've actually
seen
what is NRP and how this negatives work
will seem containerization an example of
docker file and then docker compose the
difference between the upper compose and
docker file is it's basically you know a
docker file you actually run one
container you can combine multiple
containers into one single docker
compose and run it using docker compose
so the next question is is DevOps
introduced in order to facilitate micro
service architecture yes it is it's not
actually just introduced to facilitate
micro-service architecture it's actually
introduced to see when when they're
Webster's introduced it was introduced
when these popular concepts about you
know configuration management and
infrastructure has code has started
right micro-services is like modern
architecture and the thought debauch you
don't have you cannot have micro service
architecture that's for sure but
introduction of DevOps is not just for
Microsoft future but also for normalize
that you like all the service-oriented
architectures that we already have with
many organizations so whether you use
micro services or not DevOps is still a
requirement for agility and for the
quality of your releases right and for
micro services it's like a must and
mandatory one all right so you guys have
any other questions if you have any
questions feel free to pause if you have
any feedback that you wanted to give it
to us you know I will spend a few more
minutes to answer I know I wanted all
the questions you know while running
these maybe not but if you still do have
any questions you know I will give you
two more minutes you can post them then
I'll try to answer them so I assume that
there are no questions from people so
