we be covering the concept called random
forests on solving random forests is one
of the known major ensembl ink methods
in the field of machine learning well
the word forest itself defines the fact
that it's combination of trees and
random will come later on so basically
is a combination of multiple trees there
are grown together two to every doubt
effect of of the the cons of a decision
tree now first of all let's think about
a decision tree what happens in the
decision tree one of the major problems
with decision tree is the opening
because of being overly reliant on the
training data however that required that
can be taken care of by certain pruning
methods they are still not sufficient so
in 2000 in 1981 professor Bremen he come
they came up with a concept called
random forests which got you know quite
popular by 2 0 0 1 and and this idea was
to grow thousands of trees at the same
time and loser in sampling let see how
we you are it so he'll run water and so
on so many techniques introduction to
writer for this understanding random
forest algorithm and hands-on so in on
so many techniques we treat multiple
plate tests for the same problem and
make predictions by aggregating the
predictions which means to better
predictions so let's say you were at
first the orange one is is one is you
know is modeling red sample one in black
one is modeling with sample two and on
something is the average now every diff
you look at is doing a much better job
of actually signaling orange and the
black see that okay
so run random forest is an ensemble
decision trees weight training their
acid is a recursively partition into
different decision trees based on the
idea of a parameter now what happens
what is meant by what is meant by total
number of by recursive partition so
basically you have a data set in you
have a data set in your training data
what you do is you basically do a
bootstrap sampling of the data so that
means you take a data click record and
put it in your sample and you put it
back you take a record again and you put
it back and you repeat this process for
exactly third number of times
exactly exactly equal to the total
number of your of your trained data set
so for example if you've got 100 e cards
in your training as Lynn said you will
take hundred samples as for
bootstrapping I'm sorry there are some
firecrackers nearby of a house so you
might just hear a sound
so in boosting that the funniest thing
is ready for is the funniest thing is
that this bootstrapping is going to
allow only 2/3 of the unit-sample it
assets that means your sample data sets
would be 2/3 in terms of the uniqueness
in your origin interceptor so that's one
sample and you grow thousands of fries
using those samples so that's the that's
the basic way in which your data is
partitioned sorry understanding random
forests so there's a there's this this
is you not really you know you're not
very decisive not watching movie next
edge until tomorrow
so either you are a wise friend or you
can ask group effects so if you ask gulp
of friends obviously then you'll get a
much better understanding otherwise a
particular person can tell you something
which is very specific to his or her
likings right so asking group of friends
and everything out definitely plays a
much better
right okay so so I'm listening random
forest it's nothing but growing trees in
parallel and then everything out the
effect of each tree that's it then
that's on hang on hang on
we mean of course lucid in programming
but let's finish the presentation first
so the random ferns advantage it is it
has a robust against overfitting why
well because it's everything out the
effect it's everything out the the total
effect of random forest above a decision
tree I'm sorry so basically it can be
used for both relation as well as for
classification it gives better results
with the increasing number of examples
well of course in a kit can because your
mood subsample also grow it can be use
for clustering start staying friends as
well as features like sugar yes it has a
because of a image it can do some third
feature selections ensemble method so
let me let me write down something like
so in this what you see here is features
elation right so pit selection relevant
random for this creates a tree let's say
it's creating one tree okay like this so
at each node basically it is supposed to
have a sample of variables only okay
so what
sample of variables no instead of using
all the possible variables
it only takes a sample of subset of them
and days of the concept for Gini index
for generation it is it is the sum of
squared or RSS as we called and for the
classic exposure cos Gini mix okay so
Gini index basically is with nothing but
genus is with nothing but basically it
is looking at each variable and seeing
its importance and how is a variable
name important or not well it sees how
much has the Gini index decreased by
using the particular variable so if the
drop in the Gini index is more with
respect to a with respect to a
particular split that particular
variable is gets the higher chances in
me becoming the root node so I each node
as in the split it takes a subset of the
variables and it applies that to that
note using our origin index so basically
your random forest is is sampling of
data sampling of what is later as well
as sampling of features so it works with
data
features at the same time in terms of
sampling so once it so why it is
creating a tree it is looking at a
specific sample of the data using
bootstrapping and looking at very subset
of that total number of variables using
using this sampling for features now the
good thing is the good thing is other
advantages for example if there is a
particular particularly no buddy
variable rather which is very high
indicator when is far greater so it is
likely that it be noting the sample of
that predictor columns then it is likely
that that it that node which is or the
variable which is a very strong crater
will become the root dollar in most
cases hence all the trees that we grow
would be correlated and that is where
random phonics plays a very handy role
it only looks at those algorithms or
knows I'm sorry those columns which are
in which are in the sample for the
particular splitter what if questions
over
Oh Alice's okay so Alice's is your
residual sum of squares okay so for
regression the cost function is the
irises laser senses and for
classification it is always the Gini
index which is summation P into 1 minus
P P is the proportion P is a proportion
of one class in a particular region okay
so that's how that's how we use our
essence and and and reading licks for
our particular problems with listening
the model tend to be
and they're slow to train this is fine
it's randomized randomization parameter
needs means we set as well number of
nodes i'm of randomization of instance
variables which is fine we'll do that of
course you can learn all of that and we
can batch in Adyar a couple it assigns
Li and the one who is the instructor for
that course would be not for this one
but most of course I'm the instructor
the total online live classes are 30
hours okay so basically this part of the
course which would make you involved in
some case studies on each of these new
items and I'm gonna take the same key
study in this session right now any
questions so far before you move on
hands up okay so we will start the
session now so the first is library
random forest so we're doing this in R
so the first is library random forest
this command basically will this command
basically will connect we just cleared
out so random forest library in R is
given by random n capital F will all
Susan every call character does that
allows have sentence also you want to
define they prop the problem you want to
solve this for Aras Harrison's and
Edgar's innocent data what it does is
basically the famous Fisher's
is gonna set it basically has three
three whatever at all species of
which are measured using very simple and
quick a length so presence right - then
what you see is there are 150 is can
simple dot length sepal don't wait till
dot M and put on width are the four
variables which are used for defying the
specie of the crowd
it is either setosa by secular or
virginica okay so we're going to use
this genocide to plate whether this can
be used for some random that can be used
for printing the specie of the on the
flower so the first command is create
data partition so what it does is
basically divides the data into 70 plus
6.7 means 70 percent and this creates a
training index I in TRAI
trail so this but your command helps to
create a cleanliness it then training is
in trail which is nothing but using
training using training we could train
this entry index we could create a trend
you decide using iris in plain and cover
okay now now this entrain basically oh
this question okay so
and this training asset would be used to
train on the net I'm testing will see
the actual out actually combine actual
and the predator values so if I click on
Andrew training I have three to six
doors before trading and one for dancing
I think this is not correct
so I'm these three years it's now if I
do a no training
it will be you are in fire for training
and forty my boot testing so basically
your iris is a data frame with four
variables one is first for our numbers
and fourth of the species which is
predicted column okay so I run RF random
forest species data training equal n 3
equal to 1000 M 2 equal to 4 and trees
the number of trees I want to grow and
I'm try is cause to four means number of
variables I want to be concerned at each
split okay
so table so this would create a phone
this would clear the object of random
forest RF okay maybe trying to predict
species which is the fourth column using
all the columns using God little equals
with training number of tree that I want
to do is for a number of animals and he
won't be using each pair is for if I
know what table would have predict
testing in this so it seems it has
splitted everything correctly except
over Jenica which has mean which is
which it has printed thirty-ninth
currently but twice
it has called it was a clear ok so if I
plot RF
the RF would say the testing error is 2
by 45 okay which is point zero 4 okay
and if I now with this I come to
classification so what I've done is
classification in under forest okay but
if I can do the regression in random I
think I just missed one thing let me
just put summary other maybe just RF so
it says it's a random
negation number of teens thousand eight
pairs for outer bag estimate for erudite
outer bag I'm taking ritalin so there is
there is this is point zero eight five
errors in the for the for the floor one
class and point zero one four for one
class okay this is the outer bag
estimates okay so that brings me to hook
to the end of end of classification in
random forests in in regression I'm
going to use it instead called Boston
the Boston it is it is nothing but if I
do a quick Boston then basically I have
to calculate the average or the median
value of a household from a house based
on certain parameters let's see what
those parameters are the crime per
capita crime rate in the town proportion
of land all over for launch
prevention of non-lethal business in
this charge will flow cross it or not
that was oxide concentrations having
amount of rome's
and bla bla bla bla black number of
black ratio the proportion of black I'm
sorry low estate of this population and
Midd meaning value of the owner occupied
home so I need to find the value of M ad
be Rihanna do the same thing connected
Dingaan a sec now dimension of training
is 5614 dimension testing is 10:14 and
dimension machines five minutes six and
forty eight seed one two three why do we
do seed can do seed in order to avoid
any I'm gonna three random generation so
we have if we are using algorithms like
which make use of random numbers it is
important that you put seed otherwise
every time you run it can decrease
certain other numbers so now what I've
done is I am I'm running
and I think for all the variables from
one to from 3 to 14 in order to which
one is the best everything so I have put
in my equals 2k which it is put in a
loop for K in sequence 3 to 14 okay so
if i run this slot is running 15 run the
first one after the other
so minus ik take some time okay so let
me just change it three will be ten it's
still running
okay so they'll run successfully let let
let's plot the right so it clearly shows
that @m 3 equals to 9 it has got the
minimum in go and the minimum error on
the prediction so so basically you could
write my equal to 9 and run it again so
basically what we did was Madonna I want
we done it in a for loop to find which
is giving the best and then he got the
best one mentally so if I know up trot
predict this
I'll get my predictions recording in
this way okay and if I do a trot nm this
is me on see the red line is
should coincide with the zero line but
it still is doing a pretty decent job
so if I write a very important plot oops
sorry
so if I had very much variable
importance plot then it will show you
the top two variables with respect to
percentage increase in MSE so in in node
pretty does not really help so
impersonal increase in MSE is the
parameter on which we are going to
render the earthen okay
so this is how it gives me features
election how which one and moribund
pictures okay so if I find so this way
it gives the most important features in
the decreasing order
okay so so that's it in the handle so
now it's time for you to ask questions
I'll have I'll give you next five
minutes just to frame your questions now
so there's no question
fine then in case you coloring questions
you can certainly ask me I'll ping me
back and I'll be happy to take it
how could I get the dot awful
okay and you want the on smile okay so
like to put little Buddha on commands
here in the default in the chat window I
placed the content in the chat you can
have a look thanks for joining
I hope you got some understanding of
what random forest is I try to I try to
sense a absence on file trying to run it
against certain data sets and you will
you get better sending off what rather
forest is okay so then bye for now I
hope there are no more questions
and I kept for even 20 mins especially
for the questions okay violent
