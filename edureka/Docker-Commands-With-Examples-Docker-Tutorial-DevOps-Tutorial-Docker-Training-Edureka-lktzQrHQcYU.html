welcome back to a tariqas youtube
channel my name is Vardhan and today
we'll discuss the most commonly used
docker commands and how they work so the
commands that you see on your screen
here they are the ones which are most
commonly used so if you are a divorce
engineer or if you're just someone
that's working on docker then you might
have already used these commands or you
might use them in the near future some
of those commands are darker version
docker help a couple docker run docker
build docker login docker push docker PS
your PS stands for docker processes and
this command is used to see what are the
active containers currency and then we
have docker images then you have dr.
stop taco kill there is docker RM which
has caused a stands for dr. remove
docker RMI which stands for remove
images we have docker x'q and this is
used to access the bash of any active
container and then we have two awkward
commits we have docker import docker
export the upper container docker
compose dr. Swann and docker service so
these are the 20-plus docker commands
which are most commonly used now without
wasting much time let me get started and
discuss each of these commands dhaka
version this command is used to find out
what is the version of your docker
engine okay so remember there will be
two flags that we come in before writing
version and then we have another command
which is docker again two flags and then
help now this is basically used to list
down all the possible commands that you
can use with docker
so here docker will be a parent command
and whatever child commands there are
possible here as permutation
combinations those would be lessened out
now let me quickly open my terminal and
execute these two commands for you do
remember that I will be using my Linux
virtual machine okay and and this next
virtual machine of mine is an Ubuntu
machine and it's hosted on my wii and
black i said so and this is gonna open
my terminal over here and the first
command that we were supposed to execute
is darker version right so as you can
see the version of my dock origin is
17.0 5 ok so that's how this command
works now the next amount that we were
supposed to execute is docker help
that of course would also come with two
hyphens and like I told you there are
radius commands that you haven't talked
up like dr. a touch darker build proper
comment dr. CP docker create darker
diff so all of these are the other child
commands that can be used with docker
okay as a primary command so I hope that
was clear and at any point of time if
you people have any doubt with respect
to usage of any command in docker then
you can just use the help
write and help will basically tell you
the different commands are there along
with a description so it also explain
what each and every command does now
let's say you have docker a build then
you can see the explanation that it says
build an image from a docker file right
so that's a good enough explanation if I
was a guy that's working on docker then
I would know which option to use right
similarly for everything
so for docker RL it says remove one or
more containers and then for docker for
docker stock it says start one or more
stop containers and many more so
whenever in your free time you can use
the docker health command and see what
are the different commands possible
along with their explanation okay so I
am going to clear the screen and go back
to my PPD and check what are the next
set of commands that I can execute and
remember these are all still basic
docker comas okay so the next command is
docker pull now the docker pull command
is used to pull any image from the
docker hub okay and then we have docker
images command which of course lists
down all the images in your local
repository now in the previous command
we do a docket pool right so for the
first time you will not have any image
in your local repository you will have
to pull it from your docker hub and when
you pull it from your docker hub it gets
stored in your local repository and once
it is there in your local repository you
can run the docker image this command
and then check all the different images
so all the images would be listed down
okay so that's about these two commands
and then we have boqueron command now
the docker run command is basically used
to execute that image and I'm pretty
sure you are aware that whatever you
download from the docker hub are images
right and
you want a running instance or if you
want it to be active then you have to
run it because what you will have to
deal with
they are containers right I'll to get
containers running then you have to
basically run those images that's the
same thing that we are doing here the
commander's docker run along with the
image name so supposing I am pulling at
Kubuntu image from docker so I will be
using this command docker pull Ubud -
okay and if I want to execute this image
and get a running container out of it
then I would have to basically go here
and run the command docker run along
with that particular image named docker
run Ubuntu okay guys so I think you have
a decent understanding of these three
commands now let me again go back to my
terminal and execute these two commands
will show you how they work so I'm back
my terminal here okay so here let me
write down the command docker pull
Ubuntu now by running this command I am
pulling the latest Ubuntu image from my
docker hub okay so when you hit Enter
in spite of the fact that I do not
specify any tag over here as late as
it's pulling the latest image that is
available on the docker hub okay
so let the process happen guys give it a
minute
perfect so now you can see the status
here right it says it has downloaded on
newer image for Ubuntu that is with the
tag and latest now if I want to check if
this image is actually been pulled then
I can run the command docker images now
let me run that command by fostering the
screen and then actually running the
command docker images when you hit enter
like I said you have the entire list of
images available in your repository over
here the entire list is down over here
correct so you have custom image you
have version LS / custom image right so
this is another image which I created if
you want to check if your image is
latest then you look at Kubuntu your
right so this has a tag as latest and
this was an image which was created ten
days ago in my local repository and it
is about 112 MB okay this is the one
which we downloaded recently and it has
the latest tag so this is how you check
the different images that you have in
your local repository guys okay so I'm
going to clear the screen and now it's
all about executing a docker image so
for sample purpose I can even run any
kind of an image and get a container
right so before I execute an Ubuntu
image let me execute a simple hello
world continue so for that I'm gonna say
docker run hello world now remember when
we say docker run HelloWorld you might
ask me a question that is HelloWorld
already present in my local repository
well the answer is it's actually already
present so I have an image of hello
world in my local repository but even if
I do not have the hello world image in
my local repository this command will
run because when you do a docker run
command this would first of all look for
this particular image in your local
repository if the image is not present
then it will go to the docker hub and
look for an image with this particular
name and it will pull that image with
the latest tag okay so run does two
things it pulls and it executes okay so
let me hit enter and there you go it
says hello from docker right so this is
the hello world container for docker
now the reason I did not execute the
Ubuntu images because I want to make
a few modifications to that image but if
you want to make a few modifications to
that image then you have a different set
of commands which are involved so let me
go through those commands and then get
back to what I was supposed to do
that was about docker run and then we
have something called as doc up build
okay and this docker build command is
used to build a custom image of yours
supposing you have a Logan to image okay
but you do not want it exactly as it is
and you want to make a few adjustments
to that so another example for that
would be the node image right in my
previous sessions I've had sessions on
docker swarm I had a session on docker
compose and many more right so over
there what happens is I'm using an
odious image as my base image and then
I'm building my entire application on
that so what you have your risk you have
a base load image okay and on that note
image you build your entire application
be it an angular application or be it a
mean stack application and the command
that you use to build the entire
application is the dock of build command
and as you can see this is the syntax we
have to say dock a build with the flag -
tea and the tea flag what it does is it
basically tells you that you can give
your name with a tag for your image
which are building because this image is
going to be your image right your custom
Lee building this image so when you
custom build this image you can give it
your own name and that's what this is
and followed by that with a space I've
specified a dot here now the dot
specifies that the talk of file which is
needed to build this docker image is
present in the current directory where
this command is being executed now had I
specified the entire path of my daugher
file then I didn't I wouldn't be
specifying the dot over here right but
in that case if I'm specifying the
entire path then that means that my
daugher file is present in some other
location not necessarily in the same
location where the command is being
executed okay I hope that was little
clearer you people so now if you're also
not clear let me give you a
demonstration and then you will be able
to understand this in a better fashion
ok so let me open my terminal again and
currently we are in the slash home slash
iterator directory now for the demo
purpose I had created a new docker file
let me first open and show you that
docker file ok and that docker file is
present in the Downloads demo folder of
mine if I do an LS there is a dot the
file perfect so let me say cat docker
file in fact let me open this in G edit
so sudo G edit docker file yes now the
docker file is the most important file
if you want to build your own custom
images because whatever you want for the
application to run those dependencies
are specified in this file you have to
save which is the base image that you
have to first of all download from the
docker hub and use that as a basis for
your application and then you have to
say the other commands that you want to
run now in this demo of mine I am simply
downloading and open - image from the
docker hub and I'm just echoing this
sentence hi this is version from a
breakup so it's a very simple process
right I am pulling one I'm going to
image and I'm doing an echo on that
particular image so you can just save
this closes docker file and then execute
this particular docker file okay and
since I am in this folder I can use the
dot to specify that the daka file is
present in this directory now let me
first hear that screen and then run that
command again so the command is docker
till - T let's give the name of the
image as my custom Ubuntu image custom
Ubuntu well that's good enough right and
then I'm gonna say it dot because the
docker file to build this my custom open
- image is present in the same path ok
so it says my custom open-toe should be
in lower case ok no problem so let me
just check my docker file once ok now
the reason I got this is because my
image name cannot be in caps so what I'm
gonna do is let me read on the command
with a different name possibly in small
letters ok my castle we're going to
okay perfect the command got executed so
if you can see here it says selling the
built contacts to the dr. demon and
since ads specified only two steps in my
docker file those two steps are being
executed here
step one is it's pulling the open -
image from the docker hub and since I
it's already there in my local
repository it's using whatever is there
okay and step two is running the echo
statement hi this is warden from Edo
rekha right this was the second step and
the same echo command has been executed
over here hi this is warden from Edo
Rika correct perfect so I hope you guys
got a good understanding of this
particular command because this is the
most important command if you want to
make it as a divorce engineer or a
person that's regularly working on
docker because all of the images that
you will be working on in your office or
in your workspace you will have to be
working on custom images for your
application so remember the how this
command is used and how the applications
are built so let me just clear the
screen and go back to my slides and see
what is the next command in source rust
okay so the next command is the docker
container command and this docker
container command is basically used to
manage your containers now let's say you
have n number of containers and because
so many containers are active at the
same time your system may be lagging
right there's a performance issue so at
that time you might want to close or n
certain containers right kill their
process so at that point of time you can
use the container command and kill the
container straight away so it's just one
of the different options that we have so
there are a number of other commands
which can be used with the docker
container as the parent command and I
would request you to look up the set of
commands on docker docks okay
but for now let me just go back to my
terminal and execute one of these
commands and show you how they work so
let me go back to my terminal here and
here I'm gonna run that command docker
container and let me run docker
containers logs okay but
so here let me run the command docker
container logs to basically find out the
different logs that are associated with
my container okay
now the thing is in arguments I have to
specify the container name or the
container ID and since I don't know it
right now let me first find out what is
my container ID okay so I'm gonna do a
dock of PS command to list down the
different containers okay there are no
active containers so I'm gonna do a - a
flag so these two commands I will
explain in detail at a later point of
time guys okay but anyways getting back
to our problem here you can see that the
hello world container word is secure it
right so I wanna copy the container ID
here and now I'm gonna find out what are
the logs of this docker container logs
and then I'm gonna paste the container
ID this way whatever laws were generated
for this container those would be
displayed perfect worked as with the
container executed again so the same
thing can be done for any of the other
containers okay if I do a docker PS - a
and C there are so many other containers
which are there right in my system I can
copy the container ID of any of these
and I can execute the same thing again
and again docker container logs right
and then I can paste this so this time
the logs of this particular container
which is nine one six and this entire ID
this logs have come out and like I said
with docker container you have various
other options correct you have options
like dr container kill you have docker
container remove and all those things so
I can use a docker container remove and
hit enter and basically when I do that
this particular container is off so if
you remember this ECC right this
container is the HelloWorld container
and when I said RM this container is
removed so if I go back and do docker PS
- name then the first entry for the
hello world container would not be
present and yes as you can see it's not
present right the hello world container
is not present here now that's what I'm
going to show you so I've go through in
my screen and now let me get back to my
slides so I basically executed the
docker container logs command
the docker container RM command so you
have various other options like I said
you have the container kill which can be
used if you want to kill any one
particular container okay you can use
the docker container run command to
start any container which has been
temporarily stopped or which is inactive
okay and if you want to again start the
container found something that has been
stopped you can use the dropper
container start command and these are
just a few of the commands and the
entire list of docker container commands
can be found in Dhaka docks okay so I
would request you to go to docker Docs
and then see the entire list of commands
if you want to learn more about this
command in the meanwhile let me go to
the next slide and continue with our
session the next command that we're
going to talk about is the docker login
command okay and as simple as it sounds
this is used to login to your docker hub
account can any of you guess why we
would need to login well it's for the
simple reason that you might want to
push any of your image that you have
created locally right so when you are
working with a team who are all using
docker then you can just pull the docker
image or create and your dock remains
from scratch at your end and build a
container and if you want to share that
container with other people in your team
then you can upload it to docker hub
right so how do you upload it to docker
hub so if you want to upload it you
don't have any other work around so you
do it through the ER terminal and to do
it through the terminal you have to
first do a docket login once you've
logged in using your docker container
credentials then you can simply start
pushing your docker image to the docker
hub okay so that's why this command is
really important so let me go to my
terminal and show you this command the
commander's dock and login when I hit
enter it says login with your daughter
Arya to push all the images from docker
hub if you don't have a doctor ID
it says head over to this website so
this is where you can create a new
docker ID okay and the username it says
in brackets it says vertol NS that's my
username because I'm already logged in
so I'm just going to hit enter without
entering the username again and the
password I can enter is my password so
that of course and rubble and reveal to
your people but once you enter the
password and hit enter then it says
login succeeded right if your potentials
are a match then you are successfully
logged in and once you're logged in you
can start pushing your docker images
which you worked on locally to your
docker hub ok perfect right so let's
clear the screen and get back to our
slides now like I said the next command
is basically to push your docker image
to your daughter hub remember the
command should have your docker ID slash
the image name ok
my human to image this may be the name
of the image that you might have created
locally ok but if you would have push it
to the docker hub you have to tag it
with a name and that name should be your
daughter ID ok so let me get to the ER
terminal and show you how this command
works so let me first look for the image
that I want to upload to my docker hub
ok so all I had docker images the list
of all the images come out and if you
remember my customer bun 2 is the name
of the image which I created now let me
try pushing this image to the docker hub
ok so I'm gonna copy this and first
clearing the screen and here I need to
tag this image with my daughter riding
right because right now it has the name
my customer going to and I cannot upload
it to docker hub with this name now
since I have to tag it with my name
there's a command called docker tag and
here you have to specify what is the
which image that you want to tag so the
images my castle Ubuntu and here let me
specify my docker ID slash the image
name so I'm gonna say
Vardhan LS okay no that's my daughter ID
and slash
my custom Ubuntu image right so this is
the name of my image I can even change
the name but I've just retained my
customer bill - as the name of Mohammed
so when I hit enter this image would be
getting uploaded to docker hub
and now this image has been renamed to
warden NS / my customer window we can
verify the same by running the command
docker images and as you can see here
there is there is one image with the
name my customer one two and then there
is another image with valdon + s / my
customer board - correct now this is
what I have to upload so now I can use
the dock at push command so I'm going to
say dr. push and then simply specify the
image that you want to push doc a push
button s slashed my customer burn - hit
enter and the image would be getting
uploaded to docker hub and once when you
do it from your end after this command
is executed successfully you can go to
your docker hub and check that your
image which you created locally has been
uploaded to the docker hub and it can be
shared and accessed by other people okay
okay perfect so this shows that my image
has been uploaded and let me just clear
the screen and get back my slides and
move forward and this command is
something that I already a kiss killed
it some time back where if you remember
I use the docker PS command to identify
which are the containers which are
currently active in my system right and
my daugher engine so that's what this
does PS basically stands for processes
and when you hit docker processes then
all the container processes which are
currently running in your dock region
would be listed however if you append
this command with a flag right then all
the containers which are inactive even
those containers would be listed down so
that is the difference between these two
commands to our PS and backup PS with a
flag a now let me go to my terminal and
show you that so dr. PS first okay and
right now there are no entries because
there are no containers which are
currently active but if you want to find
out all the containers irrespective of
whether they are active or whether they
are not active then it would list down
all the containers in my system right in
my host and that's what its gonna do doc
appears - it and as you can see there's
an entire list of docker containers over
here there's the custom image which I
created and then there are various other
mangez over here which I used to build a
container and I'll show you how they
work in my previous sessions so the
contact list angular and then there is a
demo app one these were images which are
used for my daugher swarm and from my
docker compose video is respectively so
if you want to go and see those videos
then the link will be there in the
description below guys and I would
request you to go through those images
to understand other darker concepts
better okay because dr. Campos and dr.
Swan they are the advanced concepts on
docker and that's a must know if you
want to make it as a docker professional
the link for those videos are in the
description below so let me just clear
the screen and get back to what I was
doing so the next command that we have
is the docker stop command now the
docker stop command is basically used to
shut down any container so if there is
any container in your dr. engine which
is running right in your host and if you
want to stop it then you can use this
command and do note that this command
would not be shut down right away it
might take a few seconds because it
would be gracefully shut down waiting
for the other dependencies to shut first
okay it's sort of force stop it's a very
gentle stop that's what this command is
but we have something called as a docker
kill command okay and what this dr. kill
command does is it ungracefully stops
your container as in if there is any
container that is actively running it
would straightaway kill it
in spite of it's something similar to
force kill right so that is the
difference between these two commands
docker stop and docker
kill kill would straightaway kill your
command now before I show us all of this
let me go forward and talk about a few
more commands there is something called
as a docker remove right
docker RM this one what it does is it it
removes a container at this point of
time you have to remember that if you
want to remove any container from your
host you have to first stop it and how
will you stop it by the two commands
that I explained in the previous two
slides you either for skillet or you
kill it gracefully using the docker stop
command or the docker kill command and
once you've used those two commands you
can remove them from your repository
okay and we have another command that is
the docket RM I okay so the docker atom
would remove containers but if you want
to remove images itself from your
repository then you can use the talker
RM
come on okay guys so these are the four
different commands that we have your
which is our regularly used now let me
open my terminal and show you how they
work so us let me do a docker PS and
since there are no containers which are
currently active what I'm going to do is
I'm going to start a service
okay I'm gonna containerize a particular
service and then I will show you how to
stop it or kill it or remove it okay
there is a one particular image demo app
one okay which I used to deliver my
previous session there was the docker
compost session right over there I used
that particular imager and I created an
angular application so I'm going to
first start that service and the command
for that is docker run - - RM I'm going
to say port number is 4 - w 0 colon 4 -
double 0 because it's an angular
application let's give it a name its - -
name right so let's give it a name my
angular application or let's give it a
name my demo application ok and demo app
1 is the name of that image so when you
hit enter first
the image would come up right the image
would be spun and the container would
come up let's just wait for the
container to become active so let me
first open a new tab of this terminal ok
and here let me run the command docker
PS and you can see that whew 42 seconds
ago this app was created right the demo
app 1 here it says the web pack is
compiled successfully so if I go to my
Firefox these servers would be active
the angular application would be active
ok but if I want to temporarily stop
this container or if I want to kill this
then I can use those commands docker
stop or I can use docker kill ok
so let's use those commands and see how
they work
I'm gonna say docker stop followed by
this container riding correct hit enter
so the docker servers are stopped now if
I do a docker PS command
this container would not be active okay
and over here also you can see that
which was temporarily compiled it has
ended right even the service is not
hosted there you go so that's how the
docker stop command works so let me go
to this come on and restart the same
service and over here this time instead
of using the docker stop command let me
say docker kill ok sorry I've just used
the same container ID right so I needed
one docker PS first ok and yeah now this
is the container ID which I have to kill
so I'm going to say docker kill pasting
this container ID and a tender and
that's container as also ended so even
the service has exited from here right
so that's how you kill a container
that's the difference between the stop
command and the kill command okay so I'm
gonna go back to your screen and after
these two commands there are two
commands like docker RM and docker are
am i right they are used to remove
continuous and images respectively so
let me go ahead and do that first let's
run the command docker RM ok
and now we have to specify which
container you want to kill or remove so
for that purpose let me first find out
which are the different docker
containers that are there in my system
so when I do a docker PS - name there
are a number of containers and from here
let me remove this test angular
container ok this is the name of the
image and this is the cutting or ID so
I'm gonna copy this container ID and go
back here let me clear it and here let
me run the docker RM with the container
writing and when this is returned it
means that my container has been deleted
successfully and the benefit with this
is I've freed up a little more space in
my host right in my dock origin now guys
are similarly we saw how to remove a
container ok now let me go here let me
know what docker images
so this is these are the list of for the
different images are out there in my
repository and if I want to remove any
of these images then I can do docker RMI
and what we have here is we have a Redis
image and we have an alpha and image
which I do not need so let me copy this
Redis image and remove this image from
my repository so the command is docket
RMI this type because remove image is
what it stands for and I can specify the
image name or I can even specify the
image ID so image name is good enough so
that's what's happening right
it says untagged and deleted perfect now
I can clear the screen and what I wanted
to show you I've showed you already now
if I run the docker images card again
then the Redis would not be visible here
so you can see alpha and but you can't
see you Redis correct so that's how it
works so let me go back to my slides and
go to the next command we spoke about
stop we spoke about kill we spoke about
docker RM and we also spoke about docker
or am I now the next command that is in
question is the docker exit command okay
and this command is used to access any
active container write any container
that is actively running if you want to
access the bash of that particular
container then you can use this exit
command okay and we use a I T flag over
here so you can either use - ID together
or you can use - I space - team now what
I does is it's basically it says access
your container in interactive mode so
that's the option this flag specifies
and that's why we're able to access the
container okay and you have to specify
which container you want to access
followed by the word bash so let me go
back to my terminal and show you how
that works
so over here let me clear the screen and
do a dock of PS and check which
containers are actively drawing none of
them are running right now so let me
start a container over here okay let me
do a docker in fact I can start one of
the containers I started sometime back
the demo app one right the one I spoke
about is the angular application let me
start this same container let's wait for
it to come up
perfect now it says a web pack compiled
successfully so now let me go to my
browser and hit localhost for to double
zero because my angular application is
at the one port number four to double
zero right so this is that angular
application which I was talking about so
if I go back to my terminal you can also
see that I have a specified photo double
zero as the port which is to be used to
access that application on my host and
this is the port number it's running on
internally in my container so I'm
mapping my currently in a port to my
host port and because of this I could
access that angular application on my
web browser now getting back to our
slides
we were supposed to use the docker x''k
command to access this container right
so right now I cannot access this
container over here so let me access
this container in a new terminal so this
is the new terminal and here if I do the
same dr. PS command the new container is
active so from here let me copy the
container ID and then run the command
docker x'q with the flag IT followed by
the container ID and then bash bingo so
right now I am inside this container so
all this time our this was the user
right Enrica at the way to boon to this
was my host machine and this is my
username right now I'm logged in as a
root user inside the container with the
hub having the ID this one because this
is what I specified over here so now we
are not in my local system we are inside
the container and what can we find
inside the container we would basically
find dependencies libraries and the
actual application code of this
particular angular application which is
hosted over here right which you can see
all the project codes would be present
inside this container correct so let's
verify if that is the case by checking
if we are actually there and by doing an
LS you can see all the different files
here we have a docker file which was
used to build this application and then
we have a package dot JSON file which is
the most important file to build any
Android application or any main such
application and then we have protractor
dot corner of dot J's which is used to
test any angular applications and then
we have so many others right we have an
SRC folder
you have an e 2e folder and then we have
no dress code module so this is where
all your project dependencies are stored
correct
so package notation specifies what are
the project dependencies that you want
and this is where it's all stored so
this is my angular application right so
if I go one directory back I am in this
SRC folder now okay let me do an LS I
have a pure let me go one path back
again and do an LS and you can see that
I have other folders like bin games
include Lib local has been shared and
SRC now all these are inside my
container I hope this was enough
evidence for you I hope it was so I'm
back here and yeah that's how you access
your container if you want to make
changes you can make changes you're okay
and since we are inside the container
let's just create a new file so let's
just say touch F one so the touch
command is used to create an empty file
right so now if I do cat F one of course
it is nothing but let me do a pseudo G
edit okay so I don't need to give a sudo
because I'm already logged in as root
user swamis gonna do G are at F one okay
so it's not letting me access this
command right okay guys anyways that's
how you access the container okay so let
me just clear the screen and if you want
to exit the container exit the bash then
you should use the command exit so when
you hit exit you are back as the Erica
user on your open to host system
interesting right so I'm gonna clear the
screen and go back my slides and check
what's next and then we have the docker
commit command and what this docker
commit command does is that it basically
creates a new image of an edited
container on the local repository in
simple words it creates a new image of
any container which you have edited
correct so let's execute this docker
commit command and see how that watch
let me go to my terminal here let's
first run the docker PS command
a check this is the container ID I
access my
docker container so I hope some scenes
would have been there so let's create a
new image of that particular docker
container okay
so I'm gonna say copy and run the
command docker commit and then
specify the container ID of your
container and followed by that you have
to specify the name of your new image so
I can say
Vardhan NS / my image right my angular
image so this would basically create an
image of this container which is running
and bingo perfect it's done so if I run
the command docker images then there
will be a new image with this name and
tag let's verify that by going to docker
images let's go up and as you can see
there is version anis slash my angular
image perfect this is what we wanted to
verify correct so let me clear the
screen and go back here and yes the pack
has compiled successfully this was the
message we bought earlier so anyways
let's all worry about that that's what a
docker command does so if I want to stop
this container service then from the new
terminal let me just kill that container
service correct so this is the ID copy
this and then I'm gonna say docker
container stop
and my container would have stopped so
here yes my service has stopped over
your bingo so I'm gonna tear the screen
and both the places okay now let me get
back to my slides so the next command
that we're going to talk about is the
docker export command correct so the
docker export command is basically used
to export any docker image in your
system into a tar file correct so this
tar file is going to be saved in your
local file system and it's not gonna be
inside docker anymore this is another
way of sharing your docker images right
so one way was by uploading it to docker
hub but in case you don't want to do
that you don't want to upload it to
talker hub because the image is very
heavy so that is this is an alternative
which is our use in the industry where
we do a docker export from one machine
and we save that image as a tar file and
this start file is imported inside the
destination system and over there it can
be accessed again and the container can
be run so let me show you an example of
that by first of all getting to it okay
so it says docker export right so this
is the syntax for that okay you say
docker export you use the output flag
with two hyphens you can specify the
name of the tar file that you want to
store it with and then you have to
specify your image name or where you are
okay so the amazing over here is my
container so you'll have to specify your
image name so let me go to my virtual
machine and what are the docker images
that I have available there is Bahrainis
slash my angular image there is my
customer bun too so what I'll do is let
me save this my custom Ubuntu image okay
this is my image and the image ID is
this right so I'm gonna copy this go
back to this terminal and what I'll do
here is I'll say docker export double -
which is the flag I'm gonna say output
flag is equal to I have to specify the
name of my tar file right so my docker
Todd file I can say I can say that my
daugher dart file and your after specify
the container and name so docker images
wouldn't do for that so I'm gonna do a
doc of PS
- a so I have a custom image here right
so let me save this particular image so
I'm gonna copy the content or ID copy
this and paste it over here which
indicates that I will create a tard fine
of this particular container and this
tar file would be same in this
repository itself in arica at the rate
I'm going to now since it's a heavy
container it's going to take a few
seconds and it's done and we can verify
that by doing an LS the name he gave us
mine darker tar file correct and then
you can see there's a my docket art file
which is basically a pgz file so if we
go back to your documents you can see
that there's a new tar file my daugher
tar file that was created and you can
verify the same my docket art file over
here this is the newly created tar file
so I can go back to my you're on a
larger screen screen okay perfect so
going back to my slides I've shown you
how the docker export command works and
what's the benefit now in the next slide
we have the docker import command now
the docker import command is basically
used to import any tar file if you have
any tar file which has been given to you
by your cell developer and if you want
to create a container of that one then
you have to import it right so how is
that possible so this is the syntax for
that the command is docker import and
then the complete path of that demo file
of that tar file ok so for this
particular purpose I have already
created one tar file because I wanted to
create one which can be imported very
soon so I created a tar file over here
demo tar so it is present inside my
downloads folder correct
so let me import that file so I'm gonna
say docker input and then I'm after
specify the complete path so it's slash
home slash a Drakkar /downloads slash
demo tar let's hit enter and this
particular image has been successfully
imported you can verify that by saying
the first few characters of the newly
created image okay so let's run the
command docker images over here
and you can see that just recently 23
seconds ago a new image was created
right with the same image re 2 3 EF and
it is the same image id over here right
it starts with the same sequence
characters and right now it has no name
so that is how you easily import docker
images ok we first export it and then
you can import it so let me just clear
the screens of both the tabs and now
getting back to my slides I'm down with
my docker import command and now comes
the advanced docker commands okay so
after you hard we saw the docker
commands which are very basic and you
know which can be executed easily but
here comes the challenging part docker
compose and docker swamp right these are
all advanced concepts in docker which
solves a lot of business problems and of
course the commands are also little
advanced in nature so first let's start
with docker compose you know there are
two variations to it and the two syntax
can be seen over here docker - compost
build and docker - compost up so these
are the two commands which work very
similar to docker build and docker run
right so docker build is basically used
to build a new image from a docker file
correct similarly a docker compose build
is used to build your docker compose by
using your dock and Yama file now your
file stands for yet another markup
language and now in the Yama file we can
specify which old containers we want to
be active okay and you have to specify
the path of the different docker files
which will be used to create those
containers or those services and that's
what docker compose does right it
creates multiple services and it's
basically used to manage all those
services and start them at one go so it
would use more than one docker file
probably if you go through mine your
previous video on docker compose have
explained it in detail over there I have
used three different docker files and
using those 3d aquifers I have created
three services right and the three
different services are the angular
service the Express and node service and
the MongoDB service the mamata v was
used as a database the Express and
was used as my back-end server and
angular was used for my front-end okay
now the link to this video is present in
the description below okay but let me
just quickly wrap this up by saying that
if you want to build that you use the
docker compose build and if you want to
start your docker compose and start the
container service then you can use the
docker compose up this is very similar
to the docker run command okay and
that's what your docket compose does
right it creates multiple docket
services and continue Rises each of them
and gets the different containers to
work together so perfect let me go back
to my terminal and let me do that for
you so docker PS there is nothing so
right now we are in the home slash
andraka folder correct so let me do LS
and there is a folder called means that
cap so I'm gonna CD into this particular
folder and here if I do an LS you can
see that there's a docker compose dot
Yaman file so let me do a G edit docker
compose dot yah will file so over here
you can see that I have specified the
commands to create three different
services one is the angular service
other is the Express service and finally
my database service okay I have
explained all these things in my
previous video I repeat the link for
that video would be in the description
below okay so let me quickly execute
this Yaman file okay so if I do a docker
compose build then this command would
look for this docker compose file inside
this directory okay and then it would
you know once this image is built I can
straightaway execute that command by
using the docker compose up okay so I'm
just gonna replace build with up this
way my docker compose would also be up
and running earlier I showed you an
annular application and this time is
going to be your entire bean sack
application which is what I involve for
everything mobo DB express angular and
no GS so my express is up and running
my angler is up and running my mom gonna
be is active on port number two seven
zero one seven
Express would be active on foot number
3000 and angular as usual would be
active on port number four to double
zero so let's verify the same by going
over here okay it also says the pac
compiled successfully so this time if i
refresh this there's a different
application that would come up correct
so this is my main stack application on
port number photo double zero is the
front end on port number 3000 this is my
server end which simply says fubar and
then on port number two seven zero sorry
zero one seven
there is my MongoDB right so these are
the three different services which are
active on my wheels port numbers so
going back to my terminal I can do a
docker PS to verify that there are three
different services of mine which are
running now if I want to stop each of
these services I can simply do a ctrl C
from here and hopefully it stops yes all
three sources have stopped let me
execute the same command and this time
yeah they're all gone right so the
docker PS command shows no containers
active bingo so I'm going to screen out
okay and go back to my slides and go to
the next come on and the next sort of
ODS come on that we have is the docker
swarm command docker compose I told you
was to basically have a multi container
application right and docker swamp is
however used to manage multiple docker
engines on various hosts right so
usually you might be aware that your
docker engine is hosted on one
particular host and you're executing
your doctor commands over there right
that's what we were doing all this time
even dr. Campos did that on the same
host three different services were
started but with docker swarm the
benefit is that we can start those
services in multiple machines so you
will have a master machine which is
nothing but the docker manager as
visible from here and then you will have
different slaves or the charcoal as
worker in docker terms so you have a
manager and workup and whatever service
you start at the manager will be
executed across all the machines which
are there in that docker swamp cluster
okay so it says right it creates a
network of docker agents or hosts to
execute the country
in parallel and the biggest benefit offs
for dr. swarm is scaling up and ensuring
high availability okay so some of the
commands which are associated with dr.
swarm are these if you want to first
false start off creating a docker swarm
then you use this command docker swarm
in it and you say advertise okay and
then you have 192 168 dot one dot 100
it's supposed to be two hyphens over
here okay yeah so this is how the syntax
is supposed to be docker swamp in it - -
advertise - add up and then you have to
specify the IP address of your manager
machine so if I start the swamp from
this particular force of mind then this
would assume the role of my manager okay
and in this syntax remember after
specify my own IP address so that the
other workers who will be joining my
network would subscribe to my IP address
over here so let's quickly go and
execute this first command and let me
show that to you okay so let me open up
the terminal and the command is docker
swamp init with SAS for initialize with
the flags advertise adder and then the
IP address su of the IP address of my
VMs 192.168.1.1 hundred okay so when I
hit enter see what happens
it says swarm is initialized and this is
the current mode this particular node is
now one manager okay and if you want
other machines to join this particular
manager as workers then they have to use
this token so we have to just copy this
go to the other machines and x-cubed
supposing this is another machine of
mine okay I'm giving you an example so
over here you would have to paste that
token okay so this is called the token
you just hit enter and then you will
join as a worker okay
so that's how the docker swarm command
works now I cannot go into too much
details with respect to how docker swamp
works okay because there again it will
take a lot of time and if you want to
actually learn docker swamp you can go
and watch the other video which I
delivered a couple of months back right
that video is called docker small for
high availability okay and that is a
detail the video and you will enjoy that
video because with that video I've shown
how docker swarm can be used and you
will see the power of docker in that
particular video so I would request you
to go there and the link for it is again
below in the description ok so I would
request you to go there if you want to
learn more about docker swamp but
getting back to our slides they have
other commands you're right so the
docker swarm join is what I already
explained to you so followed by this you
will have a token so if you give that
you can join a particular swamp cluster
as a worker ok so if you want to
regenerate that particular token which
is needed to join that particular
cluster then add the Manzo's end you can
execute this command docker swarm join
token so it would generate that open and
give it to you and so only if you want
to leave the docker swarm cluster then
you can execute this command docker
swamp leave ok so if you execute this
command straight away at the workers end
or the nodes then it would simply leave
ok but add the Manzo's end it would not
leave just like that
you'd have to append the flag force so
let me show you that let me just execute
the command docker swarm leave if it was
a worker it would leave right away but
since it's a manager like I said it says
use the force option so let's use that
ok
docker swarm leave with double flag
force and it says the node has left the
swamp perfect right so this is all about
docker swarm guys ok so let me go back
to my slides and covered the one last
command that is that for today and that
come out is the docker service command
so this command is used to control any
existing docker service beat any
container or we get a docker compose or
docker swamp or anything else right so
Tocker services are very underutilized
command I would say because if you want
to control
your different nodes when you are in a
docker swamp then you use the docker
service you use the docker service
command to list down the different nodes
that are there in your cluster you use
the docker service PS command
to find out what containers are being
executed in a particular node and then
if you want to scale the number of
containers supposing you have a cluster
of five machines and then you have five
containers running in each of those
machines if you want to scale those
containers to 25 that means you will be
executing five containers on each
machine right so for that you have to
use the command docker service scale if
you want to stop any container on any
particular node then you use the command
docker service stop and then if you want
to find out the different logs then you
use the command docker service logs
docker servers RM and so on right so the
docker service command is let me repeat
it's used in sync with your docker swamp
and docker compose primarily so that's
why these form the advanced docker
commands so let me go to my terminal and
quickly show you a glimpse of this so
its docker service if we do an LS you
will not have any options listed because
it says this is not a swamp manager
currently but if I start my docker swarm
and then if I run the same command
docker service LS then you can see that
the output is different right I have few
attributes your ID name mode which is
basically details about the different
worker nodes in my cluster but since no
worker has drawn my cluster - there are
no integer so that's how it is so let me
just end that so that is the docker
servers LS if you want to find out the
logs then you can do that - docker
service logs so if you use the docker
service log you have to specify which
service you want to check the logs off
and what is the task right so which
tasks and rich service so it's that
simple guys so that's how docker service
is used okay guys and again if you want
to stop any servers if you want to
remove any servers you can use these
commands doctor service stop or doctor
service remove and yeah that pretty much
brings an end to my session all right so
on that note let me conclude today's
session
