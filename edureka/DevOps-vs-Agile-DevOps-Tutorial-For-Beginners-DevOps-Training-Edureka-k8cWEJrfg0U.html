gonna deliver a short video on divorce
with his agile because this is a topic
which has been training for a long time
in the market and a lot of people still
have confusion over what is the
difference between the two and why it
DevOps is considered better than agile
okay so I don't want to waste any time
let me immediately get started as you
can see from my screen both our software
development methodologies agile came in
a couple of decades ago and DevOps is
very recent as recent as mid 2000s now
primarily what is the similarity between
the two the similarity between the two
is they both believe in fast software
development okay and even that
principles are based on how fast the
software can be developed without
causing harm to anyone
neither the operations nor the customers
okay but however the difference between
the two lies in what happens after
development so there is software
development there is software testing
there is software deployment right after
these three stages there's a small
difference agile actually ends right
there what you see here in the form of
operations is non-existent okay that's
not believed in agile that is not their
focus at all
however with DevOps there is operations
which is continuously happening and when
I say operations it's basically
monitoring so whatever application or
software is being developed that gets
continuously operated on to make sure
that the software is always up and
running there is no downtime there is no
problem with anything so that the
customers don't get back with any errors
or any problems right so that is a
difference so with agile the software is
actually tested before it's deployed to
customers or clients
however after it's deployed it is not
monitored on ok a track of how the
software is performing is not kept with
DevOps that is the difference there are
a lot of tools in place to achieve that
very same there are a lot of automation
which is in place and this makes life
easier DevOps believes in the fact that
one single person should have
responsibility for everything the
development operations and the entire
lifecycle ok with agile that's not the
same as
you have people will be developing
there'll be people will be testing it
and there will be people who will be
operating it so there's a wide
difference in job roles okay with DevOps
you have the ops engineers who are
primarily responsible for doing
everything so it's more from merging
between the two job roles alright so
that is the difference between them on a
higher level so let me go into more
details of what difference between the
two is starting from the first point
with agile you get the feedback from the
customer ok whatever software is
deployed you do not operate on it
anymore you do not monitor it so the
feedback comes from the customer however
with DevOps the feedback is from self
even if you deploy to production even if
the customers and clients start using it
their inputs are just one half of it the
remaining half you have automation in
place you have knobs to this place which
will let you know when something is
immediately wrong ok
and then agile also believes in having
smaller release cycles compared to SDLC
so that is one advantage with our oil
but DevOps does it better in spite of
having smaller release cycles DevOps
also believes in immediate feedback ok
and agile
primary focus is only on speed but
DevOps believes in both speed and
automation of work so that the overall
workload reduces you can conclude this
by saying that agile is not the best
solution for business however DevOps is
the best for business at least in
today's world because with DevOps there
is a lot of cost-cutting you have a lot
of tools in place open-source tools
which are freely used so a lot of people
can use it straight away without having
to pay license and companies don't need
to use manpower and a lot of other
benefits are associated with DevOps
so that is the difference between the
two ok now I want to go to the fun slide
here and talk about which all the
most-used develops tools because DevOps
is the ultimate technology right so we
start from here ok so this is the phase
that you plant code and build your
software okay so for maintaining your
code you have Bob with these tools like
git JIRA and eclipse ok Eclipse however
is an IDE
git is a place where you can store your
code and collaborate with multiple other
people so you will have a sphere for the
same purpose
for building your code you have tools
like mavens Radle and add and then to
test that code which is built you have
selenium you have j-unit you have test
energy and you have many more tools and
then comes the main part for release we
have tools like Jenkins bamboo Hudson
and many more and these tools are axiom
as favorite because they are continuous
integration tools which are responsible
for holding the entire DevOps framework
in place and then comes the deployment
tools so in deployment we have two
different categories one is
configuration management and the other
is containerization in configuration
management we have goods like puppet
chef advil and salt stack and for
containerization we have tools like
docker vagrant cuba nets and many more
which are gaining popularity and then
finally for monitoring we have tools
like Nagios Splunk
sensu New Relic LK and many more a lot
of these tools are also used in agile
development but however the reason the
accord DevOps tools is because they
enable automation and automation is
fully achieved only in DevOps ok so
having said this let me conclude today's
presentation happy Loney from a troika I
hope you have enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
and you can comment any of your doubts
and queries and we will reply them at
the earliest do look out for more videos
