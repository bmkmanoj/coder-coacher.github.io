what is Android I mean what is this
Android architecture and how are we
going to use this Android architecture
so first these architecture is divided
into different stacked layers so
different layers so the bottom most
layer is going to be the Linux kernel
level layer so kernel is going to be
something which which basically acts as
the medium between the high level
application software and the low level
hardware so kernel is something which
which is going to interact with the
hardware and how is it going to interact
with the hardware so basically we have
the high level applications so
applications we would have written
applications use in Java and these
applications uses a few things like
framework like like basically an API
will be exposed so that based on that
API API innocence application
programming interface what it happens
just it basically provides the the
classes and the methods which are
required for the development purpose so
all these things will be exposed so once
we know which which or what has to be
used at a specific point of time we
should just use that particular you know
framework and we will just use those
libraries which is related to the
framework and we the applications you
know like works like if you have a
camera device so let me just take an X
real time example itself how this
framework is going to be supported and
how are we going to use all these things
so first thing is we will have something
like you know an app which is present on
the application level layer we will call
that APIs to be a camera application and
now a camera application has a camera
hardware so which is outside the scope
of this architecture because hardware's
doesn't come under this one now assume
that there is something like camera here
and camera and the operating system are
connected through the camera driver
which is present in the kernel portion
and now what happens is the application
which is present in the application
stack or the application layer here
we'll have the framework library that
was the camera framework which is
present here so that application talks
to the camera framework and a camera
framework in turn accesses this camera
libraries and the drivers which is
brilliant Anil Knox Lee Linux kernel
layer here so as the communication
happens here between the different
layers of the Android architecture which
which helps you in talking to the
Android I mean
welcome to the physical device that as a
camera and helps us in getting the
picture out of a real world in a real
environment thing you might have a
question here like runtime here so we
have the cool libraries and what is the
runtime that you will be using for
Android here so Android uses a default a
runtime which is called as dalvik
virtual machine so basically it convert
I mean it takes in all the Java class
files but as Java source files will be
converted to class files and all this
class files will be combined and then
put together and it also takes in all
the resources which are required for the
Android app so basically half will not
be designed only using the source code
so you you might have also seen some UI
like like if you take in whatsapp as an
example what's up you can customize the
user interface that is you can just put
your friends or or an environment or a
beautiful landscape as the background
for your watch ah so all these things so
basically like all the resources images
and all those things can be put and all
the Java classes and everything put
combined together dalvik virtual machine
will process that and it would generate
something called as a index file so
which we will be using to run on that
particular device and now coming back to
the next and our tools and next options
that's called as DDMS so what do you
mean by DDMS so DDMS is be
basically a tool basically a tool which
is integrated with Android and now what
is the use of this tool so DDMS means
dalvik you know devise debug monitor
which is now change the I mean they have
just now changed the name as name of the
read EMS to Android device monitor so
basically this read EMS is a tool which
we will be using to check our device
status so what do you mean by device
status if you have that question so
device status is going to be something
like now what is the amount of memory
that the device is going to be consumed
I mean that where which exact place the
app is breaking or how much memory is
being consumed or if you are you know
working with some SMS based application
so how do I you know make the SMS
visible in my I mean on to my emulator
so all these things we shall just or all
these things we should just do it using
the DDMS option so basically how to not
spoof an SMS or if you are planning to
build an app on Google Maps or GPS based
apps and how to you know spoof your
positioning and how to get some
information based on the signal strength
of your device and all those things so
these things can be determined using
DDMS it's not only basically use for
spoofing it's you can you can you even
connect your physical devices with your
now BDMS option I mean physical device
with your DDMS and then make it work
with it and you can check your device
status and device memory options and all
those things in the DMS option itself
and while DDMS is basically use this it
is now basically used to monitor monitor
and in order to debug it is basically
used and how will I use this DDMS option
so basically DDMS is integrated with
Android studio so Android studio comes
along with DDMS so how do I open it so
just open Android studio so this option
which you see here can you see this
option called as Android device monitor
so this is going to be the option now
once you click on this Android device
monitor it's just opening that DDMS
option you know it's it takes a little
bit of time to load yes this is the read
EMS option right now this is the
emulator which I'm running so now if I
want to check the threads so I should
just go here let's take some heap memory
I should just go here and check out what
is the graph that is being used and if I
want to check some allocation techniques
and all those things are Network
selection and if I want to explore the
files basically this is a simulator I
mean an emulator you you might think
that this emulator
will have the same features as an
Android device yes it has the same
features of Android device ronzo has
some memory so how to check how to go
into this and then check out what are
the files present so we just go to file
explorer and explore the dealy I mean
explore that particular device now the
SD card option you have root and all
these things just go there and explore
what is present in that particular
device so that's going to be about a
brief introduction about DDMS that as
i've told you so EDM s is used to check
so for viewing heap in this go to that
heap portion you would select your
emulator and then or your physical
device and then check out what are the
memory status and all those things based
on your device status and network tool
that as I've shown you like just now it
is displayed you so what are the network
status and all those things can be used
or checked using DDMS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
