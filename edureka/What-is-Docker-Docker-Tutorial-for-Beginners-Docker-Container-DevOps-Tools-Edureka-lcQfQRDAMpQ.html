Rekha in today's session will focus on
what is docker
so without any further ado let us move
forward and have a look at the agenda
for today first we'll see why we need
docker we'll focus on various problems
that industries were facing before
docker was introduced after that we'll
understand what exactly docker is and
for better understanding of docker we'll
also look at a docker example after that
will understand how industries are using
docker with a case study of Indiana
University our fifth topic will focus on
various docket components like images
containers etc and our hands-on part
will focus on installing WordPress and
PHP myadmin
using docker compose so I hope you all
are clear with the agenda kindly give me
a quick confirmation by writing down in
the chat box so as I says yes Pallavi
Stephanie Daniel cool great so we'll
move forward and we'll see why we need
docker so this is the most common
problem that industries were facing as
you can see that there is a developer
who has build an application that works
fine in his own environment but when it
reads production there were certain
issues with that application why does
that happen that happens because of
difference is the computing environment
between dev and product so I hope we are
clear with the first problem kindly give
me a quick confirmation so that I can
move forward or if you have any doubts
or questions do write it down in the
chat box I'll be very happy to help you
and I would like to add this thing guys
let us make this session interactive you
won't even enjoy it if it is a one-way
conversation so whatever doubts whatever
queries you have please write it down in
a chat box
alright so shall I move forward just
give me a confirmation
Pallavi says yes so does Stephanie
alright cool cool I'll move forward and
we'll see the second problem before we
proceed with the second problem it is
very important for us to understand what
are micro services consider a very large
application that application is broken
down into smaller services each of those
services can be termed as micro services
or we can put it in an another way as
well micro services can
consider that small processes that
communicates with each other over a
network to fulfill one particular goal
let us understand this with an example
as you can see that there is an online
shopping service application it can be
broken down into smaller micro services
like account service product catalog
card server and orders over micro
service architecture is gaining a lot of
popularity nowadays even giants like
Facebook and Amazon are adopting micro
service architecture there are three
major reasons for adopting micro service
architecture or you can say there are
three major advantages of using
Microsoft's architecture first there are
certain applications which are easier to
build and maintain when they are broken
down into smaller pieces or smaller
services second reason is suppose if I
want to update a particular software or
I want a new technology stack in one of
my module on one of my service so I can
easily do that because the dependency
concerns will be very less when compared
to the application as a whole apart from
that the third reason is if any of my
module or any of my service goes down
then my whole application remains
largely unaffected so I hope we are
clear with what our micro services and
what are their advantages any questions
guys please write it down in the chat
box so we will move forward and see what
are the problems in adopting this micro
service architecture so this is one way
of implementing micro service
architecture over here as you can see
that there is a host machine and on top
of that host machine there are multiple
virtual machines each of these virtual
machines contains the dependencies for
one micro service so you must be
thinking what is the disadvantage here
the major disadvantage here is in
virtual machines there is a lot of
wastage of resources resources such as
RAM processor disk space are not
utilized completely by the micro service
which is running in these virtual
machines so it is not an ideal way to
implement micro service architecture and
I have just given an example of five
micro services what if there are more
than five micro services what if your
application is so huge that it requires
50 micro services so at that time using
virtual machines does not make sense
because of the wastage of resources so
any doubt still here guys
please write it down in your chart box
any doubt shall I move forward and see
how docker is solving these problems
cool great so I'll move forward thanks
for the confirmation so let us first
discuss the implementation of micro
service problem that we just saw so what
is happening here there's a host machine
and on top of that host machine there is
a virtual machine and on top of that
virtual machine there are multiple
docker containers and each of these
docker containers contains the
dependencies for one micro service so
you must be thinking what is the
difference here earlier we were using
virtual machines now we are using were
docker containers on top of virtual
machines let me tell you guys docker
containers are actually lightweight
alternatives of virtual machines what
does that mean in docker containers you
don't need to pre allocate any RAM or
any disk space so it will take the RAM
and disk space according to the
requirements of applications all right
okay so stephanie has a question she is
asking why are we using virtual machine
here very good question Stephanie let me
tell you first the host machine has to
be aligned X or a UNIX based machine in
order to run docker containers docker
containers does not work on Windows
system so if you have a Windows system
you require a Linus or UNIX virtual
machine then only you can run docker
containers and one more reason for using
docker containers when a virtual machine
is that you want to segregate it from
the rest of the host machine you want to
encapsulate that separately in a virtual
machine because in your host machine
suppose you have around 64 GB of RAM and
around a 20 TB of hard disk and all of
your micro services combined will not
use more than 20 GB of RAM and 200 GB of
hard disk so there's no point in running
docker containers on the host machine so
I can configure a virtual machine that
provides 20 GB of RAM and exactly 200 GB
of hardness and I can run docker
containers on that virtual machine so I
hope this answers your question
Stephanie thank you for the confirmation
now let us see how darker solves the
problem of not having a consistent
computing environment throughout the
software delivery lifecycle let me tell
you first of all docker containers are
actually developed by the developers so
now let us see how docker solve the
first problem that we saw where an
application works fine
development environment but not in
production so docker containers can be
used throughout the SCLC lifecycle in
order to provide consistent computing
environment so the same environment will
be present in dev test and product so
there won't be any difference in the
computing environment so let us move
forward and understand what exactly
docker is so the docker containers does
not use the guest operating system it
uses the host operating system let us
refer to the diagram that is shown this
is the host operating system and on top
of that host operating system there's a
docker engine and with the help of this
docker engine docker containers are
formed and these containers have
applications running in them and the
requirements for those applications such
as all the binaries and libraries are
also packaged in the same container
alright and there can be multiple
containers running as you can see that
there are two containers here one and
two so on top of the host machine
there's a docker engine and on top of
the docker engine there are multiple
containers and each of those containers
will have an application running in them
and whatever the binaries and library is
required for that application is also
packaged in the same container so I hope
we are clear so now let us move forward
and understand docker in more detail so
this is a general workflow of docker or
you can say one way of using docker
over here what is happening a developer
writes a code that defines an
application requirements or the
dependencies in an easy to write docker
file and this docker file produces
docker images so whatever dependencies
are required for a particular
application is present inside this image
and what are docker containers docker
containers are nothing but the runtime
instance of docker image this particular
image is uploaded onto the docker hub
now what is docker hub docker hub is
nothing but a git repository for docker
images
it contains public as well as private
repositories so from public repositories
you can pull your image as well and you
can upload your own images as well onto
the docker hub all right from docker hub
various teams such as QA or production
team will pull the image and prepare
their own containers as you can see from
the diagram so what is the major
advantage we get through this workflow
so whatever the dependencies that are
required for your application is
actually present throughout the software
delivery life
if you can recall the first problem that
we saw that an application works fine in
development environment but when it
reaches production it is not working
properly so that particular problem is
easily resolved with the help of this
particular workflow because you have a
same environment throughout the software
delivery lifecycle ba dev test or
product so I hope I'm clear are there
any doubts till here
ok so daniel has a question he is asking
can you please elaborate modern docker
hub sure Daniel docker hub is basically
a cloud hosted service provided by
docker
over here you can upload your own images
like you can write your own image and
upload that onto the docker hub and at
the same time you can even pull the
images that are present in the public
repositories alright so it is just like
a git repository for docker images are
you clear with talk adopt onion give me
a quick confirmation so that I can move
forward thank you thanks a lot for your
confirmation so I'll move forward and
we'll see for better understanding of
docker a docker example so this is
another way of using docker in the
previous example we saw that docker
images were used and those images were
uploaded onto the docker hub and from
dock and how various teams were pulling
those images and building their own
containers but docker images are huge in
size and requires a lot of network
bandwidth so in order to save that
network bandwidth we use this kind of a
workflow over here we use Jenkins
servers or any continuous integration
server to build an environment that
contains all the dependencies for a
particular application or a micro
service and that build environment is
deployed on to various themes like
testing staging and production so let us
move forward and see what exactly is
happening in this particular image over
here developer has written complex
requirements for a micro service in an
easy to write docker file and the code
is then pushed on to the gates
repository from get reports to
continuous integration servers like
Jenkins will pull that code and build an
environment that contains all the app
dependencies for that particular micro
service and that environment is deployed
on to testing staging and production so
in this way whatever requirements are
there for your micro service is present
throughout the software delivery
lifecycle
so if you can recall the first problem
where application works fine in dev but
does not work in prod so with this
workflow we can completely remove that
problem because the requirements for the
micro service is present throughout the
software delivery lifecycle and this
image also explains how easy it is to
implement the micro-service architecture
using docker now let us move forward and
see how industries are adopting docker
so this is the case study of Indiana
University before docker they were
facing many problems so let us have a
look at those problems one by one the
first problem was they were using custom
script in order to deploy that
application onto various VMs so this
requires a lot of manual steps and the
second problem was their environment was
optimized for legacy Java based
applications but their growing
environment involves new products that
aren't solely Java based so in order to
provide the students the best possible
experience they needed to began
modernizing their applications let us
move forward and see what all other
problems Indiana University was facing
so in the previous problem of dog
Indiana University they wanted to start
modernizing their applications so for
that they wanted to move from a
monolithic architecture to a
microservice architecture and the
previous slides we also saw that if you
want to update a particular technology
in one of your microservice it is easy
to do that because there will be very
less dependency constraints when
compared to the whole application so
because of that reason they wanted to
start modernizing their application they
wanted to move to a micro service
architecture let us move forward and see
what are the other problems that they
were facing Indiana University also
needed security for the sensitive
student data such as SSN and student
health care data so there are four major
problems that they were facing before
docker
now let us see how they have implemented
docker to solve all these problems the
solution to all these problems was
docker data center and docker data
center has various components which are
there in front of your screen first is
universal control plane then comes LDAP
swarm CS engine and finally docker
trusted registry now let us move forward
and see how they have implemented docker
data center in their infrastructure this
is a workflow of how Indiana University
has adopted docker data
oh this is dogged trusted registry it is
nothing but the storage of all your
docker images and each of those images
contains the dependencies for one micro
service as we saw that Indiana
University wanted to move from a
monolithic architecture to a micro
service architecture so because of that
reason these docker images contains the
dependencies for one particular micro
service but not the whole application
all right after that comes Universal
control plane it is used to deploy
services onto various hosts with the
help of docker images that are stored in
the docker trusted registry so IT ops
team can manage their entire
infrastructure from one single place
with the help of Universal control plane
web user interface they can actually use
it to provision docker installed
software on various hosts and then
deploy application so without doing a
lot of manual steps as we saw in the
previous slides that Indiana University
was earlier using custom scripts to
deploy application onto VMs that
requires a lot of manual steps that
problem is completely removed here when
we talk about security the role based
access controls within the docker data
center allowed Indiana University to
define a level of access to various
themes for example they can provide
read-only access to docker containers
for production team and at the same time
they can actually provide read and write
access to the dev team so I hope we all
are clear with how Indiana University
has adopted docker data center do you
have any questions any doubt still here
please ask me so Pallavi has a question
she is asking what is the difference
between docker containers and virtual
machines so docker containers are
nothing but the lightweight alternatives
of virtual machines as I've told you
earlier is where docker containers do
not don't have their own operating
system they sit on top of the host
operating system or you can say that
they uses the host operating system in
docker containers you don't need to pre
allocate any ram it takes a ram
accordingly but in virtual machines you
have to pre allocate a certain amount of
RAM when we talk about run time the
ocker containers have very less run time
because you don't need to boot the OS
whereas in virtual machine it has a run
time which is greater than docker
containers because you need to boot the
OS so these are the three major
difference if you want to know more
difference between docker containers
and virtual machines you can refer to
the docker tutorial video so I hope you
are clear with the differences between
docker containers and virtual machines
is there any doubt in your mind please
ask anyone if you have any doubts please
ask so that we can proceed towards
various docket components so cool we'll
move forward and see what are the
various docker components first is a
docker registry the orchid registry is
nothing but the storage of all your
darker images your images can be stored
either in public repositories or in
private repositories these repositories
can be present locally or it can be
present on the cloud docker provides a
cloud hosted service called docker hub
docker hub as public as well as private
repositories from public repositories
you can actually pull an image and
prepare your own containers at the same
time you can write an image and upload
that onto the docker hub you can upload
that into your private repository or you
can upload that on a public repository
as well that is totally up to you so for
better understanding of docker hub let
me just show you how it looks like so
this is how docker hub looks like so
first you need to actually sign in with
your own login credentials after that
you will see a page like this which says
welcome to doc and hump over here as you
can see that there is an option of
create repository where you can create
your own public or private repositories
and upload images and at the same time
there is an option called explore
repositories this contains all the
repositories which are available
publically so let us go ahead and
explore some of the publicly available
repositories so we have repositories for
engine X red is Ubuntu then we have
darker registry alpine Mongo my sequel
swarm so what I'll do I'll show you a
center waste repository so this is the
center waste repository which contains
the center base image now what I'll do
later in the session I will actually
pull a Center wise image from docker hub
now let us move forward and see what our
docker images and containers so docker
images are nothing but the read-only
templates that are used to create
containers these docker images contains
all the dependencies for a particular
application or a micro service you can
create your own image and upload that
onto the dock
up and at the same time you can also
pull the images which are available in
the public repositories and in docker
hub let us move forward and see what our
docker containers docker containers are
nothing but the runtime instances of
docker images it contains everything
that is required to run an application
or a micro service and at the same time
it is also possible that more than one
image is required to create one
container alright so for better
understanding of docker images and
docker containers what I'll do on my
overdue box I will pull a send to s
image and I'll run a centaurs container
in that so let us move forward and first
install docker in my open two box so
guys this is my open two box over here
first I'll update the packages so for
that I'll type sudo apt-get update
asking for password
it is done now
before installing darker I need to
install
recommended packages so for that I'll
type sudo apt-get install Linux - image
- extra - you name space - R and now a
Linux - image
- extra - virtual and here we go press
why
so we are done with the prerequisites so
let us go ahead and install docker the
fedora I'll type sudo apt-get install
darker - engine
so we have successfully installed docker
if you want to install docker and send
to us you can refer the sent to its
docker installation video now we need to
start this dorkus service for that I'll
type sudo service darker start so it
says the job is already running now what
I will do I'll pull ascend to is image
from docker hub and I will run the
Centaurs container so for that I'll type
sudo docker pull and the name of the
image that is st. OS so first it will
check the local registry for sent to its
image if it doesn't find there then it
will go to the docker hub for Center
wise image and it will pull the image
from there
so we have successfully pulled a Center
wise image from docker hub now I'll run
the Centaurs container so for that I'll
type sudo docker run - IT cent OS that
is the name of the image and here we go
so we are now in the center waste
container let me exit from this clear my
terminal so any doubt still here guys
you can ask me by writing down in the
chat box any doubts any questions please
ask me I'll be very happy to help you
all right no doubt so I'll move forward
with the slides just give me a quick
confirmation trying Stephanie Paolo II
Daniel cool grid will move forward so
let us now recall what we did first we
install docker on Ubuntu after that we
pulled send to his image from docker hub
and then we build a centaurs container
using that sent OS image so are we clear
now I will move forward and I will tell
you what exactly docker compose is so
let us understand what exactly dog it
composes suppose you have multiple
applications on various containers and
all those containers are actually linked
together so you don't want to actually
execute each of those containers one by
one but you want to run those containers
at once with a single command so that's
where dock and compose comes into the
picture with docker compose you can
actually run multiple applications
present on various containers with one
single command that is too awkward -
compose up as you can see that there is
an example in front of you imagine
you're able to define three containers
one running a web app another running a
post crease and another running our
Redis in a yeah Mel file that is called
docker compose file and from there you
can actually execute all these three
containers with one single command that
is darker - compose up let us understand
this with an example
suppose you want to publish a blog for
that you'll use CMS and WordPress is one
of the most widely used CMS so you need
one container for WordPress and you need
one more container for my sequel as
back-end and that my sequel container
should be
to the wordpress container apart from
that you need one more container for PHP
myadmin that should be linked to my
sequel database as it is used to access
my sequel database so what if you are
able to define all these three
containers in one Yambol file and with
one command that is darker - composer
all three containers are up and running
so let me show you practically how it is
done on the same open - box where I've
installed docker and I've pulled a
center s image so this is my Ubuntu box
first I need to install docker compose
here but before that I need Python pip
so for that I'll type sudo apt-get
install Python - VIP and here we go
so it is done now I will clear my
terminal and now I'll install the orchid
compose for that I'll type sudo VIP
install docker - compose and here we go
so dr. Campos is successfully installed
now I'll make a directory and I named it
as WordPress mkdir WordPress now I'll
enter this WordPress directory now over
here I'll edit docker - compose dot yeah
Mel file using G edit you can use any
other editor that you want I'll use e
edit so I'll type sudo G edit docker -
compose dot yeah mil and here we go so
over here what I'll do I'll first open a
document and I'll copy this yeah Mel
code and I will paste it here so let me
tell you what I've done first
I have defined a container and I've
named it as WordPress it is built from
an image WordPress that is present on
the docker hub but this WordPress image
does not have a database so for that I
have defined one more container and I've
named it as WordPress underscore DB it
is actually built from the image that is
called a Mario DB which is present in
the WordPress and I need to link this
WordPress underscore DB with the
WordPress container so for that I have
written links WordPress underscore DB :
my sequel alright and in the post
section this port 80 of the docker
container will actually be linked to put
8 0 8 0 of my host machine so are we
clear till here now what I've done I've
defined a password here as a breaker you
can give whatever password that you want
and I've defined one more container
called PHP myadmin
this container is built from the image
could be new / stalker - PHP myadmin
that is present on the docker hub again
I need to link this particular container
with WordPress underscore DB container
for that I have written links WordPress
underscore Divi : my sequel and the post
section the port 80 of my docker
container will actually be linked to put
eight one eight one of the host machine
and finally I have given a username that
is root and I've given a password as
Eddie wake up
so do you have any doubts any questions
please write it down in your chart box
okay so I you she's asking can you
please repeat it once more sure I you
see I'll do that so what I've done here
I have defined a container by the name
WordPress it is built from an image
called WordPress that is present in the
docker hub alright but this image that
is present in the docker hub does not
have a database so I need to define one
more container that contains a database
so WordPress underscore DB is the name
of that container and it is built from
an image called Mario DB which is
present on the docker hub now as I've
told you earlier as well so I need to
link this database with WordPress so
what I'll do I'll write links WordPress
underscore DB : my sequel alright and
the post section the port 80 of the
docker container will be linked to port
eight zero eight zero of the host
machine after that we require one more
container and I've named it as PHP
myadmin
it is built from the image called
Corbino / no / - PHP myadmin
and I need to link this particular
container with WordPress underscore Divi
and my sequel is actually the name that
I have given in the post section the
port 80 of the container is actually
linked to put eight one eight one of the
host machine and finally I have given
username and password I've given
username as root and password as ID
rekha you can give whatever password
password or username that you want so
let us now save it and we'll quit let me
first clear my terminal and now I'll run
a command sudo docker
- compose up - D and here we go
so this command will actually pull all
the three images and we'll build the
three containers
you
so it is done now let me clear my
terminal now what I'll do I'll open my
browser and over here I'll type the IP
address of my machine or I can type the
hostname as well first name of my
machine is localhost so I'll type
localhost and put eight zero eight zero
that I have given for WordPress so it
will direct you to a WordPress
installation page over here you need to
fill this particular form which is
asking you for site title I'll give it
as ed Eureka username also I'll give us
a lyrica password I'll type in Eureka
confirm the user week password then type
your email address and it is asking
search engine of visibility which I want
so I won't click here and finally I
click on install WordPress so this is my
WordPress dashboard and WordPress is now
successfully installed now what I'll do
I'll open one more tab and over here
I'll type localhost or the IP address of
my machine and I go to port 8 1 8 1 for
PHP myadmin and over here I need to give
the username if you can recall have
given root and password I have given as
nu Rekha and here we go so PHP myadmin
is successfully installed this PHP
myadmin is actually used to access a my
sequel database and this my sequel
database is used as back-end for
WordPress thank you for attending
