welcome to this live session on Azure
today in this session we are going to
see how we can secure your applications
using virtual networks all right now
before we go ahead with the session I
want to know how many of you are
acquainted with the idea of azure how
many of you know what as you're actually
is right and our I'd also like to add
guys any doubts that you have during the
session please put it in your comment
box and I have my team with me here
they'll be happy to answer your
questions right so with that
okay so I'll assume you guys know what
is the order so basically for those who
don't know Azure is basically a cloud
computing platform using which you
launch services using which he launched
servers on Azure right now using Azure
but what we're going to do today is we
are going to launch two servers a web
server and a database server and using
that we are going to configure the
properties the security properties of it
using virtual networks right so let's go
ahead and see what all we are going to
learn in this today's session so today
in this session first we'll start off
with what is a virtual machine right
we're going to understand what is a
virtual machine how we can configure it
how we can launch it in a zone once we
have done that we'll move on to virtual
networks so before understanding what is
a virtual network will first understand
why do we actually need a virtual
network right once that is done we'll
move on and see what is the virtual
network exactly and its components right
and towards the end we'll be doing a
demo where in like I said we will
deploying two servers which will be
configuring from scratch that is a web
server and a database server right and
we'll be deploying them in virtual
networks and configuring their
properties right so guys I hope this
agenda is clear to you let's move ahead
and start off with the first session
which is what is a virtual machine so
what is a virtual machine so immersive
machine is basically a raw server that
you get from your cloud provider that
ross / could could be an abundancy
it could be a Windows machine right so
it's basically just like your own
personal computer rather than purchasing
it you are renting it out on cloud right
when you are renting it out on cloud now
it is the same as if it was you on your
own computer right so it's a fresh piece
of operating system you can install as
many software's as you want you can want
it to be make it to be a web server you
can make it to be a worker to your
environment you can configure it to be
anything right so today we are going to
make it a web server and a database
server moving on guys so this is what
virtual machine is all about and also if
you compare it with AWS which is also a
popular cloud computing service with an
AWS this Plus this same service is
called ec2 all right in Azure which it's
called virtual machine and AWS it is
called easy - all right moving ahead
guys now let's start with virtual
networks and first understand why do we
actually need virtual networks all right
so like I said we have virtual machines
right so if you say launch two virtual
machines and you want both them to
communicate with each other for example
in our session today in our demo session
what we'll be doing is that we'll be
deploying a web server and we'll be
deploying a database server and we want
the web server to talk to the database
server right for this for this
communication we need a channel and
hence we need a network right but why
virtual networks so if you guys would
have noticed in cloud there is no there
are no wires there are there are no
switches there are no routers all right
so your virtual machine is connected
using a logical connection right it is
logic these two servers are logically
isolated and that is why we call it
virtual right so this is so if we
understood that for the communication
scale sake we need a virtual network
let's now understand what a virtual
network exactly is right so a virtual
network is just like a representation of
your network but on the cloud right for
example we launch the server on the
cloud and we connect to our virtual
network right when we connect to our
virtual network that is on as your our
network will include that server as if
it's on our
own network that is on on premise right
that is what a virtual network is that
is how powerful a virtual network built
right your server will be on the cloud
but your company or your company's
network will feel as if the server is on
your own network right and like I said
it's a logical isolation of the zero
cloud dedicated to your subscription
that is whatever resources that you have
launched in the cloud it logically
isolates it from the rest of the
resources that are there on Azure that
maybe it could be your resources or
someone else's resources as well it
logically isolates them and they are
insulated to other resources it doesn't
matter if the other resources are
failing or doing anything right they are
all isolated so this is what virtual
network is all about now when you say
what's your network it basically has a
lot of components let's understand these
components so the first component is and
as your subnet now what isn't as your
subnet basically when you divide a
network into sub parts it is called an
as your subnet all right so when you
divide a virtual network into bass it's
called a subnet now this subnet can
actually be given unique properties for
example in this same virtual network you
have three virtual machines right one
module machine is in one net1 subnet and
the other virtual machine is another
subnet but this subnet you can configure
to be unique for example we wanted to we
want to create a public subnet so a
public subnet is basically a subnet
which has internet access all right so
we can configure the properties set in a
way that this particulars net the
machines in this particular subnet will
have the internet access and the others
particular subnet will not have the
internet access so a subnet which
doesn't have the internet access is
called a private subnet all right so the
virtual machine in this particular
subnet will not have internet access but
but when you actually see it from a
broader perspective all of these servers
are on the same network right but
because of because of the subnets
because of the properties of subnets
they reflect different properties right
so being on the same the same
but they have different properties and
using subnets this is our subnets are
actually useful all right so this is
what this is all you need to know about
subnets guys now with subnets the
properties that I was talking about say
I want to connect to a web server right
so for connecting to the web server for
accessing that website I need to go
through HTTP protocol right so all of
this is configured in a in a firewall
now what is that firewall called that
firewall is actually network security
groups now what a network security
groups like I said they're just
firewalls in which you put in the
properties that you want the subnet to
reflect for example I want to connect to
my web server so I have to allow all
HTTP traffic on that subnet and for that
I'll have to attach that particular
network security group to that subnet
now I know it's a lot to take I just
explained you three components and you
might be thinking where which component
goes where right and so I have this
diagram so I'll just summarize what I
just explained it to you so we have this
virtual network in the virtual network
we have subnets and a subnet is attached
to a network security group right so
this network security group is where
you'll be configuring all the protocols
all the properties that you want here's
your particular machine to reflect this
firewall will be attached to the subnet
in which you will be deploying your
virtual machine all right so this is a
place where you'll be deploying your
virtual machine and it will be attached
to the subnet so your network security
group and this subnet is actually
included in your virtual network
all right so both these subnets are
actually in your virtual network so one
virtual network will have as many
subnets as you want and each subnet will
have different properties because of its
network security groups moving along
that is now let's so enough up talks I
have explained you everything you need
to know let's go ahead and start with a
demo and for that let's look at the
steps that we are going to do so first
we'll be creating a network security
group that is the firewall that is
required for our server so basically
we'll be creating two five volts one for
a webserver and one
database server right so let's go ahead
and do that so just give me a second
I'll go to my dashboard
all right so guys this is how my
dashboard actually looks like now on
this dashboard the first job that I have
to do is to create a network security
group so let us do that let us go to the
search bar and type network security
groups right and once you have done that
you will see it is red over here will
click on it and then we'll click on add
now when we click on add we first have
to add the firewall for web server right
so into the authorize either you could
deploy the web server first or your
database so you type in the name of the
network security group that this is for
my web server so I am in web server then
I will have to assign a resource group
now what is the resource group so
basically like for our use case today we
will be deploying a lot of resources
right so it becomes easier for us to
manage it if it comes under one group
alright so we'll be creating that group
over here so say I name the group as
live - demo right so this becomes my
resource group and all the resources
that I'll be launching today well I will
include them in this particular group so
that I becomes easier to manage for me
all right and I'll pin it to dashboard
and I'll click on create now while it is
being created you would have noticed
that I have pinned it to dashboard now
what is the dashboard guys so for those
of you who are not acquainted with the
azure dashboard so dashboard is just
like a desktop guys that you have on
your computer so all the shortcuts are
created here because I would be
configuring all the properties so I want
it to be listed here and that's why I
have created a shortcut on the dashboard
alright so while it is being deployed
let's deploy a second network security
group as well britches for my database
right so I will click on add and I will
type in database I include it in the
resource group that I've already created
which is live demo I click on this I'll
pin it to dashboard and I'll click on
create right that is it it's pretty
simple just
enter the name the resource group that
you want to enter it in and created
right now one thing that I want you to
notice is guys I have not configured any
property as of now right I'll do that
later so as of now I just created two
firewalls with the name web server and
database now what I'll do is let me come
back to my slide to see what we'll be
doing next right so step two is create
the virtual network so now I'll be
creating the virtual network in which I
will be deploying my servers right so
let's do that let's create a virtual
network so I'll click here I'll go to
virtual networks I'll click on add and
I'll give the virtual me a network name
say v-net right and then comes the
address space now what is the address
space recipes is basically the number of
IP addresses that your network can hold
so as of now this virtual network can
hold 256 computers right or 256 virtual
machines and now since I'll be creating
more than two subnets I want to address
space which will be more because each
subnet will take some minimum value
right so let us give it a more elaborate
address space let me type in this right
and I did this part and this will give
you a bigger set of addresses to deal
with so now my address my virtual
network will be capable of having 65,000
addresses which is kind of cool right
next we have the subnet name so by
default when you create a virtual
network there will be a default subnet
will be created which will be created
alright so this is the address range for
that default subnet so it should be in
this same range that we have specified
for our virtual network so let's give it
this address and as you can see in this
particular subnet that is the default
subnet
I'll have around 256 machines alright so
that is it nothing else needs to be
configured I will include it in the
resource group that I've already created
that is live demo and location is
basically the place where the servers
are being deployed right so by default
it's best west us we will keep it at
that right and we'll create this virtual
network that is it guys nothing else to
be configured for as of now this virtual
network does not have any subnets right
we want we want a webserver subnet and
we want a database subnet that we'll be
deploying now once the virtual network
is ready alright let me come back to my
slide and show you this diagram so this
diagram basically talks about a virtual
network two subnets now what I was doing
is I've been launching two virtual
machines and I'll be attaching these
virtual machines with this subnet all
right and this is basically your network
security group this is where you will be
configuring your properties and this
also I will attach to the subnet now
this VM will then reflect the properties
of this particular firewall right I will
not be attaching this firewall directly
to this VM but I will be attaching it to
the subnet now what advantage do I have
in this is that say I launched three
servers in the subnet all of them will
reflect this property right so I don't
have to configure them separately all of
them will be reflecting the security
groups properties of this particular
subnet all right I think a virtual
network is ready let's see so if I go to
my virtual networks I see that I have my
watching net for Grady all right now
I'll go inside my box one network and
now I've been deploying the subnets so
we'll go to the subnets pin we will
click on add and let's add our first
subnet which is the webserver subnet
right now this webserver subnet will be
attached to a network security group
which will be for the webserver
right so we'll attach the network
security group for the webserver and we
click on okay that is it
it's that simple just add the subnet
attached a network security group to
that and you're done right similarly
I'll be deploying the database subnet
now and I will go to network security
groups
I will click on the database subnet
database network security group let's
click on OK and bam I have one more
subnet let me go back to my dashboard
and see what all do I have so I have the
two network security groups
I have deployed the virtual network I
have deployed the subnets in it and I
have attached the firewall to the subnet
all that is left is now the VM so step
three is create the web server virtual
machine and the database was a machine
so let us do that we will go to our pain
go to virtual machines right click on
add and with this you will get this page
wherein you have all the operating
systems that you can set in your in your
virtual machine now you can set a 1 to
operating system you can also configure
a window so but we will be dealing with
a one two today right so I'll select
Ubuntu I actually country it and then I
get this page where I have to enter the
general properties so I'll name the
server as web server right I'll give the
user name the user name that will
authenticate me to this particular
server now when you talk about the
password or the way you will
authenticate yourself you basically have
two options you can either both indicate
through a public private key or you can
authenticate through a password so
password is more easier and since we
want our things to be done quicker I'll
give a password and this is the password
I'll configure it now and that is it
guys nothing else needs to be configured
resource group
I'll give the resource group that I've
already created that is live demo and
I'll click on OK on the next page it
will ask me the configuration of my
server that I want right so do I want
one core CPU and a 3.5 GB RAM or I
wanted two core CPU and seven gig ram I
can choose all the configurations which
are available here in the view all page
but I stick to the first configuration
which is the basic one so that because I
am doing a demo right so I don't need a
big
I click on select next comes the
optional features that I have to
configure right so the storage and then
what words will network do I want my
server to be deployed in so we have
created the virtual network called v-net
so we'll be deploying it in this then
comes the subnet so in inside this
virtual network there are three subnets
like I said one is default that is
created by default and then we have the
database and the web server subnet so
since this is a web server VM we will be
deploying it under the web server subnet
then comes the public IP address so it
will assign it a public IP address
through which we can access it that is
going to be new and then comes the
network security group so since we have
already assigned a network security
group in the subnet we don't need any
network security group to be attached
over here so let's click on none and
then monitoring do you want it or not I
would prefer to be disabled because I
won't be needing the server after this
session so I'll click on disabled and
I'll click on ok all right so now what
will happen is it will validate all the
properties that I've entered and once it
has entered it will give me a page
wherein I have to agree to the terms and
conditions and that is it so I'll agree
to the terms and conditions and I'll
click on purchase and that will deploy
my server that is it guys so this is my
web server being deployed let's quickly
deploy our database server as well
following the same steps that we have
followed now right so I'll choose a one
to machine I will click on create I will
go to this page and type in the name of
the server which is database write the
username so it said Eureka or 10 degrees
in type is password so I will type in
the password now confirm the password
and then comes the resource group so
it's live demo right and the location is
rescuers I click on ok select the most
basic configuration which is the first
one click and select now I be
configuring the virtual network settings
so
subnet would be database right network
security group will be none and that is
it
monitoring will be disabled click on OK
I can validate all the properties and
then I shall change the server and which
will be deployed right if you if you are
talking if you are thinking how much is
it going to cost me so each server is
going to cost me around three three two
three two point three point five rupees
per hour right so that's like a fraction
of a dollar so I think if you're
learning as you're that is worth it
right
so my servers are being deployed guys
now why my servers are being deployed
let me configure the properties of each
server right so let me go to the
webserver firewall and configure the
properties so basically what I'd what I
am looking at is the inbound security
rules so I click on end bound security
rules so inbound security rules are
basically the rules which are created
for the connections which are incoming
to the server right so this is a web
server right so for a web server first
you have to enable the HTTP connection
so I want the HTTP connection through
HTTP protocol to be enabled over here
right and the source is any what what
kind of people can access this over so I
want the whole world to and access my
internet website so the source is any
the service is HTTP right and everything
else is default the action what do you
want what do you want to deny it or you
want to allow it so I want to allow the
connections so I will select allow and
I'll click on ok all right so my
security rule is being created so while
this is being created guide guys let's
we'll have to add one more security rule
which is the HTTPS security rule because
our websites connect through two
protocols which is HTTP and HTTPS so we
will configure HTTPS as well so let us
select HTTP from the list
and then the action is allow and you
might be wondering what this priority
number is right so priority number is
basically the number which will be given
to your rule so say example in my
previous rule I gave the priority number
as hundred right so when it reads the
set of rules that are given in the
firewall the first rule would be the
least number which is there so the least
number is hundred and it goes up to I
think nine hundred right so it will read
all the rules according to the numbers
and then configure them so we have added
the HTTP rule and the HTTP rule is also
being added and that is it
that is all is which is required so let
me just refresh it and I can see there
HTTP and HTTPS rules are already been
given now I also want to SSH I should be
able to SSH into my server but before
that let me show you what if I don't
configure the property error let's see
what that then happens right so for
configuring my web server I have to SSH
into the web server to see to install
all the software's which are required
for that particular so right so let's
connect to this server so the way I can
connect is using a software called putty
so I launch the software I paste this
paste IP address here and as of now guys
I have not added the SSH property right
so if I try to connect it will show the
screen and it will be it will keep on
pointing here right so the connection
will time out after a few say 30 or 40
seconds and it that basically means that
the server is refusing any connection to
it and the reason for the address that I
have not configured it in my firewall so
to do that see as you can see it has
given me an error which says connection
timed out so to do that I will have to
go to my firewall which is the network
security groups of my web server right
I'll go to the inbound security rules
and now I'll add a rule for SSH so once
I add the rule I'll be able to connect
to my so
so it's done my Security Rule is being
created and once it is created I'll be
able to SSH into the server also it
takes some time for that rule to
actually be applied right it says that
it created a security rule but sometimes
it takes time to reflect let's see if
the rule is being reflected here and yes
the rule is being reflected so as you
can see I have added the SSH rule and
now it is giving me the login page so I
login into my server which with the
username area reconfigured the username
to be a Eureka and now it will ask me
the password after authenticating the
user name so I'll type in the password
and if everything goes well I'll be
authenticated to my server right yes so
I am in my service this is my 1/2 server
which is running on Azure cloud now I
need to configure the software's in it
so that it becomes a web server right
alright so as of now there's nothing
installed on it it's a fresh piece of
software so let me first update this
ubuntu so I'll type in the update
command its sudo apt-get update right
now it'll take some time to update mean
bye guys let me quickly show you if I
can access my web server as of now or
not right so I'll go to virtual machines
I go to web server now you might ask me
that we have already configured to
accept HTTP connection but still if I
try to connect to this server I will not
be able to do so it will return me empty
the spawn screen so this basically means
that there is nothing configured on my
server as of now so what I'll do is so
my ubuntu is now updated so what I'll do
is now is I'll update it with the apache
software right so i'll type in the
command for apache so sudo apt-get
install apache2 alright once I have done
that it will install the apache software
here
and within seconds you can see that I'll
be able to connect to this server so
it's starting the service processing
yeah so a patch is installed now if I
try to connect to the server you'll be
able to see that I am getting the
Abbasid screen so if you want you can
connect to the server the IP address is
40 dot 83 dot 140 dot hundred my team
will be handing you out this IP address
so I'll repeat it again it's 40 dot 83
dot 140 dot hundred you can go to this
link and you see the Apaches page as of
now now as and as as we will go along
and we'll update this thing this website
you'll see that this page will be
updated all right so I have the Apache
working on my server now now my website
that I've created it is actually a PHP
website so I'll have to install PHP on
this server as well so I will write sudo
apt-get PHP 5 and I'll have to install
it so that's it this is it one second
so I misspelled install my bad sorry
right so now my PHP will be installed on
this system and while this is being
installed guys let me show you how my
website actually looks like so I'll go
to localhost and I will type in the
address for my website all right so this
is how my website actually looks like it
please simple you just have to enter
your name your email your mobile number
your location and once you click on
submit all of this address will go to
MySQL now MySQL is in a different server
this will be in a different server and
what we are trying to do is we are
trying to authenticate them to each
other using virtual networks all right
so if I go to my web server so my PHP
has been installed and with PHP I also
need an extension which will be which
will allow it to connect to MySQL so for
that I will have to install that
extension as well so sudo apt-get
install PHP 5
- MySQL right so with this my extension
will get installed on the system and
that is it all right so my web server is
configured now let's go on and configure
our MySQL now all right so my skin is a
bit tricky guys because you there is a
lot of configuration that you have to do
but let's hope for the best and see if
we can connect to it all right
also guys if you would have noticed I'm
not configured anything for my server
for my database server so as we did in
web server I'll show you if you try to
connect to it as of now will not be able
to so while this is being loaded let me
quickly go to the properties of my
database server right and include the
inbound security rules according to what
I want so I'll first have to enable the
SSH rule right so this is how I'll be
able to connect to my server so I'll
select the SSH service the action is
allow I click on ok and my security rule
will now be created also I should also
be able to create a MySQL connection to
the server because I want this this
server to be accessed through my
computer right if I write for example I
will be creating a database I'll be
adding the table right so I won't do all
of that through my computer I don't want
to ssh into the ubuntu again to
configure anything so we'll be doing
that so we need a MySQL connection as
well so let's add that
so it would be MySQL and the source
would be MySQL action is allow I'll
click on ok and this is guys so now the
security rule will be created and if we
try now to connect to our database
server I'll be able to do so so I will
copy the IP address I will click on open
I say yes and now it will ask me for the
login name so as you can see the
security rule worked it is asking me for
the login name and now the password so
I'll give
password for this and done with this
I'll be authenticated to my Ubuntu
server first of all I'll update this
machine with the update command like we
did in the previous over as well right
so now it will be updated after this I
will install the MySQL service that
we'll be using to that we'll be using to
connect our website from right so I will
now install the MySQL service which is
sudo apt-get install MySQL server right
this is it I'll type in Y which means
yes and now does a still ask me for the
password I'll type in the password and
confirm it again hit enter and that's it
okay so now I've configured MySQL I've
installed my scale on my system the next
thing is by default MySQL only allows
the localhost to access the root user
right if I want to connect to my machine
I have to create one more user for MySQL
for me to access it right so once my
MySQL is install I'll show you what I
mean right so we'll be doing that and I
think we are done yeah so we're done
let's connect to a MySQL service now so
the user is root and the password was a
Eureka 1-2-3 to connect to my database
and we are in so like I was saying we
have to create a user that we that will
be accessing from so let's create a user
for MySQL so I type in create user say
the user name is reka for my database
where is it it is on localhost and I
should add the password for it let me
add the password as and Eureka one two
three right and let me deploy a saw so I
have created the username now I'll have
to grant all the privileges to this
particular server so let me give the
command for that so it's grant all
privileges
on everything that is there on this
database to this particular username
which resides on localhost so this is a
command that will be configuring all
right now same set will be configuring
for the percentage host so let us do
that as well all right and then grant
all the privileges for the same alright
so done so we have created successfully
a new user now if I try to connect to
this database using this user let's see
how we can do that so I'll type in MySQL
so previously I authenticate myself
using root but now I'll use the Ann
Eureka username and see if I can connect
to it sorry I misspelled it so it's a
Eureka be and now the password so as you
can see I am I can authenticate through
alright sorry for that glitch alright so
now what we'll be doing is we alike of a
saying so we have to configure one more
file for a MySQL to get configured right
so for that let us go to our directory
that is EDC and in that MySQL right and
now in this particular directory I have
a file called my dot CNF so this is a
configuration file that I will have to
configure for connecting to my MySQL so
I'll sudo nano into it and then I will
get
to this particular statement which says
bind address so this binary switch
statement basically says that only local
whose connections are allowed to my
MySQL right so I'll have to comment this
part out and then I'll save it and that
is it guys so this was the last setting
that I had to do now if I try connecting
it through my computer I'll be able to
connect to this particular MySQL
instance so how to do that the first I
have to go to my MySQL installation
folder which is somewhere here right so
let me quickly go to my folder so this
is the folder where of MySQL resides so
now I'll connect it using this
particular command which is MySQL - H
now I'll paste in the IP address the
username which is a eureka the port
number which is three three zero six and
then the password it'll ask me for the
password so the password is l eureka one
two three now mind you guys it will not
connect right now it will give me an
error that it can't connect to MySQL
service and the reason for that is that
we have configured everything after the
MySQL service started on my server so
now I'll have to restart my server to
connect to it right so it will take some
time and then it will throw an error
that it can't connect to the particular
MySQL server right so as you can see so
for now connecting to it we will have to
restart the service so let me restart it
by typing in sudo service MySQL restart
alright so with this command my MySQL
will get restarted so let's see so my
MySQL has stopped and now it has
restarted and now if I try to connect to
a MySQL server I will be get yes so I
have it on my computer now I am able to
connect to my MySQL server let's quickly
create a database for my website which
says create database entry
so I quickly create a database and I
create a table for this right which is
create table entries
I'll give the name
and then the second entry is email
address there is Val card 30 right and
then the location which is again Val car
30 and then my mobile number which I'll
be feeding here all right so I think the
net is giving some problems all right so
I didn't select the database so use
entry and then I'll create the table so
guys there is some problem with our
internet connection I think it is
residing on your end as well so what
we'll do is we'll continue this session
in our next video so we have created the
database the next is creating of episode
that we will do in our next session
alright so let me quickly quickly come
back to my slide which is here right so
we have created a VM for the web server
we have created a VM for database we
have configured a database you can
connect to a database to our computer
all that is left is configuring the web
server so we'll do that in the next
section and I'll show you how you can
configure the properties for it and yeah
