so can you all see my screen and hear me
clearly yes is my voice clearly audible
awesome ok thank you flex so just a
quick introduction about myself before
we get into the webinar my name is Ashok
and I have 20-plus years of experience
in the field of information technology
the last three and of years I've been
extensively on business analytics and
big data big data related things I've
been doing and I've done three four
projects in this primarily in the area
for a big data right from cleaning up
the bill data preparation data
transformation and data analytics using
our so I come from this background so
and I'm very very happy to be part of
this webinar and in the next one hour or
so I look forward to spend the time with
you and you know collectively it should
all strive to learn in this excellent
platform so thanks friends siletz
without further ado I just want to get
started on this webinar so thanks for
coming so let's get started so before I
just want to begin with our trivia what
is data visualization right what's your
opinion about data visualization I mean
we have a pretty attractive title if you
look at the you know dick it is our and
visualization match made in heaven right
of course we try to emphasize that you
know RS is a fantastic tool or to do
visualization it has got great interface
and fantastic tool and it's a
statistical statistical tool end of the
day but it is it provides very good
graphics so it's a fantastic tool
overall and of course it has its rivals
in
SAS and you know SP mm you know there
are few other tools available but you
know our is definitely leading the pack
here so can you tell me what according
to you its visualization why do we need
visualization can I ask you this
question ah ok I'm just reading list of
responses which I am seeing straight on
this so friends don't shy away just just
respond right ah no issues at all better
clarity of data less time consuming
better representation it's a kind of
report better represent the data right
there are a lot of versions coming up
now I'll just pause for another few
seconds to present the insides to
business okay better understanding the
data okay so thanks France yeah this is
good enough you know I just thought I'll
get the whole thing moving right so I
think let me give you a pretty old adage
right we all okay let me read out few
more collate large data sets into one
report visualization helps to infer
logical reasoning meaning out of data
wire insightful information visual cues
fantastic okay I was about to tell this
old adage do it ranjan has told that a
picture is worth a thousand words right
we all know this it's a pretty old
school of thought but still holds good
even today right something visual right
it really helps correct so if i'm going
to give some statistical algorithm right
i'm going to get the regression report
right i perform some linear regression
okay using our then i take it to the
shareholders meeting or you know i take
it to my senior execs right my
leadership let's say it's a it's a
stakeholder meeting is happening right I
just tell them okay here is that graph
here is the you know here is the date it
may not really fly well right you need
to talk the language of the business not
the technology correct so something
which it's in the visual medium it's
going to mean a lot
air right so you can actually talk sense
there it's not that you know we cannot
talk the data but the people who do not
come from the statistics background and
all that they may not be able to infer
anything out of this right say it is
better to talk you know the business
language and you know we can represent
that when our has got extensive facility
for visualization why not we use that
correct okay so um what is it use for I
just Oh what is it used for effective
communication of information right fine
and we need to clarify integrity you
know one is the data end you know if
there is a you know we need to provide
the clarity incorrect clarity is one
aspect stimulate viewer engagement okay
Ravi says my voice is not clear anybody
facing audio issues friends this may is
audio okay to everybody all right okay
okay thanks thanks i think Ravi and a
few of this I just want to say no if
there is any I mean there is an echo
okay sure so let me know if there is any
echo or any audio issues but
nevertheless you know I just want to go
on wisest breaking let me movie okay is
it better now talking bit louder and
more the microphone closer to my all
right thank you friends so it also it is
very insightful and we focus on
something which is very very effective
right we are focusing on the
effectiveness correct so I just want to
ask you one thing suppose you are given
two data sets right two data sets that
has identical value correct i am going
to show you know friends this is the
deck i will get into the our control
shortly correct so because there that's
where I want to spend the maximum moment
of time today right so you are given two
data sets for example find that has got
very very identical value you know those
final values right for you have this
median and you know 75th percentile 25th
percentile the statistics part of it
right if the final variables you know
find them values rather if they're all
the same let's assume that way correct
and and even the correlation right to
data sets the correlation everything is
the same correct so can we conclude the
data sets are similar that's my question
to you can we conclude that or no no
okay yes no I I okay all right there is
a mixed response so let's let's first
you know I before I get to the art
studio this is what I want to cover
friends today uh you know in this one
hour i'll try to cover as much as
possible video not available are should
be i mean are you talking would this
tech you are talking about the
presentation deck all right Soph let's
let me take up the questions towards the
end except the questions which i am
going to ask you right so i'll take up
the questions towards the end so that it
will help me to cover as much as
possible i try to cover as much as
possible here okay so um the agenda if
you look at it basic understanding of
data visualization as a field basic
advanced graphics change colors or using
use custom palettes graphical parameters
basics of grammar of graphics yes some
of this you know one of the basic things
and all that special you know we may not
touch on that because you put that but
you know it time if time permits I will
talk about that friends yeah okay so
what is data visualization you know I
just want to touch upon this before I
get to the art studio study off the
visual representation of data more than
pretty graphs because it's going to be a
lot more insightful give insights help
decision making accurate and truthful
you know we cannot give something you
know which is so just out of the back
correct so statistics why data
visualization is a phrase describing the
persuasive power of numbers particularly
particularly the use of statistics to
bolster weak argument correct so I mean
this is straightforward so data
visualization if you look at this right
if I'm going to take a report like this
correct it's very very hard to present
the facts are live along this part right
it's it's even very hard to figure out
what is exactly happening here right so
that's going to be challenging correct
so before I get to this slide I want to
take you through this part friends right
so this is what I was telling there are
okay I'm just giving you I am just
giving you this data set correct if you
look at it Anscombe is one of the data
set right if you take a look minimum
value first this is the median right
this is the third quadrant there's a
maximum this is C Phi Phi some what I
was telling fine on values correct this
is the final values right I can get the
summary and get the final value here
fine if I take a look at and score right
if I take a summary of this right I'm
getting the values this is the minimum
this is the first quartile ah this is
the this is the basically the 25th
percentile and this is my medium this is
my mean this is the 75th 200 this is the
maximum correct so if i look at this
summary y 1 I just take my one if you
look at it right it's not much of
difference between x1 and y1 racket it
looks pretty similar it looks pretty
similar and if I want to take a
correlation of that similarly I can do
for x2 and I can do for y2 as well
correct I can do for way to as well if I
try to see the correlation here right if
I try to see the correlation you see
this it's pretty high so what does this
indicate French point eight one what
does this indicate any any takers here
for this question
strongly correlated correct strongly
correlated eighty-one percent fantastic
Creek sits it's a very positive
correlation correct so if I do this if I
if I are similarly if I do this it's
again any one person correct so but if I
try to actually plot this right this is
where you see the difference right let's
say that you know I want to plot this in
this designated area correct if I see
this plot you can actually see does this
look similar friends x1 and x2 here x1
x2 you saw the you know it looked very
similar write x1 y1 and all that but see
one thing is the values appear quite
random over here fine and the other one
looks like a hyperbola right this looks
like a hyperbola right my point is if
your although x1 y1 and x2 y2 have a
very very similar correlation correct
summary values and everything just going
by the summary front function could be
highly deceptive right could be highly
deceptive so data visualization it gives
a different picture and it's far more it
dude him or y'all clear friends are you
clear so in in other words it is very
essential it is become a mandatory step
for someone to you know have this
visualization because even if you do the
big data analytics any any kind of
analytics today to talk about we the one
of the last stage this is the whole
thing is the visualization so we take it
till that point right so analytics mix
taking all the way to you know right
from the data preparation data cleansing
and all those things all the way till
visualization okay so uh I hope you are
all clear with what I mentioned so let
let's just move on to the second part
right let's move on to the second part
okay this is something you know again if
you look at this empty
is one of the data sets correct one of
the data sets and here the red you see
you know it has got various attributes
here right as part of the empty cars but
if you look at this red presence and
negative correlation where is the blue
presidency positive correlation correct
so this is the car Graham library is
something you know that helps to
interpret the correlation with advanced
option that makes it easy to interpret
correct so i'm going to i'm just going
to load this friends in our i'm going to
load this so let me simply do this okay
look at this let me zoom this okay this
is what i have right this is what i have
let me zoom this okay now this is empty
casas my a data set here fine so I want
to ask this team you know the group here
right so I have a bunch of things so one
of the important attribute of an analyte
of an analyst or someone who is going to
do right who is going to do this right
because one of the key things one has to
possess is to analyze the data correct
data analyst means you need to spot out
the outliers you need to spot where the
data is going wrong right you need to
spot out you know where the data can be
fixed because data preparation data
analysis steric be even before you come
into that data cleansing all those
things it's one of the key aspects which
is there in your data science correct so
I want to ask you in general what can
you make out I mean can you provide some
insights because you know we have been
telling lot of things about this is
insightful correct so I told you read
this negative correlation and bluest
positive correlation find stronger shade
means stronger correlation for example
this is a stronger shade compact
to this right and lighter shipments
weaker correlation negative a week
negative correlation write something
something like this correct so friends
this is definitely intuitive so can you
tell me from this diagram right which
two variables have the weakest negative
correlation can you tell me just take a
closer look at the you know this diagram
HP gear look at this friends this is a
very weak correlation right HP gear
exactly yes and what about WD weight and
Cusick correct even this is weak I mean
there are weaker ones too yeah what
about strong strong positive correlation
prints strong positive correlation this
is clearly coming out right cycle this
correct exactly lot of people are saying
that and what about this one discipline
wait correct these are all a positive
correlation right very strong so this is
definitely useful when you are
presenting to an audience who do not
have statistical background or other
ways otherwise you can use things like
scatter plot and all that right if you
are coming from you know that back room
so important point to remember in
visualization or has lot of fancy things
to offer so we should also present we
should avoid presenting something that
is not understandable over all right
correct so of thanks French I hope you
found this to be a good start so let's
more on I just want to close this guy
just a second let's more so i just want
we'll see what else is coming here basic
graphics basic graphs here pie chart
never use them okay scatter plot always
use them line graph linear trend bar
graphs winner when are they better than
line graphs
write it sunflower pod rut plot density
plot histograms boss box plots so all
these are various things available so
friends you know instead of showing it
here i will show it directly in our
story yeah but you know i just want to
skim through this deck um just a minute
so let's let's go to the are fine
straight away just give me a minute see
whether I just a second
so let's try okay ah before that let me
take a look at the question window
question window yeah and somebody is
asking r is a linux-based no i'm running
praveen i'm running are in windows right
now it has got mac and other versions as
well so villachor says what is the
different difference between reporting
to like tableau correct oh because
completely agreed tableau also has
fantastic graphs I have used it
personally so it has got fantastic
graphs but it's not a you know open
source correct it is not open source r
is correct even SAS is not open source
for for the people who are following
this right SAS is not open source either
correct so let me go here that's the oh
that's the only difference maker says
that's one of the major differences yes
r is free guys ok because it's tavolo
also has developed public okay i am not
too sure about that ah that is free is
it okay um I'm not too sure because but
you know but our is completely open
source and I don't know tableau is great
for graphics it has got fantastic
visuals visualization but the level of
statistical analysis what we what you
can do in our I am not sure whether w
provides that double O has very cool
graphics and all that cannot be obtained
in tableau runge insist I mean he should
stay in straightaway right it doesn't
have the statistical support correct
right tableau public is free but knows
data security correct that's right
that's reference thanks thanks for
giving the answers as well yeah so I'm
I'm taking another data set called you
know empty cars fine so must say if i
look at this simple scatter plot let's
try this right let's try this simple
scatter plot right so this is the one
which we saw just now right empty cars
we saw the relation
see how things are not right how things
are not correct so this is how it looks
and we can also okay there is a
Christian friends just give me a minute
is it easy to integrate our with other
platforms like Java oh you can Aris
friends or is so easy to integrate i am
not sure but see the way i have used
i'll tell you because I have done
analysis using you know java program you
know i have done big data all those
things analytics right I pull the data
then I got into the are but it I did
some price you know measured the demand
elasticity of various products correct
of the various products then using some
regression techniques then put the data
on do you know I i was able to write the
data directly stone with the data on to
how do i can read the data and write an
all those things using our that's
possible correct yes we have a package
or java it might be that's right run
john young so uh the lighting directly
connect but we're ranjan is correct
there is a are java package correct so
you can use that and lot of people are
also using a python can all be
integrated with matlab not so sure i'm
not used matlab but or can be integrated
with you know SAS or can be integrated
with SAS so they've got connectors for
even says so matlab probably yes sir be
because lot of these guys are you know
how the different vendors are giving ah
their own flavors of our so it is
becoming more and you know people are
don't want to work inside low so they
are providing different ways to connect
with rival products including sass right
so that's the way the world is going so
I'm sure they may have connectivity they
may have an integration factor here
right now let's try this uh you know
I'll try
this 3d part right I'll try the 3d part
let's see how this looks like right so
uh if you look at this the 3d part right
this is a you know 3d this is a library
we are using three variables wait and
this is the miles per gallon and disp we
draw you can see this weight on the
x-axis and miles per gallon on the y
axis and this piece another parameter
right so that is on the z-axis ok
correct so can someone help interpret
this plot can someone help interpret
this this one take a look at it
lower the weight okay okay lower the
weight higher the miles per gallon okay
Irish writer says that anybody else
friends
more the weightless okay it's just the
opposite all right
okay so the other option you know we can
also draw something called a best hitch
line right so that gives so if this is
what I've done earlier this is what was
you know if you any outliers here can
you spot it out friends there are no
place as well as such but if you draw a
best-fit line right it becomes little
easier to interpret here right it
becomes little easier because that's
what we try to do we draw best fit line
so that it becomes little more easier
correct there are no outlay oestrogen
assess this data set is fairly clean say
if I do just a minute I'm just using
another sepiol is another iris is a
terror set let me try this I'm just
plotting this iris and just give me a
minute I just want to see what else okay
so this is sameer scatter plot and look
at this board lot
so we can actually in the in the
scenario actual scenario we can have
different plots we collectively seek
recommendation and stick to a particular
particular plot which ever see because
there are range of plots that are
available in our right so you can do a
horizontal plot you can do a line chart
you can do you know do a scatter plot so
by default what r does right or
understands and renders the broad based
on the type of the data anytime rule
thumb rule dungeon you know it purely
depends on the business scenario right
so we can have different plots how it
typically happens in an organization
runs in it's like you know we all you
know most of the analyst right they may
have you know something which is closer
to their business needs i'm giving a
very generic one but this is a reality
i'm telling you because we all try to
see which is which comes closer
something you know which can visually
explain what they are up to right then
that means are you know they they go
over the consensus you know what what
looks better for them correct so that's
how it is typically done and look at
this
by table this is again you know I am
taking a species these two three are a
different species of flowers right this
is a data set setosa is one thing so
friends can you all ma audible now I'm
hearing some noise in the background
hello
can hear you well there is a noise
coming out okay yeah okay sure I hope
then our noise goes off sure i'll
continue correct so this setosa I'm
sorry this this particular part right if
i zoom it this is a typical pie chart
right it's a pie chart so where do we
generally use pie chart friends any
guesses here where do we generally use
to show percentage distribution okay all
right and see the species here
dimensions are less exactly number of
variables are low absolutely correct
right limited distribution of
percentages see I cannot have 20
different slices of pie right that
person look good diagrammatically and
also visually that doesn't make sense
right so species here species is the one
you know which I'm trying to portray
here is a categorical variable right
that's not a numerical one that has got
setosa virginica and particular versi
kilmer correct three things three
categories are there this generates
occurrences of different species correct
so if I look at this yeah I as you all
right we pointed out right I do not have
I do not get into the pie chart if the
value star if there are too many values
it works best when it works with like
five labels or less than that right less
observations overall otherwise the
slicing of the data will be too hard to
comprehend that otherwise it will be too
cluttered or y'all with me strength so
far this is one thing yeah thank you
let's go a little more further let's
look at the histogram here
let me zoom this okay so this actually
creates 20 buckets in the x-axis right
that's what I gave here threat just a
second let me come back here I gave
places 20 buckets correct and 20 buckets
in the x-axis so so far we have seen
different plots histograms and all right
so we have lot of options it's important
to note which one is actually required
so friends this is like you know
histogram signifies the frequency here
right it gives the frequency
distribution correct
let me give the density plot mr. second
let me sorry friends this is a second
okay let me do a box plot this gives you
a more insightful one okay when the
bricks will be used and for what when
the bricks will be used some time coming
to the question I'll come to the
question so friends can you all you know
looking at the box plot right looking at
the box plot can if you are familiar if
you're familiar with this right do you
know what are these things what is this
dark line and what are these things this
line at the bottom line at the top yeah
so ranjan is able to say how would
others are all familiar with this this
is a maximum value this is a minimum
value right minimum value maximum value
here is the mean median this is a final
exactly correct correct so
so this is one way of looking at the
plot correct so if you look at the
density plot right just now we were
saying that density plot if you look at
it let me zoom this let me zoom this so
here we have the probability coming in
the x-axis correct coming the x-axis and
6 has the highest probability if you see
so what is the behavior appearing under
the curve friends what is the area
appearing under the curve can you all
tell me awesome okay our friends can you
just just hang on for a second let me
just fix this or it's too much of noise
at my end just a minute just bear with
me I'm going to mute you for this one
ok friends I think let's continue i
think i am not getting the number so it
is one runs in has told the right answer
so let's just warm from here so get to
few more things here let's say i'm going
to give you know i'm going to get into
the customization aspect right off we
have a what i'm going to do is I'm going
to you know this one is going to divide
the plot area by three rows and 2
columns whatever i'm putting in here and
there are we have six plots all together
it's going to come together correct so I
am using heat color right i am using
different heat colors here which is
nothing but the color palette correct so
it uses 10 difference in this case right
there are 10 different colors let's look
at examples here right so if i say this
right if i say this look at this this is
how it looks right let's look at a few
more
okay look at few more it has the
variation of all this this uses
something called color terrain right and
this is color dopo look at the you know
the colors right it has a different
variation here and this is again another
one this is the another one this is the
another room okay now I want to try to
change the heat colors and show you the
difference here correct so instead of
saying ten right I'm going to use you
know here the heat colors number of heat
colors that are used is 10 in this case
it is seven again here it is 7 8 10 8
and all that if i use only fire you will
actually see 1 2 3 4 5 and the number
you know the color gets repeated right
the color gets repeated correct so um
again if I use this this one this is the
difference i want to point out you
if I put everything together I'm trying
to see how would it look just a second
okay let me zoom this unsure difference
this is a rainbow
so do you just a fundamental question to
this to this crowd right do you find
this colors insightful do you find this
I mean I know it is very colorful
because i use rainbow right so do you
find this because you know we can I told
you how we can change the color right
the color what to say the heat color
right the heat color I used a different
palette and showed you correct so this
is very colorful you can change the
colors and run it again you know I can
use any combination there correct so I
can use a five and I can use a 10 you
know how many number of heat colors I
want to do I can use right so the color
scheme is basically getting changed
correct color scheme it's getting change
now do what is the I mean did you find
this insightful Prince that's what I
want to know no visual cues okay visual
I guess not in this case just you know
because I know this is one of the let me
give you one other thing how about this
how about this friends how would fish
are here not very pleasing okay let me
you know because uh what about this
sorry
let me execute this correct so let me
zoom this friends okay now you tell me
here is my heap color 10 correct this is
my terrain color this is to poo this is
CM color okay and this is got a
different heat color here okay and this
is got rainbow now if you were the
analyst right you are the person which
one would you pick
okay one with more colors terrain heat
colors terrain colors okay lot of people
are saying okay one thing that is
clearly coming out from this class right
from this team of people is like you
know nobody's choosing a topo because
it's very bright there are few takers
for rainbow but generally not correct
and nobody is choosing this as well
right yeah there are few takers are
colors make any difference in this case
actually runs in I'll come to that
shortly so we are you know especially
when you're considering the colors it is
very essential that you know the color
combinations are carefully chosen
otherwise it's going to get into a huge
you know it has to be visually appealing
because it's a visual medium correct so
it has to be visually appealing and
enriching as well so uh let me execute
something else and she tou important for
first appearance why is top or not good
shaken is us no topo you know it is too
bright chicken right
correct so dope boy has got too many
color combinations see it looks colorful
that's all right it looks very colorful
but but is this the one which you want
to consider it looks too what to say to
gaudy here right we can different color
but for the same value we can have
definitely safe correct so that's what
we are trying to say here there are
different representation of different
colors here right so look at this
terrain colors this looks definitely
better than this because you know this
red and all those things right people
wouldn't you know you don't want to see
such a dark color coming in the
presentation and all that correct that's
right so and again this looks different
this looks too colorful again very jazzy
this is you know a lot of people who you
know have expressed this as one of the
choices and this says well okay correct
okay so what I am not done with my point
yet what is the takeaway for analyst as
if they take away I'll come to the
Nassif I'll come to that very shortly
right i will show you something some
other library there are various
libraries to portray the colors correct
so let's try to change the you know
let's see some some other package i'm
gonna use color brewer correct so i take
this and get done
tell my friends now tell me what is your
choice I'll come to the what should be
here what should be the takeaway for an
analyst from the visual aspect so can
you all tell me gray greens ok that is
the I think most of you are saying that
right now now you understand correct
gray and the Greens now tell me friends
ok that's apparently the correct choice
why would you pick for grain greens just
because it is mind or what is the
rationale behind the selection the
pattern the gradient right the variation
is clearly visible not frustrating
exactly easy to read correct sequence
right there are lot of things coming out
right gradient the color is easy to read
shows diminishing values correct
readability I think you already know
what i should of what i was trying to
say see as a rule of thumb friends you
know there is nobody can you know really
say that you know you can use this color
and all that as a rule of thumb we
should avoid dark shades or the ones
that are quite gaudy right we are going
to avoid that next thing visualization
actually looks great in light shades and
more professional as well right we know
that's true and the this one right if
you look at this it looks great
especially the set you know this one it
looks very loud right step 13 looks very
loud ideally when you're presenting
these charts to the leadership or you
know any important meeting it is
important to have the choice of colors
that shows the degree of professionalism
you will choose one parent color right
one parent color could be anything it
can be green or it can be black anything
the rest of the colors will have the
shades of these colors correct friends
the rest of them will have shades of
these colors correct that that makes it
really cool right in the color brewer
life
you all said it's going to be you know
the gray shade on this right so my point
is like you know there are you know you
when I mentioned you know this was this
was when you know that the the whole
thing got snapped right you should
choose a parent color the other color
should be the shades of that color right
and and and I saw a couple of questions
like you know if there is a danger or
anything right we should choose red
correct I mean those things you know you
need to be aware of what you're choosing
so that's quite important correct so
that's very very important like you know
if you're choosing danger you know you
know what to choose and you know you you
have to be very clear on what you're
choosing and all that same time you also
need to be because we are talking from
the global perspective you also need to
be very clear with what you are you know
sometimes the red here in India means
you know if you are talking about that
presentation in Middle East or you know
in Europe things may completely you know
they have a different perspective right
so you need to be aware of the culture
right coming back to the coming to the
colors right you need to know the
culture as well you know and what
represents what and all that so you need
to be very conscious about those things
correct so I am can you integrate high
chart with our I am not used to throne
hi chut but hi chod escort fantastic
graphics i've used tied shirt with the
you know i am not used it with the are
but i've used it with with java with.net
you know those kind of things right you
can do that but maybe it is possible i
am not seeing that you know hide shot
with are you know you have various
variants right today thrown like you
have high chance you have zoom shirts
there's so many things available and
they all can connect to your zoom charts
in fact it can connect to different data
sources it can connect to hadoop it can
connect to a Mongo you know different
data sources it can connect to so there
is another cushion if the graph is
printed
black and white one color with the
shaded will be good and not much thicker
less correct that's right killing her
yeah so generally you know we take a you
know this one it gives a very
progressive outlook starting from white
and you know it's like a almost like a
gray shade and now the gray is getting
thicker and thicker all the way to black
and this also gives a very professional
touch right starting all the way from
you know how it came to the dark gray so
you're able to clearly make out what is
exactly happening here right so uh so
you all get what I said so let me just
show one lasting friends I think a lot
of things which we have covered here
whatever is mentioned here right basic
graphs histogram west seeker and all
that right so i'll even with no no as if
says what is a okay let me go back as if
as if my point is no let me load it
again as if one one last time sure so my
point is if thing is having different
colors for same value no it is not going
to be different colors right i mean same
value what I'm saying is this is
different from this this is different
from this so it is quite a giver you
know I can have variance color variants
but my parent color if i'm going to have
even if it is red right if i'm going to
have shades of red for the other colors
it it will look lot more professional
and insightful compared to these kind of
things right look at this this looks
like you know it's going to come and hit
someone right this is like way too dark
and even this one so this one is quite
pleasing because you know you're just
seen the seeing the shades of green as
if does it make sense to you of course I
mean you're asking which one represents
what you know I have not defined the you
know this is my x-axis this is my y-axis
right I have done that but at the same
time you can put to put your own values
there are other libraries you can use as
well you can put what
what and all that you're able to put
those what is axis values right clearly
so that way it is going to that way it's
going to be more intuitive and more you
know you need to put what is the label
and all that you are probably looking
for the label but label you can always
mention that clearly where which should
come where and all that correct okay we
also have 3d charters package that's
right in fact friends how many of you
have heard about there is a package
called shiny have you all heard about it
okay yes no runs answer is yes so if you
just type shiny da da studio right like
for example right if I simply say you
know it's a it's basically a our package
right so shiny are shiny or is actually
a package and our is very powerful and
very very popular as well because it
provides lot of cool features and
visualization correct more importantly
you know it is free I mean anything free
will attract people it is good for a
demo dashboard you know as well as for
an end product as well you know it's
good for those things she assume you
completed a visualization project let's
assume it that way right you want to
give an interactive interface to the
clear to your prospective clients or
your customers right or even your
leadership your senior leadership you
just want them to play around with what
you've done if you're you know you can
you can just give them like you know you
can give them the shiny interface right
you can they can simply play around with
that so it's a specialization by itself
when you want to share it with your
friends or you know fo for any community
you can simply provide the IP address
after the development is done you can
just give it a shot but you can type
shiny da da studio com right you can
give it a shot at your end whenever you
know you find time fine so you can
it is a kind of interactive dashboard or
throat correct lot of things are there
in the shiny part just give it a shot so
meanwhile I want to finish one last
thing you know because i thought you
know there was a break so I really so
let let me take you through the spatial
of analysis so there is a just before
that I'll just uh just a second friends
I want to use the library raster yeah
and whenever you want to present the
data in a map format right anything
which is in a very geographical format
right it becomes you know especially
when you're showing it in as a global
thing you know in a map like format
right because these things are becoming
more essential in this in today's world
right so I can give something like you
know to get the data function to find
the altitude right I can do something
like you know I get data I can give just
me a minute I can say let's say country
just a second is equal to India ok so
now if I do a you know art what's
happening stimulus
okay raster layer is coming mean
something so I want to provides
information if I want to do what is in
the aisle right I'm looking I'll until
to correct say it gives me some four
slots and all that so I just want to
plot it just give me one second Prince
just want to plot it um just put a 1
comma 1 yes it does come in now so just
look at this correct so see the green
one provides the high altitude right the
green one provides the high altitude the
red or lesser shade right it gives the
lesser altitude I just uh you know the
way you know because the ultimate
altitudes scale is right at the right
hand side correct so if i want to give
you know go to the state right if i want
to go to the state I I can go a step for
their I can go even further just a
minute so I can say something like sorry
city wise city with population yes so I
can go to different levels throne that's
right countries India just a minute and
I just want a pretty okay now look you
know it says what are all the things
available chattisgarh right so i can put
it as a table okay this list of states
right and
give this I just want to tape our prime
ministers radio ok what is sorry name
one it should become a sorry subset of
this ok can anyone help me here why is
there a syntax error good you're not
sorry that doesn't matter i can give any
name here so that's a variable subset of
this and this is gujarat this is all i'm
saying it says unexpected ok ok so
that's I think I love I'm not getting
into this adobe analytics we can
visualizations or greater using SAS
tableau a chief is asking by any chance
can you use this ok or double equal to
I'll try
okay thank you oh that is a double equal
to right there thanks thanks Santa oh
let me try this gujarat okay look at
this friends okay
I can would we you know I can go to
different levels go to the cities as
their own asked me a while back right so
I can make it you know something which
is from the geographical point of view I
can make it a lot more insightful like
and and I can you know it's just naughty
I'm just showing you India there are so
many you know I can take all the 190
countries also right I can similarly
there oh if I do some other country
right you know let it be us canada i can
do anything here it's it's quite good
that way you know it's for spatial
analysis which is a very specialized
field by itself what we are seeing is
you know we just scratch the surface
here so so many things here most see
there are this technique is especially
applied you know spatial analysis to
structure you know a human scale
especially the analysis of geographic
data so complex issues arise in this
kind of analysis many of which are you
know are clearly not defined or
completely resolved but from the basis
for current research so you can do lot
of things in this lot of possibilities
so frets I think I pretty much whatever
I plan to cover sorry about the
technical glitch and the interruption
that really messed up our you know our
use our smooth session otherwise any
useful link where we can get information
on spatial analysis shanta actually oh I
can tell you that you know you can I
mean you can find the help most of the
help i would recommend you to get it
from the are itself from the are itself
just if you already have the art studio
up and running correct so you can simply
use that you know you can just put her I
mean you can use the help on that I
think that is the best thing I use then
you know you can always google it you
know for any kind of because our
community as you all know it is not you
know it is got a very powerful community
as
but it is patronized by different
several people in the community so it's
it's you can you can definitely find
help shanta if if you don't find it in
our studio most likely you will
otherwise you can always go to that yeah
so any questions friends any questions
you have in whatever we cover so I
didn't even go to the deck much because
I thought you know this is where we
should be spending more time can we
create dashboard in our like in tableau
absolutely moment you can see Muhammad
what I want to convey here is a tableau
tableau is like you know it is very very
very rich visual interface no doubt
about that correct see it is more you
know I would say if you people who use
tableau because one of my previous
organization they were also using
tableau but they used are for
statistical analysis and to enrich some
of the graphics right they took it to
develop as the final you know visual a
source for them to show the final
visuals visualization done they used
tableau towards the end correct but
whatever visual visualization which you
saw in our you know it is quite
fascinating oh definitely double oh you
know if you tell me from the
visualization because i have seen da
blow as well i've used it so I can say
that both of them are you know quite
good and you know r is more expansive
meaning it can also do statistical
analysis and you can link it up to the
visualization like what like some of the
samples what we have seen there are so
many other graphs you have and even for
the color brewer is one of the libraries
I showed there are so many things you
can do customization yes Roger yeah so
many things you can do you can do so
many plot so many graphs so many you
know histograms all that's all sorts of
things you can do correct and it's open
source that's the best part and tableau
you know you can't do all this
statistical part you know and some
people you know they use Python to do
the regression and all that that's see
if there is a competition for in the
area of statistics I think it's going to
be you know python and
what to say Oh sass right SAS is again
not open source but SAS has got
fantastic support and all that it can do
pretty much war what are can do but i
would say RSU open source you know that
has the charm and you know in the
overall race is definitely ahead and
it's going to because it is taught in
most of the universities because most of
the guys you know come from the you know
people who opted for engineering you
know they definitely will study
statistics and you know RS used then and
there and most of them are familiar with
are right so even in this team in this
group of learners I'm finding a lot of
people are already familiar maybe some
of you are working in that but
nevertheless I'm saying lot of people
are familiar with our so that is a
welcome step correct so any any other
question friends I think we are like 10
21 because of the technical glitch i
think we went over the time just a quick
customizing graphs you can do
customizing who can do you can give
different colors and all that right you
can give different colors boxplot i can
choose her if i give background as
yellow we can do this is what we saw
color blue air and all that right
advanced grabs you can do advanced
graphics creek do you know happy groups
praveen you want to mention that what is
that ok Praveen says please make a class
on that ok sure premier if we are
definitely i'll keep Eddie raker posted
on this haplogroups is it possible to
export charts PDF yes you can store it
the Kalinga you can do that
you can do that any other questions
friends with snapshot data I want make
haplogroups sure praveen i'll i'll keep
that you know i don't have much of
insight about what you're asking but
allah will probably let the iterator
know this sure okay alright thanks so
friends can you share the deck culling
sure killing an order I think you may
want to check with a direita because i'm
just using the deck as well so they are
the persons to answer this question so i
think definitely you you you would like
to check with them coalinga yeah please
check with them on this good night
friends and again sorry about the
technical glitch you know that really
gave a kind of you know it took the flow
stop the flow briefly so good that we
could resume so glad about that so
friends thank you so much thanks for
being very attentive and i request one
last thing before you drop off for any
email ad any questions friends you can
write to the ad wrecker support you know
because i don't want to be a you know
bottleneck in anything right because
what is your priority i may not be
looking at may not be knowing your
priority right so please write to Eddie
wrecker support they will they're more
than happy to help you here plus I also
have one last thing please provide your
feedback when I close the session I want
you to provide the feedback right so be
very very candid in your thoughts and
all those things so it's going to help
us really help you know refine the
course content or beat anything right
it's going to help us and you know in a
long way thank you so much thanks
