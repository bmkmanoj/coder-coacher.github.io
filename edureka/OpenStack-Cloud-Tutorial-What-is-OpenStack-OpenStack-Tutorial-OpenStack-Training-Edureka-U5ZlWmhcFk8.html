Eureka and in today's session we'll be
learning about
OpenStack cloud thank you all the
attendees for joining today's session if
you can all hear me properly please drop
me a confirmation on the chat window so
that I can get started okay so Suman
says yes Jasmine says yes and I've got a
confirmation from the others as well so
let's get started so let us look at the
topics that we'll be learning today that
first I'll tell you about cloud
computing virtualization concepts so
that you are very clear when I talk
about OpenStack cloud after that I'll
tell you about the different cloud
services and different types of cloud
will learn what is OpenStack and we'll
also take a look at the OpenStack
architecture we'll also see the
OpenStack community and different
OpenStack cloud deployment models and
finally I'll tell you how to set up your
OpenStack infrastructure by taking you
through the OpenStack cloud design guide
so is the agenda clear to everyone ok so
someone says yes Jasmine says yes Mahesh
says yes so let us now begin with the
first topic which is cloud computing
virtualization now we're talking about
cloud services but what is actually a
cloud and how is it created you must
know all of these prerequisite things if
you are trying to actually build your
own cloud infrastructure with OpenStack
so when you're setting up cloud the
first thing you need is basic hardware
so now there are bare metal servers
running somewhere around the world so
what you do on top of this bare metal
servers is that there is a layer of
hypervisors now you can use any kind of
hypervisors for virtualization purpose
like VMware then hyper-v kzm etc so what
this hypervisors does is that they
enable virtualization now with
virtualization what you can do is that
you can split up the computing capacity
or the server capacity of your server
which is your bare metal server or your
basic hardware
okay so someone is asking what is a
hypervisor so well someone a hypervisor
as I was telling is this can be either a
software or a hardware that enables
virtualization okay so this is what we
use to set up a virtual environment this
can be termed as a virtual machine
monitor so it runs on the host machine
so the machine where you install your
hypervisor is called your host machine
and on top of that you can install
different guest operating systems which
can be termed as virtual machines so
does that answer your question someone
okay so she says yes so like I was
telling you you can use hypervisors for
virtualization purpose and what
virtualization actually means here is
that this is the logical partitioning of
your computing capacity of your server
your bare metal servers or your basic
hardware okay so let's say that I have
got one server and I want to launch
three instances and instances here are
nothing but they are virtual machines so
they might be of different operating
systems or they all can be a boon to
machines maybe one of them is a Red Hat
machine the other ones are Windows it
can be like that also so if you want
three different environments based on
just one Hardware you can do that what
you have to do is that you have to
enable virtualization to create logical
partitions well however this can also be
done in the alternate way let's say that
you have got three servers and you want
to perform some high computing that
needs a lot of processing power so let's
say that you're working on something
that needs a lot of processing power so
you are actually taking three Hardware
servers and you were enabling
virtualization to create only one
instance so that it has a lot of
computing power so you can do that with
virtualization as well and if you want
to give me a virtualization example that
you can relate to I'll tell you that you
can consider your laptop or your
computer which you are actually working
on right now so what it has is that it
has a basic hard-disk right but what
happens is that when you open up your
computer you see that
they are divided into different local
disk you have got your local this c d e
f so these are nothing but
virtualization that enables logical
partitioning but actually in your
computer there is just one hard disk so
this is a very good example of
virtualization that you all can relate
to so now what happens is that this are
the consumer these are the people who
actually wants to use services so what
they do is that they make a request to
the IT department and this IT department
is responsible for maintaining and for
support of this cloud infrastructure so
what they do is they maintain the metal
servers they main in the hypervisors and
the instances that are launched on top
of it so the consumer makes you request
to the IT department and the IT
department somewhere here as an admin so
what the admin does is that admin takes
a look at the request and approves it if
it meets all their need and finally the
consumer gets all the available
instances or whatever you requested
after the admin approve so this is how
you actually avail child services in
real life and when I'm talking about
availing cloud services what actually
happens and how it actually connects to
everything I'm going to tell you right
now so this is the consumer again that
makes your request to the cloud and
somewhere over here the admin is there
so basically what the consumer wants are
computing resources so the admin who is
actually managing the entire cloud
infrastructure approves and gives them
access to the computer resources and the
use southbound api s-- so the southbound
API is are used to connect different
layers in the cloud service stack so the
api's connect you with the compute
resources on which you can work on you
can develop your applications on and
some more southbound ApS are used for
storage purpose now this part can be
termed as your hardware part because
eventually everything gets stored in a
hardware right so this is the abstract
pool of storage resources and these are
all connected using API s and they can
use both southbound and northbound
api's for different purposes but while
they're connecting new to it they're
using southbound api's that connects the
top layer to the bottom layer is the
slide clear to everyone any questions
okay no questions so now let us move
forward and take a look at the different
cloud services so this is the cloud
service stack that you see so on top of
this that is the data application
runtime middleware operating system
virtualization server storage networking
so the bottom three layers can be
actually termed as your hardware your
servers your storage your networking for
networking you might be using devices
like routers or switches for storage you
might be using disk and bare metal
servers and on top of that there comes
the virtualization file your hypervisor
is part then on top of that you can
install an operating system there can be
different middleware like rabid mq or
JDBC so middleware are nothing but their
computer software that provides service
to software applications beyond those
that are available from the operating
system so this can be the middleware can
be actually termed as a software glue
and it enables communication and
management of data in distributed
applications okay and a very good
example are the rabbit MQ or JDBC these
are very good examples of middleware and
in run time you have different
software's like data recovery software
products etc and on finally on top of
that this is the application that you
have this is going to be your
application or maybe some other software
or application that might be running on
your cloud infrastructure and finally
the data that you use in your
application so this is a basic cloud
service stack so we'll take a look more
about it when I tell you about the
different infrastructures ok ok so now
we will take a look at infrastructure a
service platform a service and software
service ok so when you have
infrastructure a service this is the
same cloud service tag that I just
talked about so
when you were availing infrastructure
service from your cloud vendor or your
cloud provider so what happens is that
this part the networking storage service
and virtualization part is completely
handled by your cloud vendor and after
that when the cloud vendor sets up these
things it gives you the basic hardware
and the hypervisors and after that this
is something that you should manage you
can actually install your own operating
system middleware runtime applications
and data and OpenStack actually provides
you with infrastructure a service
similarly in platform the service the
cloud Thunder provides the util done
time it gives you all the services that
you need for run time starting from the
hardware to virtualization you can also
request your own operating system
they'll give you that the required
middlewares the runtime software and
after that you can just launch your
applications on it and a good example of
platform as service is also AWS when AWS
can also be an infrastructure as service
but you can also request it as a
platform a service to develop your
applications on and finally there is
software service now in software service
almost everything is managed by the
cloud vendor itself the application is
also run by the cloud vendor itself all
you have to manage is the data in it now
all the Google services the Gmail that
you use can be termed as software so if
you using the software the application
is running on their server you're just
managing the data on there so when
you're availing these services from the
cloud vendor there is a pure abstraction
customers do not need to worry about the
servers or anything the cloud vendor
manages all by themselves
and you can just focus on running your
application on it because that is why
you need a cloud infrastructure right so
any doubts about infrastructure service
platform a service or software service
shall I move on ok so let's move on
and take a look at the types of cloud
okay now there can be broadly three
types of cloud we can have a public
cloud a private cloud or a hybrid cloud
so let us take a look at them one by one
so let's see what is a public cloud so
this is you who is trying to access to a
public cloud and this is your service
provider cloud this is the public cloud
that is managed by a cloud provider or a
cloud vendor so what you have to do is
you have to go through their firewalls
these are all the security protocols so
there would be authentication when you
try to go through the firewall to access
the cloud infrastructure so what happens
in a public cloud so let's say this is
you who is trying to access resources
that is present in the public cloud so
this is the cloud that is managed by
your cloud provider or your cloud vendor
and you are trying to access service
from it and there is the firewall so if
you want to go through the firewall you
have to go through a certain
authentication processes to avail all
the resources so you have to go through
the firewall and there you'll find all
the instances that you want to use that
is on the other side of the firewall so
all the instances and all the security
protocols are all defined by your
service cloud provider or your cloud
vendor that you want to access so
everything is just there you just have
to go through an authentication process
by services in order to do that and
avail all the resources so everything in
a public cloud is managed by your cloud
vendor and you can only available on
there and again a very good example are
Microsoft Azure or AWS so they are
public cloud infrastructures now let us
take a look at a private cloud now what
happens in a private cloud is that it is
an on-premises cloud if you're running a
big enterprise and you don't want to
rely on a different cloud vendors what
you can do is that you can set up your
own cloud and obviously that's why we're
using OpenStack and OpenStack is widely
used for that purpose only for setting
up cloud infrastructure
enterprises so this is your on-premises
cloud infrastructure and you have got
all the instances available to you but
to protect it from vulnerability from a
public network you also have to set up a
firewall okay so this is your private
cloud that is completely inside your own
network and you have to find a firewall
so that people from outside about this
network cannot access it unless they're
authorized to do it and finally there is
hybrid cloud so as the name goes it is a
mixture of a public and private cloud so
let's say that this is your on-premises
cloud infrastructure or this is your own
private cloud and you want to access
some of the public cloud services as
well let's say that you're running
production on your on-premises cloud but
for development or testing purpose you
want resources that are present on a
cloud infrastructure let's say that
you're running your production on your
on-premises cloud or on your private
cloud but for your development and
testing purpose you want resources from
a public cloud so what you can do is
that he can set up the secure VPN tunnel
and this is a virtual private network
tunnel now this is very secure that you
can set up to connect your own
permissions private cloud to a public
cloud and create your own secure hybrid
cloud and you can also actually move
instances from your public cloud onto
your private cloud or from your private
to your public cloud through your secure
VPN tell'em and these security protocols
can be purely defined by you so that you
have full control over who can access
this data and that it is fully secure
when you're transferring data from a
private to public or from public to your
private clouds so these were the types
of cloud a brief overview of a public
cloud private cloud and hybrid cloud
okay so Vikram is asking which is
private and public in this okay so this
service provider clouds this is your
public cloud and on-premises cloud this
is your private cloud over here and make
sure of this a little bit of this a
little bit of that actually you can
create a secure
with cloud and you can make a connection
between these two class by creating a
secure VPN tunnel and create your own
secure hybrid cloud so is that clear to
you
Vikram okay any example yeah of course I
just gave you an example but I will
repeat it again
so on-premises cloud is your own cloud
infrastructure that you set up within
your company's infrastructure this is
your on-premises cloud your data centers
lie in your own premises or in your own
company and you have set up your own
cloud infrastructure but let's say that
I'm using a software and I'm only using
this private cloud for my deployment
purpose of my application when the
actual development and the actual
testing are taking place on an AWS cloud
infrastructure okay so for that when I
want to deploy that I need to transfer
all the data from the development
environment from the testing environment
into my on-premises cloud or into my
private cloud right so that I can deploy
it but there might be sensitive data
that I don't want anyone to access it so
that's why in order to transfer from my
AWS to my on-premises cloud what I'll do
is that I'll set up a secure VPN tunnel
now this is my own virtual private
network so I'll define my own security
protocols according to my data or
according to my company policies and a
mixture of these two will actually
create a secure hybrid cloud so this is
also an abstract form and this secure
hybrid cloud will actually contain
everything all the development and
testing data and the deployment data or
environment also is that okay Vikram
okay so he says all right
okay so now let us see what is OpenStack
like OpenStack organization says is that
OpenStack is a collection of open-source
technologies delivering a massively
scalable cloud operating system so with
OpenStack like I told you you can set up
your own cloud infrastructure and it
provides you with infrastructure service
and it provides you with a lot of
services and these are the services over
here Keystone which is the
authentication and authorization service
your Glantz service which is used for
storing images and images here means the
different types of operating system
files and there is the Nova which is the
computing service this is where you can
actually launch up your instances and
work on those instances you have the
Neutron service which is the networking
service that connects all the services
to each other you have Swift for object
storage cinder for block storage
services horizon which is your dashboard
which easily helps you to provision on
your application developers with
different instances and manage your
infrastructure as a whole
you have got ceilometer which is used
for metering purposes or billing
purposes that keeps a track of uptime of
different instances and then you've got
heat that is used for orchestration
purpose so we'll be learning more about
OpenStack and how to set up your cloud
infrastructure in a while so any
questions still here well guys let me
tell you that you can ask any questions
at any time
I'll be happy to answer your question so
do you have any questions right now no
questions so now let us take a look at
the OpenStack architecture so this is
the OpenStack cloud architecture so
let's consider that you're accessing
OpenStack with the dashboard so the
first thing that you'll see when you
start OpenStack is the dashboard which
is the horizon and this virtual machine
is the core part so this is where
everything is happening so this is just
a graphical user interface which is
horizon which is the dashboard so what
it does is that it is directly connected
with Neutron which is the networking
service now Neutron is actually
connected to every other service because
this is what actually enables
communication between different services
so the neutron connects you to the
virtual machine let's say that you want
to perform some kind of computing in
your virtual machine so as I told you
just now that you actually do all your
computing with the nova service over
here so this is where you launch up all
your instances and to launch up your
instances you have to boot it from an
image you have to have an image from
which you can actually launch an
instance and all the images are here in
glance so the glance helps you to launch
your instances and all the images are
actually stored in database so when you
request for computing instance what
happens is that glance actually
retrieves it from the database then
glance over you'll actually launch the
instance and it is launched in Nova and
it finally provisions the virtual
machine or your machine with the
computing instance that you requested
for it and while you're computing and if
you want to store some data so these are
all directly linked to Swift which is
used for object storage and cinder which
is used for block storage cinder over
here can be actually thought of as a
pluggable storage device and Swift is
your object storage where everything is
actually converted and stored as an
object so ceilometer here actually
monitors everything
the Keystone over here is used
for security so the first thing that
will happen when you are accessing the
dashboard is that will ask for your
authentication for your username or
password and that is what Keystone
actually does so it sees that whether
you have the authorization to perform
any tasks that you want to do and your
open set and the heat over here which
lies on top of it actually controls all
the orchestration about how different
components are actually communicating
with each other and what is going to be
the order of tasks so like I just told
you at first glance will retrieve the
data from trove and it will launch up an
instance after that it's going to Nova
and finally it's going to provision the
VM with the instance so this is what
heat takes care of it orchestrates all
the services together so any doubts on
the OpenStack cloud architecture and no
doubt
talk about the OpenStack community well
OpenStack is an open-source project and
a lot of people are actually
contributing and by contributing I mean
that they are contributing code to
OpenStack
so these are the different services and
this is a pie chart of that so these are
some other services also that people are
contributing there are a lot of outside
contributors for Nova and for different
configurations project and figurations
neutron tempest Keystone so these are
the services that are available in the
previous versions as well so now the
latest version is okata
before that that was Newton and Mitaka
and maybe finally after a few months
they're going to launch another new
version and the fun fact is that they
actually named all their different
versions or their different releases in
alphabetical order so at first it was M
Mitaka
then n Newton then finally it's O which
is okata so I don't know what's going to
come with P does any of you guys know
what is going to be the next release
that's going to start with B okay so the
victim knows it's called pike and then
Queen's very well Vikram thank you for
letting me know that this is the pie
chart of different companies that has
been contributing to OpenStack and
OpenStack let me tell you was actually
created first by Rackspace which is a
cloud hosting company and NASA yeah the
NASA which actually sends people to
space that NASA
so they created OpenStack first in 2010
and they made it open source and since
after that HP has been contributing a
lot to OpenStack almost 24 percent of it
there is VMware and there is IBM there
is Red Hat there is Mir antis some
different independent companies and
there are actually even more companies
that are contributing right now there is
Dell so they are all in others right now
so you can say that the open source
community is actually very huge
by the numbers if you see that there are
twelve hundred and two contributors
Samsung Yahoo Comcast which are one of
the big Giants in the tech industry are
among the top 20 users of OpenStack
there are 350 new features launched
recently so there are 53 third party
cloud integrations and the top companies
are these that are committing code every
day now and then there is 32 percent
increase in the infrastructure and the
code is written in 16 different
languages and there has been almost 2902
bug fixes so yeah there are a lot of
contributors and there are new features
coming out very frequently so now let us
take a look at the cloud deployment
models now you can deploy your OpenStack
cloud in one of these five ways the
first one can be your on permissions
distribution it can be an OpenStack
based public cloud a hosted OpenStack
private cloud OpenStack as a service and
appliance based OpenStack so let us take
a look at them one by one so the first
one is an on-premises distribution
so let's say that you have an enterprise
and you want to actually set up your own
private cloud infrastructure so
on-premises means within premises or
within your own company premises so this
is where you can use the OpenStack
software to actually set up your own
private cloud infrastructure and the
next deployment model is the OpenStack
based public cloud so what happens is
here there is a cloud provider or a
cloud vendor and it actually sets up his
own cloud which is a public cloud and he
actually sells different services he's
actually selling services maybe to real
instances someone is asking for storage
so a cloud vendor has actually set up an
OpenStack project and has made it a
public cloud and he's allowing people to
access services from there so that can
also be a way of using OpenStack so the
next is a hosted OpenStack private cloud
so what happens here is that your cloud
vendor actually sets up your own private
cloud so if you don't want to take the
hassle of actually creating your own
private cloud infrastructure because you
have other things to focus on you can
actually ask one of your cloud providers
they will actually set up all the
OpenStack infrastructure in your
premises to set up your own private
cloud and they will only charge for
support maintenance and for initially
setting up your own private cloud
infrastructure
the fourth is OpenStack as a service so
what happens here is that a cloud vendor
actually sets up everything he is using
his over he has set up an OpenStack and
you were just using service so this is
for small projects or small applications
that you want to run on if there is a
person who is actually set up an
OpenStack let's say that he'll give you
maybe an open sec sandbox or something
so one example is the try stack that you
can use if you want to just launch three
instances and you just want to like go
through open style you can use that
which is the sandbox of this is an
example of OpenStack as a service so
your cloud vendor sets up everything and
you can just access whatever they have
installed in their system
they'll give it access for that and
finally there is appliance based
OpenStack so this is appliances our
software that actually do not require
operating system they'll run directly on
servers so if you're using
infrastructure as service and you want
everything under your control you can
use this kind of a deployment model also
so any doubts on the deployment models
no doubts great and finally let us take
a look at the OpenStack cloud design
guide so if you want to set up your
OpenStack infrastructure i'll show you
different scenarios and I'll also let
you know about the different resources
that you might need things that you need
to focus on while you're setting up your
cloud infrastructure so you might need a
cloud infrastructure for general purpose
you might need it for computing purpose
that is just focused on computing you
might be needing it for storage purpose
which is storage focus you might be
needing it for multi-site projects or
maybe you want to set up a hybrid cloud
infrastructure you should also take a
look at the security and legal
requirements and also if you want a
network focused cloud infrastructure
I'll tell you the guidelines that you
need to follow things you need to focus
on when you want this kind of cloud
infrastructures ok so the first one is
general purpose so general purpose can
be let's say that you have a small
application and you want to run dev test
fraud on your cloud infrastructure which
is not a very large application so these
are the resources that you might be
needing so you would be needing a VM
disk image library and this is actually
a file format that describes containers
for virtual hard disk drives which you
can use in virtual machines like a
VMware Workstation or a VirtualBox as
well and raw block storage means that
these are storage areas and they are
divided into different blocks and each
block can be actually controlled as an
individual hard drive you might need a
file or object storage
and if you talk in openstack terms
you'll need the gland service over here
you would need the cinder service over
here and the strip service over here and
obviously since you have a cloud
infrastructure you need a firewall to
protect it you will might need load
balancers so you can also actually bill
L bass which is known as load balancer
as service from OpenStack and different
software bundles of course to develop
your application like different software
development kits or related other
software's that you might actually need
so any questions over here
okay no questions and now let's say that
you want a complete compute focused
cloud infrastructure so what you might
be needing is that you might need to
perform high-performance computing so
for that you might be actually dealing
with a lot of data and you need a lot of
processing power so make sure that you
actually avail large instances in your
OpenStack infrastructure if you need it
for high performance computing you might
actually want to also make an analysis
of that data so you might want to use
big data analytics using Hadoop to make
sure that you have a cloud
infrastructure which avails you for
analysis purpose as well and also you
want to use different tools like Jenkins
for a continuous integration and
continuous deployment of your
application and when you're actually
focused on just computing you want to
use it as a platform service and not as
an infrastructure service because you
don't want to worry about the lower
layers you are completely focused on
computing and processing of your data
and you might need a signal processing
for mfv or the network function
virtualization which is actually a key
enabler of a programming network and
infrastructure foundation next if you
just want to focus on storage you might
need storage for archiving your data and
you want to store it in a particular
hierarchical manner and you want to
actually synchronize your data as well
again you want to maybe perform data
analytics and you want to analyze your
data that you are storing so let me tell
you if you're completely focused on
storage you can use high volumes of
storage from cinder or you can actually
define your containers in Swift object
store as well so you need a persistent
block storage is obviously cinder and
you also might need it for operating
system and image storage which is your
gland service where you store so make
sure that you actually build a lot of
memory to your database to store that
amount of information because it's a
complete storage focus infrastructure so
make sure that you act
we purchase or use high volumes of
storage memory and you might need it for
media streaming define databases like
you have also got the database service
known as stroke to make sure you avail
all the services when you are completely
focused on storage now let's say that if
you want a network focused
infrastructure what you might need be
setting up is you might need to set up
network management functions network
service offerings you might want to set
up different web portals or use
different web services and since it's an
epic focus you want to communicate with
the other parts of your infrastructure
and since it is a network focused
infrastructure obviously we want to
communicate with other parts of your
infrastructure so you might want to
focus on setting up a video conference
or web conference voice over IP and you
want to transfer lots of data from one
part to another so make sure that you
have a good setup for a high speed and
high volume transactional systems and
also make sure that the security is
well-defined so that there cannot be any
vulnerabilities or any attacks while you
are actually transferring your data and
next time you might need an hybrid cloud
and this is in situations let's say that
if you are working in an e-commerce
website and out of a sudden let's say
that you decide to hold a mega sale so
obviously you'll be expecting a huge
amount of traffic and huge amount of
requests coming so for that you might
need a different load balancers more
load balancers more servers so that
process is known as a bursting and in
situations like that you might want to
avail load balancers or servers from a
public cloud so that is when you should
actually think about bursting private
into public to avail more servers or
more load balancers to use for a
particular amount of time because after
that sale maybe you might not need that
many load balancers or that many servers
to handle requests because after the
scene is over the amount of requests the
traffic is going to actually go down or
become less
and then maybe you want some other
servers for disaster recovery purpose
and by this I mean for backup right so
let's say that you have got data center
servers that are on-premises in your
enterprise but for backup let's say that
you have stored all those data in a
public cloud so for that also you might
need an hybrid cloud for development and
testing and like the example I just gave
you let's say that you're just only
running production on your private cloud
and development and testing is actually
happening on our public cloud a
federated cloud which is a cloud that is
defined infrastructure that is actually
defined to meet all your business
requirements or support legacy systems
legacy systems are nothing but they are
old methodologies or old computers that
is actually going on any don't want to
maybe change it so if you want to
support those kind of methods of
computing so you might also use in
hybrid clouds so there is a cloud your
private cloud is actually working on new
technologies and new procedures while
your other processes are in a public
cloud which you have defined totally in
a hybrid cloud are running on legacy
systems and let's say that if you have a
multi-site project so you have a company
that has got offices in different
locations around the world so and if you
are dealing with sensitive data and if
you're worried about data locality
because there can be data sovereignty
issues with a public cloud since let's
say that if you are in India and you're
storing some kind of data in AWS but the
server that is actually storing your
data maybe in the United States and
sometimes when you want to take out all
that data there might be data
sovereignty issues that you might face
so it's better that you actually define
your own OpenStack cloud infrastructure
so that you don't get such issues and
formally side projects that have people
working from all around the world it is
very essential that you use and
OpenStack infrastructure to create your
own private cloud infrastructure and
they just give authorization to the
people who can access your cloud
infrastructure and finally when you are
actually setting up your cloud
infrastructure make sure that you go
through all the security and legal
requirements the different construction
issues the third party involvement your
data location of your servers so maybe
you should consult with a lawyer for
this so make sure that you go through
that so that later on you don't face
with any kind of legal issues so this is
a brief overview of an OpenStack cloud
guidelines or any questions on that any
question they want to ask me about this
okay no questions
so this is the web browser of my virtual
machine this is where I have installed
OpenStack so I'm just going to go ahead
and launch the dashboard which is
horizon so I'm going to go to this IP
ten dot zero dot dot one five slash
dashboard and enter
so this is the first thing you'll see
when you are trying to log into the
dashboard it will ask for a username and
a password so I'm going to log in as
admin and the password so let me tell
you that you can find the password in
the root directory in the file Keystone
RC underscore admin so that is where
you'll find the password for the admin
user so I'm going to go ahead and click
on connect
so this is my dashboard I have
successfully logged into horizon so you
can see there are a number of tabs over
here there is this projects so the
project is the demo project the admin
and different services you can go ahead
and check the users this are also
basically the demo users with different
services and of course the admin as well
so there you can see so you can also
define group and different roles to a
particular user so this will have all
the authorization of a particular user
so you can assign roles to a specific
user so let me just show you how to
create instances and assign them with
networks and your OpenStack cloud so let
us first go to network
click on networks over here
so you can see that there is already a
public net defined with a subnet also so
you can think of it as an external
network so we're going to go ahead and
create our own networks so for that go
to this tab over you click on it write a
network name I'm going to name it at
Eureka net make sure you click that
dialog box here create subnet then
assign a subnet I'm going to name it a
do SN provide with a network address I'm
going to give it 192 168 1.0 and slash
the CIDR notation slash 24 click on next
you can choose to enable the DHCP and
don't bother about filling out these so
just go on and hit the create button
there it is you have created a network
which is Eddie reconnect with a subnet
and in edu essen this is the IP of your
subnet and your network ok so now let us
create some instances so you can go
ahead and check the plants repository
I'll show you where that is click on
compute and images so you can see that
you have a serial image already you can
add image over here on to create image
you can add and a bunt a major centers
image or whatever image that you want to
boot up your instance from so I'm going
to use the cereals only so I'm going to
go ahead and click on the launch button
over here so this will ask for the
details of your instance so I'm going to
name it at Eureka p.m. the availability
zone will be Nova this is the computer
and you can also mention how many
instances you want of this kind so I'll
just let it stay as one so note that
there are some abstracts marked on these
options this means that these are
mandatory to fill out you can also leave
our security groups Network boards keep
air but you should fill out the details
the flavor of your instance and the
maximum so will directly jump on to
flavors this is the mandatory one so now
you have to choose the flavor of your
instance among these now flavors are
nothing but the disk size and the RAM
size of the instance that you want to
launch so I'm going to go ahead and
select on em one tiny so this has one be
cpu 512 mb of ram the total this size is
1 GB and root disk is 1 gb so I'm going
to go ahead and create a tiny image so
I'm going to select the m1 tiny so these
are predefined flavors that are already
there in OpenStack but you can also go
ahead and create your own flavors as
well so now click on next so now you
have to assign your instance to a
network so we have just created the Eddy
raker net
with the add new subnet so I'm going to
assign this network to my instance so I
will click on this button over here and
now you're ready to launch your instance
so click on launch instance and you can
see the message that one instance was
launched and you can go view your
instance and I'll tell you where you can
go ahead and see your instance that you
have just created so go to compute and
go to instances
so there it is so this is the VM that we
just created this is assigned with the
IP address one ninety two dot one sixty
eight dot one dot one zero the size is M
one tiny this is the flavor the status
is active so this is up and running so
now let us just go ahead and click on my
instance and when you do you can also
have an overview of your image this will
have all the details about your instance
you can also go to the console and use
the terminal of your instance
and this is the terminal of the instance
that is just created so I'm going to go
ahead and log in so the username is zero
it is over here it's Cubs win
so here it is
so this is your instance that you can
use it for any purpose that you want you
can launch as many instances that you
want you can define savers in your
instance you can also define the image
where you want to put it up from now
this is a serious image you can also
launch Ubuntu Linux Red Hat any kind of
instance that you want to so this is
what you can do with OpenStack and this
is how you can design your own OpenStack
cloud by creating instances and networks
so let me show you how our network
topology actually looks like so just go
to networks go to network topology
it's better if you see it in a graph
so there it is this is our instance you
can also toggle the labels if you want
to see the details of the icon set is in
front of your screen so this is the ad
Eureka net that we defined and this is
the instance that we created and this is
our public network you can also connect
your instance to the public network or
any other network that you have created
in your OpenStack cloud so you can do
more with OpenStack you just have to
install it it is open source you can get
it for free and start your project and
start using a cloud infrastructure with
OpenStack so I hope that it is clear to
you any questions
all right no questions so this is what
we learned today we learn about
different cloud virtualization concepts
different cloud services I have told you
about different cloud deployment models
we have learned what is OpenStack we
have taken a look at the OpenStack
architecture and OpenStack architecture
design guide finally so do you have any
questions on these you can still ask me
