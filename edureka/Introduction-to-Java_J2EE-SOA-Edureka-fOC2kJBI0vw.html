depend to our free will
Java EE and Sooey
you
can you just can I just type yes all
chat window if you are able to hear me
okay great
none hello everyone welcome to our free
webinar on introduction to Java j2ee and
SOA my name is Suren and I'm a part of
support team here at iterator thank you
all for joining this session and
choosing iterate as your learning
partner I would like to inform that you
that the instructor may not be and not
be able to answer all your question
today due to large audience however our
technical experts are available live on
Twitter to answer your queries so feel
free to post your questions on Twitter
marking them to add the Eureka Dorton
using a hashtag Ysidro Rica you will get
to know more about this in the next
slide now I'd like to introduce our
instructor mr. Chen Kumar who has 21
years of experience in IT industry more
into software development field he has
worked in the various companies like
Oracle Corporation iflix BMC Software
etc along with a development experience
he has 10 years of training experience
in corporate as well as in college as a
visiting professor wishing you a happy
learning
let's begin our webinar
yeah hi I'm Sharon okay today we are
going to learn about Java and its way
mainly focusing on its way okay so how
exactly it works is that we have online
classes and all the ramon's classes are
recorded and it is 24/7 support and at
the end of the class you have a model y
squares and at the end of the course you
need to develop a project and you will
get a certificate based on the project
right so you'll be learning these things
in the today's class right what is Java
one of the advantages of Java okay and
we'll be having like a will be knowing
about SOA and what are the users how it
works what is the architecture and all
we'll be discussing and I'll be
demonstrating the web services to you
right okay
introduction to Java okay John Java is
developed by Sun Microsystems
by James Gosling and initially it
started like you know it was known as
oak and later on it was renamed to Java
some of the advantages of Java are
concurrent class-based object-oriented
okay what is what do you mean by
concurrency is parallel transactions
it's like more than one task at the same
time okay for example you can do in a
word doc you can type your text as well
as you know you can search for a string
in that so two tasks can run in parallel
if you look at gaming also write two
cards can move simultaneously so the
code must have written only for one car
but due to concurrency so the the code
can be executed multiple times you will
see as if more number of cars are seen
right so the advantages of concurrency
is that the speed
then one task you can do multiple tasks
at the same time if the speed increases
right the features of Java Java is
simple it's not very complicated to
write programming like any other
programming language like COBOL and all
for for simple string to display there
you need to write 20 21 lines of code in
COBOL but in Java it is like one line if
you just want to display one hello world
Java has got lot of security features
and portable portable is since Java is
platform independent that means to say
you can write the code in Windows and
execute the code in Mac I mean to say
Java code in Windows compiled in Windows
take the code and run in another
operating system so it is easily
portable from one operating system to
another operating system in the sense if
I write a complete project in Linux I
can take and execute in Windows it's
very easy object oriented Java has
object-oriented facility robust Java is
very strong it has got exception
handling facility and lot of facilities
like that so that it is strong in C++ if
you consider the pointers are there due
to pointers there is tendency to crash
the program at many times since pointers
is taken internally by Java and not
allow the developer to code in it then
the robustness of the program has become
more it's become much more stronger the
next is multi-threaded multi-threaded is
as I said in the previous slide
concurrent transactions you can perform
more than one task here thread is a task
multi thread means multiple tasks so
multiple tasks are running at the same
time is one of the feature of Java what
happens when you run multiple tasks at
the same time the speed of the system
increases as I said if I can run 10
tasks at the same time the speed
increases by 10 times right
architecture neutral della is not
depending on any architecture in the
sense like 386 486 CPU any CPU any
hardware it can run on it is not
depending on any particular hardware if
it if you can install Java on a system
then you can write a Java code and start
executing as I said the high-performance
see when it is multi-threaded right so
multiple tasks at the run at the same
time so it is the performance naturally
increases and the last point the
distributed it is not required
the one of the best feature of Java is
distribution it is not like I need to
run my pro entire project in one system
or one location I can instead I can have
the Java put in two different locations
for example okay one part of the module
I can put it in California another part
in some you know in postal another
pattern you are right so I can
distribute the modules of Java and I can
connect them without any time
intervention in no seconds I can connect
I'm like in a module from Boston to New
York
it's as if like you know the two systems
are keeping each other next to each
other okay where Java is used Java is
very very popular extremely popular it
has taken almost 80% of the market share
in time in terms of development you take
up any system you have Java in it
nowadays like we have Mobile's
in mobile Android is very famous and
Android is developed in Linux on Java
like Java platform
Java on Linux okay if we can look at
like you know it is used in many of the
pieces and even in
nobody's the program cars using software
and even for programming in cars also to
run the card some of the features of the
car to run automatically they use Java
Chrysler is one of the company which
uses Java for developing the software
for cars ok it's used for Android
applications it's used for Hadoop
applications and Java is used in lot of
frameworks like Hadoop spring hibernates
trucks so many tools and like it's it's
it's huge market about the Java right
and so it is used to develop business
process management tools web servers
some of the web service like the
GlassFish WebLogic websphere and sorry
web services IAS tomcat application
servers like the GlassFish WebLogic
websphere etc so Java is used for lot of
development in the current trend ok some
of the technologies of Java there are
like more than 50 to 60 technologies are
available in Java but some of the the
best technologies which is currently
used right now is like jsps JSP is
basically used to display web pages
display web pages it's like you can
develop web pages in HTML and include
Java also as part of it spring is a
framework which is used free spring has
almost almost all the Java technologies
in it and it is used for as a middle
layer of the project here I'm talking
about MVC architecture that is Model
View controller that is the front end
the middle layer that is the actual
logic will be performed and the back end
back ok the back end is the database
where you connect to the database and
get the data from the table
so the first technology which came up
from Java to connect to the database is
JDBC so after that hibernate is a
framework which was built on to get the
data from the database hibernate is a
framework which is built on JDBC
technology it is very very easy in
hibernate you need not write complete
SQL you have certain methods in
hibernate where you set methods
internally hibernate converts into SQL
so you don't need to write SQL code in
hibernate that is one of the advantage
of hybrid as I said before you have many
other applications many other tools you
can develop that is Android is being
developed web services are developed in
Java okay now currently Java 8
you
yeah so s ways okay
s way is used in banks for example I
will they respond
are you able to hear me are you able to
hear me now okay okay okay
it is used in banking it's really is
used in banking it's like I have an
application I want to communicate with
the bank for credit card authorization
or debit card authorization I have an
application but how will I connect to
bank and get by that yep no sorry give
the approval
you
okay
Sabich not asking are we going to learn
Java 7 in this course yes we'll
definitely will be learning Java 7 in
this course ok so this is just that
advanced topic we are introducing over
here this way
well to answer your question yes we'll
be learning Java 7 in this course okay
coming back to banking so I have an
application which I want to connect to a
bank and get the approval for the debit
transaction or a credit transaction
right so I will be using SOA
architecture I'll I'll be connecting
with a bank and I'll provide all the
details to the bank and get the approval
either it's approve or decline the
transaction okay
even in manufacturing also sorry even in
manufacturing also SOA is used that is
if actually in any manufacturing unit
they will maintain the inventory right
if they will have a minimum level and
maximum level for any component if the
level of the component if it if if it
drops down to minimum below minimum it
has to be informed to the vendor so that
the stock gets refilled in so but in by
using s way you can reduce a human
intervention the moment the stock
reduces then automatically it informs
the manufacturer and manufacturer the
vendor and vendor acknowledges and
refills in here there is no human
intervention is required okay even in
insurance let's say like you know if an
employee joins the organization and
we need not manually give all the
details to the insurance company and get
the employee insured so we have all the
details we need to have if we can
develop a software using SOA we can just
connect to the insurance company provide
all the details and the insurance
happens like the insurance is done for
the employee and insurance policy has
been sent by email
everything happens automatically so you
don't need to manually give all the
details to the company to work for the
work okay some of the companies uses the
SOA architecture is ICS a bank HDFC bank
Axis Bank a lot of banks like any bank
you take it up right it will be using
the SOA architecture because any bank
which provides the credit card they need
to support SOA architecture because they
need to give on the web however the the
credit card transaction is approved or
declined if they want to go ahead for
like if they want to process credit card
transactions then they have to support
SOA right some of the other companies in
IT sector are using eswe is IBM HP
Oracle
Google Amazon it's like the list goes on
right so we don't right now without a
CoA in a huge organizations it doesn't
work even for any transaction the basic
idea is if you want to review the human
intervention and we want to connect
automatically and things to happen
automatically
then SOA has to be used okay some of the
companies which uses its ways for
manufacturing purposes
Apollo Marathi Hyundai and many more
companies okay and Harvard Medical
School and all its hospitals uses the
SOA architecture XY architecture if
there is a lot of demand in you know
everywhere for SOA architecture if you
look at the trend so this is like you
know so lot of
demand is also there it is that we write
the code and user services on the other
side without human intervention
everything it's everything is automated
ok that is a main advantages of s wait
ok why s way it is let's say if I if I'm
starting some company and I don't have
the expertise in it in one of the field
or not all the fields and other fields
in that case what I do is I outsource
the work I use the work I part of the
work I used from others and plug in that
component as part of me right so that
becomes the s way if it is not there I
have to develop everything on my own
then it increases the speed to deliver
and then like when the time to deliver
is more definitely the cost also goes up
so to reduce the cost and to deliver
fast then I need s way and one of the
problem of not having s way is one of
the problem of not having s way is that
interoperability interoperability means
let's say I have two systems dissimilar
systems for example I have a Macintosh I
have a Linux system ok and I want to
connect both of em I can't look I want
to connect these two systems and
communicate with each other I want to
use a Linux system to use the services
or the product which is installed in the
Macintosh machine it is impossible
without this way ok what are the
advantages of s way as it said if I use
the services from the other company or
the other vendor ok
I can I can I'll have these other I
shall have these advantages that is
speed to deliver the customers will be
more right I can deliver very fast if
somebody is very special somebody is
specialized in that area I will use a
services of them so that I can deliver
the service with a customer fast so the
cost reduces and customer can get
reliable delivery it's like I develop
mobile and I talk to Android to install
Android on my machine
I don't invent OS I'm a mobile
manufacturer but I need weights I'll
give I'll use the architecture given by
somebody else who is who is like
specialized in the particular subject
right the customer service is improved
and as I said interoperability can
communicate with similar and dissimilar
systems for exchanging information and
data ok
Anand is asked like what is the
difference between SOE and web services
yeah issue is is the concept
so the strategy web services is the
implementation of it I'll just tell you
in a while right
it's like object-oriented programming
and Java right object-oriented
programming is a concept it's a
technology it's a strategy it it's a
software engineering concept right so
Java is used to implement SOA instead of
object-oriented programming you look at
object-oriented programming you have
like polymorphism static polymorphism
run time polymorphism encapsulation data
hiding these are all the like you know
the concepts and an object-oriented
programming I will use Java or a C++
I'll use Java to implement that right
similarly the SOA and web services
Esso is a concept which will be
implemented through web services ok ok
now
do you have any questions yeah actually
we have we can develop in 8th we can
develop in 7 also but the course we will
be dealing with Java 8 ok so I think
that is for so week right so it is
asking like we are we are already in
Java 8 but why it is in Java 7 via
training no actually we will be trimming
in Java 7 Java 8 itself ok any questions
for me before I move on with SOA
introduction any questions for me if it
is if I can move on please let me know
so that I can continue further
ok ok that's why a introduction s way
stands for service-oriented architecture
it is a design pattern or a software
architecture which provides application
functionality as a service to other
application SOA functionality is not
depending on any vendor product or
application one of the functionality
provided by a sway is getting online
bank statement the functionality can be
combined with other features of the
application to provide the full-fledged
application the application will use
service provided by the vendor or the
network without human intervention the
simple meaning of SOA functionality or
functions provided by a vendor or
internet or network for a cost or no
cost s way in a simple terms that we
will be using somebody will be
developing a component or a service
right and some other company will
connect to the service and make use of
the service in a very simple terms like
once somebody will develop
the service will be using the service
for example a bank will provide a
service saying that you give a credit
card information and require details or
the web without human intervention
through programming you connect to me
and I will tell you it is the
transaction is approved or declined
right so everything happens or the
Internet and no human intervention is
required okay that is s way a
service-oriented architecture right okay
if you look at the slide right so
service provider it's like for example
in a bank transaction right so any bank
will provide services for example credit
card approval debit card approval then
getting a bank statement like you know
from this duration to this duration all
the facilities functions will be
provided as methods in a bank right they
will publish it to a common broker which
is called as in Web Services it is
called udda when we look into web
services in detail we look at you what
is you DBA how it is to be published or
not then the consumer right anybody who
wants to access my online bank statement
through program right not not through
locking into the bank and getting it
that is also possible but this is also
without human intervention s ways the
use of a cube without human intervention
this consumer will connect to the
service provider that is bank through
service broker that is okay then the
consumer will directly talk to the
service it will interact over here that
is the bank will make set of functions
or a service okay and register saying
that these are the facilities I have you
provide the like you know credit card
number and all these details I will tell
you whether it is approved or declined
and you provide me the account number
name and when for which duration you
want the bank
a bank online statement a bank statement
and I'll provide you that all the
features all the facilities were
provided by the bank and kept as methods
or functions okay and as a consumer or a
client can connect to the bank account
ok Bank a bank and can use those
services
ok this happens through x-ray
architecture if you look at in detail
right if you look at like you know this
is application one all the applications
these are all the clients are a web
application right this is the security
layer that is it crosses through the
security layer thing is it a valid user
or somebody is trying to hack or
something like that right and then this
is the actual service provided for
example if I can see bank transaction
right so the credit card debit card then
like you know a checkbook request and
monthly statement transfer of friends
from one account to another of course is
all the services provided by the bank
one is I can do online another one is I
can do I mean with like manually I can
do online otherwise I need not through
program I provide all the details and
say click on ok supplement and it will
do automatically it will talk to the
service layer of the bank and crosses
through the security and then performs
clicking and it uses internally the
database for providing the information
for example if I'm asking for the bank
details there is transaction details
like for the last 1 month it by
providing the account details definitely
I eat bank has to contact to the
database write its own database to see
the complete transactions then only it
can provide you
any questions so far
okay so okay if you look at the details
that if you look at the architecture in
detail on SOA right this is the consumer
layer that is the customer the client it
has to get integrated with the s way R
this is the service provider right it
has mainly four components one is a
business process layer and a service
layer a component layer and operational
systems layer that is in a business
process layer it is it is meant for the
business this is the way the business
has to take care in the sense like there
is certain way the business has to go
for example for credit card transaction
I need to provide name credit card
details cvv2 expiry date everything I
need to provide this is required first
it has to like you know check whether
credit card details yeah we will
typically is 'king like you know are we
having any practical example definitely
yes so service-oriented architecture is
like you know the the concept I want to
explain then we will be looking at
example at the end will there will be
looking at it
the Polka you asked me a question saying
that can you explain with an example
where it is used are you saying you get
the statement without logging into the
bank yeah
you have been logging into the bank
through program right the way you are
doing it right so in online the user ID
password with that only you should be
able to log in right without that it
would not be possible but you will not
be using it you will not be manually
doing it you'll be doing it
programmatically right otherwise it
would not be possible okay for example
sorry so if you look at the JDBC that is
JDBC or hibernate or any database
transaction one is you can commit you
can connect to it manually right other
way is through program you can connect
it you specify the URL of the database
and you specify the user ID password and
all the details credentials you put it
across in the database and connect to it
you have to connect to the banking
system with the user ID and password
right without that it would not be
possible then otherwise it will be very
difficult for a bank to handle right
okay yeah if you look at the business
process layer service layer and a
component layer that is business layer a
separate layer has been introduced to
take care of the business the way it has
to go the process the business layer
mainly processes taken care first you
have to get the details ok then it has
to be approved then it has to check in
the database then you can respond back
the process is laid out in business
layer ok the service Li ok one more
advantage of the business layer is
tomorrow if there is a niche why exactly
the fittest layer has been introduced as
tomorrow if there is any change in the
business process right then it is easily
accommodated in business process layer
ok that is only the reason one more
layer has
being introduced otherwise if it is if
it is very tightly coupled it will be
very difficult okay then
service layer service layer is it's it's
the components it's all the services put
together okay it becomes a service layer
it is like all the components in a jar
file all the class files in a jar file
it's like a service layer that is I have
ten services given by the bank okay all
the ten services comes under service
layer if you go to the component layer
it is an individual service okay I have
ten services like you know getting a
checkbook adding at the online
transaction like you know credit card
details debit card details approvals all
these things these are all the services
you don't buy given by the bank and it
comes all this put together in one
service ok banking it comes under
service layer then so individual
transactions right individual services
credit card approval are declining right
so that comes under component layer
individual service is a component layer
the the operational systems layer is a
database okay so if you look at the this
architecture again this the consumer and
a consumer layer is a client it gets
integrated with the business this
business process layer and this entire
process like in a business process layer
service layer component like an
operational system layer all these are
part of the service provided ok
business process layer is for business
right so it can easily accommodate
changes in the business suddenly they
want to introduce something else in
between two processes right new security
has to be brought in so then it is very
easy in business process Li the service
layer is all the services provided by
that organization comes under service
layer right I may have 10 services I may
have hundred services right component
layer is individual service I may be
looking at individual service right so
it comes under that right and that
service individual service will talk to
the database to respond to the consumer
right okay that's okay Pavan not a
problem so okay now if you look at its
way a framework that's what I have told
in the previous architecture program
that is consumer interface layer this
layer is used for the custard by the
customers business process layer
provides the business process flow also
accommodates new changes in the business
easily
hence this layer is provided service
layer this layer comprises of all the
services in the enterprise component
layer this layer has the actual service
to be provided an operational system
layer this layer contains the data
models that it obeys it connects to the
CRM it connects the backend database to
fetch the data so that the client can
get the information right okay some of
the principles of eswe is it's like
loosely coupled abstraction like
object-oriented programming you have
abstraction that is what what actually
does what actually is done in the code
will be not shown to the client okay so
what the client will give the
information that what needs to be given
and he'll get the response that what is
the output like you know if I give the
credit card details it'll go and perform
you know it will it reach the bank and
bank will process internally what has to
be done and it will just respond it is
approved or decline the reusability it's
not like once the code is written right
it can be reused not only by me any
other you know company can use it right
not only my company hundreds of
companies can connect to the bank and
get approval or declining statements
from for the credit card statelessness
the this way architecture will not store
the state unless state of the you
unless until it is required the main
purpose of this is to to reduce the Mac
the resources usage otherwise it'll be
huge like if I if I get ten thousand
transactions for a parole and decline if
I start storing everybody's details
it'll be difficult if it is required it
will be stored in the database else it
is not the survey's discoverability as I
said we will be discussing this in the
class you TDI udda is for the service in
the registry ok the services has to be
registered and it has to be accessed
I am muted by an organizer Pavan Pavan
I did not mute you once again hold on
I'm sorry Pavan I'm not able to
I didn't mute you maybe you can post
your question over here I will answer
your question and service
discoverability that is this service
services are registered and tonight can
look at the registry ok and can look at
so I all want some service then I look
at the registry if that service is
available I will connect through the
registry to the server ok so if it
becomes the registry becomes a mediator
or a broker in which we have discussed
in the previous slide here if you see
here the service provider will register
with the broker and client will connect
to the service broker and talk to the
service once the interaction starts in
the plain 10 service can start working
there's the same concept in our my
remote method invocation ok so that
completes like a information about s way
do you have any questions on s way
please let me know if you have any Rama
asked me a question that you will you
share the slides with us LOM like now
it will be put on the website you can
take a look at it okay so at the end if
I want to say s way the service-oriented
architecture
okay the a company provides its service
on the net in the form of methods or in
any way right I can write one program
connect to the vendor who provides a
service and use the services of it that
is on the service-oriented architecture
is right no human intervention
everything happens to program connect to
the vendor on the net and get the output
right are there any questions for me
before I move on with web services can I
move on please let me know so that I
will start with web services
introduction okay so yeah okay if you
can look at the slide right if you look
at the slide that is web services
introduction eswe is a concept using web
services okay and using web services SOA
can be built as I said in before itself
that object-oriented programming is a
concept which need to be built in and
one of some of the programming languages
like Java build the object-oriented
programming so web services are the
services provided on the net right it is
same as sy sy is a concept which you
need to bring in to the web services
only through web server through web
services you can build web server sorry
s way okay producers will create
services and publish consumers will look
for the services and connect with the
producers and will access the required
services right
as I said before producers that is a
companies will create some services or
functions or functionality put it on the
web
okay and consumers or clients can
connect to the akhada organization
through web using web services you can
implement Web Services in two ways one
is a soap there are a simple object
access protocol basically it uses XML
and another way is a restful web
services okay
restful Web Services uses HTTP protocol
okay so pursue protocol is used to
access web services and soap stands for
simple object access protocol okay the
protocol is based on XML and the soup
was designed by in 1998 by David winner
Doron box mob attention and more seen
okay this is how the architecture of the
soup works that is the client okay the
client puts the entire request that is
if I want to have a credit card
transaction that is the name credit card
details cvv2 expiry date amount of
transaction it will be put in the the
request and it will be sent on the web
you okay to the service provider okay it
will reach the bank and bank will check
it and look at the soap message and get
the input what the customer wants and
process the required details and
responds back this is a service okay and
responds back again in the soap format
to the client okay so the entire
information request will be put in an
XML and it will be sent on web on
Internet to the service provider right
okay if you can look at the slide
if you want to get the approval or
declined status for credit card
transaction from the bank using soup
okay so a simple object access protocol
that is the input and output will be in
the form of XML okay
following steps to be done or will be
executed in in client module write the
details for the customer details like
credit card account number expiry date
cvv2 in soap format as I said before
that you write all the details credit
card details into an XML file and in a
soup format the soap is a format in any
using XML right so the soap message is
sent on web to web service which
provides the desired service for example
if it's a banking transaction then I
will put all the mail like you know the
details of the credit card and send it
to the bank so the web server is unpacks
the soap message and convert into a
command that the application can
understand application will get that is
application here in our example
application we'll get the credit card
information does the required processing
and generates the response either a
plural decline status in soap message
that is what happens the the bank will
get the soap message as a request and it
will see it'll let you know convert back
to a command and understand what is the
input required what is the input given
and what output is required and it will
call the corresponding method the method
will perform the required operation and
generates a response back in soap format
and the soap message is sent back to the
client right again the soap message will
be sent back to that line and client
unpack the soap message and gets the
required information that is the client
gets the information in soap format and
take the like output which is there in
the soap format okay and understands it
so if you look at the client and server
transaction is happening through you in
soap format all the details has been put
in XML in so
oh man and sent to the server server
looks at it understands what the input
is given understands what what is
expected by the client looks processes
it and responds again back in the soap
format and client receives it right so
this is one architecture using web
service soap is one one protocol used on
web services
it's the diagram right the client will
send in the soap format to the web on
the web to the web service and the
process ok the server process is it and
responds back again ok to the client
module ok some of the files generated in
soap is whatever the service we have to
write it will be writing in the Java ok
and we have a visible file ok missile
stands for web services description
language that says that file shows what
are the services provided in the Java
coding ok so what are the services
provided and what is the input required
what is the output required like this
and using this Delphi the client can
generate ok all right
the web service didn't connect to the
server ok now the rest ok before I move
on to the restful web services do have
any questions for me do you have it
equations for any questions on soap web
services are we showing a demo on soap
web services right ok going moving
forward ok restful services restful
services is also a web based standard
that is soap uses HTTP XML protocol
restful services uses the HTTP protocol
okay if user
HTTP protocol and if you know servlets
the operations are very similar to serve
let's repeat back slide please
which slide why bow I did not get it
is this a slab you are talking about the
files and yeah okay yeah okay I'll do
one thing I will just show you a demo of
I'm using Eclipse to develop please give
you a mallet Eclipse is loaded okay
I'm generating one java file that the
service which I am going to provide I'm
going to write a method
Here I am for not to demonstrate you
have taken some credit-card numbers
ideally I should have a database
connected if I'm AB and then I will have
a database C so I'm giving like you know
if the credit card matches with the
given data available with me and amount
is less than 50,000 then I won't approve
the transaction okay so this is one of
the service I want to provide and and
from this I will generate wisdom file go
to web services okay
create a web service okay then this is
the method which i want to give i'm
using apache tomcat server okay not a
problem so it will it's been used by
other application that's why it is
the Apache server has been locked by
other process that's a problem so I'll
do one thing I'll create a new workspace
itself mmm
one second it's loading
okay now I'll add Webster business sorry
Apache Tomcat server runtime any want me
to add Tomcat 7 and browse for desktop
Thank You traffic for development you
don't add finish server is dead
and ticket okay
okay savory starting off if you can look
at server is getting started here apache
tomcat server
yeah it's generating a wisdom file it's
well known so I can test like this okay
so like it will generate the method like
in Web Services Explorer is there using
that I can verify the server code now
what I will do is here if you look at in
the vestal you generate WSDL file so
this provides the data like in a
validate credit card is a method and
like you know these are the fields of it
right you know the name credit card
number amount amount is double credit
card number as long name is this string
right so it reads the information okay
what is the input what is the output
everything it see here provided credit
card it returns the string okay so where
exactly it connected all those things
from the Vistal file right i can
generate a client
I'm generating the clouds now yeah so I
have the validate credit card method so
this is the client if you look at like
you know test client okay
game I'll give Karen and I will give the
the credit card number so Bank and I
will give you I'll give one twenty three
point two three as the transaction and
say see it says a prude the web services
are responded now I'll add the different
credit card number and say invoke it
says declined right and the same amount
I will say it for more than fifty
thousand okay then it should decline the
transaction for me it is declined I will
reduce the amount to six thousand and it
will say uproot right okay so you will
learn all these things in the class how
exactly to do what is a versatile file
what are the parts of visible file there
are five parts of digital file how do
you generate the from the visible file
how do you generate the client what are
the components of the file means of the
client everything you will learn in the
class okay do you have any questions for
me can I go on with restful service we
have done I've shown you how exactly the
soap works okay okay now if you look at
like you know the soap files wisdom and
client generation that is Java code
which does the actual operation or
provides a service I've just written a
simple Java code where it takes a credit
card details and then amount based on
the criteria
of the bank it returns either approved
or declined right the visible file the
web services description language this
file say so this is a pistol file as I
should let you know the web in the
visible file authenticate not visited
okay so it has all the information what
are the methods as I said five potions
are there in this so in the class you
will learn entire details about in
detail about to what is this you have to
specify the port here to specify the URL
everything you have to specify right and
the using visible file we can generate a
client and can execute the web services
using versatile file we can write our
client or using eclipse we can generate
the client file one of the facility of
eclipses you can generate the code right
now moving forward like you know the
restful services that is soap is one
format you write like you know here you
send the information using XML you see
here everything is attacked okay in the
rest it is the HTTP if you perform the
operations and servlets like you know
then you will understand that you will
connect to the URL and it uses the some
of the methods like get head post delete
usually get and post which is like do
get blue post okay
it uses the same technology like
servlets right so rest is also very
popular right if you can look at rest
based architecture everything is a
resource the resource is accepted by
HTTP methods the HTTP methods are get
post head they lead everything right so
like soap hat client-server even rest
should have the server which provide a
service and clang 2x as the service 100%
rain so soap is a way we are accessing
the the client and the server that is
the client and develop service right
rest is also one of the the protocol to
connect between the client and the
server ok this is one more way right to
access the server methods client it
moves the server
method using the URL has done in servlet
server method takes the input processes
it and rest
once back to the claim the same thing
whatever we have done same procedure
here we are using soap rest is also
possible right you know in the in the
test web services Ness client right so I
have given all the details and click on
invoke so from the client it reaches to
the server web service using soap and
then soap the server performs and sends
the response back in soap and the client
decipher it or understands what it is
and displays the input the output right
okay now okay to access the web the
server method client invoke the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
