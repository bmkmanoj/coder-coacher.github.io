here and I'm your presenter for EM your
presentation for principles of MVC for
rails development I I have and you type
in war with that were there is pleased
to let me know if you can hear me and
see my screen is that you know why are
the questions window so I can proceed
vice please let me know where questions
window that you can see my screen and
him alright so let's begin now what I'm
assuming is that you guys have basic the
programming experience um and you know a
bit about rails you move there is no
enough to start with what is everything
alright so by the end of this module
you'll be able to understand the
challenges faced when designing an
application without a framework the MVC
design pattern the logic behind MVC he
dry convention which stands for do not
repeat yourself and also convention over
configuration we will see the MVC
benefits and we will have a live demo of
MVC in valence so I'm
open by the end of the session you guys
will be able to complete it when we see
yourself so what are the challenges
while designing an application without a
framework let us say we are developing a
web app and an e-commerce are it might
it may contain a lot of logic there will
be lot of redirecting you know a lot of
code will be there so is complexity and
with and until you manage it in a proper
fashion you will be dealing with a lot
of complex code and actually a lot of
code and third and it will be unless you
manage it in some fashion it will be
difficult to reuse something that you've
written one you should be able to reuse
it again rather than you know writing it
again moreover if you write something
you more than one time and you change
something you know if one of the places
you might actually forget to change it
in the other place they prove it in the
same logic so it is best that whenever
you are you know there's something that
has to be repeated it isn't one place
and both wherever it needs to be
repeated calls that function or method
whatever you have defined and reusable
it is essential to reuse the code it is
very difficult without you know a design
principle to reuse it and you will have
to hard code everything from the start
moreover as number of four people are
working parallely programming badlani
you there will be conflicts in you know
let us say to die two people have more
have I working on the same file and one
has a different version or that has a
different one so how will you reconcile
that
kind of inner design principle is
required to manage code
other than that everything was
pre-tested it was before it goes life so
said she'd quote doubt reusability
people working in different environments
and having the test for everything it is
reviewing necessary that we have a
design framework alright so what are the
challenges faced while designing an
application without a member as we
talked it leads to disorganization and
moreover if there is no structure around
the court and if the court rules huge in
size you change one thing and it means
turb another so you need a lot of
testing you need a lot of structure in
your application so that you know all
your qualifications and its complexity
can be managed so the solution to this
is use design pattern and you do one
such design pattern is MVC and we see it
stands firm what have you control it I
will shortly know what what is the
meaning of Model View controller
separately meanwhile MVC as I said is a
design pattern it is a way to organize a
program in the proper manner my program
will mean an application alright so what
is MVC as I said it is an acronym for
model view controller a software design
pattern for developing web and desktop
applications more so with applications
now in simple worth it is it is a way of
separating you're separating the logic
of your application from the display
will see how it happens originally
described in terms of design pattern for
use with small talk and by a guy called
try give then saw in 97 i'm not sure i'm
pronouncing it correct now his paper was
published under the title application
programming in small talk how to you
then we see and it was that was just the
beginning and it paved way for future
implementations so what it does is it
separates out your applications business
logic your rules yes a man takes you no
rules it for example let us say you're
filling out a form and let us here user
is registering itself the user will not
be able to register without any mail so
that is a rule now the whatever she does
is it separates such rules and your
presentation logic so for example you
might want to add some CSS on the page
and our script make their UI friend user
friendly and of course ESS for the look
and feel of view of your application so
these two things are completely
separated they do not enter mean and by
the virtue of this our code is you know
more reusable it is more structured you
have different people can work on it it
is maintainable you can test it very
easily so so that is the basic premise
of in business so your model in your MVC
stand will represent your data layer
your view represents your user interface
layer here you will in your model you
will specify all your rules and business
logic of your application you your view
is the user interface layer here you can
specify a uhaul the CSS and JavaScript
the look and feel of your application
and in controller it is a controller is
like a bridge between a model in of you
will see how it is like that so this is
this is a illustration
what happens is let us say you have you
you are an end user and you send a
request to my website dot-com your
browser will receive the request and it
will in turn center sender it HTTP
request to a controller the controller
will see ok this is my request now let
us say I needed I the user wanted to see
the list of all users or let us say all
the articles so what the controller will
do is it will see that oh I want to
fetch all the articles that will request
the model to search all the articles now
your model will in turn send a request
to your database and it will fetch all
the articles once your articles has been
etched they will be returned to model
which in turn will return the all the
articles to control now controller will
store them in a variable and pass it on
to the view now this view will simply
display all these articles add some CSS
to it some JavaScript some images if
required and return it back to the
control now controller will wrap it in
the response and send it back to the
browser now what your browser has
received in HTML which it will display
to the end user so that does that is the
cycle so in between actually in between
this controller and your web browser
there are two things one is your web
server so your whips your browser cannot
directly interact with your controller
it will send a request to your web
server of X server can be something like
a mongrel Apache a thin fabric fabric is
the default server for you by the way
which we use often used in development
would not suitable for production but
default and good for development so
you're so the first thing that happens
is your web server intersects your
your request and now your web server
sends it to her outside you see all this
in very shortly but just to give an
explanation it will send your request
your route your Ruby on Rails doubts
once that is done your routes will
decide to see you know which controller
do i send a request to and it will
select an appropriate controller for
example if the request is to fetch all
the comments it was a little garments
controller if the request is to you
fetch all the article the request will
be sent to the article's controller like
that so on and so forth alright so so
that this is about that about about your
this diagram alright so a model what is
the model data accesses routines and
some business business logic can be
defined in the model your modular
responsible for providing the data from
the database and saving the data into
the theaters pro so any interaction that
has to be done with the database is done
by the model be it saving the data
retrieving the data abusing the data or
deleting the data so so a few things
that a model does it it puts your you
know checks and validations on your data
like for example which field will accept
a numeric value or you know let us say
if it is an email see you what format
will be acceptable to these kind of
checks and constraints so 34 things your
checks and constraints fetch retrieve
delete update data and any other kind of
business logic that is there in your
application will also be handled by the
mod so mod
are active representation of database
tables they can connect to your database
wearing it if instructed so by the
controller so the controller is like you
know it is actually what is controlling
the request what is the life cycle of it
where it goes what theater to fetch and
safety data to the database there is no
direct interaction between the model and
the view all that logic is handled by
the controller all right views define
exactly what is presented to the user as
I told you it collects data from the
user and gives it to the pin true to the
controller controller invokes required
model the controller pasta later to each
view to render it in some format
use can be described as template files
that represent their dead present their
content to the user so whatever data has
whatever data the model has fetched it
is given it to the controller Center let
me put it in some kind of a variable and
pass it on to the view so variable ad is
an object that reduces view our instant
with you controller of you should not
contain complex business logic only
elementary control structures to be
necessary to perform some particular of
operations for example let us say there
is a bit and you want to display the
date in a particular format so that kind
of logic in going your view you know the
difference format styles or let us say
you are converting a dollar value into a
rupee value knew that those my small
logics can go into the view however
bigger logics should be in model
preferably and if they are not in the
model max do max they can be in the
controller no heart for complex business
project should be there in your you
alright so controller um look as I told
you the controller binds the whole
pattern together a request to receive by
the controller it invokes the model
which in turn fetches the data it has
returned back to the controller the
controller then passes it on to the view
you renders it and then returns back to
the controller the controller will again
return the response so this the whole
controlling of life cycle or the flow of
your request is done by the controller
controller is intermediary between model
and view your controller contains the
logic of your application each
controller can offer different
functionality so as I told you let us
say my URL was my website calm / users
and I so all the actions pertaining to
the user will be there in the users
controller and at the same I URL is I
have requested for all the article my
website calm / article all the logic
pertaining to the articles fetching it
deleting it etc will be in the articles
controller and this this thing of you
know which controller to invoke based on
the request is done by your router will
be seeing router in a short while
so once request is received from the
client it executes appropriate business
logic from the model decide which you
display based on users request and other
factors pass along the data that each
you will meet and our hand off the
control to another controller entirely
so it will decide what to do with it
which which hbu to render so there might
be two views for you know let us say
there is a listing of users and there
are two to kind of use one which lists
all the users and one which lists the
paginated way so you know whether to
saudi pagination view or the normal view
is you will depend depend on some
parameters and this this decision which
view to render is taken by the
controller now i will make a directory
for MVC
literacy DMV think so I what I will do
is I will create a new rails app and
what it will do is it will it will be
your you know Oh project management kind
of a thing we're in a project can have
various tickets and a ticket can be
assigned to a particular person to do
that that is what we do for now we'll
probably see if you want to add more
functionality to it but this is the
basic of what we'll try to do his bundle
will take some time so what it does is
it install the gems that are required in
a rails app the basic gems so that is
wait for it to complete so have a
question from ajay sharma and he is
asking will raise automatically create
the director struck terriots for your
rails new application the commander
Taron field space new space application
we will create a real project for you
and it will instantiate a blank
application all your all your directory
structure will be available in that
application so yes it automatically
creates already directory structure will
switch to this will will theory into
this folder or tickity the blank rails
application so we had MVC here you have
tickity here so what it has done is it
has given you a basic directory
structure now the main folder that will
be dealing with is the app folder it
will contain ninety percent of a core so
this these are the model they are empty
as of now their new models as of now
these are your views will be you are you
still live here and this is your
controller folder are controllable but
control is to live here by default rails
has an application controller and any
further controller will be derived from
this controller so let's
just run this app Rios has command will
run your app and it would be available
on localhost 3000 Reyes is short for
real server so this is the default rails
page that we see this is the default
welcome page if you can see this page
that means your application is up and
running so let let's just create a first
model and killing the server you can
kill the server using control-c okay so
how do i regenerate a model in real so
you do a real G model and let us say my
model is called project and I want to
have a field called name so so this is
the syntax for a raise gene model
project and after that any any fields
that you want to specify so this name
will be by default a string field if we
want any other field in the other data
type we can specify it like this but if
it is a string field I do need to
specify yes this will create a model
rails is best to you know tried and
fiddled with on the next machine as you
can see this is pretty slow what it is
done is let's see our models now it just
created a project model if you see for
our raw activerecord DF is the one or
all your models inherit from
activerecord days so what this does is
it it Maps your your class to your
database table so the table will be
called projects and this class project
is mapped to it
all the rows will be available as
instances of this class and all the
columns will be the fields so let us see
so it what this command will do is if we
could create a model and it will also
create a migration who are migrations
live in Lord he be migrated folder so
let's see what is a migration now so i
just created this medication so what it
is telling rails is to create a table
called projects and have a spring field
in it for name and what time stamps does
is it adds two fields called created at
and updated at which will be
automatically updated we don't need to
handle them so anytime a record is
created it will the Creator at will be
populated with the current date and time
any time our record is updated your
updated add will be updated with the
current date in time so is this the this
command is generated to thing project
class and your migration so we will need
to run the migration for the changes to
take place the command to do it is ready
to be migrated so it is the migrated our
our our table and a table is in place
now so let us first also create a
controller for this
how do we create a controller we do a
real G controller
in the name of the controller a name of
the controller corresponding to our
project model will be called projects so
this is the this is convention who we
had a look in the slide for convention
over configuration so what this is is
that the drills does a lot of things by
convention for you for that you don't
have to write those things on your own
for example we have a project model and
the corresponding table for the model
will be called projects and the
corresponding controller for our for our
model project will also be called
projects intruder so you know rails
assumes a lot of defaults for you and
you do not have to write code for it
however you can override these defaults
so for example if I wanted my model to
have a different table name other than
my projects table I could have done
something like set table name
and you know if you see whatever it
doesn't matter but so this is by
conventional introspective projects but
no I don't want invention thing I want
to override it I want to configure it
myself so I can specify and configure it
so she notice we did not need to have
right we didn't write the name of the
table here it was automatically picked
by a convention all right we were
generating a controller so how do we do
it it is rails G controller projects and
name of the methods that the controller
will have let us say an index new and
sure i'll tell you what these are
already generated a lot of files with
seawater files are presented so it has
generated a projects controller which
derives from your application controller
it has created three methods and in the
views folder it has created another
folder called project and in this
project folder we has three views called
index dot HTML new dot HTML dot e RB and
short HTML oh dear there's another thing
that we need to do is open a route file
found sync now
file resides in a concept folder and
what it is added three routes so what it
will do is it will match a get request
to the project's index and a get request
to projects you another get requests
your projects or so we'll see what
happens not ok so let us type in our URL
or I didn't start the server I need to
start the server so our server has
started and let's see what is this what
would this URL do projects so what it is
given this no new no doubts matches
projects so what I was I need to do is I
need to add it out here
all the sources project let's see okay
so
have an error this is a pretty common
error in a window system so what you
need to do for this is we need to add a
gem for your gem file we open your gem
file
and the name of the gem is just just a
second i'll tell you a gem that you need
to have to fix this now just below your
coffee rails 10 you need to add another
gem fall of his script
source
and diversion is going to be one point
8.0
so what I'll do is kill my server and
just to a bundle update
office crypt source and locate my jam
now give meanwhile up
this is installing I'll take your
questions now
since prom Ajay Sharma what does these
files contain a basic level or two in
shape new projects or just blank file so
i am not sure which what is it that you
are referring to now but your model will
contain a blank model whatever what the
output of your generate model command is
a blank model oh you're can the output
off your rails g controller command is a
bare minimum controller with the actions
that you specified and use for them and
these views will contain you just
placeholder code another question from a
jay is which enter are my using i am
using sublime text if you are on mac you
can use ex-mate other than this there is
a specific Ruby a little foil the ruby
mine which is very good but are sublime
text is pretty good as well i also have
a question from Vinod does it also
create a stored by default this is what
we had in that index HTML or Thierry's
let me show you what has happened
our browser sent a request to localize
3000 now this is the default URL on
which your application will run in
development environment so it has enter
URL to local Oh 3,000 / projects so this
request landed in a routes file now what
our routes file did is with this line
what this time there is it created five
routes or I'll show you what routes look
like Windows is really tough I don't
know anyway so what this does work this
single line did it and what I'm doing
now is running the recruits the month
what this does is it lists all the
routes in our file in our application so
we will see whatever this resources
project line has produced this is
produced seven seven routes for if as
you can see here so what happens is when
my URL looks like this flash projects
and the HTTP verb is get so if i send a
get request if the browser tend to get
request to slash projects which is the
case here flash project that will just
lash projects what this will do is what
is the controller and the action it is
the projects controller and index action
at my request wheel / project and a post
request it would have landed in projects
controller create action
at my request being projects / knew it
would have landed and get requests it
would have landed in projects knew the
controller would be projects and
actually be new so on so this request of
mine the router has decided that it will
go to the blood / projects request will
go to the projects controller and the
index action so this is our projects
controller and the index action there
now what so this is an empty action has
a firm this action could have contained
poor to fetch all project where there is
no code as of now because we haven't
created any code project a stitch and
what this will do is by default by
convention it will render the index dot
HTML template in the projects folder in
the view folder of your apps folder so
this in there we will run whatever the
coder and this will be there available
in our and this file will be rendered so
this is what it has rendered projects
index and business immigration now let
us add some model code to it yep so let
us have a look at our products
controller and let us say we have you
connect so what we'll do is
you've done is we have collected all the
project project what all is a call to
the method is a call to the model this
project is a model and all is the method
defined or that by default so it will
fetch all the projects from the database
and it will assign this projects who are
variable now this variable or any other
variable that we define here any other
instance variable that we define here
gets passed on to index dot HTML there
is no project there is there is there
will be no data in it right now it will
we can't do anything with it but let me
show you if this projects is an empty
array what these does it so let us see
the view file for index the name of this
file is index dot HTML dot here we know
this HTML stands for
you have nervously it stands for that it
is an extreme inside this er B stands
for the fact that it is it has embedded
Ruby code so this embedded Ruby code
will be in you know under these you know
Angela brace and a person time and end
with again a percentage and I could have
written any HTML here let us say brought
it this thing and we are displaying if
the projects is empty or not let's see
how I didn't start myself again it's
like all right so let us see what was
dead oh I do not convert it to an array
let us convert
Oh looks like i'm using the wrong method
let's check in then
ok so it is given the length of 0 for
the underwater so let us have some cord
and let us create in project
you
so for this I need to action one is new
in this new action we will have a new
will instantiate a new project and we
will have another option for create
which will save this a few more things
that we will have here is
okay so we will what we'll do is we'll
define a method called Project param um
which will whitelist all the parameters
that are allowed or that that can be
updated via a post request so
project and warm it means only a name
can be
it now did not be a are what we'll do is
project
and
project or new if you notice the
difference between you and created that
it will have the patterns that a user
has been I'll show you what what this
means
rajat patterns and then we'll save this
project if gets aired will redirect to
the index page with the notice that
project has been saved successful all
right otherwise will render the new
template we'll just see what is code
means so what what what has happened
here is we have we have a new method
corresponding our new template you
projects you again this was in front of
you generated and we'll quickly write
some code in here so we have an h1 tag
which is new project and let us say I
have home for deezer this form for is a
helper created by given by rails and it
creates a form for us automatically we
don't have fake this is a night in it
will also see the state of the project
object in it and create and you know
create the form with the relevant URL
and relevant H citty people
this form contain this form will contain
an input field for a name of a project
all right so we have a phone for just
give some tips go to class or feel right
in the step we will have a label and
text field
what name will shortly see what whatever
what is the code that I'm what is it
that I'm doing trying to do with the
score
then we will create a submit button but
let's see what the status ok so let us
say let's go to project / me ok this is
the code that I've written so what
happens is my URL now is project / you
were out of my router has decided that
it will go to the project's controller
and new action what did this new action
do it see the embassy part of it what
what did to do is we interacted with
with your model which is project it
created a new an instance of it and
passed it on to our view now my view
that will be created by a default that
is that will be used for this action by
default is new so a new dot HTML now
here in our new dot HTML we had a header
you know part new project we have
created a form for the object that was
received from the controller that is at
the rail project and we created a field
for name and we created a submit button
now this song for what it does is if it
creates a form helper it is a helper
which creates a form and that gets
submitted to work create action so when
your phone gets submitted to a create
action it goes again it lands on the
router or to seize that it is a post
request and URL a'stache projects it
sends the request with the parameters to
our create method what it does is it
again creates a new object this time
with the parameters that we have sent
from the form and this method again is
defined here which is that fun only
permit names user can only input name
nothing else that will be saved
you can save this project with the save
command and if it gets saved to the save
and return a true or false we have this
get saved we will redirect to the
project's partner this projects path is
nothing but the index action and will
notice that the project has been saved
if there was some problem some
validation errors in there it will
render the new template so it will land
here and rear ender the new template in
the series in action or lettuce if my
name of my project is first project
muted it landed here so what did we have
in our in our index was the length of
the projects it's let us open our index
and list our projects you would just
displaying the length if you notice
earlier it was 0 now it is wine that
means our record got saved and we are
displaying the land so let me quickly
write some code or discipline the
projects i am just creating the table to
display
so what I'll do is I'll I trait over all
the projects for X dot each is in each
is nigh traitor in rupee
and I will display the name will also
display some links here that does just
display running
let me add a TR TD we write another link
just one league as of now for our
shortage in to link to the shore action
and so that she would see the output in
a minute alright so let's see ok
spelling stick ok so this is our project
listing again we can go to New
project
ok this is displayed so this is our
basic you know basics of MVC using we
creating a project the model is handling
the part where we are of instantiating a
new object where where we are fetching
new objects the controller is actually
making you know sending requests out to
the model to fetch fetch all the objects
and then passing it on to the view the
view is then displaying you know putting
some CSS on air or i tripping over them
and displaying all this attribute so
that is MVC for you now what we what it
over you that the other model will have
some you can have roots and validations
so let us add a validation
so what I want to say is that I want my
name to be always present form cannot
submit without a name let me just I
haven't displayed the error that fed go
to display the error in my new template
so let me just say
if project dot errors not in there any
errors here the students create a div ID
is Error explanation and mmm what I'll
do is I'll I treat over the errors
project or terrors dot messages message
what I'm essentially doing is I might
rating over the project's errors and the
messages and taking the message in a
variable message and call will call a
method over it or rather displayed that
is it let me just put this in a UL as I
Nora let's see now so we have added a
rule in a project or as I told you the
all the rules part of how you know of
saving the data are retrieving it
deleting yet updating it will be in the
model this is the first rule that I have
entered in my model which is the project
which says that validates name so i have
added a validation on my name attribute
which says that it has to be present so
and what I've also done is I have added
some logic to display any errors let us
say this is my this is my form for
creating a new project I create a
project I mr. here's the start
the errors first and see if there are
any okay there are errors let mr. move
let's just remove this and therefore nah
probably this is not displaying anything
let us see why this is not anything
let's try and print my name here let's
see let's get splint it basically I'm
just debugging why is it not staying
here to me it is coming here
move tu an ally as well hmm let's print
this way out here yeah it does not come
in here assignments the each I traitor
or in this not now so let's try to
create a new project and let us remove
this without any name and it says name
can't be blind so so we have added a
rule to our project which says that name
can be blank and by the principles of
our MVC it has it is what's in our model
not anywhere else now we can add
multiple rules here things like you know
checking the format of the email
checking the uniqueness for a name that
we want every project to have a unique
name stuff like that
guys who keep asking me any questions
if you guys have any questions keep
asking naruto what will now quickly do
is so whatever I have done their the
shortcut for all this i just showed I
just implemented all this so that I can
show it to you with the shortcut to for
all this is real cheese scaffold what
I'm trying to do is now create a ticket
that we create a model of you and a
controller and the necessary
mr. few thing row ticket will have a
title and a description which will be
text so let's see what will dazzle and
sorry I'm running over time I think I
started late so let me know if you guys
the marina rush
so it is inner terms added a lot of code
let's see what it has done what it is
done it is added a model
let me just plug in my charger just the
second place
alright so let's see what it has done
done so it is added a model called
ticket controller with all our actions
it has also added a folder for all our
actions as the holder for tickets and
all the views as well so let's enter
also generated a migration let me just
for creating tickets let me just quickly
my great but before this what I will do
is I will associate this with a project
so there's something called references
what it does is is it will add a foreign
key of project ID here so the key word
is references like this now I am going
to move it I am going to quickly
add my associations so what this will do
is it belongs to
our project this is for the Association
and
as I'm going to mute for a minute just a
second all right this belongs to a
project project has many tickets so
you're all this business level logic we
are going to write in a model so as many
tickets
I thing that our controller is missing
is its controller
okay it has everything actually so let's
let's see let's create a ticket as as we
notice the URL will be / ticket
I didn't start my server again all right
so one thing that I need also to show
you is nested route what I'll do is
unless this tickets in my project so
that my foreign key is going to exist
that is the ticket the object will have
a foreign key reference to the project
my routes will reflect that is them so
my routes will look something like
project / 1 maybe the idea of the
project ash tickets / new okay I need to
fix a few things here so let let's fix
ok so what would I need to fix here
nothing edit
but let's fix in there is nothing call
tickets but there is project under score
tickets park and you will have what
project here also we need to add a
function that will try to find project
so before action is the something that
fine you know that runs before any
action that we define it what so let us
say this will be finally set of function
concept ticket and it will run before my
new year and it actually all of them now
to define this
def set project third it project to
project so this again guys is the model
you know we are invoking the model to
find a project which is which is
provided in a parent's the desert
theorems the project I'd even you know
this one will appear in the parents
project ID wrong rotation sorry
again we will have to fix this fix it
out
let us let let's fix all that out in one
go there is no route here one thing that
we need to change is this okay so what
this does is it it sends the value for
project ID rather than just sending the
parameter sorta get it will send the
project ID as well or there we go so a
lot of issues there but yeah we have our
form and let us see we have not time we
are creating a ticket for this
particular project of ours and we have a
description you created it again we need
to fix our URLs okay so this again is
nested under project so let us fix the
URL we will forward it to watch it
and so this discuss will go to the
project show page and let us now let us
now display d tickets in a project show
page project dot ticket now we create
the association that why this message is
available to us not each do
we collect it in a variable called
ticket let us do let me know if you are
not getting any of this
this just is pretty ticket title and
will also display t it's in the
paragraph I'd live in should go in are
you know some you really like but we'll
put this in a paragraph and then we
project
four different name let's see
okay we need to find the project here in
our projects controller we store doing
he true so distance is given this is the
style of programming you reproduce the
error and you you know I'm deliberately
trying to do this so that you know you
can see the errors and get to know what
is it that I am going what is it that is
missing and you know by by defining the
error you will get to know exactly what
line will do what so we have four we
have you know we have invoked the
project model and now invoke the fine
method on it and we are trying to find
the the project which is supplied in the
parents ID and we are assigning it to
the project variable there we go so this
is my project
and it is displayed you know DD projects
to me
now let me just turn it let us try to
attach the ticket to it all right and
open the pickets controller so one thing
that I need to do here is let's check
the development logs
you
for this project let me open the log and
show it show to you what what is that it
that M that is happening so there is a
folder called logs available to us
alright so let the empty it one so that
you can see so let me try to create a
new ticket for you
so it landed us on the project show page
let's see what happened the URL that
went in that the URL that we went for
his project / 12 it's new so it is the
router decided that it will land on the
tickets controller new action and the
parameter was that was available to us
with the project ID we came to the
tickets controller what it did was it
landed on the new action it initialized
a new ticket that will work the model
new and it rendered the new template
what this did was it rendered it did you
know display your rob your title and it
rendered another file called form so
ticket got it / form this is the form
what it did was it took in the project
ID and the ticket in try to display any
errors if they were we haven't added any
validation so no errors it had two
fields for title and description and the
submit button this this holes of this
form for created or help is a helper
which will create a URL and which will
point towards e8 action so what created
was it created a new ticket here and if
the ticket got saved it went it
redirected to our project so page so so
sales are redirected to the first
project page we got to know that this
ticket this particular ticket was
attached to the first project
so these are two examples how how MVC
works we created a project the router
you know this guy you interpreted our
URL for us and it landed us to the
project controller the controller then
you know interacted with the model it
either fetch the data or you know save
data or something and then it performed
various options on it similarly for the
tickets now a ticket is associated to a
project and we saw how we have be nested
routes for that so you know but so what
are the approach that I try to do with
you is in order to show to you is to
produce an error and then show what
exactly is the line of code that you
know that would resolve that error so
that you get to know exactly what what
each line you know will help you do so
this is this is the basics of MVC guys
do let me know if you have any questions
so we saw what is conventional
configuration convention by convention
you know naming the table after a model
naming the controller name the views
everything that is by convention in case
you want to override it we can you know
express this explicitly specify and
override anything so this this makes
writing your code a lot lot simpler you
have to write Nestle code because by
conventional picks up a lot of things on
its own
alright so we saw embassy and what I its
benefits right a separation of concern
what your days with separate thanks
controller in separate your reason
separate thing yeah alloy development
ice separate teams since the code is
organized change is accommodated it is
organized and maintained it will support
multiple views
we had a demo
I'm open for questions all right guys
hope you got a comprehensive you what of
what is a missy and hope this will help
you get started with coding in riddles
thank you
you
