Java
okay Joe Joe is developed by Sun
Microsystems by James Gosling and
initially it started like you know it
was known as oak and later on it was
renamed to Java
some of the advantages of Java are
concurrent class-based object-oriented
okay what is what do you mean by
concurrency is parallel transactions
it's like more than one task at the same
time okay for example you can do in a
word doc you can type your text as well
as you know you can search for a string
in that so two tasks can run in parallel
if you look at gaming also right two
cards can move simultaneously so the
code must have written only for one car
but due to concurrency so the the code
can be executed multiple times you will
see as if more number of cars are seen
right so the advantages of concurrency
is that the speed rather than one task
you can do multiple tasks at the same
time if the speed increases right the
features of Java Java is simple it's not
very complicated to write programming
like any other programming language like
COBOL and all for for simple string to
display there you need to write 20 21
lines of code in COBOL but in Java it is
like one line if you just want to
display one hello world
Java has got lot of security features
and portable portable is since Java is
platform independent that means to say
you can write the code in Windows and
execute the code and Mac I mean to say
Java code in Windows compiled in Windows
take the code and run in another
operating system so it is easily
portable from one operating system to
another operating system in the sense if
I write a complete project in Linux I
can take and execute in Windows it's
very easy object oriented Java has
object-oriented facility robust
Java is very strong it has got exception
handling facility and lot of facilities
like that so that it is strong in C++ if
you consider the pointers are there due
to pointers there is tendency to crash
the program at many times since pointers
is taken internally by Java and not
allowed the developer to code in it then
the robustness of the program has become
more it's become much more stronger the
next is multi-threaded multi-threaded is
as I said in the previous slide
concurrent transactions you can perform
more than one task here thread is a task
multi thread means multiple tasks so
multiple tasks running at the same time
is one of the feature of Java what
happens when you run multiple tasks at
the same time the speed of the system
increases as I said if I can run 10,000
the same time the speed increases by 10
times right architecture neutral Java is
not depending on any architecture in the
sense like 386 486 CPU any CPU any
hardware it can run on it is not
depending on any particular hardware if
it if you can install Java on a system
then you can write a Java code and start
executing as I said the high-performance
see when it is multi-threaded right so
multiple tasks at the run at the same
time so it is the performance naturally
increases and the last point the
distributed it is not required Java the
one of the best feature of Java is
distribution it is not like I need to
run my pro entire project in one system
or one location I can in I can have the
Java put into different locations for
example okay one part of the module I
can put it in California another part in
some
in muslin another part in you are right
so I can distribute the modules of Java
and I can connect them without any time
intervention in no seconds I can connect
I'm like in a module from Boston to New
York
it's as if like you know the two systems
are keeping each other next to each
other
okay where Java is used Java is very
very popular extremely popular it has
taken almost 80% of the market share in
time in terms of development you take up
any system you have Java in it nowadays
like we have Mobile's
in mobile Android is very famous and
Android is developed in Linux on Java
like Java platform Java on Linux okay if
we can look at like you know it is used
in many of the pieces and even in
nobody's the program cars using software
and even for programming in cars also to
run the card some of the features of the
car to run automatically they use Java
Chrysler is one of the company which
uses Java for developing the software
for cars okay it's used for Android
applications it's used for Hadoop
applications and Java is used in lot of
frameworks like Hadoop spring hibernates
trucks so many tools and like it's it's
it's huge market about the Java right
and so it is used to develop business
process management tools web servers
some of the web service like the
GlassFish WebLogic websphere and sorry
Web Services is Tomcat application
servers like GlassFish WebLogic
websphere etc so Java is used for lot of
development in the current trend okay
some of the technologies of Java there
are like more than 50 to 60 technologies
are available in Java but some of the
the best technologies which is currently
used right now is like jsps jsps is
basically used to display web pages
display web pages it's like you can
develop web pages in HTML and include
Java also as part of it spring is a
framework which is used for spring has
almost almost all the Java technologies
in it and it is used for as a middle
layer of the project here I'm talking
about MVC architecture that is
Model View controller that is the front
in the middle layer that is the actual
logic will be performed and the back end
back ok the back end is the database
where you connect to the database and
get the data from the tables
so the first technology which came up
from Java to connect to the database is
JDBC so after that hibernate is a
framework which was built on to get the
data from the database hibernate is a
framework which is built on JDBC
technology it is very very easy in
hibernate you need not write complete
SQL you have certain methods in
hibernate where use at methods
internally hibernate converts into SQL
so you don't need to write SQL code and
hibernate that is one of the advantage
of highbury as I said before you have
many other applications many other tools
you can develop that is Android is being
developed web services are developed in
Java</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
