and failover happens so so on the right
side we have Hadoop one where we had
named node and it logs filesystem image
and there was secondly named node and
actually on the downs like the lower
bottom of the screen this is one dollar
recovery that you have named node then
you have a second renamed node and you
manually recover using the second name
node but if you look at the top screen
now you have active name node you have
standby name node and you have secondly
name node so skinny name hood is always
talking to active name node to do the
merging of the filesystem imogen edits
and then you have automatic failover to
standby node so you configure automatic
failover that if primary name node goes
down the standby automatically becomes
the primary name node which is active
and this one then will can be restarted
and brought to as standby so this is how
the automatic failover happens so
basically now we won't have a downtime
we don't have to manually start the name
node this name node standbys always
always ready in the read-only mode to
become active name not in case active
goes down so it just gets the control to
write to the metadata means it becomes
active otherwise it has just read access
to metadata it keeps on making sure that
it updates its metadata with the latest
updates that has happened in the primary
name nodes of metadata directory and
then it also gets all the block
information from the data nodes so
that's why this node is always ready to
become active name not in case a issue
arises and it has to become active so
what was it saying so if you have three
nanos and we need three more standby or
they can feel over for each other no
they cannot failover to each other Fe or
if you remember my screen I said was
each name notice independent it's not
going to talk to second name node it's
not going to do so if you want to
configure them as standby for the other
node you can do it but usually since
name node is memory intensive process
you would not want to do it right
because you just add another machine and
just make separate three standby name
nodes for each of those
so Muhammad is saying very selfish name
not Sarah yes because they need to make
sure that they serve their purpose
before doing social service for their
friend which is the next name Lord so
then the first thing is to make sure
that whatever they have been brought up
to do they should do that first they
should first of all make sure that they
are able to handle the requests coming
to them and handle the set of data notes
they have so which is why this federated
concept has been done because if not
then there'll be lot of basically
coordination they need to make sure that
the whatever metadata this name node has
second one here should have same copy
and multiple concurrency is gonna create
a lot of issues which is where they have
kept each of these name nodes to be
separate and just maintain and basically
monitor their own set of data no cells
have been assigned to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
