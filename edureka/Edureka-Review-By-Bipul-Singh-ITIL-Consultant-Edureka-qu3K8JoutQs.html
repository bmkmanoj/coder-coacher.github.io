15 plus years of experience you know in
the fleet of IIT and then I say I t as
per you know the the I have developed
the infrastructure have created the the
service architecture and followed the
IDL guidelines and you know the atty
strategy and support are currently i am
working as a director in a technology
company named as a Content our
technologies area of expertise is is an
IT infrastructure almighty service
delivery when i first visited a duvetica
i found that the course content and the
delivery part was extremely extremely
good and then after that i think i did
some for five courses with Eddie wake up
and I think I'm highlighted it very very
clearly that none of these programs were
directly related to my you know you know
the actual work profile I never did any
of the program you know on a duvetica
with respect to my professional
advancement it was for my living
obviously whatever you learn could use
it in one way or the other but it had no
direct relation with you know that what
am i learning and going to apply it on
the very next day or I am looking for
you know some changes it was for my
consumption for my learning and
obviously it will use in one way or the
other I think I think your lineage
always you know is a two-way my believe
is and and also it is not very
structured markup if you want to learn
it you can learn it you know anything
from anyone and you know it when I mean
to say anything much lever it doesn't
mean that somebody was not a master of a
particular field will teaching that
subject but I need to say anything is
like you know you can learn the the
other aspects the stock scales and you
know many other things for club it is
not only that the structured course
which you learn it when you come in a
book there are many things which you can
give it right from the communication to
you know the way of presentation this is
not the exact part of that the course of
the chapter so the learning i believe
always is the two wins
you know everybody can learn it from
everybody and it depends on that housing
material quality I per se will say was
exceptional very very very good and
moreover you know any of the instructors
never you know are active as you know
the kind of one-way communication it was
very open discussion you know all the
questions were appreciated and you know
try their best to answer it and most
more more often than not you know it was
on the same line and even they help to
understand the question at times if they
didn't understand the question or we
could not phrase it properly so so that
way no it was more a kind of I will not
say that the relationship was like you
know instructor instructor is not even
the right word it was more of a kind of
a discussion wave one guy who has the
more knowledge and experience is trying
to you know make it understood to the
every other participant in that that was
the kind of relationship which I said I
found it you know very very very good
especially on three parameters which is
the content part which is the delivery
when I say delivery then I am talking of
the instructors fault and then also of
your you know the the way you have
managed put it on the web and have
allowed it for the lifetime so a what if
I you know want to go and refer it I can
go and prefer it but had studied all my
30 40 jostles would change there and
that it's a very very very properly
structure answer I'm sure that better as
a done and you know enough research to
see to it because when you talk about
you know big data I do love you know you
can you can you can put so much content
that you know that people are not even
interested but it has been put in such a
manner that you know cooked it is
basically a you know creates an endless
and then it goes in such a chronological
order that you know 20
we keep learning in and moving to the
next level and which is making sense to
you so you don't lose focus in interest
if what do i do that if i go in put that
every content and then you know it is
not following an order and then I might
lose my interest also in focus x-ray and
the best part is this basically you know
one thing I would again like highlighted
that the line time or library which you
have given to us ever as I want to refer
anything I can immediately go back to
you and you know I can see to it I can
brush it on water I've done it that
videos also helps that you know ever if
I have missed or after some time I want
to go and refer those puppets so that
way that delivery that fit that the vi
divided into two one is that you're a
vision of em and one is immediately by
its top and I found both of them are
very structured and that that is also
one thing which you know one should
appreciate it he meant from home with
the ug did I forget about 3g I never
found any disturbance and in fact I ve a
moment Liz Lange of some forty my drink
45 in Libya's do it must be used for
some other reasons as well and you're
also using a very high bandwidth but it
has google act out is not very very
clear but trust me all the classes which
I did even from the poem on this 2g data
earth was flawless absolutely flawless
there was no diggity you know to me it
was perfectly same with these three in
md worse and let a couple of people
already think you're ever interested
please Gwen visit we find it very very
very interested then I name was not
promoting that was my actual personal
experience which i know i had shamed him
them and i wanted also that you know
that they could gain out of it who says
he you know keep those visiting going to
rake amount slits in a week looking at
something that you know new things
interesting coming show you know I carry
an entry level yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
