hash map in Java so the hash map is a
class which is used to perform
operations such as inserting deleting
and locating elements in a map you have
to create a map in which you pass two
kinds of values one will be the key and
the other will be value okay
using key and value pairs you'll be
putting those values in the hash map and
whenever you have to retrieve a value
you'll be using the key so that you can
use the value right so the map is an
interface map keys to the elements maths
are unsorted and unordered map allows
one null key and multiple null values
okay as I told you that the values are
stored in a format that is key and value
now the key could be a one key could be
null in the entire hash map and there
could be multiple values that could be
null in the entire hash marks okay so
remember this key act as indices and can
be any objects as well okay so this was
the overview of an hash map moving on
there are several methods available with
hash maps as well so you have got put
method object key and value simple
method enumeration keys it will face the
keys enumeration element fetch the
elements object get of you pass the key
and you'll get the object and with that
key the value that is associated with
that particular key contains earth key
if you want to check whether this is
present in this hash map or not you'll
be using the contents key moving on
contains value you'll have to pass the
key and yeah if you want to check you'll
be using this method object remove you
pass the key and you can remove the
object if you want to sighs you'll be
using the size method and if you want to
convert it into string you'll be using
two strings okay so these are several
methods that are present that you can
use along with a hash map the diagram
right here this is the way the hash map
gets created these are the elements
ideas right you can place the key and
there could be a corresponding element
like this that is Ravi Rajeev Megha
Sonny these values can also be empty
these could be null multiple values
carbonyl in the hashmap
now let's see how to use it a shop says
yes
same as associative array Nikhil says
banks is yes now create a hash map you
use the hash map keyword hash map equals
to new hash map putting elements hash
map port you pass the key and you pass
the value passed the key you pass the
value like this you are putting the
values inserting the values into the
hash map now how to display the values
you get an isolator I trade R equal to R
theta equals to hash map entry set dot i
traitor this is the difference than RLS
because the values are actually present
in a set right so for that you'll be
using entry set dot I traitor okay you
get the entry set and then you run the I
theta so you'll get all the sets into
the I theta after that while I traitor
has got next you write map dot and three
entry data entry mapped out and three I
traitor dot next that entire set will
come here then using the entry you can
get the key separately and using the
entry you can get the value separately
and you can use it in your program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
