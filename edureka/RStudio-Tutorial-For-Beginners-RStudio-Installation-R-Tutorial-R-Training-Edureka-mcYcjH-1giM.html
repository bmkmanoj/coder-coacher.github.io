session my name is Gotham well mind I'll
be giving you an overview of our and our
studio there is not a chat a lot of buzz
in the industry about our and our studio
so today's session is dedicated to
getting an overview of what exactly is
happening in the statistical world and
how are in our studio are changing the
paradigm for advanced analytics all
right okay brilliant so let me set the
context before we dive deeper into the
discussion so how is essentially you
know it's an open source programming
language and it find its route to the
statistical computing requirement that
arose a few decades back and that is
when you know the programming language s
came into existence so I find its roots
to this programming language by the name
s s was essentially developed few
decades back you know by John Chambers
while he was working at Bell Labs right
so essentially our finds its roots to
the original language by the name s
which was there which came into
existence a few decades back alright
however you know in the last decade or
so R was essentially evolved from the
University of Auckland by the two
gentlemen by the name rawski Hakka and
Robert gentlemen all right and a lot of
speculation was out there that I was
essentially named as a tribute to these
two gentlemen who have their names
starting with arch okay so yeah so
basically you know about a decade back
or so ash was created and originally the
entire code for R has been written in C
and Fortran and R as well all right the
beauty with R is that it's a language
that's very close to where you know be
of a high level languages that we have
for instance sequels of the world and
that is one of the major reasons why
our has gained so much popularity
amongst the data science and analytics
world all right and there is a joke that
goes around with respect to RSL that is
a programming language of
non-programmers all right so if you're
an our expert you'll basically learn the
language that has its roots to the
statistics side all right and as I was
saying I have been you know the open
source lingua franca with respect to
data science and analytics world and the
very reason why it's so popular is that
it's open source and it has lot of
people contributing packages functions
libraries etc to its evolution alright
so that is one of the major reasons why
our is so popular amongst the folks of
this community
ok now on that part let me you know
start talking more about the two IDE
that is our studio and our GUI in
general all right so what you're seeing
right now on the screen is the authentic
plain vanilla our GUI ok and the method
or the way to actually obtain this is by
going on this website by the name cran
dot our project.org alright this is
where you know the comprehensive our
archive is present essentially this is a
website that's contributed by the the
open source community and depending on
the operating system that you're running
you know you can actually go ahead and
download the respective cran package
alright so once you actually download it
you can actually install it and this is
what it looks like once you have it up
and running all right this is the base R
as we have been talking about alright
now as I was talking about there is a
major misconception out there in the
industry that are and our GUI are
substitutes to each other all right
that's most certainly not the case ok so
are essentially the base pack back
absolutely essential in case you want to
run our studio right and it's not the
other way around all right
basically if you want to run our you
don't really need our studio as a base
pack all right so our studio is like an
encapsulation it's like a wrapper on top
of the base arch which essentially gives
a good look and feel it improves the
user interactive ability of a tool and
it makes you know the users capable of
doing multiple tasks in the same
application all right and we'll be
looking at how our studio scores over
are and just a while from now right so
let's get this absolutely straight our
is essentially not a substitute or our
in our studio are not substitutes to
each other they actually work in tandem
all right and for beginners it's always
handy to actually start exploring arch
before they can actually lay their hands
on our studio the very reason is for
someone who's actually beginning their
journey our studio can be a little too
overwhelming right because of TR the
information that it exposes you to right
so it's always good to actually get your
hands dirty on the base version of art
and then start exploring our studio
right okay so on that part let me give
you an overview of our console in
general right so this is essentially the
script or this is essentially the pane
where you do complete scripting and this
is also where you'll be seeing a lot of
results of the computation have you know
you're processing it's a job that you do
in your environment all right as you can
see there are multiple tabs present over
here depending on the utility you can
actually go here and choose to save your
environment save your workspace and then
review whenever you want to come back by
default there are a set of packages that
come in the base R as well right and you
can in case you're interested in loading
specific packages
perform specific applications or
computations you can actually go ahead
and install the package at your own
behest okay and at any point of time if
you're interested in in seeing more
content information manuals etc
pertaining to R you can actually go here
and see go through the FAQ you know
policy be manual download the manuals
look at the are functions etc cetera
right so very very open-source community
you can actually you know see that there
is phenomenal amount of information
available out there if you want to get
started in learning are alright and you
know there is no dearth of information
available on the cran website as well
the one that we were seeing a while back
and obviously you know the major reason
for that is that it's an open source
community which is contributed by
thousands of people across the world all
right so this is it about the base are
as you can see it's an extremely basic
version which doesn't have you know lots
of frills and fancies alright and that's
one of the reasons why we actually
needed a more advanced version of our
which can be you know little more
attractive and which can do multiple
things right now that's where our studio
comes into the picture alright so for
downloading our studio you can actually
go on the website our studio comm
depending on your requirement you can
actually both and download the our
studio X exe file alright and there are
commercial licenses to this as well
because I mean for enterprises they're
not really comfortable of accessing the
free application they always look to
find that someone who's caller they can
hold in case something goes wrong right
so that's exactly the reason why there
is an Enterprise Edition to this as well
right as most of you would contour
company wouldn't be very comfortable
with your leaving production ready
solutions on an open
course - right - in order to meet the
enterprise SLA that we have an
enterprise addition to this as well and
even beyond our studio we have some of
the others of I des for I for instance
Microsoft our server is another one
right and one of the areas where our
server is advantageous over our studio
is that Microsoft our server
leverages multi-threading right so the
open source our studio or the enterprise
our studio is single threaded
that's why Microsoft our servers
incorporates multi-threaded application
where it can run several processes in
parallel all right so that is our server
comes into the play alright so coming
back to our studio this is where you can
actually download the version that you
are interested in and once you have it
up and running this is how it will look
in your console all right as you can see
lots more information depicted over here
for your usage and as you can see you
know a lot more functionality than the
base are all right and you can always
play around with the tabs that are
present over here depending on your
usage all right so without any further
ado let me introduce you you know - the
major advantages that our studio has
over the base are ok as you can see our
console doesn't really have a separate
you know I should say the script window
doesn't really have a separate
environment over here and it doesn't
really have a history tab his room right
as you can see over here our studio has
a history tab as well where you can
actually see what all commands you have
executed in the recent past and then
make use of it
ok and the environment is where whatever
variables I initialize will reflect all
right as you can see I just initialize
the variable a with the value 1
and that's what reflecting over here in
the environment all right however if I
do the same command over here they go it
doesn't really show much right so that's
you know a key difference between the
two over here right another very useful
thing of our studio is that it has a
separate painful plotting it has a
separate thing for the help as well
right so in our at any point of time if
you're not clear with something or if
you see that you want information about
something you just run that command
basically the name of the package or the
function or the library with just a
question mark in front of it all right
just when you do that you'll see all the
possible health information related to
that in your studio all right
the same thing is absolutely possible
over here as well it's just that you
know it's actually you know not as easy
to interact with alright as you can see
it's actually thrown me out of our onto
the website where all the information is
available all right that's one of the
key differences right I don't really
want to get out of it and actually look
at some website for whatever help I need
right I should be able to look at the
information the basic information over
here and if needed I should have an
option of moving out of it all right
that's one of the major advantages that
our studio has over our alright another
very important feature over here is that
at any point of time if you feel you're
more comfortable with using the console
or the command line version just like
you use any other application in UNIX
etc you can actually open up the shell
version of arc
right so as you can see over here I'm
actually opening up the shell version of
our right so whatever I am doing or
whatever I can do on the our studio in
general I can do all of it over here
right let me try to run the same hand
over here there you go
it's run completely variable right so it
gives me the option of running command
line applications as well right
okay let's try to initialize another
variable over here
grow right so if executing it's
aggregating properly right and at any
point of time you want to get out of it
and work on the conventional art studio
just close the button and you'll be back
all right now something you know very
phenomenal or something very appealing
that I personally you know really like
is there is lot of option of customizing
you know the look and feel of my art
studio all right let me quickly show you
how I can actually customize the
appearance of my our studio in general
okay all right never mind right so let
me quickly give you an overview of the
different panes that PC over here in our
studio right now as you can see the
major difference is that I'll have just
one pane that it works on however our
studio has four different panes all
right the top left is supposed to be
used just for scripting right whatever
script you want to build you can
actually do it in the top left pane
console is also used to execute your
command the major difference is that you
can't really do the scripting in the
console
all right so whatever ad hoc amounts you
want to run you can actually do it from
here right
right so whatever commands you want to
execute you can actually execute it over
here as you can see where I've just
executed the command to see what time is
it right now all right so it's giving me
you know the exact result as per the
expectation the major difference is that
I cannot do scripting over here all
right I can't build a script over here
right so that's the major difference
between the two panes whatever I execute
over here will reflect over here for
instance let's try to view a data set so
R comes with you know default data set
that one can work with
all right so I can actually you know
pull the data into my working
environment and start working with it
all right so that's exactly what I have
done over here and let's try to view the
data set in general right so this is how
the data set is looking I can always
click over here and see the various
columns that exist in my data set along
with an introductory you know set of
values for the same all right when I do
the same over here there you go
it provides me with the exact
information over here it says right
there is no interactive feature of drag
and drop and viewing the data set in the
environment in the base art package all
right
now another very good feature with our
studio is I can actually view my data
set by keying in the command view all
right gives me the data in a very very
interactive fashion as you can see I can
actually use filter operators if I want
to see any specific set of values over
here which is not really an option in
general in art all right let's try to
execute that here as well see it gives
me a very base very basic version of the
view all right
with not a lot of customization options
right so that essentially makes it you
know a little more fun to work in our
studio right I can actually play around
and do lot of things with this data set
over here ok moving on over here you
know whatever plots i generate they
appear in the bottom right pane over
here alright so let's try to plot
something over here
so to give you an overview the status it
is is essentially about flowers right so
it's actually giving the data set is
giving the the measurements in
centimeters of the various variables
such as sepal length which petal length
and petal width all right for
respectively around 50 flowers right it
also gives me an overview of the
different variables that are here all
right so let's go ahead and compare the
length and the width all right the idea
is to see whether there is some sort of
a relation between the length and the
width
all right whether there is any
correlation between the two or not okay
all right so this is how it looks over
here I can actually zoom in to see
whether there is any correlation between
the two or not all right
so looks good to me all right let's try
to do this the same thing over here as
well right another beautiful thing that
you will notice over here is if I try to
type something over here as you can see
our prompts me with the completions or
the complete information that I would
need to complete this all right as you
can see it's prompting me and when I
press dollar over here to referral to a
specific column it's also prompting me
the different columns that exist in this
dataset all right
very very user interactive very very
interesting however if I try to do
something similar over here well our
disappointment all right it's actually
not giving any useful information over
here it might not be really really
useful in this scenario in particular
however it's extremely extremely useful
in cases where you're actually working
with data sets that have thousands of
rows or thousands of columns okay so in
those scenarios it's very important to
have such a feature all right and not
just this you know in case I'm
interested in working on a function
right
for instance plot right it gives me
complete information
about what all attributes should go in
what this function is all about a brief
introduction on it along with you know
some sort of syntax around it all right
I can actually drag through I can
actually drop through the whole list of
functions that are matching my search
criteria and you know the beauty is that
I didn't really press anything it's just
giving me on my own okay on its own and
if I do the same thing over here well
nothing really
alright so that's another one of the
major differences that exist between the
two yeah right so these are you know the
the major contributors or these are
essentially the factors why our studio
has gained so much popularity over here
let's try to plot the data set over here
as well
for the conveniences I'll conveniently
go ahead and copy the text from there
there you go right so I have a very very
interactive very very useful information
around the plot as well right
as you can see over here doesn't give me
a lot of options of playing around with
this information okay
very very counter to contrary to what we
are seeing over here every plots that I
get I have an option of saving it as we
made saving it as a PDF copying on the
clipboard etcetera etcetera all right
I can even publish it using our markdown
right that's a conversation for another
day
right so bunch of things that we can do
in our studio which is not you know
really practical or possible over here
in the base are right and you know you
can actually have multiple ways of doing
the same thing for it since over here
there is a button to run just the
current line or the selection and then
you can actually here on the previous
code region completely all together
right so lot of things to play around
with over here I can use these buttons
to actually maximize minimize these tabs
depending on my usage my convenience you
know a bunch of things that can be done
over here all right so I would suggest
that someone who's actually starting
their careers will be statistical
programming and advanced analytics
should actually get more comfortable
with how the base are works because let
me tell you this much the the syntax
there is no syntax is absolutely the
same it's just that you know our studio
makes it way more fun and way more
exciting to work on all right makes life
very exciting as a data scientist or as
an analytics expert alright so get your
hands dirty on the base are and then
that you can actually go ahead and
install our studio and you know start
exploring the the different different
windows different options
that are present over here and you will
see the you know the exact power of fire
studio all right okay brilliant so on
that note I would call it a day and I
would like to close the session all
right thank you very much and please do
