Rica and I'm very excited today to be
alive on YouTube so welcome to this live
session on tableau and today we will be
discussing about tableau will understand
how beneficial this tool can be to find
out different insights and today we'll
be doing a customer product analysis
using the super store data in tableau so
this is what we will be covering today
so at first we'll understand what is
tableau what is this all about
and then we'll understand how trending
or how popular it is is that really that
good that we should use it right away
so we'll find that out and after that we
will understand the need of data
visualization that why is an analysis
just enough why to visualize the data
and then moving on we'll get to the
basics of tableau and finally the
hands-on part where we will be doing the
customer product analysis so I think
that you guys find the agenda quite
interesting so without wasting any more
time let us move on to our first topic
which is what is tableau so tableau is
set to be the groundbreaking data
visualization software that is created
by tableau software so why is it it is
because tableau can connect to many
different data sources and can visualize
larger data sets compared to any other
bi2 so once in tableau
it shows the basics of all the users
data and the users can perform different
operations they can drill down into the
data sets and then from there they can
apply various visualizations to the data
it also gives you the depth of discovery
it is because the features of tableau
gives the users ways to answer questions
as they investigate through the data
visualization created with tableau so
the solution can show different basic
trends like predictions questions like
What if queries and you can adjust
everything hypothetically and visualize
all the components of data dynamically
for different comparisons this is how
tableau enables you to make very crisp
and clear insights
and then now let us move on to see what
is the trend the tableau trend so the
picture that you see in front of you is
the Gartner's Magic Quadrant now Gardner
performs analysis on all the different
BI tools according to their performance
and as you can see tableau stands in the
leaders and it is among the top BI tools
according to Gartner now I'm not saying
that Gartner is saying that an all no
Gartner does a very good analysis and
that is why tableau is currently the
leader among all the BI tools that is
available in the market so you can see
there are others Microsoft who is a
little lower than tableau there is click
the click view and click sends all
tricks then there is Pentaho quite in
the nisha players quadrants so tableau
is currently the leading bi tool and the
most popular one it is because it is
very easy to use you will know that
later on I'm going to show you in the
hands-on part and now let us see the
tableau product family so tableau has
got various software so the so the
parent software is the tableau desktop
so this is a self-service business
analytics and data visualization that
anyone can use so it will help you to
translate pictures of data into
optimized queries and with tableau
desktop you can directly connect to data
from your data warehouse or any kind of
data base you can connect to and Amazon
redshift you can connect to your Oracle
database my sequel database you can
connect to pretty much any file in your
local file system a CSV file or an excel
sheet wherever your data is present it
is that powerful in connecting with
external sources as well as in your
local file system ok so you can also
perform with tableau desktop you can
also perform different queries without
even writing a single line of code so
you can just import all your data into
the tableau state engine from multiple
sources and it can also integrate them
all together by combining multiple views
in interactive dashboard and then there
is the tableau server so it is more of
an enterprise level tableau software so
you can publish your dashboards with a
tableau desktop and then share them
throughout the organizing
with the web-based tableau server so it
leverages fast databases through life
connections and then there is the
tableau online so this is a hosted
version of tableau server which helps
makes the business intelligence faster
and easier than before so you can
publish the tableau dashboards with
tableau desktop and you can share them
with your colleagues in your office and
then there is the tableau reader so it
is a free desktop application that
enables you to open and view
visualizations that are built in tableau
desktop so you can do various kind of
operations with the worksheet or the
visualization that is in your tableau
reader you can filter out you can drill
down but you cannot edit it so it is
just meant for viewing a worksheet that
someone else has created and you can
just perform some manipulations on it
but you cannot just change it entirely
with the tableau reader and then there
is the tableau public so this is a
freeze tableau software which you can
use to make visualizations but you need
to save your workbook or your worksheets
in the tableau server and it is public
to everyone it means that anyone can use
it anyone can download it onto their
local system and then perform some more
variations on it
so basically tableau public and tableau
desktop are the same there are
difference in few options but the only
difference major difference is that in
tableau public you cannot save your
workbooks you have to publish it on the
tableau server so here are the different
software's that tableau gives you so
we'll be using tableau desktop today we
are using the 10.2 version and now
before we move on and perform different
visualizations on our data we need to
understand that what is the need of data
visualization why the this tools like
tableau and other visualization tools
are coming into play so what are you so
here is an example before you so will
you have you're seeing in front of your
screen is the ants combis core tree so
there are the X&amp;amp;Y points that you can
plot
a graph so if you see it closely if you
see the numbers here in every quarter
the numbers are pretty much the same
right so the x-coordinate here is 10
similarly in 2 it is 10 then in 3 it is
also 10 and 4 it is 8 or something and
even the y-coordinates if you compare it
it is pretty much close so if you think
if you just see the numbers you can
think that ok since the numbers are same
maybe the lines will look slightly
different or maybe they will be pretty
much similar right with the numbers it
says so right that they are quite
similar they are very close the number
seems very close but if you visualize it
once you plot it in a graph you can see
that after you plotted the lines and the
points they look completely different
even though the numbers are same once we
plotted this gives you a squiggly line
this gives you a curved line this is a
pretty much a straight line and this is
a vertical line parallel to the y-axis
so you can see that this was not
possible to identify just by seeing the
numbers we have understood that they are
completely different lines only once we
have plotted it or only once we have
visualized how each of the points would
look like when they are plotted in a
graph it is very much similar to your
company's data now you might have all
the data all the numbers all the correct
numbers in your sheets but you cannot
make clear-cut insights with that
because numbers don't show you
everything you have to visualize it and
that is why there are so many
visualization tools coming up and is
highly used in every other company in
order to make an analysis and
visualizations in order to make reports
so that they can find out different
insights from it so this is just an
example to show you the need of
visualization so I hope that you have
understood it and you have understood
the importance of visualization and
tableau will help us to do that so now
before we move on to the demo part to do
the customer analysis so we will
understand some of the basics of tableau
so we'll start by understand
the different data types that tableau
uses so the first one is boolean you all
know what boolean is that is basically
true or false values that is the same in
tableau then there are whole numbers all
the integers or sorry all the natural
numbers with 0 and then there are the
decimal numbers which are fractional and
then here are some of the data types
that tableau uses there is a date and
timestamp so you can see that the date
is written in such a way that first the
month comes and then the date and then
the year and then in timestamp it is
like first you mentioned hours then the
minutes and colons and whether it is
a.m. or p.m. and then the other data
type is text or a string so an example
is at Eureka and this is one very
special a data type which is the
geographic values you can pretty much
plot any map on your tableau worksheet
if you have God the geographic values it
means that you can plot latitude if you
have the latitude and longitude
coordinates you can pretty much plot any
graph any world map on your tableau
worksheet ok so this is a very much
popular in order to visualize your data
across different regions so we'll also
be using that so here are the different
tableau data types and now let us come
to measures and dimensions so dimensions
are basically a field that is an
independent variable and measures are
dependent on dimensions independent in
the sense that they do not need anything
else to describe them and but measures
need dimensions to describe them in a
meaningful way so usually a dimensions
are text and measures are numbers so let
me give you an example to understand
what are dimensions and measures so
dimension is basically like ok let me
start with measures so that I can relate
to the dimension so measures is like
let's say a sales number so let's say
that you're saying that my sales profit
is 41 thousand dollars so it doesn't
actually convey
anything that much right so with
dimensions if you say that my sales
profit for the product ID number two is
forty one thousand that comes as a more
meaningful way so this is a distinction
between measures and dimensions so
basically in tableau if you see your
data it is divided in two dimensions and
measures and he used them in order to
plot different graphs or in order to
make different visualizations so now
comes the demo part so here we will be
using the superstore data so the
superstore data comes with tableau
itself if you installed tableau desktop
the status that comes with the tableau
software tablet desktop software itself
so the superstore here sells various
appliances like tables chairs
electronics etc so there are many
products so what we're trying to do is
that we're trying to find out some
insights about what is wrong with sales
and what exactly can be improved in
order to get a healthy profit so we'll
find out so for that we'll find out
which customer segments are the elite
buyers that help the superstore to
profit and which are the products that
they are buying so that the superstore
can get more of those items in order to
improve their profit and their sales so
let us begin without wasting any more
time let me go to my tableau dick stop
so here is the sample superstore data so
you just click on it alright so here you
can see there are the dimensions and
these are the measures so the dimensions
are showed in ABC and the measures are
shown with a green hashtag alright and
there are also different hierarchies
like if I have a dimension product so
there are hierarchies inside the product
that there are category and subcategory
and similarly location there is country
state you can drill it down to country
state city postal code etc so in order
to find out let us first see that which
are the items or which are the
appliances that are making different
profit so in tableau you
understand how easy it is all you have
to do is drag and drop all dimensions
and measures into the rows and columns
section so in the rows first I'm going
to take the subcategory and then here
I'm going to take the sales so here it
is you can sort it in ascending or
descending as you want it so if you
wanted an ascending you can just click
this little button over here so we
wanted an a descending order so you can
see that the sales of phones as highest
right so and then the second are chairs
then storaged
and then tables
you
all right so I hope that you guys can
see my screen now
okay so I'll wait for some confirmation
if you can see my screen now all right
so I will repeat what I just said I'm
really apologized for that inconvenience
so here is where you can find the sample
superstore data set so here is the so
you just click on it so now I've already
dragged and dropped it so I'll just tell
you you can see that here are the
dimensions and here are the measures so
the dimensions can be seen by with an
ABC and the measures are shown with a
green hashtag over here alright so and
then I also told you about that there
are hierarchies that in the dimension
also so you can in order you can see
that the hierarchies you can drill it
down to order date order ID and in
product there are hierarchies like
category subcategory etc so the first
thing that I was trying to do or what I
already did as you can see in my screen
is that I wanted to find out that which
are the highest selling products in my
superstore so the thing I did is that
okay let me just show you once again
I'll remove it so the first thing I did
is that I dragged and job the
subcategory into rows and then I took
sales into columns and then I have
sorted with it with this little button
over here and descending order so that I
can see that which are the highest
selling product so I can see that phones
are the highest selling product in my
superstore then the second is chairs
then storage then tables binders
machines and fasteners don't really sell
too much so if you're just hover over it
you can also see that what is the sales
amount this is $3,000 phones are three
hundred and thirty thousand dollars but
now I also want to see that which are
the products that are making profit so I
have a measure here that says profit so
I'll just drag and drop into the color
and here you can see that there is a
color scheme if
going through the orange part of the red
part it means that it is not profitable
and the darker the blue the more
profitable it is so for phones you can
see that it is the highest selling
product and it is also very profitable
but you see that tables are the fourth
most selling products but the profit is
negative so you didn't know about that
right until you have seen and compared
this and you can see that comparing is
so easy so you can visualize that tables
are at loss and phones are the highest
selling products right so here I will be
naming my sheets so you can like create
different sheets so I will rename it to
highest selling products let's say all
right and now let us create one more
worksheet we'll do something else right
now so now since I know that ok phones
are selling so let's do some forecasting
whether the phones are going to get sold
throughout different years or not and
what are the possibilities that some of
the some of my products other products
might get sold in the coming years
according to the sales number if they
are increasing if their sales are
increasing maybe the coming years
they'll increase more so we'll do some
forecasting now this is very much
popular in tableau you can do
forecasting and the visualization that
you see are pretty accurate because
tableau uses a multi multiplicative
algorithm for forecasting data which is
very accurate alright so here what we'll
do is that we will take years so we'll
take the order date over here and ok
here is selected you can also drill it
down to quarter or month or more so but
we'll leave it to be years all right and
then here we will take the appliances we
had the subcategory and then also my
sales
so you can see that so the sales all
right so now so here are the sales for
each of the subcategories alright so you
can also sort it again
alright so here are all the sub sub
categories and now we'll do some
forecasting so for forecasting can go to
the analysis button over here and then
you can click on show forecast
so it'll pretty much show you that
whether the sales are getting increase
or not and you can see that for this
accessories part the sales are estimated
to be increased right they will get
increased to 72 thousand dollars and now
it is around forty one thousand dollars
so maybe you can purchase more
accessories and stop them up more in
your superstore because the forecasting
says that the sales will increase and
for appliances and for then binders it
is forecasted to be decreased I don't
think you buy a lot of binders right so
here are different forecasts that you
can make so it also shows you the trend
line of what is the particular sale
going in so and very good thing about
tableau is it chooses that what kind of
graph will fit best for the
visualization that you're choosing and
apart from that you can also click the
show me tab over here and you can choose
any kind of visualization so I think
that the trendline fits best in this so
here is a forecasting that we did and we
are going to rename this sheet and we're
going to say forecast all right
and you can do some more analysis to
find out this as just the sales again
the profit also matters right for since
in the earlier sheet we have seen that
even though tables sell they don't make
more profit so you can also take profit
and put it into the color section and
then the forecast if it's gone
alright so it shows that and for
machines the sales is the profit is
going lower right so if you would still
want to see the forecast again alright
so we'll leave it like that so we have
named it as forecast and now we will do
some more analysis so we'll create a
different worksheet for that right so
now let us find out that which are the
geographies where my sales are going low
or where the sales are more so for that
I will be taking my geographic locations
alright so the latitude and longitude
are going to be in my measure since they
are numbers like coordinates or numbers
so longitude I'll put it into columns
and latitudes here alright and then I
will sort it according to the profit
so let us put some more details so it
has loaded the map so if you need to
provide more details so here we will put
let's say the country and also the state
let's sit to find out which are the
states that makes the more profit so
here again the color scheme says that
the doc is the blue the more the profit
so you can see that Texas is in los and
the highest profit is in California
perhaps with seventy six thousand
dollars yes so you have so here you can
make different insights you can find out
that which are the regions that you can
pay more focus on right and next let us
okay so first we'll rename the sheet so
let me name it profit region wise so now
let us make one more sheet and what
we'll do now is that we'll try to find
out that which are our elite customers
or which are the customers were buying
more products from us because which
we're able to make so much profit right
so for that what we will do is that we
will take this so we'll find the
customer segment here so we are adding
the segment into labels okay so here are
our different customer segments we've
got consumer corporate and home office
then what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to find the sales into my size so
this pretty much tells me that if the
size is bigger that means my consumer
here which are actually individual
persons who purchase it corporate is
corporate buyer then there are a home
office so you can see that the area here
tells me that consumers are individual
people buy a lot from us
and let us refine this visualization
even more so we'll also find out the
profit so four colors will put some
profit over here
so here the profit as you if you just
hover on that you can get all the
details right so here it says the profit
is one hundred and thirty-four thousand
dollars here it is sixteen thousand and
here it is ninety one thousand okay so
here we have found out that the
consumers here the individuals buyers
here are the most profitable who buy a
lot of stuff from us right so you can
also do one thing you can add some more
filters in order to find out that what
are the different products they are
buying so what we'll do is that in the
filter section will add the subcategory
alright so here let us put all and okay
alright so with the filters what you can
do is that if you select all obviously
it will just show you it is showing the
total sales but if you want to see four
appliances which are the most profitable
again the area shows that it is consumer
alright so you can also put profit in
the color again the profit above the
darkest color here shows consumer you
can check for tables because tables were
quite controversial so again the profit
and the consumer section for tables is
more as compared to Home Office or
corporate for phones you can check again
it is the consumer so here with all this
visualizations you have found out that
who are your buyers who buy a lot of
stuff from you and what are the products
they are also buying from you so in the
end if you want to show it to your
manager or you want to present it to
someone you can just combine all the
sheets together in a dashboard so first
I will just name this as let's say
customers so this is the button here
that will help you to create a new
dashboard and here you can just drop all
your sheets here so you can drop your
sheets like the highest selling products
you can also just the area that it is
covering alright alright we'll adjust it
after putting all the others so here is
the forecasted sheet then you can go
ahead put the profit region wise that we
have calculated you can also view it you
can zoom in you can zoom out it can play
around with it then for the customer
section with the filter
all right so this is how you can put all
your sheets in dashboard and you can
just go ahead and save it if you want so
this will be saved in your My Documents
folder if you're using tableau desktop
if you're using tableau public you'll
have to save it you have to publish it
in the tableau server so and this will
be saved as a dot twb file as different
workbooks so this is how you can make
different visualizations you can use the
show-me tab here in order to find out
which visualization suits best so if you
want to change it put it into a
different graph like this but it is very
important and if you just play around
with tableau for some more time you will
understand that which visualization
actually fits best right so this doesn't
give me much idea as it takes me some
time to compare all the boxes that which
is the bigger one but if you put this or
the ones that we use the bar graph okay
so alright anyway you can just go around
and play with it so this shows the
profit or sales altogether you can use
scatter plots and different such things
so this is what you can do with tableau
can go ahead and try it out the tableau
desktop has a 14-day trial so you can
play around with it and you can also
purchase the license if you liked using
it and of course because it is so easy
to use right so this was all about a
very basic so that you can get started
