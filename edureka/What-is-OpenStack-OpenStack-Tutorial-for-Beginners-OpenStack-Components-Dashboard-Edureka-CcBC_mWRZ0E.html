an instructor with a Eureka for
mastering OpenStack okay so let's get
started before before we begin with the
introduction to OpenStack let me start
with an introduction about myself I am
Sonia and I have been into mastering of
OpenStack with ed Eureka for for a long
time now professionally I am into VMware
infrastructure bill I have been into
private cloud I have been into Verizon
private cloud I have been into Telemark
cloud mostly compute mostly the computes
and the storage and now I am into
OpenStack for for for a pretty long time
I don't know if I can remember so I have
like six to seven seven plus years of
experience into infrastructure built for
the private cloud as well as the hybrid
cloud and since OpenStack has taken
everyone by surprise it has also taken
me by surprise
I have been into a lot of modules of
OpenStack with a developer's community
to understand different modules and work
around with those modules you know
developing the codes and submitting them
to the developers for the bugs and all
those things so yeah I mean it's it's a
long route that we followed for the
OpenStack that you will come to know
after an hour or so as we move ahead
with this particular webinar so I hope
that every one of you has a single
mindset about learning OpenStack most of
you must have been wondering whether AWS
or OpenStack so we will we will discuss
about all those things in detail
in this session and whatever it is that
you guys have you guys can ping me and I
will see if I can you know clarify your
doubts and your questions related to
OpenStack and what career that you want
to opt for that you want to take up
OpenStack whether you not want to take
up OpenStack that you would come to know
slowly and slowly as we move ahead with
this webinar okay so let's get started
so what do we have in this session
basically we will see about the cloud
introduction which most of you might
have already been familiar with we will
see what is OpenStack and we will check
what are the components of OpenStack
that are like the that makes the
foundation of OpenStack we will see
whether we get a demo out of it and we
will see the future of OpenStack that's
like the most important thing right now
in everybody's mind okay so let's get
started so like you know it says like
it's been announced that our company is
moving to cloud no wonder
you already know that you know there are
a lot many companies who are moving
towards the private cloud hybrid cloud
or the public cloud Microsoft Office 365
that has gone towards the public cloud
there are lot many examples which are
out there for the cloud so let me let me
ask you guys a question
do you use cloud on a daily basis - you
use cloud computing on a daily basis and
do you understand cloud computing at the
first place can anyone tell me so yeah I
get pretty good responses I see that
people are saying as file sharing and
Gmail of course so on a daily basis yes
of course as is also one of the example
on a daily basis we have you know
Dropbox
Dropbox is just one example one fair
example of you using the cloud right
the another fair example is Gmail of
course the answer that you guys have
told me so what is actually happening
over there do you have any idea like in
the backend what is actually happening
so if I would if I would say it's just
like sharing you know what you are doing
you're just sharing the network you're
sharing the resources which are provided
to you over the internet when we say
when we say the things that are being
shared over the internet that is cloud
computing yeah that is cloud computing
so it's not a wonder to think like if
most of the companies are moving towards
cloud that's where your foundation
begins by you will see it in the next
slides that why companies are so focused
on using the cloud okay so as we move
ahead as we move ahead
so of course cloud computing does not
mean that you know you are flying in the
clouds and you're afraid of the heights
that's definitely not true in the
technical terms we have a better
definition for it it says that if you
need milk why would you buy a cow true
enough yeah can anyone explain me what
does that mean okay so I get pretty good
pretty good answers that's fantastic
that's fantastic so yeah exactly yeah
why would why would you want to spend
some extra money on on different kind of
resources that are not to be used by you
entirely at the first place that is
perfectly right that makes sense as well
yeah so why when you just need an
application to be hosted why do you have
to buy an entire infrastructure why
would you go ahead and buy a server why
would you go ahead and buy a different
storage why would you pay for the
networking and the switches when you
just want to host an application server
right so that's a huge amount of money
that is involved when we are talking
about the product
environment okay so in that scenario
what companies want what companies want
they want someone to give them with the
infrastructure or the platform over
which they can host their applications
their services you know almost almost
everything whatever that bet they need
do you do they need the platform do they
need the infrastructure so you know it's
all about the terminologies today when
we are talking about the cloud computing
by terminologies I need to say that it
could be software as a service it could
be platform as a service it could be
compute as a service in fact it could be
operating system as a service it could
be storage as a service so that is like
star as a service okay so in today's
market there is lot of lot of
involvement or as a service so whatever
that you can sell is as a service okay
so it says that all the users are
consumers need is to get the benefits of
using the software or the hardware of
the computer like sending emails etc so
just get the benefit of computing why
should a consumer buy the software or
the hardware true enough that's where
that's where the importance of cloud
computing comes into picture it becomes
more interesting with this with this
light I think most of you would be more
interested in in this light you know so
you get a better picture of what exactly
we are talking about so when we say that
we want pizza
okay so suddenly you guys have a craving
that you want to eat pizza what would
you do would you would you would you
want to go ahead and make it all all by
yourself
so you would have you would need a lot
of not many things actually you you
would need you will need a you know lot
of toppings lot of different kinds of
sausages you know you would need the
oven electric the gas and honestly I
don't even know how to make a pizza but
you would need a lot of things you
to make make make a pizza so do you want
to do it all by yourself because because
I honestly feel like if you go ahead and
make a pizza at home you'll you'll by
the end of the time you'll I don't know
what what it will come out to be and by
that time your craving will be gone and
you will be like oh my god I'm supposed
to do everything on my own just to eat a
pizza
it's rather better to go out and have
the pizza yeah so so that is the
traditional on promise from Isis you
have to manage almost everything that is
the traditional way of doing things
it is the same as what we do or what we
rather used to do in our prior days when
you know entire infrastructure was your
headache went cloud computing was not
introduced okay when we moved ahead it
came as infrastructure as a service
where you would need you know you would
need like you know the Duff tomato sauce
the toppings the cheese that is
something that you won't manage you
won't have to worry about you just have
to worry about you know reserving the
dining table you need a soda
you need an oven you need a fire and you
know your your pizza will be made for
you all you have to do is just bake it
all you need is just baking it okay so
everything else is provided to you right
so so so that's
infrastructure-as-a-service
when we talk about platform-as-a-service
that means that you don't even want to
deal with it all you want is a
reservation and you want some soda you
want your pizza there on your plate you
want the pizza okay so my focus is on
the pizza so you've ordered a pizza you
want that pizza to be delivered on the
dining table with almost everything
whatever that you need that is your
platform as a service when it comes to
software as a service so you've got
almost everything okay so you call
almost everything it's not you you you
don't have to manage anything okay so
you it's just like that
out it's just like dining out when we
talk about platform-as-a-service
we are saying that pizza is getting
delivered to your home okay so you have
to take care of dining table and all you
have to take care about is soda
so let's say that you not ordered soda
so you manage the soda and you manage
your sitting area that's your piece of
getting delivered that is called as
platform-as-a-service
when we talk about software-as-a-service
you just chill just going out and you're
just you know having fun with the pizza
that you ordered so that's that's that
same as what we are trying to do with
the production environment with the
infrastructure so when we are talking
about the traditional infrastructure as
I have told you everything has to be
managed by us for simple things when we
say infrastructure as a service we say
that networking switches routers storage
servers virtualization it's not going to
be your headache yeah that has to be
managed by some vendor some vendors but
you don't want to deal with that that is
your infrastructure as a service so in
infrastructure your networking storage
service and virtualization comes into
picture you have to take care of the
operating system middleware or the
framework on the top of that
infrastructure as well as their
applications which are running on the
top of it that is going to be your
headache okay then when we move on
towards the platform as-a-service
all you care about is the applications
you don't want to deal with the
framework you don't want to deal with
the middleware you don't want to deal
with the operating system and the
infrastructure lying behind it you don't
want to deal with that so that comes as
a platform as service so all the rest of
the things will be taken care by the
window yeah all you have to worry about
is the application typical example is
the Gmail typical example is your
Dropbox anywhere that you share your
files and the folders you never know
where these file
getting stored up everywhere on what is
you know location and on what server
your data is being stored you don't know
that so that is your platform as a
service that is a very typical example
of platform as a service when it comes
to software as a service it's just that
someone has given you the software's and
you have to use it let's say for a
typical example if you want to view
certain files so all you have to do is
just upload that file and see
so whatever soft fields that are
available to you you just have to use
that that is software-as-a-service say
for example you have you want to view
your presentation online yeah
and SlideShare is also a typical example
of software as a service so the software
is given to you all you want to do is
just use it ok and and and whatever
applications which are given that's
that's that's what you see so that is a
typical example of software as a service
yeah so so this these are the basic
basic differences when we want to
understand cloud computing as well as
the types of cloud computing these are
also the service providers ok so it
becomes like infrastructure as a service
what are the service providers for
infrastructure as a service like for
example AWS and OpenStack platform as a
service so what are the examples or the
service providers or the platform as a
service yeah
then software as a service so what are
the providers for the software as a
service so these are just as thoughts at
the slide says you know ownership lies
with the service providers so what are
the service providers which are out
there in the market this is where your
comparison lies so when we talk about
the software as a service it's just like
your emails and did your any other
software that you are using online that
is just that you're consuming their
resources that is just like you are not
dealing with
find out the software that you're using
where that there that software is lying
upon that is not your problem that is
typical software as a service so you've
just requested somebody that I want to
use Citrix I want to use your Citrix in
a environment I don't want to deal with
anything else
so yes boss that's that's that that's
what we will give to you that will
become your typical example of software
as-a-service
rest of the things the management of the
infrastructure is not going to be your
problem then this is platform as a
service her platform is like we're like
decision support like any application
development where you want to develop
your own application on certain
infrastructure which is given to you
that is your platform as a service when
it comes to infrastructure as a service
you have to deal with the framework you
have to deal with the middle way you
have to deal with the operating system
but you don't have to deal with the
networking virtualization storage
anything that is physical anything that
is physical that is not going to be your
problem that is going to be your
infrastructure okay so that is
infrastructure as a service okay so does
anyone have any question on these
differences this is this is this is what
is going on in the market out there
these are the basic comparison for as a
service as I've already told you there
are many as a service components and the
service providers which are available
out there these are the basic ones okay
so let's let's come and talk about
OpenStack let's talk about where the
OpenStack originates from so how
OpenStack started so OpenStack has a has
a very interesting story to deal with
initially OpenStack was not given in the
public it was not used by the public it
was a private project by NASA and
Rackspace they used to take care of
their own internal
you know network with OpenStack it was
never known outside
it was never known outside in 2010 they
realized that they want this OpenStack
to be used outside so they just launched
it you know for the others to actually
exploit OpenStack so it's it's very new
actually in the market OpenStack is
really really growing and it's growing
very fast
there are many contributors which are
involved with OpenStack today that this
not just one but there are many you will
understand why these contributors are so
keen to contribute themselves to
OpenStack ok as we move ahead with the
slides
someone had a question I think I okay so
this pass provide the database and the
application server so see does your does
your database and application server
require any particular platform to be
running upon then it would it would go
it in that manner when you don't require
any platform to run your application
server and database then that's fine but
when I say that you require a framework
to understand or to run your application
server then it might come under platform
as a service right so when we are
talking about platform we are talking
about the framework that framework
should be supportive of whatever that
you want to run what applications that
you want to run yeah so in that scenario
you might require a platform so what is
the difference between AWS and OpenStack
I knew this question would pop up I knew
that but you know why don't I deal with
your question at the end of the session
once let's understand about OpenStack
and then we would be standing in a
position where we could actually
differentiate between the two how about
that are you okay with that so okay so
so um what happened next
what happened next OpenStack was
launched with the help of the
organization's with cloud computing
services so they realize that you know
OpenStack has got
openstack has got something that they
want to actually exploit it has
something of much more importance that
they can actually work around with okay
so it eventually you know many
organizations started to add up with
OpenStack and they started exploiting
what actually OpenStack is okay so in
couple of slides you would understand
what I am talking about the most
important thing that we need to know
about OpenStack is that it is a
non-profit and corporate funded entity
okay so the one thing about OpenStack is
do not expect a 24/7 support out of
OpenStack that is not what opens that is
OpenStack is open source framework which
is given to you to exploit cloud
computing Cibola I have just given you a
definition of OpenStack so that is what
OpenStack is it's a framework to help
you achieve cloud computing that is what
is OpenStack in very simple terms and it
is an open source so do not expect that
you've created an environment of
OpenStack and you have the entire
production environment of your cloud
computing with OpenStack and if
something were to go wrong you can you
can just drop a mail to somebody from
OpenStack and expect a hill out of it
that's not going to happen okay
there is the developer community which
is available for OpenStack individually
so you will have to post your comments
you will have to post your problems
so this developers will reproduce those
issues and try to fix the bug if there
is any and otherwise you know they'll
try to help you out figure the issues
what you have so you must learn what
basically OpenStack talks about how to
speak to OpenStack that's there the
difference between AWS and OpenStack
lies when you are talking to OpenStack
you're dealing with it you're dealing
with its files you're dealing with you
know it's modules and basically you
decide how your interest
is going to work you're the you're the
deciding factor over here how I'm going
to tell you in the couple of slides okay
so this is a non-profit and corporate
funded entity
it depends now you know if you have if
you have you're using OpenStack from Red
Hat
from Iran tears from Ubuntu then you
know you will get the support of the
operating system but exclusively on
OpenStack I guess not
okay open source and built by the
community of tough lacrosse so that's
what I'm talking about so this is open
source and this is built by the
developers who are very very keen to
learn open staff are very very keen to
actually help opens that provide a lot
of you know scripts provide a lot of
files and not many things just not many
things so that is an open source this is
community of developers out there who
are going to help you know who are
helping OpenStack and there are lot many
modules that they are adding on to open
stuff okay so there are more than 500
computing comic companies I'm sorry
more than 500 companies which have
joined this project so today at this
state I say it's not 500 or it's 4,000
plus contributors with OpenStack
4,000 plus so I have not mismatched any
zeros over here it's it's not more not
more than what you think there are lot
many contributors which are joining
every day with OpenStack ok this is one
of the fastest growing open-source
communities ok so so just because it is
so interesting to actually help you with
the cloud computing services it is so
interesting and there are lot many
developers out there who are developing
lot many things over OpenStack it is
very safe to say actually that OpenStack
is really getting matured day by day ok
so it's going to it's going to take time
to actually achieve a very strong
production environment out of open
stuff but yeah it is not completely
impossible paper is one of the user of
OpenStack
and they have recently claimed that they
have achieved a hundred percent cloud
computing with OpenStack now initially
they used to deal with VMware in order
to achieve the cloud computing that they
wanted but they completely you know they
completely moved to OpenStack and be
claimed that they have achieved the
cloud 100 you know 100 percent cloud
with the help of OpenStack now they do
have to depend on VMware for their
networking purpose because networking in
VMware is pretty strong it's very strong
as a matter of path but yes
OpenStack has today come into the
picture that it is actually kicked off
VMware a little bit because it is an
open source and because it is so easy to
actually deal with the file of OpenStack
ok you can create your own automation
you can create your own files you can
create your own modules to help support
OpenStack which a lot many companies are
doing today iBM has recently come up
with it with its own cloud using
OpenStack modules they have used certain
OpenStack modules integrated those
modules with their own environment and
they have come up with their own cloud a
private cloud so that's where they you
know that's where the importance lies
like how can you exploit it how can you
use it so let me let me talk about a
little bit about AWS and OpenStack which
I'm pretty sure that a lot of you have
have been thinking about that that
what's the difference between them ok so
you are asking me that how can you
relate this with Hadoop and all ok
Hadoop is kind of a framework or a
technology to make use of the structure
as well as the unstructured data and of
course harue can be you
on the top of OpenStack button of Sahara
so if you integrate the Sahara module
with OpenStack Hadoop is also achievable
so you know you have the module or the
component in OpenStack which is Mon and
Sahara that will help you with the data
processing which is same as hope ok so
so yeah so which version of OpenStack
components you are explaining in this
slide on the screen oh this this is a
this is not a very recent one um this
one is I think um Hana but the recent
version of OpenStack is Mitaka so in
Mitaka there are lot many components
which has been added if you guys are
aware about the distributed virtual
switches that has been added into the
Mitaka version with our version just got
released in april I give 6th of April
I'm not very sure about to date before
that it was Liberty and before that it
was Havana so these are the components
which has been being added with each and
every release of OpenStack ok so um oh
whether they will actually discuss about
the versions of OpenStack that's a
catchy question that you have but we
will be have a slight ahead of us for
the components of you know version of
OpenStack um we have another question
OpenStack is equivalent of AWS and free
of cost well my answer would be yes and
no both see um you must understand that
AWS is has been into the cloud computing
for a very very very long time
in fact AWS was the first to introduce
cloud computing so it's it's very
matured in the market it's it's very
matured but it is not free of cost okay
it is not pay of cost even if you create
your free account there is some charges
that you need that will be imposed upon
you okay
many components which are there in
interviewers for you to use
okay the difference lies in the
infrastructure and the way that you
handle it
AWS infrastructure is something that
you're not aware of okay
the kind of the storage that we use is
something that the amazin has got it in
their own servers they have got their
own servers they have got their own
networking they've got their own
switches from the back end which is very
huge they do give you the feasibility of
using that infrastructure now whether
you want to use s3 whether you want to
use the block storage the EBS or whether
you want to use the ec2 that is
completely dependent on you but you're
not entirely controlling that
infrastructure you do create the cloud
infrastructure on the top of the AWS but
you're not controlling the
infrastructure when they talk about
OpenStack it's about P who decide where
my infrastructure is going to lie say
for example if I talk about storage and
I said that I want Swift or I want Cinda
I can decide where my storage is going
to be whether it is going to be safe
whether it's going to be lost out
whether it's going to be the local
storage I can decide what it is going to
be what kind of object storage it is
going to be what kind of file storage it
is going to be okay so this is
completely scripted everything is
scripted so you deal with all of that
you deal with all of that you have a
freedom of choosing whatever
infrastructure that you want upon ok so
that's where that's where the importance
of OpenStack lies
it's wilted equivalent or Maison s3 that
is correct that is absolutely correct
so um choices basically yours I would
say that EWS is very mature in the
market OpenStack is not yet that mature
but it is an open source okay so it's a
the chart choice choice is yours when
you decide what what your production
environment actually wants okay what
your production environment is seeking
for do they need to deal with all the
infrastructure they want to take take
care of all the infrastructure
themselves then definitely go with
OpenStack you can decide what database
you require you can decide what
messaging protocol that you want to use
you can decide what kind of
orchestration services that you want to
use okay you can decide what kind of um
compute that you want what kind of
alarming services that you want and the
scripts are in your hand to actually
deal with it you can edit the scripts
and make use of it in any manner that
you want the most interesting thing in
all of these is you can use any user
interface and integrate that with
OpenStack all you have to do is you know
code here code that a little bit of this
little bit of that and create a Python
script for a dashboard if you want to
create your own dashboard you can do
that all you need a you know little bit
of a coding language coding language
knowledge but you can use the scripting
language as well that's the beauty of
OpenStack basically so there there is a
support for JSON files as well and
OpenStack is entirely created in Python
so you can create in Python scripts as
well as well as the bias or the shell
scripts for automation so it's like you
know you cut the control that OpenStack
which is not true with AWS most of the
times okay so it is it would be unfair
for you to decide between AWS in
OpenStack unless you actually use
OpenStack because if you have used AWS
then please use OpenStack and then try
to differentiate between the two have a
look and feel of OpenStack
understand the infrastructure learn to
be with it and then you would be able to
understand the differences between the
two both of them have the same
destination okay but the way that
destination is being approached is
different okay so we have few more
questions coming up if any production
environment uses OpenStack and you find
issues with OpenStack framework how they
get it resolved who will support it I'll
draw it that's what we have that's what
that's what the situation that we have
over here we don't have a full pledge to
support which is available for OpenStack
there is an open standard of element
community which is available where you
how many issues you can you can put it
over there but let's say that you have
the issues while you're using the Red
Hat OpenStack so of course you can raise
your queries with the Red Hat OpenStack
community they have they have their
audio community for you to deal with and
you can definitely get it sorted out but
please do not expect a support 24/7
support in OpenStack please be prepared
when you are talking about
OpenStack production environment if you
if you are not satisfied with what I'm
saying you have to go and figure it out
yourself just go and figure it out yeah
of course now ishani this is this is an
open source so when it is an open source
do you have a support available for an
open source um
I guess no you don't have a fully
supported uhm 24/7 support that will be
available to you for anything which is
open source because it is given to you
to deal with basically it's just that
you you have been given with an
opportunity you've been given with
something which is so amazing that you
want to actually use it in your own way
so um that's not going to be very you
know you you you just can't expect um a
support 24/7 seven
but out of it what is not free part of
OpenStack aha
okay that's a very cheeky wing question
that you've asked me so let's say that
um for example let's say red heart let's
talk about it so of course the operating
system for the red heart is something
that you have to subscribe for that's
not going to be free so you have to have
a subscription for it but any module on
the top of it whatever you install is is
free was so let's say that you want
choke database all you have to do is
just download the files folders and and
that's it okay so all you have to do is
install the libraries for whatever are
components that are available for
OpenStack and that are free so it's kind
of a long question to be asked that what
is not a free particle OpenStack there's
nothing which is um chargeable in
OpenStack okay there is nothing which is
chargeable in OpenStack so all you have
to do is just have an operating system
on the top of it yum install this um
install that that this this that that
and blah blah blah and now you will have
all the modules with you all free for
you to use so isn't that interesting do
you find that interesting if you don't
believe me just go figure so does anyone
have any question with respect to AWS
and OpenStack is there any restrictions
are ro it for the first part of what you
are asking is there any restriction yes
the restriction is that you are you are
you have to use a Linux operating system
okay you have to use a Linux operating
system or it's OpenStack is not
supported on a Windows operating system
if you want to exploit it um you want to
have to have a workstation or
chubak sorry KVM but it doesn't work on
Windows operating system okay when you
talk about applications and versions
then yes then there has to be an updated
version of OpenStack as well as the
operating system on the top of it say
for example if you are using red heart 6
version and you know on the top of it
you are installing the newer versions of
OpenStack
it's it's rather better that you use
recent versions of the operating system
as well because that's where the support
and you know the synchronization would
work between the two so yes that is
another restriction that you have it's
always better to use the updated if
you're using an updated version of
OpenStack always have a recent operating
system to support that newer version of
OpenStack okay so safe let's say for
example recently we came across an issue
where you know someone who's using 5 v
version of red heart and and the newer
versions of OpenStack started leaving
some kind of issues so it's always
better to have the recent versions okay
so um Akshay for any practical
experiences since this is a demo class I
am forbidden to actually give you any
practical on OpenStack at this point of
time I cannot do that so sorry
Ubuntu 64-bit is supported yes of course
it is supported we're going to support
it and with Ubuntu there are many
components and tools which are available
for you to use and exploit Ubuntu is
supporting its own OpenStack which is
known as canonical OpenStack ok so yeah
so um before we start with the
components of OpenStack does it support
MySQL servers yes for JBoss and MySQL
you have to download certain
repositories and they will be supportive
of course
but do keep a track of the recent
versions I would request you to keep a
track of recent versions and check that
what recent versions have because one
important thing that I forgot to tell
you is OpenStack releases the new
versions every six months with every
version they are coming with new support
for a lot of tools and lot of
infrastructure support okay so um be be
always alert on whatever the new
components that are coming up always um
see the summit videos of OpenStack there
are OpenStack summit videos where the
developers come up with the newest
versions and they tell you what they are
supporting what they are looking forward
to in the next versions of OpenStack so
unless keep a track of it that is one
request that we always have for people
who want to actually use OpenStack in
the production environment because then
you have one version of OpenStack
running in your cloud environment and
suddenly you you you started getting a
hang of it you know that that that
naturally takes time and and the moment
you start getting a hang of it there is
a newer version that has come up in the
market so um are you ready for that
newer version you have to ask yourself
that are you ready for the you know
updating the repositories which you have
already created so um be always alert on
those factors be because OpenStack is
developing a lot and fastly okay you
have to keep up with the pace of it so
you have to keep yourself updated with
recent versions so let's see in April
I've got Mitaka in October I will get a
newer version with lot more support in
lot more modules being added into it so
I have to be alert on whatever new
things that they're coming up coming up
with yeah so that is that is my that is
my challenge and I have to be updated
about it you can any backup layer
available with OpenStack yes of course
so it um
NetBackup very Symantec Backup there is
veritas backup
these are supported with OpenStack for
the third-party plugins so where it does
Symantec and net back make up have
provided the plugins to third parties to
be associated with OpenStack so once you
download those third-party plugins you
you can have the backups working with
OpenStack and the backend could be your
net out all your very tough or worse
okay so let's let's talk about OpenStack
and the main components of OpenStack
which are available so there are many
modules for you to choose the choices on
you what modules that you want to deal
with there are many companies out there
who just want to exploit the Swift
component of OpenStack okay
or maybe the heat orchestration module
of OpenStack okay they don't require all
the modules so the dependency is very
very reduced in OpenStack these modules
are independent of each other but they
are still dependent on each other in a
manner that you have to communicate the
communication between these modules
possible with the help of Keystone
services okay so you need to understand
basically the communication between each
and every module okay so let's say for
example for an infrastructure as a
service you would require the compute
when we talk about compute we are
talking about the resources we are
talking about the RAM we are talking
about the CPU cycles and we are talking
about the disk may it be informal or
non-formal storage okay so that is
compute when there is another compute
which is known as ironic ironic is a
component which is used to manage the
hypervisors which are available in your
OpenStack environment then there is
Neutron which is a networking component
so as you try to install each and every
component these components have
dependency on each other to make sure
that you get an infrastructure so there
is a net
work among each other there is a
communication among each other by a
remote procedure call to make sure that
each and every component is
communicating with each other in a
rightful manner and each and every
component is properly authenticated as
well as authorized ok so so there is an
importance of understanding how the
infrastructure of OpenStack is being
built and how this is being communicated
with each other ok there is an
orchestration as a service in OpenStack
which is known as heat you can relate
this with puppet and share or ansible
jenkins such kind of orchestrations
which are available out there then there
is database which is known as Stroeve
Marya DB MySQL there is a support for
all of these databases ok so um I have
few more questions coming up but let's
just deal with these questions once we
talk about the components for once then
I'll get back to your questions ok so
then next we have data processing as
suhara there somewhere someone asked me
that what if they want to exploit harue
on the top of OpenStack so as I've
already told you that OpenStack is a
kind of a framework for you to use any
application that you want to use ok so
some do not be afraid of using OpenStack
for any of the application that you want
to use but do do exercise prudence to
learn that whether that application is
supportive with the current version that
you are using if you are using the
earlier versions like Hilo or Juna
version you want to know whether your
module or the application is being
supported or not ok so be always careful
on on those parameters
ok then one is key management which is
known as Barbican there is a DNS manage
which is known as designee it
there is a message Heuer which is known
as the car by default in open side
rabbit and pew is also used as a message
Queuing protocol become a library which
is being used in OpenStack is Oslo and
the Identity Management Service is known
as Keystone and the image management
component in OpenStack is known as
glance so that's where your templates or
launching a virtual machine lies okay
when we talk about the front-end of how
you are going to access OpenStack that
happens why are the command line or any
REST API or any you know let's say for
example the horizon dashboard so in
OpenStack the dashboard is known as the
horizon which is stateless user
interface okay and otherwise we have the
command line to access the OpenStack and
and the you know the modules of
OpenStack so let's let's see the basic
the main components of OpenStack so the
first one where you would end up being
is the horizon dashboard that is where
you want to access all your components
okay
the Keystone identity service is
responsible or authorization and
authentication of a user say for the
first time if you have logged them
whether you are authorized to access the
components or not so that is
responsibility of keystone cinder is
your volume storage service
okay so cinder is just like your typical
traditional storage where you would
store your data Neutron is your
networking component which will help you
facilitate the networking on the top of
your environment okay so all the virtual
machines which are which are which are
running on the top of your OpenStack
environment will be connected with the
help of a neutral networking component
then next is your Swift which is known
as
store which someone of you said that it
is same as AWS s3 that is exactly the
same so in the similar manner you create
a container and you upload your files in
that container that is your Swift
storage in OpenStack you can decide
where your images are going to be
uploaded
what kind of back-end storage do you
want your files to be stored upon okay
so that is something that you can you
can control next is your glance image
service as I have already told you that
this is one of the component where you
store your images to launch a virtual
machine out of it okay
then next is your Nova Nova is one of
the important component of OpenStack
where the resources to launch or spawn a
virtual machine comes from Nova is going
to be the component that is going to
decide how you are going to launch your
instances so when I talk about instances
I need what you XI okay so I mean what
your machine okay so before coming to
the future of OpenStack
I have not many questions coming up so
let's go to them one by one can we
upgrade only a particular layer example
Neutron only instead of whole OpenStack
version so row in my answer is both yes
as well as No
so if you if you come let's say if you
want to upgrade a entire OpenStack
module you can do that or if you want to
upgrade only a particular or component
that is also possible
so let's say for example nowise one
module that I have I have in my
environment and if it was an older
version and if I want to install the
newer versions I can do that I have the
flexibility of doing that in that sense
you would want to make sure that you
take the backup of the module that you
have installed
the modules have the configuration files
which has the information of
connectivity of this mode of one module
with the database as well as the
Keystone services so the chances are if
your files get overwritten you might you
might wonder that what has gone wrong
okay so take the backup of the module
and you know you install the new and
modules that is always possible with
OpenStack okay so you don't have to
stick with the older versions of any
particular module you can definitely do
that
okay can we get the slide deck um
Vikramjit I think this is something that
you might want to call up a director and
ask them whether this will be available
to you or not however the recording of
this session will definitely be
available to you within a day or so so
you know you can go back and check but
yeah the recording will be available to
you okay so um your next question is but
since OpenStack is open source and no
one um organizing or maintaining the
cloud will and organizations will
essentially be creating a private cloud
it's not really a public cloud become
Jake um let me try to understand your
question so you are saying that if there
is no organization which is available to
maintain your cloud why there is a need
to UM create a private cloud is that
what you mean
well um basically when we just talk see
um
you must understand the biggest scenario
of OpenStack it's not just one OpenStack
that you would be dealing with when you
want to have a production environment
there will be many tools that you will
be using along with the OpenStack it's
not just going to be OpenStack yes when
it comes to OpenStack you might feel
certain troubles to actually deal with
it
but let's say for example you are using
the third party plugins
let's say for example the net app
someone has asked me about the backup so
I let me use the example of the net
backup if you have any problem in
integrating then plug-in of the net
backup and integrating it with OpenStack
you can blaze a query with net app team
to help you sort out this problem this
is one scenario that I can tell you with
yes but in your private infrastructure
if you end up having certain issues most
of the times you have to be dependent on
some OpenStack development community to
maybe help you out otherwise you will
have to find out and sort this out
yourself
but most most of the times you should be
able to deal with it because you're the
one who actually created the
infrastructure yourself so you
understand the in and out of OpenStack
yeah so you have the flexibility so
don't feel like you will not get the
support the developer community are
there 24/7 basically there are
developers on OpenStack community they
are available 24/7 for you to help out
with your problems but you must
understand what OpenStack is it is an
open source ok so there are certain
challenges with that comes along with
OpenStack ok so um
ok so you need to understand what um
basically opens that tells you ok what
does it mean to have OpenStack in your
environment ok um I hope I have um I
have clarified what your question is um
any organization using OpenStack will be
maintaining their own cloud of course
yes it is a private cloud yes you are
right you got it you got it perfectly
right so if I have not told you already
um let me rephrase it OpenStack is
infrastructure as a service and it is
private cloud so I am sorry if I missed
this particular term to be used before
but OpenStack is infrastructure as a
service and of course yes it is used as
a private cloud ok ok thank you
so um do you have another quest
can we access local c d---rom or any
local devices in the VMS inside
OpenStack yes definitely
yes definitely you can do that so let's
let's talk about OpenStack future okay
so lot of people are asking about the
future um see their IT people and we
know about the future of the market we
know market very well but when we talk
about OpenStack um you you know that
there are many um companies out there
which are not running away from it but
they're running towards cloud computing
so fast that they need OpenStack at this
point of time unless there is something
else that comes into picture which is
similar to OpenStack which is similar to
providing an open source cloud computing
framework and of course cheaper yeah so
companies are still running towards it
so you can say that there is a good
there is a very very good market which
is coming up with OpenStack and it is
building up you know the companies are
really they're attracted towards
OpenStack because it is free their
dependency becomes greater when they
want to be dependent on the
infrastructures let's see or Microsoft
if you are talking about Microsoft cloud
computing or if you are talking about
the VMware there is there is um there's
a lot of dependency involved and there
is a lot of cost which is involved and
there are many companies who actually
don't want to depend on the components
which are being developed so that's why
they want to move towards OpenStack and
if more companies are moving towards
OpenStack that means more job for you
and more knowledge do you have on
OpenStack more chances of you getting a
very big terms on your money you know
many zeros might might be getting added
in your salary so yeah as you can see
this graph over here you can see the
adaptability of OpenStack is pretty high
as compared to the rest of the services
which are
it's edokko IBM cloud stock and chef
so OpenStack has got a very good score
reason being it's just five years old
and it's quite mature today okay so yeah
it's pretty it's pretty fantastic
actually I would say so we have a
question since we are talking about the
future the analyst organizations such as
Gartner and Forrester don't think they
evaluate OpenStack and hence just
OpenStack show up in da orphans well um
ha Vikramjit that's a question that's a
great that's a question with a lot of
doubts at this point of time um I don't
know basically what they want to use
what they want to do with their
infrastructure whether they would use it
whether they won't use it it completely
depends on their requirement there are
many companies were still a little
afraid of using OpenStack but it's no
way saying that the rest of them are not
going to be using OpenStack you know so
it the moment when OpenStack starts
having a better or a sound foundation
let's say that will be the time when
rest of the services which are providing
the private clouds will not stand a
chance against OpenStack ok so so that
might happen in your future you know can
we get a trial version access um I do
not understand your question are you
asking me that can you access OpenStack
or not is that what your question is ok
so um as I've said OpenStack is open
source um so yes definitely you can and
there is no trial version um you can use
it as long as you want
ok
in stalker a competitor of OpenStack of
course yes it is a competitor of
OpenStack so um the slide for the piece
Gil sees a lot at this point of time why
I asked in beginning you said there is
cost - Oh see nothing is going to be
entirely free for you I did not say that
OpenStack is completely free of course I
did say that the tools which are
associated with OpenStack will charge
you you cannot have an entire
infrastructure all based upon OpenStack
okay you have to be dependent on lot of
other tools as well right so if you
consider that you know I have OpenStack
Walla and I don't need anything else
that's not going to happen okay that
that that's that's going to be that's
not going to happen actually you would
need lot many tools to support it's not
many things okay so you would definitely
end up paying for those things so you
know nothing is so free for you but yeah
when it when we talk about OpenStack and
its repositories of course they will be
available to you any links or anything
you know or this point of time is out of
the course
um I mean out of the intent that we have
in this webinar um so he's Google it are
you you'll have none of information any
OpenStack certifications you have seen
two one zero certification I think which
is available for OpenStack once you have
that you can go with the advanced
certifications for OpenStack okay so
yeah um so why is OpenStack the next big
thing standardization
since there is lot of organizations who
are using it OpenStack is bound to use
the standardization now this is
infrastructure as a service it is not it
is not only the open source but it also
follows the standards so when we say
open source do I mean I don't mean that
someone has given you a code online and
you are just trying to use it and just
trying to change certain code and you
know make it your own
it's not like that OpenStack is is
abided by these standards which have
been used because the organization's are
using it for their commercial purposes
okay so it always follows the standards
the ecosystem is rich why I am saying it
is you can always have the support of
whatever support my support I do not
mean the you know dialing a number on
the phone no I mean that if you require
any other storage so let's say for
example I want to be dependent upon
cloud watch I will have to I will have
the plugins available for it okay if I
want to depend on cluster storage I will
have the plugins available for it
okay so the ecosystem is very rich it's
not limited okay it's not limited if
today you feel that OpenStack is still
needs to mature a little bit wait till
the next version comes up maybe they
will have more support for the rest of
the components which you might need okay
so that that's why it is very rich at
this point of time open source of course
it follows the bazaar model or itself is
an example of open source development
which is done particularly right yes of
course so it is very stable in that
manner it's it's it's just very open
source it just speaks very open source
so you would understand it by this point
of time and who's behind OpenStack so
that's that's that's pretty interesting
who's behind OpenStack so you know you
yourself can see not many
companies which are over here
AT&amp;amp;T HP Dell IBM red-hot marathas
Rackspace suzay
these these are just a few to mention
these are just a few to mention there
are a lot many contributors with
involved with OpenStack okay there are
not many companies which are not
involved with OpenStack so um let's talk
about if you join the course
what is our roadmap towards
understanding and learning modules of
OpenStack okay so the first one is going
to be an understanding about the entire
infrastructure of OpenStack that's where
we will discuss how each and every
module is communicating within OpenStack
ok the second is going to be the
Keystone which is your identity service
which will make you authenticate it
towards the infrastructure the next is
going to be Nova cinder glance Neutron
horizon dashboard heat orchestration
services salami tow trove Swift which is
an object store then installation and
troubleshooting we will have OpenStack
operators skite which will give you some
important commands um to deal with
OpenStack
we have central logging ok so this this
is going to be the roadmap that we will
follow in in learning OpenStack ok um
you have the batch details available for
you to go up to ok so we have we have
the next batch which is starting on 4th
of June we take the classes on Saturdays
and Sundays so it's basically six
weekends do you you see a life for
configurations or GUI we are very much
dependent on command line basically so
we will be using a lot of command lines
ok so yeah we do have a lot of
dependency over there actually
okay so um um the course has like online
life classes which is going to be 4440
to us you will have the extra
assignments for another 25 hours you
will have to work a lot on these
assignments yourself in order to get a
better understanding on OpenStack you
will have the projects that you will
work upon okay so we have the offer
which is valid till 3rd of June because
we are starting the batches on 4th of
June um people have good morning as well
as we mostly have the morning match
match is just starting on 4th of June so
I hope I see you guys there in the
sessions um
now do you have any questions for me now
we've learned opens time we talked about
OpenStack I have taken you towards the
roadmap of OpenStack and the future of
OpenStack what questions do you have for
me
Red Hat OpenStack opens um I don't think
so but to ask the iterator support guys
and ask them this question place any
discount for student so um we had this
discount right I mean we have it over
here we have like 15% off until you use
it ok so you can um you can avail this
discount ok so any more questions any
more queries so I'm pretty sure that a
lot of you are confused um a lot of you
actually want to use OpenStack um you
wouldn't know unless you try
you know try and see it and then you can
decide so um if if you're done with the
questions I think I'm gonna wrap up and
I am very sure that you guys have got a
very good understanding about OpenStack
I hope at this point of time you
understand the differences between AWS
and OpenStack and better understanding
is going to be obtained when you deal
with each and every modules and in and
out of OpenStack and see how the
communications lie and how you make the
OpenStack work how you launch the
instances how you make that those
instances communicate behind the load
balancer and how you exploit the storage
which is the valuable with you so better
understanding comes when you have a
better hands on on on you know
technology I'll do it for the question
that you've asked me um honestly I am
not sure but whoever will there will
there be there will be pretty good and
yeah they'll be pretty good I am very
positive okay so does anyone have any
question I'm going to take the last
question if anyone has and then we are
going to wrap it up and you guys can
have this demo session um recording
available to you guys are within the RT
or so for any extra questions that you
have related to any discounts which
we've already talked about the timings
um and the certifications um and all
those things you guys can call it Eureka
support and those guys will help you out
okay so I'm just gonna wait for like
couple of minutes for the last question
to be entertained
and then I'm gonna wrap up okay so um I
don't I think oh wow so I did not know
that I would be able to clarify each and
every one of your questions in just one
session I thought that you know there
will be more questions but I believe
that everyone is clear on on the concept
at least that make that makes me happy
okay so um thank you guys thank you for
joining our file you close the session I
believe that you might get a feedback
form or something to let us know your
feedback and please are get in touch
with the Eureka support for the rest of
the questions it was great to have you
guys in this session I hope it was
helpful I hope it was knowledgeable and
you learned something out of it
so this is goodbye from me Sonia I hope
to see you guys in any one of my session
if I am taking it so thank you so much
for joining and have a good day bye bye
