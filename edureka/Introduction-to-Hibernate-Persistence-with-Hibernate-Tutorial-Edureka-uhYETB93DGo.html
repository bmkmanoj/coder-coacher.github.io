very important terminology so when we
talk about something called us it's
already the price Edition the point of
our Enterprise Edition is all about
providing solutions at the enterprise
level that is what Java Enterprise
Edition is all about for in solutions
when you say enterprise I mean whenever
I drop the hood something called
Enterprise enterprise is a technology
which all this comes across when we have
to do some distribution program and
never we have to do some distribution
level as programs so for example this
continuum I have a server and that
particular server is keep learning to
develop at some point of time the server
the server will be requiring some
problem might can happen with the server
or the server absurd require some
maintenance so this is a day-to-day
activity so at that point of them what
might happen to the server who can
replace the server right so who can take
the impact of that service whose will be
in a position to replace that particular
server so that point often what happens
we need communication between two
servers if one server goes down another
server should step up and we should take
care of the activities which is already
running buddy and others that particular
server so here we're sharing comes
sharing will be the two servers before
it goes them other server should be the
position to take that corresponding or
motor for the corresponding amount of
customers that particular server is
handling so this is called distribution
so this is going to go with all the
server's friend
so we are going to acquire a chain of
connection to all the servers so the
probably chain of connection to all the
servers then we probably end up
something called as distribution
distribution of data across all the
servers so this distribution of theta is
optical enterprise is an enterprise
which useful are you going to distribute
a data family
that's where Java EE comes up in the
picture
you
so Java is facing optical Enterprise
Edition so it will provide a collection
of KPIs and a particular random
execution environment for running the
enterprise apps when you say enterprise
Maps like the distributed it apps like
your GM has put Java Message Service
which is taking care of the message
between the enterprise distributed data
and containers like the EJB containers
which is going to take care of handling
all the beam related things whenever you
want to deploy something the service
will be readily available to the
customer so all the distributed related
things the Chamber's the email the SMS
all these things can be specifically
added by Java Enterprise Edition to
betray direction so telling that it
provides services like persistence
messaging web transactions these are
some of the main services I can say core
services but and also a lot of other
services also provided apart from this
the service is also provided and when
you talk on the word persistence that's
where I Burnett is going to come up in
the picture I will note squared is
synced as a backbone for Java to support
the Enterprise Edition okay so basically
I can put forward in this way there's
nothing special linking Java EE as a
tool or the software what it saves is
all about this out to use the same level
of Java to use at the end up is not as
simple as and you would use the same
level of the job of programming but how
exactly I am going to use the
programming and an enterprise level
perspective if that's where your
Enterprise Edition comes up in the
picture so this is all this is all about
the information Enterprise carries to
teach back ok so so ashe what I was
trying to say is that we can't put you
can put in a very simple statement like
so Java e is not a tool or it's not a
software it's not those kind of things
so Java e is going to provide you
libraries which is arcane can be
executed
see the BC Java at the interface level
at the distributed programming level
financially it's a fine essentially
pushing yeah so people always make
mistake by understanding Enterprise
Edition means away we have a separate
software it's not like that again seeing
level it's going to define a spec but
spec will tell you how to use the Java
interface there so you have to follow
this particular spectrum okay
and provide particularly the rest
services the result when you say that
web services oh can I expose my service
whatever has been developed to the
outside world those are the things okay
so that's why Java interface is a very
very critical thing to understand and
the first systems part of the Java
Enterprise hibernate takes it to a very
very great direction okay rest and so on
basically they've service the scanner
will give it in some services so for
example I have written some services
like let's consider I have a tenner
services which is going to handle the
credit card transactions and that
actually used by some other organization
not by me
some other organizations so at that
point of them when I'm giving that
service to other person I can't expose
it directly there should be some level
of security that should be some level of
definition has to happen in this service
what are the things you can access in
this service what are things you can't
access okay so those are called web
services
when two parties are trying to
communicate to each other and at the
same time they are not aware of each
other also there's a first time we are
going to conduct and he is not out of
what you are doing and you are not aware
of what he is doing those kind of
scenarios believe the web services comes
up in a picture and they can be
implemented by both register as well as
so that is the rest is typically and
lives all the HTTP related things but
it's a soap is typically angle for you
are excellent kind of deployment
accelerator fine
so he now is asking what prior knowledge
is required to understand this session
okay also nothing much you should be
knowing some level of shower when you're
talking you can join this course again
we'll be providing some level of links
and some level of tutorials to
understand what Java is all about we
will also provide some level of
knowledge field before starting the post
we produce some links so I do you think
as something not your will you join the
course without any commentary didn't
probably make sure that that I wanna
join the crews you'll have the
corresponding set of classes and etc you
can good room you can be put running it
okay yes yes put in your current project
can you provide in this is looking so
fine acronym so even though if you see I
am using Java
I typically make sure that you are going
through some loads of classes in Java
also now to cover it
find a phenom this is Anthony machinery
know what is I do yes you know like I
think we can discuss what is I do
maybe of the end of this module ok let
of this module I will give an
interaction of parties are fine Tina
yeah what basically I believe is all of
the frame
but it is good why we need fiber name so
I burned it is basically nothing holder
some shit relational mapping okay based
on cheap relational mapping so what an
eye Burnett is trying to watch it is so
for example let's I will take it notepad
so so everybody can be able to see the
notepad can get a quick confirmation
please yeah so what I believe is trying
to say is that so typical development if
you have a database if you have a
database table if you have a table in
the database if the arson squad so let's
take a employ table and then employ
table is going to have some level of
characteristics or attributes something
like ID or name or some other level of
Cadets all the other tickets so what the
typical problem across the world be
nervous before I permit came up in the
picture this table can be a different
meaning and different databases and I
say different meaning this can be MySQL
can be a different definition let's say
this is a MySQL database and in the case
of Oracle database this can be at a
different definition okay and maybe add
Microsoft SQL Server and this can be a
different definition so it's real people
employee it's represented differently
each and every database because they're
so the database has been built so most
of the scenarios what happens I as an
organization when I when I am working on
all of the database and I feel the cost
is going sky-high because Oracle is not
an open source so what I am trying to do
that I am planning to migrate myself to
- to database and I am did some level of
putting in the Oracle database by I have
working with the table to no work
available I am trying to migrate to -
florist and now what happens the
definition is changing if the definition
changes everything is going to changed
whatever the code has been written for
Oracle now actually
completely my related to the pool which
is going to support my SQL so if it is
something like three years of
development so one can I understand how
much level of code has built again you
can just think wait three years of time
and keep on working with Oracle and then
keep on writing some developed good now
my organization decides so is easier now
this cost is now extending to another
level
so they shift to some other database so
they are coming to speak to other
database called maestro okay so now what
can happen
I have to rewrite the code which to
support my script so now to solve this
problem what we are trying to do is that
what I would need for sparing saves them
you acid code don't speak to get a base
directly use you and whatever the poor
you write I am going to come in
different colors in hibernate and I am I
am going to take the responsibility of
using the same written good to speak
with Oracle as well as my history of it
does because of this simple concept
called as it is going to microwave code
into him so what type of it is trying to
say you give me employee as a cool I
will make sure of transferring the code
into the corresponding tables so this is
bonus
object so this is where I will net came
up in the page
fine so whatever the core here so the
Cybernet is somewhat like a middleware
yes you can depend defined like that
table but it does more than that and you
save more than that it takes care of all
the database operations like the crew
operations like the transactions a
except to all the other things also H
takes them so you as a developer but now
you have to concentrate only on code
okay yeah it's like a JV permission yes
yes I like ng information if sneaking in
for databases for companies and it's yes
but as I said it is more than fine - it
does more than that because together
brings a lot of other things is that
like come it is their role
is there everything is going to take
care right so it not require any query
language who knocks what time's up like
a little push in come on
so what I want it is trying to say is
that I bet it's having this world
Deaconess hp1 all criteria okay so what
the output is saying that you can just
see for example I can say from my
employee table dot get needle so when
you type something like this I burn it
takes us computer transferring this
tranquil Aibileen instead of a that's
possibility of transferring this into an
SQL since I'm the very powerful support
for query languages find goon encoding
it's a very powerful support for query
languages so what I put it is trying to
say you just fetch the data based on the
objects and I will make sure of
transferring is particular whatever has
been fetched from the class yeah I
believe query language can siphon it
could language like SQL so discuss when
you say Java EE bit I burn it the major
rule what I burn it is going to do stead
for call the data bits irrespective of
whatever the data is the same level of
food will be executed against each and
every catalyst that's what I basically
Ivan is going irrespective it's an
Oracle or the highest fuel or I tell me
Microsoft SQL what our or and no is
database like mahogany
even that also I Burnett can go ahead
and execute it that's all that's how
much I burn it is very powerful and if
you see in today's market it's very very
difficult to see an enterprise
application without hibernate
particularly after your Louisville game
up in the picture
so there are if you join the course so
the skills required is yes you should
have
some SQL skills and hibernate to still
explaining what I won it was horrible
some object-oriented programming skills
okay and any database we shall work
before maybe in MySQL or Oracle etc
whatever it is okay and the job frenzy
all this
as usual I'm Annette were now Simon it
will be my eighth possibility of issue
particularly with the new features right
you see hand the busine and so if you
want a minor to know is to know super
magnet so I'm gonna listen to push you
to help you
that's what interesting some use a very
very latest a con equal I burn a 4.5
