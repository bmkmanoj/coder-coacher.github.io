first of all I would like to welcome and
pants all the attendees for joining the
session so this session is all about
Java classes so without any further ado
let's move on and see the agenda for
today
so in start of the session by first
discussing what a class is and what are
the different components in a class
after that we'll be learning what
constructors and how they play a major
role in a class moving on we'll see the
structure of a class where I will be
summarizing the above two concepts with
a programmatic example next we'll see
another key concept in a class that
objects and how can you work with them
how can you create them Absalom and play
around with objects towards the later
half of the session will be going to
slightly advanced concepts where I'll be
talking about multiple classes and
object-oriented concepts such as
inheritance abstraction encapsulation
and how can you work with them so are we
all clear with the agenda kindly give me
quick confirmation by writing down in
the chat pod so that I can proceed okay
so I'm getting confirmations so Cairo
says look spying and Umbra says yes
Samir says go ahead all right so we are
good to go look up against getting an
introduction to a class or what is a
class so class Java is a blueprint which
includes all your data that is present
around you now I have to give an idea of
what the class is let's see this real
life example of a car that you see in
day to day life now have you even
thought of how a car is created at first
you need a design meaning you can put
all the functionalities to it so for
example you must know where a tire
should be a steering wheel is placed in
a car so all these things needs a
structure that exactly a class is so
once you design a structure it will ease
your task as you don't have to repeat
the same steps again and again that is
how it minimizes the student didn't see
how can do that here comes the concept
of objects because the class helps you
understand on how an object would be
looking so you might be wondering what
an object is so don't worry guys we'll
be learning the whole concept of objects
in a while but here to give you quick
overview of an object and up
basically everything you see around for
example dog is an object of animal class
or you can say I am an object of human
caste similarly they can be different
objects to the same car class now moving
towards the syntax of a class or how can
you define a class in the Java code so
class logically groups are data and
functions together so if you're going
technical term these are called as
variables and methods so we learn about
these things in detail but if I have to
relate to the same example here my
variable here our color model and price
so variable is nothing but an attribute
of a class then we talk about method
they are just the functionality of a
given class here the main function to
make a car move is P so I declare a
method speed-up similarly you need to
get out whenever you speed up a car so
if you don't do you'll end up killing up
the engine
therefore these things are really
important to function a class
so guys have seen the structure of a
class with respect to car so let me just
showing my IDE on how a class looks like
so this is my employer class we'll have
some variables like ID name and some
more so there these are all my methods
so this is just a simple understanding
don't worry if you are not clear with
anything we'll be talking about each one
of things that are declared here
individually so now let's go in detail
of what a variable is so a variable is
used to store a data value so if I talk
about the same example of a car in my
previous life I took the variable as
color model and price so every car must
has a color right but the values can be
different my car can be black yours can
be red or if you talk about model I may
be driving an Audi a4 you may be driving
a 6 similarly I may be paying a
different price you may be paying
different so all these are considered to
be available where the values are
changing with your own requirements now
coming back to this line a member
variable is a variable that belongs to
specific class so these memory variable
are classified into three types local
instance and the class variable so let's
see what exactly they are and how they
are used so local variable is a variable
that can be accessed within a function
so in these variables scope remains
still a function so just to remind you
guys a function is again a set of rules
that we wish to operate with the
different values next instance variable
these variables are declared outside a
method constructor or any block so these
variable are unique because these values
are instance specific finally when we
talk about class variable these variable
doesn't need a separate memory
allocation it shares only one copy that
is taken by everyone so you need to see
how I can implement them practically so
this is my car class which has some
variable and methods to it now a local
variable is a variable that is declared
within a method so I created a method
called as display they have passed an
argument as M now my local variable is
model here which has a value and
associated to it and here I've just
printed this value then second I have
instance variable now these variables
are declared outside any class
constructor or anything so in this case
color is my instance variable which has
a value black to it
third is the static variable which has
one copy which is shared by all so in my
example
all guards are having four tiles right
so I have declared a static variable
that is tile which has a value 4 so I
hope you guys are there with different
types of variable let's see how a
variable is initialized in a method and
how can you create your own method and
putting different functionalities to it
so as we discussed earlier methods
basically is a set of rules or
operations that describes the behavior
so you might have a question why are we
not writing these set of rules in a
program or why do we need a separate
function for this so the answer here is
reduced hidden in C so if I have to take
an example let's say I have to add two
numbers for a large data set so one way
of doing this is by writing the code
multiple times but you must be aware of
the fact that a program follows top-down
approach where a compiler executes the
code from line one till the end so here
if you start writing your code it will
waste a lot of time and energy so to
avoid this you can just create a method
which has addition formula where the two
numbers can be added ultimately so this
is how you can overcome the problem and
use methods instead of writing it again
and again
so Tyler asked me how does methods
affect the performance of a program so
as I just discussed our methods are used
to reduce the code written in C or you
can just reduce the complexity in your
program because the good part of method
here is you can send in different values
to the same function so don't be
confused because the methods and
functions are same so I hope you got
your answer now all right so now let's
jump off the next topic that is a
constructor so constructor is basically
a special type of function which has the
same name as that of a class so you
might be wondering why a constructor is
used when a constructor is used whenever
an object is created it won't be wrong
and saying a constructor is
automatically called
so here again we were thinking about
object but don't worry I will be telling
all about objects in the for the most
lights but for now you have to keep in
mind that these constructions doesn't
have a return type so let's see how
these constructors are classified
majorly there are two types of
constructor
default constructor and a parametrized
constructor so next now more about them
so deep one constructor is something
that is created automatically when you
don't create a constructor so here you
don't pass any argument to it also it is
further classified into two types the
one it is automatically created and the
other is user-defined whereas in the
parametrized constructor is where you
pass parameters to a constructor it
might be of any data type it can be of n
string or anything
so now let's implement them practically
so here is my cartridge so I'll create a
default constructor
you must know the constructor name is
same as that of a class name yeah
you
then I'll print this is my default
constructor
next what happens if you don't pass any
value to it that is the case when
compiler picks a default value so first
let me delete the value of color which
is black
so they can print these both color and
price
so since my color is of integer type
compiler picks up a value 0 and price is
off string at a time so you take a null
then you talk about a parametrized
constructor again I have to pass
parameters to it so I'll pass
Trixie and teacher P which refers to
color and price so I make a local
variable that is color which stores the
value of C similarly I create local
video price that stores the value of P
now again I have health claimed that
this is my paradise constructor
and again I have to print the color and
price so I'll just copy it from hell
paste it here so this is my default
constructor where I haven't passed any
parameters to it and in this case I have
passed string and integer so this is my
parameter s constructor so I hope you
guys are clear with constructors so now
we have talked about methods and
constructor but let's say if you want to
keep these methods some of them
specifically to your car now how can you
do it
also you might be wondering why are we
using this public keyword always so to
understand that let us talk about the
next topic that is an access specifier
public is an access specifier similarly
we have three more private protected and
default so when you give your simple
understanding of what these are and why
that important and useful for us so now
first this file is public so public as
the name says it is accessible from
everywhere so if we declare the class
method or variable as public these can
be accessed from any other class or
packets next we have private modifier
which basically limits your scope so
here the scope remains within the
function or if you talk about a class
scope remains within one class only so
that is how you can differentiate
between the two public is accessible to
all whereas private is completely
private then it comes protected access
modifier now you protected modifier the
properties can only be accessed by the
subclasses and finally there is a
default modifier for which you don't
have to write anything it is basically
taken by default where you can access
the properties in the same class but not
from a different package so as we
discussed in previous line let's look at
that in a tabular manner so that you can
get a complete understanding with
respect to it so here i've given a brief
explanation to all of these modifiers
and if i connect a public is accessible
from anywhere so you can access it
within the same class same package
subclass and other packages well then
there is private modifier which is
accessible within the same class but not
the same package subclass or other
packets at scope is limited for them
similarly there is protected which is
accessible from everywhere but not the
other packages and in the end there
comes a default which is accessible from
the same class and package but not from
the other group
so I hope you guys are clear with access
modifiers and how they are different
with respect to classes and packages so
kindly give me quick confirmation guys
okay Tyler is saying looks good okay so
so the read is asking my portion what do
you mean by a package and subclass okay
so mean so a package is basically a
namespace that organizes a set of
classes and interfaces now hang on we'll
be going through interfaces in the later
session also I asked me about sub class
right so a sub class is a child class
which inherits the property of a parent
class now here again the concept of
inheritance pops in so I will be
explaining both your interface ad
inheritance in some more minutes so hope
now everyone is clear with it alright so
now we come to structure of a class so
again this is a summarization of what we
have learned till now so here is my java
code that explains it all together now
this is the name of the class and I've
talked about member variables and the
different types
then after talked about constructors and
how I can initialize them then we have
also discussed about methods where you
can put in all the functionalities so
you guys have seen the structure of a
class with respect to car so let me show
you another example of class today so
this is my student class which has some
variables like ID and name then I have
my default constructor then I have a
parameterized constructor and here is my
method which displays the name and ID
and then there is main method which
basically executes all your code so I
hope your pyramid structure so till now
we know about variables constructors and
methods or you can say how a class is
designed basically we have just
completed a blueprint but now comes the
implementation stage or how can you
actually access these variables and
methods that are present in a class to
do that we need another key concept that
is known as objects so an object
basically is a child entity that has a
state and a behavior by state what do we
mean basically refers to a variable and
my behavior
it's your method now if we take the same
example of a car where this is just a
view
and this is actually an object of a car
the each state variable has a
corresponding value to it so where we
see color model and price earlier now we
have seen objects that has a value say
color of my car is orange our model has
a value 1 similarly price has a
corresponding value to it now we talked
about functionalities or behavior that
we have just seen earlier in a class is
still present in my object that is my
car needs to speed up and as it speed up
it also needs to change its scale so one
thing that you must have noticed that
the behavior that you set in a class is
something commonly present to all the
objects that you create but the value of
the state keeps changing from object to
object so now let's begin working with
objects so there are basically three
stages for creating an object you have
your declaration instantiation and
initialization so this is basically a
syntax of how we can create a new object
so you use a new keyboard now you have
already seen this so let me go back and
explain you what each part of syntax is
for so this is the class name that is
student followed by the object name then
there is this new keyword which
basically allocates the membrane for the
object so this new keyword is followed
by a call to constructor let's see if
you're not going to specify any value to
that object you can call MV for
constructor so in my case I am not in
any parameters to this so I know it
becomes my deeper constructor then there
are three ways where you can initialize
an object so the fourth is by a
constructor so here as you can see and
can use the default or a parametrized
constructor to store a value to my
object so let me just go back to my
previous code so here as you can see I
haven't passed any parameter to it so
this is basically my t4 constructor and
this is my another object that is to one
where I've passed the value of ID and
name so ID here is my one and the name
of the student is our you Shi then there
are methods so as we discussed how you
can pass values to a method
so let's see how I can call them using
an object so here let me take an object
that is student which has a method sale
display now it has an ID as a parameter
so let me put an ID say - and a name
that can be so this is how you can pass
values to a method the third way of
initializing is calling by a reference
variable now what it is till now what
they have done is actually passed the
value through constructor or a method
but how about creating an object or you
can say a reference variable to access
them let's see again how it is done so
we'll take another object say student 1
where and put the values of ID C 3 so
here it is accessed using a dot variable
so let me just print till
this current one an ID so let's run the
program and see what it shows to you so
here as you can see the first object is
my default constructor so the values are
0 and 9 so now Y is 0 because the ID is
of integer type so the compiler takes
the value 0 similarly for string it
takes null then we have created a
parametrized constructor which says the
value 1 and i you sheet that is printed
then it is by a method which passes a
student ID and student name so here i've
passed to and john and that is printed
then by reference variable and
initialized in ID that is 3 and this is
rented
so now I hope everyone is clear with all
these three methods to initialize an
object
most of them say yes sleep we move
forward so now that you've got an
understanding on how to work with class
or how to work with objects now just
take this to higher level where we
understand how to work with multiple
classes now you may be wondering why do
we need these multiple classes so no
Java code is written with just a single
class and when you're looking at real
tank project you may be having thousands
of classes as part of a code so what
we've been doing today we'll work with
two classes so this is just a reference
to understand where I have created two
classes which contains a constructor and
a method in both of them so you see in
my IDE where you can create two separate
class and perform operations on it so
now to understand this I have to create
one class so new in class let's say I
name it as a created it I have to do
another glass so I will go to class and
I name it as being put in the main
function just finish it so in my a class
first of all I need to define the
constructor so let me say sister
which says this is way
then and create a mess up a mess
which enhances that this is the network
across a
similarly may Class B and create a
constructor and Method so this operator
and then just change that this is the
constructor plus B and this is the
method or plus B change and this is the
constructor and the method is B metal
let's say I have my main function in
Class A with first of all and we created
object of Class A so that is a glitzy
object of a
the new which basically elevates the
membrane and okay let's create an object
of B glass say last name that is be an
object of the glass
can be then suppose I have to access the
methods of plus B then I just write to
be
so it'd be method and I'll just call it
so let me just go on and implement this
so they'll ask me that you have to
implement a and B so I will say yes so
the first thing that I have called is
the constructor of Class A that is this
is a constructor of Class A and then
I've called a constructor of Class B
this is the constructor of Class B then
again I have called the method of Class
B which says this is the method of Class
B so I hope you guys are clear with
multiple classes and how do they work so
again the output tab just shown in my
IDE
so now let us focus on boobs concepts
where I'll be talking about inheritance
abstraction encapsulation and how can
you achieve them using the class in Java
so the very first topic is inheritance
so all of you must be familiar with
inheritance
so it basically enhance the properties
which can be further use so here if you
see in Java a class acquires the
property of another now whose property
is inherited so there we have two
classes where a child class inherits the
property of a base class or you can say
earth parent class so class whose
properties inherited are known as base
class Mira's class which can help those
property unknown a style class or you
can say the right class or subclass so
these are just different names to call a
class then we have several types of
inheritance such as single
multiple hierarchical and hybrid so let
us know about them one by one so my
first type of inheritance is single
inheritance so this is the easiest type
where a single child inherits the
property of a parent class now how can
you edit them so in Java we use this
keyboard as extend which is used for
inheriting the properties of path oh so
this is my syntax where I have my class
a and my other class B is inheriting the
same Class A using an extend keyboard
then we have multi-level inheritance
where they can be different classes that
inherit property so for example your
parents would have inherited some
properties from their parents so in turn
you want to inherit some of them from
your parent right so if we look here
Class A is my parent class and B is a
child class which is inheriting the
properties of a now B can also be my
parent class which has a child class C
and that is inheriting the property of B
so if you see the syntax here Class B
extends a and similarly Class C inherits
be moving on then there is hierarchical
so in this one class is inherited by
many subclasses so how many of you have
siblings so I have a sibling and we both
share a lot of things that is similar
and that exactly is heretical so if you
look here Class B and Class C are
siblings or you can say child classes
which are hating the properties of Class
A and again if you see the syntax class
B extends a the Class C also extends
Class A so we have discussed three major
types that we've seen in Java so before
I go ahead this animal has knowledge of
C++ so Tyler is saying yes
so is B babe okay so some need ask me is
it important to have knowledge of that
okay so I mean it is not that important
but I can just relate to the topic that
we are about to learn okay so an amateur
also says yes since most of them are
saying yes
so guys you must have seen many types of
inheritance in C++ now guess why you
cannot find all these types in Java or
what is the challenge the Java is not
supporting these types so the main
objective of Java is to make it simple
or easy for everyone should remove all
the complexities such as multiple
inheritance which I hated a lot so let
me go to another type of inheritance
that is hybrid now if you have learned
about multiple inheritance you might be
having many doubts but to help you layer
with respect to these inheritance hybrid
is a combination of single and multiple
inheritance so in Java as you know
multiple inheritance is not supported as
you must be aware of diamond problem
with the two subclasses were inheriting
the same properties of the parent class
which has leading back to ambiguity and
that is why Java isn't supported but
here you can achieve this hybrid
inheritance using an interface now
interface play a major role here so we
will be learning about interface in a
while where I will be explaining what
exactly is interfaces and how it is
useful to achieve this type of
inheritance then my next object on it
concept is encapsulation so
encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of
wrapping up the data and code together
and a single unit so here if you see
methods variable all are binding
together in a single class so
encapsulation it also provides the
functionality where the variables of a
class can be hidden from another class
and which can be accessed only through
the members of the current class but now
the question is how can I do that
so to achieve a capsulation there are
two methods the first is where you can
declare the variables of a class as
private so have already seen this way
you can declare a variable as private
well the second method is where you can
provide sector and get a methods to
modify and see the values of the
variables so let's see the second
third way we can create a getter and
setter method to access these values so
here you see the code I have created a
class employee now this class has a
private variable that is named so this
is the first case where we have used the
private access modifier then we have
created get the method which takes the
name of the employee then we set that
name in a setter method therefore any
class that wants to access the variables
should access them through these Gators
and settles so let me go to my IDE and
show you how you can create these setter
and getter methods here I create a class
say employees
main function and finish now let's I
have to create a private variable let's
say it's the name of the employee
now you don't have to manually write
these Gator and setter methods
you just have to right-click go to
source and here you have an option of
generate getters and setters I have to
click on the name that is my variable
and click OK so this is my Gator method
which has a name say get name which
basically takes the name of the employee
and in my set name method it just sets
the name so by hair you guys must be
clear on how these methods work and how
encapsulation helps you to bind the code
together so if you have any doubts area
to any of the concept that I've just
explained you can ask them by writing
down in the chat box so that I can
explain them again so we make is saying
all clear namkha says perfect
Sammy says go ahead alright guys ok so
now let's move on to another concept
that is abstraction now abstraction is
basically the quality of dealing with
ideas rather than events so for example
when you consider the case of this car
here the mechanic is repairing a certain
function that is present in a car but
the user or you can sit drive what does
it want to know about these things
we just want that his car gets repaired
fast so in these types you can basically
segregate the implementation and show
the other person what he actually wants
to see so here how can you achieve this
you can achieve this by using an
abstract class and interface so let us
discuss what they are so an abstract
class is a class which has the abstract
keyword to it so here in these classes
you cannot instantiate or you cannot
create an object to them so it may or
may not contain abstract methods now
what exactly an abstract method is so an
abstract method is a method without a
body so here if you can see this is my
syntax will abstract is my keyword
followed by the name of the class so
also you have to keep in mind that if a
class has least one abstract method then
the class must be declared as abstract
again if the class is the clear abstract
it cannot be instantiated ok so be big
ask me portion how can you use an
abstract class then ok that's a great
question debate so to use an abstract
class
you basically have to inherit it from
another class or you can say you have to
provide implementations to the
check methods there itself so if you
relate we have done this before in
multiple classes where I've explained
with the working of different class in
separate class files so is it related
will be big or do you want me to repeat
that side again okay so he says he got
it all right that's great now coming to
my last topic that is interface so
interface in Java is AB you print of a
class or you can say it is a collection
of abstract methods constant and
everything else around so in an
interface each method is public and
abstract by default also it does not
contain any constructor so let us see
how we can declare your interface here
if you can see I have created an
interface s car so let's say we have
three methods he'll change gear speed up
and apply brakes so all my car have
these functionalities right but how they
work they'll going to be different let's
say you're working with a manual car
then you have to increment the gear one
by one but if you are working with the
automatic car that time your system
decides how to change gear therefore not
all my subclasses may have the same
logic written for change gear same case
is for speed up now let's say when you
press your accelerator it's speed up at
the rate of ten or fifteen kilo meter
per hour and suppose I am driving in
supercar basic increments by 30 or 50
kilometer per hour so again the logic
varies similarly is for apply brakes
where I may be having powerful brakes
and you may not have the same so what we
are doing here since all the
functionalities are common with all my
subclasses we'll create an interface
where all these functions are present
and then I will be creating a child
class that implements this interface but
the logic would be defined only there so
the functions will be present as part of
that but the logic varies but how can i
implement an interface so let me show
you in practical that i will be
providing all the functionalities to
your methods so here i have to create an
interface say my interface name is
parent car
here I have to write my methods that we
just discussed that are change gear
speed up and apply brake so let me just
write it down to you
you
so now we are done with writing these
three methods so now let me create
another subclass say an odd a class
which basically implements my interface
that is a parent car so I'll create a
class he'll say Audie which has our main
function
I'm so sorry
and rhenium is a sodding
this is done so first of all I have to
implement my interface that is parent
car so it is done by using an keyboard
that is implement four by the name of my
interface that is a parent gosh
now I have to declare some variables to
it say speed and gear
now I'll add these methods that we have
just declared in my interface so I'll
write my first method that is change
gear
I'm so sorry now it is fine
then I'll write another method that is
speed up
you
now Here I am putting some
functionalities to these methods so let
us see what happens after we add on
these functionalities
here am i incrementing my speed then
I'll write my third method that is apply
brakes
where I'll pass an argument as decrement
and I'll recommend my speed by this
variable
so we are done with these three methods
now let me create an object for this C
or D a six is equals to new body
then I have to call my function using
this object where I will give some value
to it
say suppose 50
okay one minute now it looks fine
okay so let me get one more method which
displays all these value say void
you
so in this method I have just printed
all the states which says my speed gear
so now let me call this method by an
object name so here says print print
States then I'll call another method say
change gear and let me put value 4 and
again I have to print
and say I have to call another method
see
and in the end we have just printed
these dates so now let us run this
program and see the output
so here my speed is 50 GERD is 1 then
for my second method speed is 50 again
and gear is 4 so I hope you guys are
clear with how an interface works so
here I can give you another example we
are create another class say BMW so I
will create a new class for you
so here I just copy paste my code
you
all right so now you must be wondering
why I've created this BMW class so here
in my own methods I'll just change the
functionalities and let us see what does
it affect in my interface so in my first
method I just change the value I'll
increment the gear value by one then in
my speed up function
I'll just increment my speed method
multiple of two
and similarly a increment here before
so let us run now
so here again you see different values
to the same function by implementing the
same interface that is my parent card so
this is the magic of an interface so
this brings us to the end of the session
so let me give you quick summary of what
we have known till now
at first we saw Java classes where I
took a real-life example of a card then
we have learned about constructor and
the different types later we talked
about access modifiers and how they are
used differently with respect to a class
and a packet then we saw a structure of
a class there I summarize the previous
topic with the programmatic example then
we talked about objects and how can you
work with them and finally we talked
about
OUP's concept and how you can implement
them in Java so I hope you guys find
this session useful so any kinds of
potion or doubts you're facing in any of
the concept that I have talked about in
this session you can just write it down
in a chat box or probably connect with
me in my next session so any question
guys all right so Tyler says no thank
you
the big says it was a nice session all
right so thank you so much guys for
attending this session also this video
will be uploaded to your LMS and if you
have any doubt you can reach out to our
support which is 24/7 available so by
this I hope you guys had a better
understanding of Java classes well thank
you everyone have a great day goodbye I
hope you enjoyed listening to this video
please be kind enough to like it and you
can comment any of your doubts and
queries and we will reply to them at the
earliest do look out for more videos in
