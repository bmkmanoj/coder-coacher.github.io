Eureka welcome to this session on smart
contract tutorials so we will be going
over the following topics today we're
going to discuss what a smart contract
is we're going to see who invented smart
contracts and we're going to discuss the
key properties then go through the
development languages and the advantages
and disadvantages of smart contracts
furthermore we're gonna see through some
smart contract tools that are really
necessary for development and in the end
of this tutorial I'm gonna show you all
how to deploy your own smart contract on
a test network so without much ado let's
get into today's session when blockchain
was released back in 2009 people didn't
know what to really use it for other
than the general bookkeeping of
transactions well it's been almost a
decade since blockchain was invented and
we've come across really interesting use
cases that implement the blockchain in
their own unique ways one such use case
is etherium which was the first blogging
platform that implemented the concept of
smart contracts so what exactly is a
smart contract well a proper definition
states that a smart contract our
executable logic that runs on a
blockchain network this basically means
that smart contracts are just simple
programs that run on the blockchain this
opens up the blockchain to be used in a
variety of sectors smart contracts are
available that control the logic behind
simple things like gambling asset
transfer
vote counting etc blockchain is also the
ideal space for smart contracts storing
due to its decentralized nature this
allows smart contract to realize
transactions without the need of an
intermediary even though the first
application of the concepts of a smart
contract was with the launch of a
theorem the genesis of the idea dates
back to early 1994 and the entire credit
goes to Nick Schwab
Nick was well known as a cryptographer
and of computer scientists he introduced
his idea of electronic contracts that
would handle protocols regarding
ecommerce when strangers met on the
Internet in 1998 Nick even designed a
mechanism for a decentralized digital
currency called Bitcoin even though it
was never implemented it acts as a
direct precursor to the Bitcoin
architecture today we have numerous
blockchain platforms other than its
helium that support smart contract
functionality
example hyper laser fabric nem and
Stella regardless of the platform they
are deployed in smart contracts have
some general key properties firstly
every smart contract is autonomous in
nature this means that once the
developer has created his logic and
deployed on the blockchain as a smart
contract he does not need to participate
in any of its processes smart contracts
are also OTO sufficient which means that
they can collect money realize
transactions distributed resources issue
and spend to allow a larger capacity of
storage and computation power
lastly smart contracts are decentralized
they are distributed by various Network
points instead of being focused on one
single central source smooth contracts
are mostly developed in their network
specific languages like solidity serpent
Viper but there are application
programming interfaces these days that
allow developers to develop their smart
contract in languages they are familiar
with for example Python and JavaScript
smart contracts come with their
advantages and disadvantages let's
discuss their advantages first first of
all smart contracts are sure complete
safety and security as data in a
decentralized registry cannot be lost or
hot secondly they remove third parties
and hence of show agent neutrality in
signing of deals next as smart contracts
are completely automated this means that
it performs a job with utmost precision
without a chance for human error and
since everything is automated and run by
code it also saves a lot of precious
time like every technology smart
contracts to have their own shortcomings
firstly they are a hassle to maintain as
things are immutable on blockchain this
means that every time you update your
swap contract you have to deploy it as a
completely new contract at a new address
the concept of a distributed and
decentralized back-end service is
difficult to understand for
inexperienced developers since it is a
new technology people generally tend to
be suspicious and skeptic when
implementing smart contracts now that
we've seen the pros and cons let's see
the tools available for helping us build
our smart contracts every contract
firstly needs a wallet to store its
transaction values in there are many
models available like mist armory and
multi-bit which serve this purpose
secondly we need a framework which makes
our lives as a developer much easier for
deploying these contracts good examples
of
frameworks include hyper laser fabric
and truffle we also need a compiler for
our scripting language but these can be
easily replaced by online compilers like
remix and compose app later on
lastly we need a test network to
actually test our smart contracts on as
once they are deployed on a regular
blockchain network they become immutable
smart contracts have seen some really
interesting use cases over time let's go
through a few of them gambling for one
has been made secure and lightning-fast
with the use of smartphone traps voting
smart contracts exists that make the
process completely transparent and
corruption free smart contracts are also
being used to speed up processes
involving deal signing for example
financial agreements and insurance
policies other than that
smart contracts are also being used to
automate entire organizations where
things like payment distribution
incentive handling are completely
automated these organizations are
commonly known as decentralized
automated organizations now that we've
seen everything about smart contracts
it's time we deploy our own smart contra
on our test network for this exercise we
are going to need no js' and npm
installed and update to the latest
version for the following exercise we'll
be using the following technologies
we'll be using the 3GS framework to
interact with a smart contract through a
front-end API will be using test RPC as
our test network and we'll be using
solidity to develop our contracts and
compiling them will be done through the
remix browser so without much ado let's
get started to get started we must go to
the remix browser first
as you can see the you get a smart
contract out here so we'll be creating
our own smart contract so press the sign
button and give it any name you want so
we will be compiling our smart contract
through this remix browser and we'll be
developing it in solidity this contract
will not be very complicated as the
motive of this exercise is to show how
you can deploy your own smart contracts
and test them on a test network so let's
get started
we define our contract with the contract
keyword and we call it them
now we need one variable and it's going
to be a string in a school Republic and
it's going to be colony you know make
two functions want to set the name so
function set name which takes an
argument string and sets that string to
the name very
next we need a function that gets the
name to function cat name and it's gonna
be view only and a public nature return
a string
so it's going to return a variable name
now that we've created our smart
contract it's time to compile it so you
just go and press start compile and as
you see we only have warnings which we
don't really care about and we don't
have any errors in the smart contract so
next we will need to set up our test
network for that open command prompt and
go NPM I - JEE ganache Sierra now you
just wait for it to install
not as installed just type in the
command ganache CLI and this should
start off your test network so as you
see this our test network is up and
running and this gives us ten accounts
these are the public keys and these are
the private keys so on the remix browser
go to the run tab and changed
environment to bat three provider click
OK
and as you see the provider has been
changed to the web three provider which
is running on the test RPC so now we
need to create our contract and it's
been created at this address now it's
time that we create our front-end for
this contract so to do that you open
command prompt again
we're a desktop
okay
and you make folder so we're going to
call a folder test
and you go into that folder angle NPM in
it
press Center through all these questions
and you're done so we've basically
initialized our JSON files so now we
need to also install our frame box so
for that we go NPM install cache now
save so that it gets saved as a
dependency in the JSON file and here iam
gs material /r @ 3
oh I made a spelling mistake this one
getting started properly
NPM and star
the young
you
one cell framework is installed just go
and check in the folder should have
three folders one with no modules and
you should have this web 3/4 without it
so now we will have to create our
front-end so for that
you're gonna create a new file so go to
the folder where you installed web 3 GSN
and initialize your project and create a
new text file
we call this index and show me a text
file
so we're gonna save this as in the same
folder
mother index dot HTML so now we just put
in the HTML boilerplate and we're gonna
call our webpage smart
entre - sorry
second file we need to include a script
so the source is go to the non node
modules you go to web 3 girl just and
you just copy this thing
and don't forget to change these
and the end tie prep 330s now we've done
de we will create our HTML for this
particular thing so it's gonna be very
simple we have a div and in disturb you
haven't so input type will be 'text and
you know how your name will give it a
placeholder
here and her name and now you have a
button so button you're gonna call it
set name
let's give this and we're gonna have an
output part and this is a same day so
let's give these some IDs so let's give
this an ID off and put this will have an
ID of button and now this have a
nineteen of output
so let's see what this looks like
yeah so we have our basic thing so if I
type in my name and set name something
should come up here so let's get that
working that we need our script
and so let's declare a variable called
back three we're going to be using this
variable to reference a phonebook
so if type off
type of that tree is unopposed to
undefined said the NASA provider to read
three
current provider so if it's an undefined
type he said to the current provider and
else
nut tree because new left wing that tree
the libraries HTTP
lighter
it's gonna be what
RCM e-learning odd it was running at
it's running at logo those eight five
four five I'm not wrong so match TPP
so now that we've specified our provider
we need to specify our default count so
mapped Rita Anton before found not at
the accounts
this basically means that we're setting
the first account as a default account
and we be doing all our transactions
based on this so now we need to define a
contra war new contra equals two
but 3.8 start
now we paste in our contracts EBI out
here the API stands for application
binary interface to get the application
binary interface core is a compile tab
go on details and you basically need to
just copy the small thing out of it yeah
this thing ABI copied us and space it
out here this basically shows what
functions are there in the contract next
we need to instantiate a contract so bar
equals two so dot app we specify the
address of our contract which was
basically this
so that's a dress that our contract has
been deployed at on a test network now
we need to do some fiddling so let's get
our outputs and inputs far
I mean to just Josie
I'll give them different name this was
the input it had an idea
and this is the output so 90 of button
and
okay so now we go contra ah
what was the name of our contracts
function it was set name so contract
I'll accept name will give us should we
input value and
and this should only happen when we
click on a button
so we're listening for a click and all
that functionally basically do this
so we selected all the elements of our
contract of our HTML Rado and then
whenever somebody clicks the button and
sets the name we're gonna get an output
from the contract cat name
so let's save this down file save and
let's try it on
last time we made an error HTML 8383
oh yeah I forgot this that should I fix
it not read property providers of
undefined
0:27
mmm I forgot a new keyword out here
okay so document.getelementbyid ei' it
just needs to be small that was a
mistake
yeah seems like we you've run out of
iris resolve now so basically this
should go yep now you see we've deployed
a contract on the smartphone shot and
now we're getting the output out here so
basically what happens is our contract
is running out this address out here
right here it knows what's in the
contract through this application binary
interface which we see right here and
basically what three GS just lets us
interact with our contracts I hope you
learn something today and this is all
