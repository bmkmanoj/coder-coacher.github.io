hello guys this is my ex and I and I
would like to show you my Android
application which I developed for Ed
Eureka which starts with an flash
activity which stays on screen for two
seconds and then based o inventory is
displayed which contains computers
monitors and accessories so that we can
add any item 2d card or just CD card as
if I click on C card it says you have
nothing in this card so I have to add
elements to it so to get to any
particular product we just have to
traverse from back to next so if I click
on back it says this is the first model
so I have to click on next so if I
choose to buy crumble crumble 175
computers with this price and need four
units of it I just click on four units
and add that to card also I given it our
experts rating bar which can be helpful
for the salesperson to sell their
product by the ratings of the various
models the same can be done for monitors
and accessories if I want to buy Trumble
17-inch monitor I just click on add card
and if I finalize the all the purchase I
just click on C card so all my purchase
products are shown in the card with
6.50% sales tax with this amount and the
grand total as there can be slight
change in the sales rate I had also
given it a change button so that they
can change the rate accordingly let's
say it it's ten point five and change
the rate and my sales tax amount with
the grand total is adjusted accordingly
with the ten point five percent sales
tax and also now this ten point five
percent rate is fixed from now on for
any purchase for the words so that we
don't have to change eight to ten point
five again and again also if I want to
delete any item I just have to long
click on it it will ask to delete the
item from the cart if I click on delete
the item is deleted and deal so it's the
dealing page where I have to fill all
these entries to go further to finalize
the purchase which I have to fill the
buyers name a valid email ID which I I
haven't given it a valid ID and select a
salesperson and if I click on finalize
the purchase it says enter the valid
email ID so I have to enter a valid
email id containing a trade with the dot
and also the processing date will be get
through the system and click on finalize
the purchase so the old number number of
Units grand total with the name of the
customer and the salesperson with email
is shown in the summary and the purchase
details also the order number will
increment for every time whenever there
is a purchase to make so when I click on
pay I will be redirected to the store
inventory page and also I get a
notification which says the order number
and the name of the buyer with the
purchase amount so that it can be easily
accessible for the salesperson to know
which order number was for which buyer
also I had given it a menu features such
as see all transactions where all the
transactions can be seen and the total
sale amount can be seen also I can
delete all these transactions or just go
back if I click on delete all it will
delete all the all these transactions
and redirect me today store inventory
page also if I click on about us
it tells all the information about the
Trumbull computers with its main branch
and the phone numbers fax numbers so
that sales person can tell anybody about
anything about for the Trumbull computer
so if I click on close the app it will
close my application and that's my
Android application so I would like to
thanks a draaga

applications by providing me with online
trainings and various videos related to
Android at a greater Doulton it's very
helpful for me to develop the Android
applications so i heartfully thanks to
