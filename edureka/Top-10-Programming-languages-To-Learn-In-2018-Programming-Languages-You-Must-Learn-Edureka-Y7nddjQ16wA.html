and welcome to this interesting session
on top 10 programming languages of 2018
2017 has come to an end we just have a
month left and here are the top 10
programming languages that you need to
look out for in 2080 starting at number
10 we have Alexa now Alexa was
introduced in September 2014 and a
functional concurrent and
general-purpose programming language
that runs on a language machine it's a
language that compiles to bytecode for a
language of machines where everything is
an expression now it's created by josva
lab and has gained a lot of popularity
mainly because it has become the
foundational language for one of the
most popular messaging application which
is what's up now using Alexa we've been
able to create better applications for
message processing connecting IOT
devices and streaming of data this in
turn has made the Internet of Things
domain were quite fast and effective
thanks to this language now if you're
moving into that domain where you want
to explore something new and get a good
idea of Internet things then definitely
Alexa is a language that you should look
out for moving in at number 9 we have
our programming language now our has
gained a lot of popularity and is one of
the biggest dominator in the analytical
dubbing this is mainly because of its
ease of use and simple syntax that a lot
of statisticians and non statisticians
love this language as were having very
strong graphic capabilities due to
libraries like ggplot and ggplot2 it
also has a very powerful command-line
scripting too which makes it quite easy
for storing even a series of complex
data as well now since it's an open
source project it has an edge over its
competitors like SAS and MATLAB as well
now due to its platform friendliness it
can run on Windows Mac and Linux and
it's being used by organizations like
Google Facebook and Firefox for that
advanced analytical operations as well
coming in at number 8 we have :
introduced by Google in 2009 it's a very
fast fun and productive language which
is being used across different domains
as well
now go is recognized in tradition of C
but makes many changes to improve
brevity simplicity and safety as well
having features like faster compilation
time remote package management online
package documentation and having a
distinct approach to various existing
problems go comes with a desire to keep
language specifications simple enough to
hold in a programmers hat in part by
omitting features common to similar
languages as well used by of most
popular organizations like Dropbox
Google Netflix and uber it's also being
used with newest technologies like
blockchain as well so definitely this is
something that would be really helpful
if you're looking to move into new h
tech as such next we have rust
introduced in 2015
rust is a system programming language
sponsored by Mozilla research it has
been the most loved language by
stackoverflow developers for 2016 and
2017 it is mainly managed by Mozilla
Foundation and these other people who
manage most of your Internet related
operations so definitely if they are
introducing and they are working on this
language you can expect a lot from this
language as well organizations like chef
Dropbox and NPM use rust for various
different operations because of its
minimal runtime and memory safety as
well following this we have Scylla
now Scylla has been in the market for
quite some time now Scylla is a
general-purpose programming language
designed to express common programming
language patterns in a concise elegant
and typesafe way it smoothly integrates
features of object-oriented and function
language enabling Java and other
programming languages to be more
productive now ideally the code size are
typically reduced by a factor of two to
three times when compared to an
equivalent java application scalar helps
to boost development productivity
application scalability and overall
reliability in the industry today scalar
has dominate really being used with
respect to slack spark and has gained a
lot of popularity in the big data domain
OspA organizations like LinkedIn Airbnb
Foursquare Netflix tumblr make use of
Scala effectively coming in at number 5
we have Swift it's a safe fast and
interactive programming language that
combines the bare
in modern programming languages thinking
with wisdom from far wider Apple
engineer culture and diverse
contribution from its open-source
community the compiler is optimized for
performance and the language is
optimized for development without
compromise on either now for those of
you who are new to programming language
this is one of the most friendly
programming language that you can
definitely pick up as well now Swift
intern combines powerful type influenced
and pattern matching
with modern lightweight syntax allowing
complex ideas to be expressed in a clear
and concise manner as a result the code
is not just easier to write but easier
to read and maintain as well now Linda
is using swift for their applications
right now also uber is switching their
iOS application over to Swift as well
enterprise wise IBM is using Swift for
their apps as well as working on an
online compiler for the language as such
Firefox has 23% of Swift code in its iOS
implementation as well for those of you
who are looking for us development Swift
is the biggest player here it has to an
exchange replaced objective-c
but definitely Swift is growing beyond
iOS and Apple as well next at number
four we have C hash C hash is an
object-oriented programming language
which is a style of programming that
carries its own advantage as well it's
the most powerful programming language
for dotnet framework and takes the help
of visual C++ being designed by
Microsoft there's a lot of documentation
available and if you're looking to
develop applications on Windows
definitely this is your biggest support
as well now now when I say application
development C hash is not just
restricted to Windows application but
also can be used for Android iOS and
Windows Phone applications as well now
those of you who are coming from
programming backgrounds like C C++ and
Java this is definitely one of the
easiest programming language that you
can really pick up as well now coming in
at number three we have one of the most
oldest and popular programming language
which is Java now Java has been in this
domain for quite some time it doesn't
really matter which domain you work in
you will surely come across
sooner or later that's how effective and
widespread Java has become today having
become the foundation for various
frameworks like spring struts
hibernate and the list just keeps going
on as well it's being used in various
domains like web development application
development like your Android
application stock market big data and I
can keep giving you a big list as well
today there is no domain Raja is not
present and has been one of the biggest
programming language that most
programmers are aware of as well coming
in at number 2 we have path now this
personally is a favorite of mine now if
you're new to programming and if you are
looking to go into a development job pro
this is definitely what I would
recommend you to it's a very easy to
understand and easy to pick up
programming language now it is an open
source programming language and can be
used for various operations like web
scraping testing web development
analysis artificial intelligence and so
forth as well now python 2d has gained a
lot of popularity in comparison to most
programming languages that are out there
and if it was not for the number one
programming language Python would have
definitely been the biggest programming
language of 2080 ad number one we have
JavaScript and typescript javascript is
a programming language which you can use
to implement complex things like on a
web page as well on a high level it's
the most used programming language in
the world and has the largest open
source package repository in the world
as such companies like Microsoft Google
Accenture uber and so forth the list
does not stop use javascript effectively
for their various purposes typescript is
a superscript of JavaScript which
compiles into plain JavaScript objects
now typescript is something that has a
lot of pious opinion but definitely is
one programming language that will pick
up a lot of attention going forward as
well
javascript has become the base for
various frameworks and library like
angular nodejs react.js and so forth as
well now when you talk about the
features of JavaScript
it basically is a high-level programming
language which high dynamic
capability and full flush complete
access to the users a spa now it's
believed to be the language of web and
is the backbone for the internet that is
available today when you talk about the
features of typescript it has various
capabilities some of them being early
error detection as in that compiler can
check for errors at the surface level
itself while compiling and this in turn
makes it quite easy for the users for
debugging as well
now using typescript you can define one
main entry ts file and refer all the TS
files that you need in the output
JavaScript file now when you compile the
bean Intuit ES file with the out option
the compiler will concatenate all the
directly or indirectly referred files
into one javascript file in order to
which they were referred as well now
typescript supports huge applications
quite easily which was earlier difficult
with JavaScript now with this we come to
a conclusion of this video now in case
