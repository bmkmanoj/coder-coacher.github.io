acre and welcome to this session on
blockchain wallet now without wasting
any time let's move forward and get
today's agenda to get a better
understanding of what we'll be covering
as part of this session now the first
thing we'll try to understand is why do
we actually need a blockchain wallet as
such okay when there are different types
of world present then why do we
specifically need a wallet that stores
our bit cards moving on from that we'll
talk about what exactly is a blockchain
wallet and we look at the various
features of a blockchain wallet once
you've seen these features we'll talk
about the various types of wallet that
are present in today's market now there
are different types of wallet that are
available today so we compare some of
the most popular wallets and help you
get a better understanding as to which
meets your requirement finally as part
of today's demo session we'll be looking
at how you can buy bitcoins and how you
can transact these bitcoins using
different wallets as such now I hope you
guys are definitely excited for today's
session so let's move forward
today's first topic that is why do we
need a blockchain wallet now first thing
that comes to your mind is why do we
need a specific Bitcoin wallet now in
what you need to understand is that
bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency so
to handle these cryptocurrencies to
store them and as well as manage the
transactions initiate the transactions
as such you need a specific type of
wallet and that's exactly what your
blockchain wallet is now apart from that
most people usually have multiple
blockchain accounts okay so each account
correspondingly could have a different
amount of bitcoins presented and this is
a general policy most people actually
follow now in that case using the same
blockchain wallet you can store all
these accounts and ensure that you have
complete access to your accounts as well
as paths apart from that these
blockchain wallets in itself help you
instantaneously perform transaction now
once you have the address of the person
whom you want to send the bitcoins to
then it's just a matter of copy pasting
it specifying the amount of bitcoins you
want to set and then just clicking on
sell and the transaction in itself is
quite instantaneous as such finally
comes the concept of transaction now all
we see it's important that you keep a
track of all the transactions that you
do now once you've linked all your
blockchain accounts to a single block
chain wallet in itself it becomes quite
easy for you to keep track of
all the transactions that you have
perform now take an example of online
wallet like blockchain info here all the
transactions from when you have created
you wallet are available now this
basically gives you a complete idea of
how much you earned whom you've sent to
war as well as all the references and
the transaction details as well ok now
moving on let's try to understand what
exactly is a blockchain wallet it's
basically similar to a bank account ok
like how you have a PayPal account how
you have a bank account associated with
Bank of America
ICICI HDFC and so you blockchain
wallet also is equal into a bank account
it's on here what happens is you use the
specific blockchain account or
blockchain wallet to send receive and
store your bitcoins as such ok so again
similar functions to your bank account
itself now I mean how it is different is
that instead of actually sending
currency here you're sending bitcoins
but the value of bitcoins is something
that is not constant it keeps changing
with respect to the current value of
bitcoins aside now more people invest
into bitcoins more will the value of
bitcoins increase more people pull out
from it more will the value read user
sir and this is one of the major
contributing factor that decides the
value of bitcoins as such because the
Bitcoin and blockchain system is
something that's completely built on no
trust model no need to put your trust on
someone else to burn time now we need to
understand that here more and more
people invest into the system or a
mobile the value keeper and this is one
of the greatest contributing factors for
growth of bitcoins it's grown over 650
percent at least in the past year itself
well now move forward let's try to
understand the various features of a
blockchain wallet how does it separate
it from the other wallets that are
present in the market for storing this
riccati
now the first and the foremost feature
is the security feature in comparison to
most other digital wallet
blockchain wallets have multiple layers
of security apart from that even
initiating a transaction was certain
levels of step you're gonna have to
enter your PIN that is associated for
the wallet you may have to enter a
passphrase if required if the hardware
wallet you need to actually specify you
need to actually confirm the transaction
on the hardware wallet and so far in in
comparison to most other words out then
the number of secure
delays associated with a blockchain
wallet is quite high SL and apart from
that the blockchain system in itself is
something that is completely built on
various security techniques so this
ensures that even the transactions
themselves are completely secure but one
thing you need to remember is that the
transactions in a block Chile ledger are
not reversible that is if you've
initiated or transaction to a wrong
person then you cannot recover the
bitcoins that you have set always ensure
that you're sending the bitcoins to the
correct address apart from that the next
feature would be the insert image
transaction feature now again as I had
mentioned to you the transactions here
are quite ingenious
you need to be read for a long time for
the transaction to complete for a
confirmation to come now if you work
with bank transactions there are times
when you initiate a transaction but have
to wait till the banking asks for the
transaction get completed and verified
as well here the transaction can be
initiated 24 hours and 7 days a week and
you don't need to even worry about the
delay with respect to the transactions
now one major factor with respect to the
blockchain wallet is that it lets you
convert your bitcoins into different
crypto currencies as well as you can
sell out your bitcoins into any currency
that you want now as for today's session
I'll be showing you how we can buy
Bitcoin using in you know piece then
I'll also show you how you can convert
bitcoins to aetherium on the blockchain
in for water finally comes the use of
accessibility
now again as I had mentioned Bitcoin
wallets are presented multiple platforms
you can have your wallet present on a
piece of paper it could be present on a
hardware device it could also be on your
phone so at any given instant you have
the complete access to your wallet and
it becomes easy for you also to check up
your balance you can also validate your
transactions and immediately also
initiate any transactions as per your
requirements as such
finally let's move forward and talk
about the various types of wallet that
are present with respect to block chain
wallet now it's essentially important
that you understand the different types
of wallet that are present so that you
can go on to decide which wallet suits
your requirement as such now the first
category of wallets are based on the
location of the priority that is where
exactly is the private key associated to
your wallet being store now when we talk
about a hot wallet this is basically a
in Pokhara we're in the private he is
completely stored on a cloud-based sir
so you don't need to worry about where
it's being stored because what happens
is its present on the cloud and anytime
you want to access it you can go on to
the website off the blockchain well it
immediately access it as per your
requirements as such the second type is
called a cold wallet now here how it's
slightly different is that you have an
application that once on either your
device or it could be a hardware wallet
as such what you need to do is that all
the transaction related details that is
the private key the sender's key apart
from that the amount everything is going
to get first hashed and only the
transaction hash is going to get
propagated toward the network so this
ensures that the details with respect to
the user is Sakura set now in comparison
to security feature cold words are
considered to be more secure than hot
wallet because again you have the
complete control with respect to your
private key but at the same time in
terms of accessibility hot wallets are
more easily accessible as well as the
speed of transaction with respect to a
hot wallet it's quite faster when
compared to a cold wallet as such then
you have based on the devices and client
let's first talk about the devices you
can either go for an online web wallet
here what happens is the wallet is
actually present online that is it's a
web-based wallet wearing all your keys
would be stored on a cloud-based server
apart from that you have mobile wallets
now here what happens is usually the
private keys are stored on your phone as
well as it's linked to of web-based so
now on the web based servers based on
the application there would be a copy of
the private key or it could just be
stored on your phone whereas the
transaction details would be propagated
on the cloud service then you have
desktop wallets not desktop wallets are
basically an extension to your
cloud-based wallet but what happens here
is that it is actually a cold war with
rather than hot work because all the
details with respect to your private key
your transactions everything is stored
on the planet and it's not directly
accessible to a third party professional
now again you need to understand that
all the details are present on an
application it's only the final hash
value that is going to get propagated
through the cloud-based server or on the
blockchain server itself finally you
have physical works no physical walls or
something like your security
you can have your physical wallet either
present in form of a bitcoin card it
could also be a paper wallet as such
where you're storing your bitcoins in a
piece of paper okay now this is a simple
example of how a paper wallet would look
like as well as a Bitcoin card now apart
from that physical wallets are also
usually used to store bitcoins for
future purposes as well so let's say you
want to save up some bitcoins in case of
some emergency physical worlds are one
of the best choices as such now moving
on let's talk about blockchain vault
based on clients assets you can either
have a software client where and it
could be a desktop application it could
be a cloud-based application mobile
application or so forth or you can go
with the hardware wallet as such now
again as I had mentioned it's based on
the user's requirement that you can
choose one or the other now let's
compare some of the most popular wallets
that are present in today's market okay
so we're going to compare five of these
popular wallets and each of them come
from a different category as such now
the first wallet that we'll be talking
about is Bitcoin coke now this was the
co wallet introduced by Bitcoin radhaji
and is one of the most secure as well as
stable wallet in the market today what
you need to understand is that while
you're using this wallet it completely
downloads the entire blockchain that is
you get the complete blockchain
downloaded on your system so thereby it
becomes a very huge part given today's
size it's close to over 130 TV that gets
downloaded when you're working with
Bitcoin co water but with respect to the
space and memory constraint also comes
the feature of security privacy and
stability with respect right so this is
one of the most popular wallets that had
been initially introduced coming on to
the next wallet that is tensor tensor is
again one of the most popular wallets as
a hardware wallet okay now again with
respect to Hardware wallet security this
is again one of the major players in the
market today and it also comes with
respect to a display as well as two peas
which will help you verify as well as
adds another layer of protection for
your blockchain water now again when you
talk about the security feature with
respect to tens or or any hardware
wallet it's very high in comparison to
all of the world but again with respect
to ease of use it's not that comfortable
when you're on the go or when you want
to immediately initiate
these are not very comfortable for that
okay coming down to the next wallet is
blockchain info wallet now blockchain
info all it is one of the most popular
online wallets present today it has
close to about 8 million different users
such now it also supports both bitcoins
and etherium and helps you convert your
bitcoins to aetherium and vice versa
which we'll be seeing as part of today's
demo as such now apart from that you
also offers one of the cheapest
transaction fees for initiating any
transaction as such like let me just
give an example and see if you want to
send about 2500 piece on a non Pekar
time it costs you somewhere about 4
rupees as such as the transaction fees
and at the same time if you want to make
the transaction of priority transaction
the transaction fees slightly increases
to about 41 rupees thinking this is a
very small fees that gets included when
you see the overall transaction fees
with respect to the different forms of
transactions that are available today
okay next we have Elektra electrum is
again a very popular desktop based
wallet and is known for its security
feature as per now in terms of speed as
well as simplicity is one of the most
popular ones as such with respect to
desktop water there are various features
with respect to selectra so I will
definitely recommend if you're looking
for a desktop wallet this is one that
you should definitely put your eyes on
but again one thing you need to remember
is that electrum has slightly higher
transaction fees when you compare with
respect to the other desktop wallets are
such moving on mycelium mycelium is one
of the most popular mobile wallets which
is present for both Android and iOS okay
here you have the complete access to
your private keys and it does not leave
your device unless and until you wish it
to so as I had mentioned you this is an
example of a cold water here the private
key details are stored on your device as
such and unless and until you want it to
be migrated it does not get my kit now
there are people who want to constantly
keep checking their Bitcoin wallets for
an update with respect to the value of
Bitcoin so mycelium also offers you an
option of watch only address when you
can keep checking the value of bitcoins
associated in your wallet without having
actually to log into your wallet as such
ok so I hope we've got a simple
understanding with respect to the
different types of wallet as well as the
comparison between the most popular
wallets in
today's market now you can go on to
choose whichever Wallet meets your
requirement and for today's demo session
what we'll be doing is we'll be buying
bitcoins using this app a mobile
application okay when and I buying
bitcoins and then I'll be initiating a
transaction from my Zep a mobile
application to my blockchain info wallet
which is the online blazed water then I
will also show you how you can convert
your bitcoins to aetherium as such okay
so how you hope you guys are definitely
looking forward to this
moving on first what you need to do is
that you need to go on to Google Play
Store and download your zap pay
application from Google Play Store in
case if you are looking to buy bitcoins
in India then this is one of the best
choices that I can such a steal well
okay so once you've done with that let
me just go on and show you how you can
buy bitcoins and I'll give you a simple
overview of how they pay works now this
is the Zippy google apps to download
page okay so you can go on to download
the application and this is the Apple
Store download link for zippy okay now
let me just show you how sepia looks
like now this is a zippy interface on an
android application now since I am using
an Android application you can see this
is how it looks like okay so let me just
go to the buy option here okay now as
you can see I have already loaded some
money into it let me just give you a
simple overview with respect to the
application before we go on okay so if
you go to the menu option here you can
see if there are different things here
first thing that you need to do after
you install the application is go to the
verification option and here what you
need to do is that you need to provide
your personal details as well as your
pan card details apart from that you
need to give you a bank details now
every time that you wish the balance not
that is what you've the amount that
you've gained after selling your
bitcoins to be transferred to you back
then you need to provide the
corresponding bank details apart from
that you need to provide your address
details in case of verification as such
now once you've completed the
verification process which usually takes
a day to three days then you have the
access to buy and sell bitcoins as per
your need now first thing what you need
to do money verification is complete
does that click on the deposit option to
deposit a specific amount into your zip
a wallet as such okay so you have two
ways to transfer the money either you
can use net banking or you can go with
RPG SN EFT or I appears I would
recommend going through net banking
because it's faster and you can
definitely
started immediately okay once you've
done that you can see the corresponding
balance being reflected here now let me
go on to buy bitcoins as per my D so if
I click on buy option process here then
it's going to redirect me to the option
to buy the bitcoins okay now one thing
you need to keep in mind is that zippy
biased as well as sells bitcoins on a
higher rate when compared to the market
present trends okay this is mainly
because they keep a buffer with respect
to the current rates as such in case of
a fluctuation with respect to that same
now again the minimum amount that you
can buy bitcoins for is thousand and it
can go up to ten lakhs as such okay now
what I'll do is I'll use the complete
amount here so let's say I'm going to
use three two five eight okay and then
it's telling me I can buy zero point one
Bitcoin given the present rate as such
so let me just click on buy option and
it is going to ask me for a security pin
now this is another thing that you would
be setting up while you're installing
the application always ensure you
remember your PIN associated with
respect to your water if I click I
specify my pin as such the transaction
gets initiated and immediately the
bitcoins get added to my wallet again
now if you can see I had earlier zero
bitcoins present now I have zero point
one bit compressor now given at any
incidence I want to sell my bitcoins I
can just click on a cell option and it's
going to give me the present rate and it
tells me how much I can sell my bitcoins
for so if I click on sell all it's going
to tell me the corresponding value as
well okay now it's time that we initiate
a transaction with respect to our set
the application now for this what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to use my
Zep a wallet which has 0.1 Bitcoin and
I'm going to send it to my blockchain
wallet now here if I you have the option
to either receive bitcoins or you can
send bitcoins by selecting one of these
two options the first thing I want to do
is that I'm going to send bitcoins so
let me just click on send now here it's
going to ask me whether it's to a
specific contact in my wallet or I'm
going to specify the corresponding
address now in this case I'm going to
specify the address so I'm going to
click the B icon press it here once I do
that it's going to ask me for the name
as well as the address so here you can
see the address has been specified so
let me just call this my wallet
apart from that most wallet these days
also have a QR code associated for their
wallets so you can even scan the QR code
rather than enter it manually okay now
once I click on the tick mark present
here you can see below here it's going
to ask me how many bitcoins do I want to
set I'm going to click on send all okay
so here as you can see it's taking a
corresponding transaction fees
associated for my bitcoins as per
earlier where I had almost 0.1 bitcoins
now it's come down this is because of
Bitcoin network transaction fees now if
you see here these of the standard
transaction fees associated with respect
to the bitcoins we may change slightly
depending on the traffic as such now
once I click on send all option and I
click on the OP I can present here it's
going to again ask me for the pit so I
specify my pin and it has initiated or
transaction with respect to my bitcoins
now let me go back and show you okay I
see you can see I have got a message
that tells me that my bitcoins have been
sent from my wallet as well so this is
one of the major factors which I would
recommend you to go with set pay as such
okay now this is my blockchain info
wallet and this is the completely
cloud-based wallet here okay so here are
all my recent Bitcoin transactions my
present transaction value that is
there's no bitcoins present at the
moment so it's showing me the balance to
be 0 ok now again now they've recently
started an option to buy and sell
bitcoins through these blockchain to
wallet itself apart from that as I had
mentioned they support both bitcoins as
well as he throws as such ok so I've got
a notification that says I've received
bitcoins so let me just call my Bitcoin
dashboard okay let me just go to my home
- $4 so here you can see I have 0.9 5 5
5 7 6 bitcoins but the value is Flo this
is mainly because the Bitcoin info
wallet actually is going with the
current value of 2 laugh 96,000 for the
present value of a bit card whereas on
zippy it was close to 3 lat 22,000 now
that is mainly because the difference as
I had mentioned so they keep a buffer
difference with respect to that same
okay not this is my corresponding value
in Bitcoin so let me just convert show
you how you can convert these bitcoins
to etherium as well
so here you have the option of
converting all your existing bitcoins to
the theorem on the blockchain info
wallet itself so let's say if I put zero
point zero zero again and it tells me
that the minimum limit is zero point
zero zero zero 1 for 3 bitcoins okay
which is correspondingly equivalent to
40 rupees in Indian rupees as such ok so
let me just change it to zero point one
now it tells me I have only so many
bitcoins and I can only convert this so
once I click on this option then it
converts this to etherium okay so zero
point zero zero nine bitcoins is
equivalent to zero point one two seven
etherium as such again this is mainly
because the price difference with
respect to that same now wearing of
Bitcoin is close to three lakhs and
etherium is just worth twenty one
thousand rupees again I have generally
kept the currency to be two pieces
because rupees is where I will be
working out now once I click on next the
conversion actually starts okay now one
interesting fact about the same image is
that there is a time frame associated
with respect to the code with respect
because the value of bitcoins or theorem
are constantly changing you can see here
it's fixed a specific value from our bit
conscious Victor specific value for my
aetherium it's also kept a constant
exchange rate with respect to that
there's an Associated transaction fees
as well as a withdrawal visa so now I
have agreed to the condition shapeshift
is one of the most popular platform
which helps you convert your
cryptocurrencies between each other okay
so once I click on confirm
correspondingly the transaction is
couldn't get initiated and the exchange
has successfully taken place again this
may take some time with respect to that
and the corresponding conversion would
get reflected here now if you see here
this was also considered to be a
transaction okay now at any point if I
want to see this series of this just
click on the arrow mark here which will
redirect me to blockchain dot info
website where and it will show me the
status of the transaction as well so you
can see the status of any transaction
and if you've attended my previous
session you might be aware that any
transactions using bitcoins is visible
to everyone across the clock so all you
need is the transaction ID associated
and you can completely view transactions
involving Bitcoin but here again it's
using my public key thereby ensuring
that no one can actually know who is
dealing with respect to these bitcoins
who your identity is completely
anonymous now with this we come to a
conclusion of today's session we started
talking with respect to why you need to
use a blockchain wallet what exactly is
a blockchain wallet then we saw the way
these features of blockchain wallet as
well as we saw the different types of
water after that we compared five of the
most popular wallets in the market today
and we saw them on how you can buy
bitcoins and perform a transaction using
them we also saw how we can convert
bitcoins to etherium as such now with
this we come to a conclusion of the
session in case if you do have any
questions please put it across
