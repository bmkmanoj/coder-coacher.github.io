decision tree for predictive modeling as
you all know data scientists as a
profession is fast catching up and and
out of that's the best profession in the
current will now data mining is one such
technique and within data mining you
have a plethora of opportunities and the
world is moving in a piece at a pace
which we have never seen before take
example of driverless cars data mining
is being used artificial intelligence
and data mining go hand in hand those
both are the same if you get an email in
your account in your gmail account how
will that particular email get
classified as a spam email or a regular
email which gets into your inbox and
before we get started let me tell you on
what is data scientists as a profession
a data scientist is a person who
actually builds prediction models across
the radius domains across the radius
industries and across the radius sector
for example if you apply for a loan
should I approve your loan or should I
reject your own I'm given two decisions
right I need to take one decision out of
these two will you default on the loan
payment or will you not default again I
need to take a decision will I default
on the credit card or will I not is a
credit card transaction fraudulent
transaction or not will a person working
in my organization leave the company or
not within the next three months or six
months whatever be a time with a person
who is using airtel shift to work phone
yes or no these are the radius decisions
that you might most often not want to
take as an organization now or as a
department you need to take this
decision and a data scientist is a
person who is going to build those
predictive models which will help you
forecasting n decision tree is one such
technique which will help you figure out
on which that's right and let us do a
deep dive into decision tree for the
next 45 minutes or so and then there
will obviously be a lot of question and
answers right so decision trees that
meek which is part of data mining super
wise when I say super wised your
algorithm or the model that you're going
to build is going to learn on its own
think about Mars rover right what is a
Mars rover Mars rover is a small
equipment which is sent to planet Mars
to check on whether there is life there
to continuously keep providing the
required information to the scientists
here on the planet Earth right before
even sending that they have used this
particular machine a rowboat travel on a
bumpy road to travel on an uneven Road
whether a lot of rock the machine used
to learn on its own on what should do if
there is a steep slope what you do watch
the machine do if there is a steep
height there watch the machine do if
there is a rock should it take a left or
right or which direction should it go
right now are you getting on what is
artificial intelligence car watch the
car do if there is an animal which
suddenly comes on the room or if there
is a zebra crossing watch the card if
there's a pot there is a man who'll our
person who watch the car to wake will do
if there's a left or right which
direction to shoot the way kulti what
should the V the speed at which the Waco
should accelerate and mention that way
colac celery what should be the braking
system right obviously you do not want
your vehicle to keep applying sudden
break so all these are happening as we
speak in should I take a lighter right
or a left that's a decision that you
need to take should I apply a break or
not that's a decision that you need to
take right and this is where decision
tree is going to come in handy for
building your predictive modeling so let
us move forward here and this gives more
about a few key studies we will look
into what is a need for this model will
look into an example or business
scenario and try to understand that
vantage of using your decision tree how
can decision tree as a technique be used
in business
what are the key decision tree features
these are the radius things which
wearing the disc is and at the end we
are going to discuss about the crow caws
framework which at Eureka provides right
there's a new course which a Eureka has
started on decision tree eminence it's
amazing basically so try to get let us
try to get motivated on why this
technique is so important business
scenario need for a model say you want
to do some kind of marketing amazon for
example wants to do marketing of a
product say there are hundred thousand
folks registered on amazon web hyper 10
takes up the product only thousand
people have a out of ten pounds so what
did you ideally do you have sent an
email from ocean two hundred thousand
folks all of them only thousand people
have actually purchased the product say
our business is unhappy because you have
a poor response rate and think about
this what if each meal which amazon is
sending to a customer cost two dollars
then one would have spent two hundred
dollars per new customer acquisition
right instead can we find a new scenario
here can I instead of sending two
hundred thousand folks send only to
20,000 prospective candidates or
customers and what if instead of 100 I
get 900 responders 900 customers
actually purchase a product what if they
come up with this kind of a scenario
what is effectively happening here I
have reduced or narrowed down the number
of customers prospective customers from
100,000 to 20,000 so 80,000 irrelevant
customers are done a week and look at
the success rate thousand one hundred if
you translate this into percentage terms
you'll see that you have done a
remarkably
great job however never you'll be able
to get an exact match in real life
scenarios if there is a customer a can
you accurately say on whether he's going
to purchase yes or no that's going to be
you know a difficult task right hence we
come up with a probability associated
with that and decision tree will help
you come up with that probability on
whether a person would purchase yes or
no right and what is a target that we
are trying to achieve here a rather than
send email rather than send email to all
the customers all the prospective
customers I send an email by narrowing
down the population to a smaller portion
and I know for a fact that the smaller
portion there would be a lot of
conversion a lot of customers would
purchase among these so our target is to
send the email for the marketing purpose
only to subset of the population where
the conversion rate is more that is what
I want right number of responders number
of people purchasing my product should
be greater that is my objective here
right and here green is your benchmark
response rate if you get more response
rate that's represented using your red
color here and less response using blue
color now all we need to do is work on
increasing the response rate try to
achieve the red part of this now let us
understand Anatomy see there is a credit
card company and you want to decide on
whether you want to approve the loan or
not and we know for a fact that 70
none of the customers have good rating
and thirty percent have bad rating right
now these 70 folks seventy percent of
the people are creditworthy customers so
if I provide them alone chances are low
that they might default on the loan to
me if you want to send the files
normally what happens if you apply for a
loan all your documents are filed and
probably you send it to a third party or
you get axial secure and try to check on
what is your credit status credit rating
what if each time I send a particular
file or a customer information and try
to get a credit report what if each time
it's going to cost me five dollars
obviously you cannot send all the
records that you have all the details
that you get right if there are say
10,000 customers already in my bank it
cannot send all the ten thousand records
and get their credit worthy status are
the credit rating that will be costing
me fortune so what can I do can I a
forecast can it predict on who would
most probably have a good credit rating
if I have a hundred thousand folks who
are my customers and say I'm a monk
easier mccann is beside on who could
probably have a good credit rating and
who might not have a credit rating good
credit ready can I forecasts predict if
i can predict i would send only those
limited number of files credit bureau to
get their credit rating that's going to
bring down my operational costs to a
great extent and one tool which will
help you take such a decision is
decision tree it's going to improve the
accuracy of the decision that you plan
to take how do you create your decision
tree in this scenario you're going to
create root nodes root node and these
are intermediate nodes and the last node
is called as your leaf node root
intermediate and leave
so these are the wages parameters based
on which I want to create different
rules for example I would check that
count if the account is having greater
than or equal to 1.5 probably 1.5 lakh
rupees on an average then I'm going to
say that they follow a particular
percentage right for example let me show
you this so each thing is called as a
rule I'm going to explain here yeah now
I'll explain that so here check that
count if the account has greater than or
equal to 1.5 lakh then probably i can
safely term that those customers have
eighty-seven percent creditworthiness
eighty-seven percent of the customers
right are creditworthy now if people
have less than 1.5 lakh on an average in
their account then I am also going to
check the duration is it less than
twenty two point five months probably
right then what's the percentage of the
folks who most likely have a good credit
rating again I am doing a split here if
the duration is greater than or equal to
20 2.5 months probably then I'm going to
split it further there is a third rule
which is coming into play do have a
savings account since how long greater
than or equal to 2.5 months probably
right and less than or equal to 2.5
sorry this is not greater than or equal
to this just greater than 2.5 and here
it's less than or equal to 2.5 right and
this n here says those many people fall
into that category so here n equal to 41
means people who have less than or equal
to 1.5 lakh people who have their
account for greater than or equal to 22
point
five months and people who have greater
greater than 2.5 months right since they
have opened the savings account that is
one rule in this particular rule you
have 41 folks and what is the
creditworthiness of the people who fall
into this category 71 percent of the
people have good credit rating rest of
the twenty-nine percent have low credit
rating what is the seeming by the way
this decision tree which is shown here
is accomplished using a lot of
statistics in the background there is
something called as information gain
entropy and all that based on that this
split happens and you come up with these
kind of and what is this based upon this
is based upon the historical data you
collect the historical data of a lot of
customers based on that historical data
you come up with these kind of a rule
rules rather and then any new customer
who applies for a loan I'm going to
quickly check these rules hey do you
have greater than or equal to 1.5 lakhs
in your account on an average yes then I
might most probably approve the loan or
i mighta most probably send your
documents to credit bureau for further
investigation however if your account on
an average has less than 1.5 lakh and if
you have the account for greater than or
equal to 20 2.5 months there and if you
have a savings account for less than or
equal to 2.5 right then you fall into
this category within this category there
are only thirty-seven percent people
whom you can actually trust so if a
person is falling into this category we
went most often than not say hey let me
not send this category persons fire you
for credit to credit bureau to get dear
reading because most often than not the
person who falls into this category
might be defaulting why it might not
have a good credit rating now this
information will help me make a lot of
business decisions and save a lot of
operational costs for us now how is it
split basically right look at this
particular split here it's same me that
eighty-seven percent of the folks who
fall into node 7 here have a good body
credit rating and only thirty-seven
percent of the folks who fall into this
category node for our worthy customers
now this is going to give you a sense on
whose files you need to send to a credit
bureau to get more information about
their credit rating look at that this is
what is our area of interest right
understand the gain by working on
different notes right so now we can keep
a documentation cell to demand more
document from a subset of population and
then send them to Bureau after receipt
of documents for example if the wreck
there is a customer he's applying for a
loan and say he falls into this category
this 37 person what would you most
probably do what business decision would
you take here you'll probably ask this
customer for additional documents
additionally surety and those additional
documents probably you'll send it to the
bureau and get more information about
this particular person before offering
the loan so you'll be extra cautious in
approving the loan and dealing with the
customers who fall into this category
rather than a person who falls into this
eighty-seven percent category and that
is what is mentioned here that's called
as RGB consecrate red green blue now
that is what we have been discussing all
not altogether right so you know for a
fact that a
seven percent is very smooth going and I
have absolutely no problems with that
category folks I'm reading them as red
leather to folks are green that means
they're almost there blue ones are my
area of concern I need to be extra
cautious before I take a decision right
now among these prospective candidates
you can again apply a decision decision
tree and decide on whether a person is
going to default or not default now you
can bring in additional characteristics
such as what is your age what is your
gender what is your educational
qualification which is location are you
from what is your income right and have
you applied for loans previously and you
can bring in all sorts of additional
information before deciding on whether a
person is going to befall the loan or
not default alone right and what are you
doing here you're avoiding a lot of bad
loan what are the various industries
which make use of decision tree
technique in order to come up with
interesting insights here we go so let
me select the spotlight here among
various patient profile who will respond
better with such treatment so if you are
planning to perform clinical trial
there's a new medicine you need to cry
on few people even before you release it
to the general public right whom should
I select i have said 20 people on which
i can actually perform clinical trial
each person to each person on whom i
perform the technical trial i need to
pay him $50,000 for example what if
there is an algorithm which
statistically tells me on who is going
to perform better to a particular
medicine who is not going to perform
right what if I have such information I
would save millions of dollars for my
clinical trials firm
right look at this among customers find
profile of those who will accrete was as
those will stay with the business for
example there is telecom industry
there's a customer who is using 80 would
he most probably in the next three
months move on with a different provider
that is bootiful or 8 cyl or will he
stick with your phone what if i get that
information up friend look at the
platter of possible this year right
acquiring a new customer is going to be
extremely costly in comparison to
retaining the existing customers so if
you can come up with this kind of
prediction up friend on saying that hey
there is a ninety-five percent
probability that the customer a might
switch to vodafone in the next three
months what if i have that information
even before a customer moves on to a
different service provider i can
probably lure him with additional
discounts see whether he is a worthy
customer for me or not and provide him
with a personalized plan or what are the
various reasons because of which he
might move on you try to assess all
those things all right look at this if
you are applying for a loan if i can
upfront predict and say hey you're going
to default on the loan this guy is going
to not pay your credit card he'll use
your credit card but he'll not pay back
the amount what if i can come to know
about these kind of decisions up front
it's going to save me millions of
dollars right home loan whom should i
actually provide whom one r is a
customer going to switch from one bank
to another bank right say he has already
taken a home loan from ICICI Bank right
what if i can predict and say that hey
this person would most likely move on to
a different
I can probably reduce his interest
probably give him some more additional
benefit which will ensure that he stays
back with me right so these are all a
bunch of possibilities in decision
analysis please so there are a lot of
questions which are coming in now so let
me take these questions so I'm all has
this question I've worked with many
financial institutes advising them on
their models and decision metaphors that
they use for customer risk rating
understand the decision tree but I'm not
sure this is a best example I would
recommend the scoring model based on
applying weights to factors for the
scenario absolutely I'm ooh that is what
my next question what next statement was
right that we end up using a lot of
additional parameters on your age gender
income right and geography that you're
staying in all that and obviously it's
going to a decision tree is going to
look into this coding right it's going
to wait the parameters age might not be
of extreme relevance for me probably
income that you're drying might be of
more relevance ma'am and I'm all sizes i
will use a decision tree for recruiting
process narrowing list of candidates
absolutely amo that's a good example
it's called as workforce analytics right
if there's a senior profile whom i need
to interview or any person whom i want
to interview what is a guarantee that a
person would join me after releasing the
offer letter but candidate might apply
for various other companies and he is
going to choose one company which
provides him the best benefits now even
before interviewing can i actually make
a sense on who are those candidates who
might most likely join your company if
you provide them and awful it that's
important right and it becomes even more
important if you are you know hiring a
senior profile you're going to spend a
lot of
mount in interviewing a senior profile
what if that person doesn't join your
company instead he joined some other
come it's a waste of time it's waste of
energy and most candidates would not
turn up on the joining deed they would
say they would be joining you on the
joining did they are not reachable your
phone is switched off what would you do
you are desperately waiting for that
person to join in and get started now
you need to redo the entire hiring
process once again right so your
decision analysis our decision tree
announcers were actually help you in
workforce analytics also which is fast
catching up right even before a person
resigns we can actually predict on
whether he's going to resign or not once
a person resigns if you want to talk
with him and try to retain chancer
weightless bleak that a person would
join back or take back his resignation
even before he resigns if you go to go
and speak with him strike a deal and try
to read in him that is what we want
right and the chances are high that you
might retain that person if he doesn't
resign that is workforce analytics and
decision trees yep is widely used in
some scenarios so key decision tree
features here are a lot of key decision
tree features automated field selection
if you have a lot of fields say you have
100 parameters based on which you're
evaluating a person on whether he is
going to resign or not right I've just
given you example of age gender location
income married yes or no smokes yes or
no it's a red etc if you have all those
things right say in that fashion you
have 100 different parameters your
decision tree will help you
automatically select those fields which
give you more information that is called
as info
ancient game now this algorithm is going
to calculate a lot of things in the
background such as entropy right and
based on that it's going to
automatically select few fields which
might be more relevant than other right
little data processing needed
pre-processing right so you need not do
a lot of transformations if there are
outliers in your data set you need not
perform a lot of right impervious
activities there these are on the
advantages right what do you mean by
impervious if you unable to be affected
by right this model will not be affected
by outliers that is what this means and
what is an outlier extreme value now
I'll not get into that anyways so
transformations what if your data is not
following a particular distribution say
it's not following normal distribution
you need to transform the data using
box-cox johnson transformation so on and
so there are a lot of statistical
techniques there instead of using those
your data decision tree is automatically
going to ensure that your data
pre-processing is taken care of you need
not do all these things spend a lot of
time transforming the data or dealing
with outliers missing while you're
tolerant say you could not capture
information about a few of your
employees for example you have not
captured on whether they are married or
not all right when they have joined I
have mentioned as married probably now
you don't know the current status right
are a few of the people might be
reluctant to you know probably provide
your sensitive information probably the
passport numbers or whatever beat there
they are going to place it as n/a
non-applicable now
this decision tree is going to
automatically take care of those skin of
missing values data entry values or some
way you have forgot to enter the dd's
right all that is taken care of and it's
extremely fast and you can quickly build
a model and also validate the model on
whether your model would be helpful in
the future or not here is a basic
framework all right even before them I
see that there is a question let me luv
Kush has this question is this decision
tree derive using a software by
providing input parameters or is it
generated manually after the information
in silao khush there are a lot of
analytical tools in the market right you
have our SPSS SAS math lab data there
are a lot of tools available we will use
a tool called are in this training to
actually accomplish this particular
algorithm which is called as decision
tree right so let me I'll spend some
time on what tool to be used in all that
right do it so here here is the
framework of this training session right
all the case studies are based on
industry and to what extent these models
are getting used in the industry and we
train based on two things we look into
from interview perspective and from the
way years business and the model
perspective from these two perspectives
this particular training is composed
you'll learn about all these things
interaction to decision tree what is the
business need why do we need to do on
under what scenarios you need to do
right and how to calculate and use
decision tree and the radius parameters
that I've just spoken about that's
introduction to data tree a decision
tree and then we are going to look into
data design for modeling
what is a historical data that you have
what is the performance going to be of
your model if you have humongous data
big data for example will decision tree
work or not will this kiss their data
treatment before modelling right so you
are going to audit your data you're
going to cleanse your data you're going
to check whether your data is actually
in a right format or not or if your data
is unstructured or semi structured you
try to bring your data to a structured
format and then comes your algorithm
basically what is a genie right how do
you interpret that measuring
classification tree strength how do you
classify right I'll show you a quick
example just bear with me until them and
then there'll be a lot of Industry
examples and then you're going to deep
dive on those industry practices which
are used to come up with the decision
tree then we'll discuss a little about
the regression tree right and we're
going to discuss about the difference
between regression tree and linear
regression then what is pruning right
last but not least we are going to
discuss about the child algorithm using
chi-square and we are also going to
discuss about a variant of decision tree
which is random forest yes your Janish
were I've told you that i'm going to
show you one right so sorrow passes
whether customer will default on credit
payment or not can also be predicted
using other classification techniques
such as logistically aggression how do
we decide which algorithm to use huh so
there is no clear-cut table available
which says that given this business
scenario use this algorithm so what we
most often than not do a syrup we
implement two or three techniques and
see which model is giving you better
accuracy most often than not in the real
world we go with something called as
ensemble model random forest is one such
ensemble
model what is an ensemble model
combination of two or three algorithms
to build a model on top of that right by
the way logistic regression will not say
yes or no whether a person will default
or not it would say probability it will
just give you the probability numbers
Eric logistic regression just a
clarification right now let me quickly
show you one example of decision tree
I'm going to quickly open that in our
and show you just bear with me meanwhile
if you have any questions you can ask me
while I pull up that particular
information I'm just trying to pull up
some information there could you please
please explain explain what is a job of
data analytics and data science and data
center janish were data analytics data
science and data scientist all mean the
same data analytics is dealing with the
data data science means the same a
person who deals with that is called as
a data scientist what does the data
scientists do is that your question
please confirm yeah so what are the data
scientist to data scientist is going to
build prediction models and help predict
the future for example a company comes
to you and says hey can I open a new
store what would you tell them say
Target or Walmart comes to you and says
I want to open a new store can I do that
what would you say would you say okay
open a new store try to run it for a few
years and then see whether it works or
not is that what you'll say or would you
say hey hold on right even before you
open the store let me tell you on
whether you'll be profitable or not will
that be a statement what would be a
statement and just trying to figure out
there yeah here we go so have the arco
de way
with me let me open that and show you
that start sharing my screen so in the
interest of time let me show you this
example first and then lick their and
then take the questions so here is data
set which is called as fraud data fraud
check data set right and here is
information whether a person is
undergraduate or not Martel state is
taxable city population work experience
and all that by the way I'm using our
two to explain you right I've just
loaded this data set fraud check in it
has 600 observations that means it has
data about 600 folks and it has six
observations are six variables variables
mean six parameters or six of your
variables based on which you're going to
decide on whether a person is going to
default on the loan I'm a dashing the
data set to our I'm looking into the
header in right or you can just check
this table there now first of all let us
look into the summary of the data say it
it's going to tell you on how many
people have an undergraduate degree 3 12
and how many people do not have an
undergraduate degree how many people are
divorced married single so on and so and
you have the taxable income and all that
right now what are we doing here I'm
trying to create a new variable right
and i'm going to classify all those
people who have less than or equal to
30,000 taxable income as a risky the
rest of the folks as good now this is
just an example right in the real world
you'll get this data also whether a
person was a risky or a good customer
based on his credit history you'll get
our information say I give a loan to you
if I observe you throughout your loan
payment in your I'll obviously come to
know and whether you're a good customer
or not so let us create a data frame let
me create table there I mean I'm not
going to explain you the code line by
line there but let me take you to the
actual essence on how this model
I'm running each one there is a library
or a package called Cree if you do not
have that we need to install that in the
command to install the packages a simple
as this all these things would be
explained to you in the course actually
i'll i'll come back to you guys I'll
explain I'll take your questions just a
minute while I do so so here is a tree
model we are trying to plot that and
this is how it's going to look like let
me zoom that so your model has actually
taken all these things the first is city
population right it has taken the root
node a city population now going back to
this data set why should I take city
population why kinetic undergraduate or
module status or taxable income or work
experience or open why should I take
only city population as my root node
right that is decided based on your
entropy and based on algorithm and few
stats which willing to deep down as part
of the course right and work experience
whether a person has less than 20 months
or 20 years or less than 7.5 years again
you are splitting it right you are doing
a lot of splits and then deciding on
whether a person falls into good
category or a risky category and all
these things are different rules for
example city population less than 58 to
33 and work experience less than 20 and
work experience less than 11.5 then that
person is going to fall into good
category now rather than explain you all
on such a big cream let me prune the
tree pruning is actually trying to
reduce I forget that there is a variable
that I need to change anyways that's an
error which is part of that now I'm
trying to prune the tree pruning is
reducing basically if you see here there
is a steep bend there hence you need to
consider two splits not
more than that so let me plot it in
there you go now if i zoom that there is
a simple straight here if the city
population is less than 58 to 33 and if
a person from this Kansas it is applying
for a loan provide him the loan he's
going to fall into good category if the
city population is greater than 58 to 33
and if the work experience is less than
6.5 then that's a risky customer do not
give him the Loon probably right or
you'll be cautious enough do additional
verification and then provide a loan to
boot so in this way you can come up with
your decision tree algorithm and we have
done that using are now in the interest
of time I have not explained each and
everything what happens but the
underlying logic is this now there were
a few questions which have come in on
what tool is the best for me to use let
me show you google friends and let me
show you on what's the status of a few
good statistical sense is numb no doubt
a good tool there however you also need
to be futuristic because your career is
very important right so choose a tool
whose performance is going to increase
rather than dip in this way right since
2005 until 2009 it was good there the
dip started in SAS right let me show you
another to list all real time that i'm
showing you spss spss is also decreasing
the demand for that steadily even if we
try to forecast the forecast clearly
sees that it's going to further decrease
now if i'm going to compare this with
our let us see what happens here our is
increasing and look at the difference
between our and the other players are
would undoubtably kill that the
competition no doubt about that right
now let me
take a few questions and that was a
question from our kirsch occurs has
asked this question on what tool is
easier to start with our or SAS and what
is the industry inclined towards
industries inclined towards our easiest
tool to learn is our garnish where has
this question both data analyst and data
scientist Buddha same absolute if we
could if I say yawn probably am
referring to you Gyanesh were is also
yawn him in that way data analyst or
data scientist Mina seen a love which
has this question for a Windows platform
will I be able to fully use a
functionality of decision tree using the
Arkansas absolutely lock right but our
studio is just graphical user interface
it has few additional features which
makes your life easy right but otherwise
are also can be used extensively it's
the same comes all the coding everything
to Hina this question is output of the
our code the data model output of the
our code yeah i mean the final outcome
the final tree which i've shown you
that's your model outcome how is
rapidminer tool for data analytics pooja
I I won't go with that rapidminer it's
not as robust as our Janish sure how
many algorithms are there which book is
having all the algorithms so you'll have
Jionni sure one more book called data
mining with our that has a lot of
algorithms I think there are close to 20
or algorithms are even more I'm aware of
20-odd algorithms so these are the
various modules which this particular
codes on data decision tree is going to
cover when you close please take the
survey which will actually help us gauge
on what was the quality of the webinar
what else we need to use including the
future webinars and here if there are
any other questions I'm here to take
data mining using our yeah janish so to
ian has a question on what is a learning
path for the
I didn't quite get your question to him
if your question is how do I get started
learning analytics and all that if that
is your question then I would say there
is a course called mastering data
analytics with our that would be the
starting point wearing you are going to
get started right from the basics of our
a basics of statistics and moving on to
the advanced concepts not very at once
but yeah that will give you some kind of
edge of others in getting a job and
things on those lines right Akash has
this question you spoke about the list
of algorithms available in a template is
there a link now I was seeing that there
is no such template available which will
say given this scenario use this
algorithm now occurs but you know there
are a lot of lot of algorithms available
within data mining itself there's no
such direct link available with me which
I can share but akin to a Google search
you'll get to see that okay sourabh has
this question Mac or Windows for our
which is best now I use our boot on mac
and windows i did not see any specific
significant difference between running
our on macintosh or windows so either
would work what are the best
to learn are there are a lot of free
courses available on Club Coursera you
can explore those oddish but as I've
told you I'd Eureka also has one you can
think about concering that occurs has
this question that is what problem and
what algorithm to select that entirely
depends on the industry sector that
you're dealing with our courage and your
business problems that you're trying to
solve it depends on that it's not a
straightforward thing if I'm trying to
predict a numerical value probably i'll
go with regression linear regression or
logistic regression if i want to gauge
the probability of a value if you want
yes or no then i can go with or if I'm
dealing with defects I'll go with
Poisson regression if I'm dealing with
defectives binomial or I can go with
negative binomial regression right it
all depends on your business scenario
that you're trying to deal which are
good books for learning our tool pooja
there are a lot of good books on our and
one such book is our book there is
something called as our book our book
that's it you can go to that it it has
around thousand odd pages and it's going
to help you when to use decision tree
algorithm is what garnish were is asking
if you are stuck with taking two
decisions for example say you want to
decide on whether a person is going to
leave your company or not you are stuck
on a decision on whether you want to
open a new store or not right you're
stuck in making a decision on whether
you need to add a new product to your
existing product list yes or no right on
the set circumstance you can use that
it's used in various dating websites
also do I need to date a person yes or
no because there are a lot of fraud
cases right in question well it's
extensively used dating right because
marriage is not so prevalent there and
you might fall into wrong hands they
might kidnap
whew all sorts of risks out there right
so you can use your decision tree there
it's extensively used in fraud
algorithms also let me tell you that
fifty percent of your data mining work
happens in the space of fraud detection
say Amazon is sending your product to
your home you have purchase it online
once you receive the product you're
going to open that you're going to
replace the product with a duplicate
product and sing it back saying that it
is not meeting your requirement that's a
front right the mom and gmail was opened
to the world spamming started happening
so determining on whether an email is
going to be a spam or not is a decision
tree problem moment you can use decision
tree there so to him has this question
is are just the syntax and we need to
know statistics and algorithm to run
using our absolutely to win our is just
a syntax the code but it has a lot of
statistical capabilities within that all
you need to do is statistics and
algorithm you can run it using are you
can run it using our or SAS or SPSS or
any other tool but the basic context and
underlying logic is important here is
our platform independent is a question
with ratty she's asking which erotisch
is asking you are is platform
independent in the sense you can install
that on a Linux machine you might be
using VPN you might be using red hat you
can use that right or you can install on
windows on a 32-bit or 64-bit you can
install that on Mac in toshiya its
platform independent that is what I
would see a dish has this question are
there any other tools that go well with
our our goes well with a data
visualization tool which is called as
tableau our can integrate itself with
how do big data tools rachela are has a
lot of that capability using which you
can actually
integrate that with other tools in the
market if you know c c++ java javascript
etc you can use that code in our and
execute that but our has its own
language called as our language only so
occur sees a good refresher and
statistics or a book so there are a lot
of books actually occurs on the top of
my mind I have business fundamentals
using statistics that's one thing that
on top of my mind right which is a very
good book you can just read that yeah
Krishna our book I'm not sure about the
author by the way but our bookie or I
need to search that until you and pooja
has this question what does entropy
doing decision tree algorithm entropy
decides on for example here should I
split this particular or what should be
my root node should have split it based
on city population or should I split it
based on marital status or taxable
income right it will tell you on if
you're going to split based on city
population you'll get a lot of
information on whether a person is going
to default or not and what should the
second split be should it be work
experience or should it be under
graduate status or urban on urban
whether a person is coming from urban
location or not right if you want to
decide on those lines then your entropy
is going to help you do that yeah hi
manish so information gain is what
variable is giving you maximum
information on deciding on whether a
person is going to default or not yaman
is sure we'll be sharing the recording
of this session also for example syrup
if i split based on undergraduate maybe
i'll not get a lot of information on
whether a person is going to default on
the loan or not right probably i need to
split it based on marital status that
will give me more information on whether
a person is going to default or not
right in that sense your information
gain is going to be helpful so that's
the status six part of that syrup it
would take a lot of time for me to
explain that question on how entropion
information you go again go hand in hand
right because entropy that's a
statistical formula used to calculate
from that you come to or from that you
try to derive information gained in that
sense right so both are related in
Trapani information again but that's a
different formula it's elaine the
formula you'll better understand that
when you actually undergo the entire
coops all right folks if you have no
more questions thank you so much for
attending the session hope it was
helpful hope it has given you some
meaningful information thank you so much
have a nice day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
