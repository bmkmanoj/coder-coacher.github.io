gentlemen my name is Verdun and I'm
super excited to be here on interracial
life with you guys so in today's session
I will tell you why the next
administration will never go out of
fashion and the number one reason why
Linux administration won't go out of
fashion is because it's a preferred
operating system for server hosting and
since it's open source
every company or there has adopted Linux
including the likes of Facebook Twitter
Amazon and many more and since the usage
of Linux will also not radio's given the
demand for Linux administrator's we will
never die out and also because there are
so many interesting things that you can
do one in the nuts it's considered to be
the breeding ground for technological
advancement so much so that developers
console UNIX as a paradise for software
development well having said so much
about Linux let me get back to our
session here so by the end of today's
session even you guys will understand
how awesome Linux is when you know after
I give my practical demonstration of two
such tasks that any administrator will
have to carry out during his career so
my guess is that everybody present in
the session right now have used nukes at
least a couple of times and that you
people are aware of the few
adminstration tasks in Linux can you
guys to clear tell me if you vote on
runs before or if you've used notes
before
you
all right so I have a lot of fun yes and
I also have a few knows there so well I
can assume that people are from
different backgrounds yeah but anyways
that means that you know I can give a
it'll be a revision for the people who
already know about Linux and for those
of you who don't know Linux I will also
give an introductory topic that'll help
you get in sync with the other people
and also in sync with the session and
what I'm going to cover today alright
guys so having said that and one more
thing guys if you guys have any doubt
during the session you can raise them by
putting them in the comment box and
either my team or I will myself answer
them for you so just sit back relax and
enjoy a drake alive for the next 45
minutes to learn white units
administration will never go out of
fashion so these will be the topics that
i will be covering today i will first
discuss which are some of those timeless
tasks that units administrators will
never stop performing in their
organizations and after that i will
discuss in detail about two important
job loads of dares one is that of NFS
right that's called network file system
which will be used by all the users in
the organization you can create a shared
repository for all the users in your
organization and the second is that of
implementing squid which is a proxy web
server so enough talk then let me just
get started with the first topic for
today and that is the timeless linux
admins admin tasks and what you see here
on the screen are few of the most common
tasks that units admins are responsible
for in their organizations first of all
you have installing and upgrading the
software right so this is the number one
task which most admins start that career
off with servers hosted either locally
or on the cloud need to work with
optimal performance all the time and
that can happen only when the services
and the software which I use are updated
to the latest versions so this is pretty
obvious and self-explanatory
that's one thing and the next important
task is that of patching and bug fixes
fixing the software patches and bug
fixes is all very underrated and highly
important tasks and lot of people are
not aware of that because every software
will have a bridge and its functionality
will improve over time
and those softwares need to be updated
right and how do you improve your how
will you perform your updates without
affecting other services correct so
that's where patching comes into the
picture and besides that patching can
also be done to fix bugs and make
changes to the code without affecting
other services and then we have that of
configuring web services so configuring
web services is again a very common task
which helps in checking the health or
monitoring the status of the server and
helps in a lot of other things because
the service performance need to be
measured on a regular basis so as to
avoid any type of downtime and the next
task that you see here is that a few
dial-in situation right so this is a
very important task and you people
should be aware you people should know
already how important that is because
it's the administrator that controls
what other users can do on the server
what whatever they have access to which
websites each user can access during
their workers all these things can be
controlled by them so this is a very
important task and it's a very common
task actually and then you have that of
you know creating an organization-wide
shared storage repository right you have
that task you have performing migrations
whenever needed for those shared
repositories and restricting access
could those directories to a very
limited very few people write that one
and also the these three things probably
make up an important day-to-day activity
and this is the thoughts that I'll be
showing you a demonstration on later
today I'll be using NFS to show you how
to create a shared repository across
your network right and last but not the
least we have the orchestrating of the
functioning of the different develops
tools which is again a very interesting
task and it's pretty new role it's a
pretty new role that admins are getting
used to because options in yours and
system is newest they all need to
primarily set up these devups tools and
we have to monitor the working of the
software that they are developing right
and I have to make sure all that is you
know being done well and that's where
DevOps tools comes into the picture and
since you know it's admins work on these
the ops tools regularly they have a good
dog and they'll have a good role to play
in this task so these are some of the
most important and also you know what
tasks which will never end and it's
going to be forever it's these are
me forever so I hope by now you guys got
a good or a better understanding of what
works what goes on behind the scenes of
an administration right so yeah and I
think it's the right time for me to
switch the topic to how we'll enix
admins actually go about their regular
work okay
so that's going to be the first topic
and I'm going to switch to that and so
let's understand what is a network file
system why it's needed and how admins
configure them in the network so yeah
first of all NFS stands for network file
system and this technology is used for
sharing files and folders across all the
systems in the network well what happens
here is that the file systems which are
present in the server they can be
mounted locally on a remote host machine
which is very similar to a client-server
architecture well for those of you who
didn't understand in simpler terms NFS
is just used to create a shared hard
drive storage space for the entire
organization and also the so that the
entire organization can can access the
same same hard drive resource and
collaborate together on that on that
hardware resource so that's what NFS is
and that's the benefit with NFS and well
some of the benefits that we know we can
get with NFS is that it can be installed
and can be run on machines with any
operating system right so you don't have
the need to you know have all the
systems to have the same OS so as an
administrator I can set up an FS in my a
Linux server and the other users will be
accessing my shared resource right the
resource that I allow them to use that
system can be windows or it can be any
other operating system so that's one big
benefit with NFS and of course another
very big important you know advantage
that we have is that the data that can
be accessed there right the users that
can get access with the data there they
can be in any location so it's just that
they need to be given access to that to
their their IP should be given access so
that's the only important thing and
these are the two
advantages and yeah that's the only
important need that goes about with with
the configuration of NFS so yeah well
since I have spoken so much about NFS
now that you know a good introduction
you know what NFS is let's get to the
configuration of NFS and if you want to
configure them we have to configure them
at two places one at the server side and
one at the client side so first up comes
the server side configuration where you
have three important steps right so the
first one is that of installing NFS and
all its dependencies so you have three
different packages here for NFS one is
that of NFS doodles
second is NFS util slip and the third is
NFS utils devil so these three packages
need to be up and running if you want to
set up a good NFS Network and once
you've done installing these settings
you can get to the next topic and you
can configure excuse me yeah so the next
top so the second step is that of
configuring the exports file in the in
the route et Cie folder right in this
directory you have the export file you
have to configure this file with the
with the resource so if you want
whichever whichever hard drive which
were shared directly that you want to I
know give I give other people access to
you have to mention that path and also
the IP addresses to which you want to
share it with so we can now individually
specify the different IPS and you can
also you know otherwise if you want to
give the access to all the other users
in the network you can simply give an
asterisk over there so we can do one of
these things because when you give an
aspect it basically means everyone
connected in the network they'll get
access to that shared repository so you
can now you can add those serials inside
the export file and then finally the
third step is to start the NFS service
and the RPC bind service right so the
RPC bind service is something that's
gonna start your port map and it's
basically to to help your raw NFS map
with the correct port on which it's
running and to set up service with the
other client side right so that's why we
use abused RPC binds our so that's what
you do on the server side and when
you're done with this you can go to the
client set configuration and
configuration we have three important
steps so here again the first step is
the same thing value NFS very we install
NFS with all its dependencies but the
second would be to straight away start
NFS service and the RPC bind service and
then the third step would be to mount
the server's filesystem in your
directory of your choice so what this
means is whichever shared service that
the that is being shared from the server
write that path you need to mount that
path in your local system so you'll have
to mount it with the help of forgiving
you know by giving the IP address and
the path of the server with the place
where you want to where you want to
place it in your system right so that's
the mount nothing so you have mount
command for that very purpose
I will show you how that's done and now
that I'm done with talking about NFS and
what are the steps involved I can
straight away go I can set away go to my
demonstration if you guys have any
doubts please put that in the comment
box right now because I can clear that
clear that away before starting with the
demonstration
you
well okay I have one question here from
on and then he is asking and if ice is
used to mount between deluxe and UNIX
machines right or vice versa and he also
says so what can be the UNIX machines
your in real time
well onon the see the thing is NFS is
not just for raw you know for these two
machines right can be used for Windows
also so all these three operating
systems can work on NFS right they can
all get connected and the server can be
anything you can have your server either
on Windows you can have your server
either on Linux or you can you know have
your server even on UNIX and again even
the clients can be of any other
operating system so that's the big
benefit with NFS and in fact in my own
office we have such a set up where you
know the servers on the nukes and we
have a number of users who are
non-technical right so they use Windows
systems and they are connected to the
same resource so and that's how it works
and so
okay so now well since I don't have any
other important question can I uh can I
get tired with my demonstration guys
okay I'll anyway start with my
demonstration right so any other
questions you can put them in the
comment box and I'll anyways move
forward with my session so here I'll
show you how to create a shared
directory
you know I'll show you how to create a
directory and then share it with other
hosts or other users in the organization
right in the organization or even in the
entire network so these can also be in
remote locations and not necessary to be
within the same organization right so la
get start with that and for this purpose
I'm going to go to my VM now right so
this is my VM can you guys see my
virtual machine yo guys
you
you
okay guys can you somebody bought your
machine yo
you
okay great so since it's all the video
is all good now let me get started and
now before I get started let me tell you
that since we need the two different
machines for server and client I have
our two different VMs for the same
purpose
right so this slave machine that you see
here the slave VM this I'm going to use
as my client and the master VM that I'm
going to use that you see here I'm gonna
use this as my server so if you guys
remember the first step that we need to
do is we need to set up the server side
and we have to first of all install the
NFS here right so for that let me open
my terminal here and the command to
first of all install NFS is that of sudo
yum install NFS astrick well I'm using
yum here because I'm downloading my NFS
from the yum repository now since this
is a sent OS system since it's a Red Hat
system I'm gonna use yum and I'm using a
spec here because there are multiple
packages and multiple dependencies right
so I told you that there are three
different packages NFS utils Lib and
devil so to install all the three at the
same time we can use the asterisk and
yeah monedas hit enter you should be
good and the download should start there
goes my password okay I have a question
here from ma Ganesh
he's asking is it really required for
the NFS service to be on the client side
Ganesh yes you have to have the NFS
service otherwise how will you connect
to the server right you have to have it
on the client side so without without
having it without mounting it on the
client side you cannot connect to that
repository which is there on the server
side alright you will get a better
understanding when I show you the
demonstration all right so anyways
getting back to our raw getting back to
our VM here so I ran the command and for
me it's already installed and I have the
latest version so there's nothing new
but however when you're doing it for the
first time you will have a detailed list
and it will show you what's what's
getting downloaded and all the packages
are that I needed all those things would
show up right so now that I am done with
the first step the second step is to go
and configure the configuration file of
this right
of the exports so for that let me again
run a sudo command so that I get the
root access and I'm gonna run a VI
command and go to the etc' folder under
which there's another file called
exports so I'm gonna go here and well if
you're using Linux for the first time or
you know many are opening the export
file for the first time there's gonna be
nothing but maybe the experience folks
would have some other details right but
you know so but but even in my case that
I don't have anything so let's straight
away start mentioning what we want to
share we have to first fall mention the
path the directory that I want to create
a shared service off along with the IP
addresses that I'm gonna share it with
so before I even create before I
mentioned what I want to share your I'll
open another terminal and what I want to
show you what I want to do is I want to
create a new directory in my root root
I'm gonna create another folder my root
directory
okay so so right now we are in the root
directory right so I will create a new
folder called NFS demo right so this is
gonna be the name of my folder and
password right so it's an empty ok sorry
for that
yeah this is an empty empty folder right
now in bin directory
let me just use the touch command to
create a couple of files so let's say
file1 file2 file and alright so now it's
created we have three different files
right file1 file2 one five three and now
that this is done what have to do next
we'll have to restart my after restart
my NFS service and my RPC bind service
correct okay wait I have to mention the
path of this directory alright so this
is what I was doing already so yeah what
I was saying is after men have to
mention the directory where
created these files right so this is the
folder that I want to share and this is
under this is present inside the root
directory so I'm gonna specify a root
and mention there for our the the
directory name right now once you've
mentioned the folder or the directory
name you can straight away mention the
IP address you want to share this with
and if I want to share it with my slave
that's my client that's running over
here I need to first of all find out
what's the IP address so I can find the
IP address of my system by running the
if config command and so the network is
running so this is the IP address of my
client machine so I'm going to copy this
and I'll just go back to my server
machine and I'm gonna paste it here and
inside brackets I'm going to say RW
comma sync now when I say RW it
basically means I'm giving readwrite
access of this folder to this particular
machine so whatever host is present over
here I'm giving the read/write
permission of this folder okay and sync
is basically two you know it's basically
before you create an export or before
you share things it's telling that also
make it available for stable storage so
that's why we use sync right so that
there's a stable storage you know space
that's also created along before making
an export or before making a share with
other hosts so once you have done with
this you can just save and quit this and
now what we need to do is we need to go
to the third step that is starting our
NFS service right so the command to
start our NFS service and our RPC bind
services sudo service and FS start but
anyways let me restart because NFS is
already running one so let me stop if
anything is running already so let me
stop it once and restart it again by
giving this command and similarly we
have the RPC bind service and even that
can be done in the same way RPC bind
restart right okay so even the RPC bind
has a stop down it's restarted again now
great
so show mount fantastic so we have our
file which is ready to be shared with
this particular IP address so our first
problem is solved what we can do next is
go back to our draw go back to our
client side and start configuring our
client so the screen and first of all we
have to download the NFS service over
here also right so for that NFS along
with all its dependencies so it's the
same command that I'm running here with
this password so again oh yeah so some
people find it funny their sin domani's
yeah well finally yeah see we are
working on Linux right so known as open
source and all these technologies are
open source so yeah I mean this is our
life so sometimes this happens so we
have to just deal with it be patient and
trust that we've done the right things
so good good damn I'm glad people here
at least find the funnier part of it but
anyways getting back to our session this
was all wrong this is our client side
this is the first step that is that we
have done we have achieved this
successfully so the second step would be
to straightaway start our services so we
have two services and the command for
that is sudo service NFS restart ok I'm
restarting it because I want to stop any
existing service and I'm you know
starting it again so just shutting down
once and let me run the same command for
our PC bind right
okay so we have these two things ready
now what we can do is probably use a
shoe mount - II along with the IP
address of my server so this will also
help us show what directories that he's
gonna share with us
so for that let me run if conflict to
find out what is the IP address of my
path okay so now this is strange because
even my server has the IP address of
56.3 and so is my client so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna run a command to
change the IP address okay so well
before I do all these things let me
change the IP address of my and the
command for that is sudo IP add or
delete and what's the IP three copy this
dev and at one port right yes it's at
one port
all right now let me add a new new IP
address I'm gonna say slash dot 4/24 and
instead of delete I'm gonna say add okay
now great now my IP would have changed
and let me run and if config now yes my
appearance has changed to dot for now
that we've changed this we have to also
go back to our we have to also go back
to our client our server and change the
IP address over there also correct okay
so let me go back to my client here -
sorry - my server and go back to the EDC
export file and this dot three would
change 2.4 all right great now just to
be on the safe side let me restart the
services and I hope these are good this
time these are up and running okay
alright so this time it's being shared
with dot 4 ok and dot 4 that you see
here this is the IP address of my client
also so now it should all be good and
now if I run a show mount command with
the IP of mine of my server then it
should probably show me the list of
files that can be shared well even if it
doesn't show me it's not a big deal
because it's not an error but anyways
it's showing me that
so the NFS demo folders what is going to
be shared from the server and it's being
shared with only me here so this is
fantastic good news so I can get to my
final step that is of mounting this file
structure at my end at my client so for
the command for that would be mount the
IP address of the of my server that is
Daughtry : what's the path where it's
present it's NFS damn
and the path where I want to paste it in
my in my local system so okay so let's
say I want to go to my root directory
and sword in my mount folder I can do
that also by specifying Amenti okay okay
on your route can do that great it's all
done so let me just go and see what's
present in my mount mount folder right
now
very good so finally our demo is done
with respect to NFS because you can see
file1 file2 files through right so these
three files are present even at our
client end and this was of course
something that we started from our
server so let me just clear the screen
and give you a better view right so
right now this is my this is my slave
and this is my master now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to quickly show what
I'll see what is there in my NFS demo
folder okay we have these three files
and similarly I'll go back here and I'll
open the same folder but over here it
would be present in my mountain
directory right now now comes the fun
part let me run a cat command for all
these or files or rather even one file
would do cat file one okay and cat file
one so right now there is nothing to
display so the cat amount basically
displays the contents of the file right
so file one has nothing right now now
let me go back to my master and add some
videos to my file one let's say I'm
gonna add
something like this this is the first
update from the server side and let me
just hashtag it with one all right
and when I say okay now let me save and
quit because this is my root directory
right so I can't just modify what's
there in my root directory so I'm just
gonna have the same thing here first
update from the side and I'm gonna one
okay quit fantastic now let me go to my
client side and do the cat file one
again so this time you can see that we
have an extra line we have this line in
the file 1 right so this it says this is
the first update from the server side so
that's what it is so right now I'm
basically accessing my servers folder my
servers directory and the file 1 which
is present inside my server so that's
what you can do let me show you one more
fun thing here inside manifest folder if
I create another folder called you know
if I well basically this whole thing is
my file then even that would be right
now let me just show you something let
me just add this is the modification
in file - now I say man quit and if I go
back to my client side and if I do a cat
file - then you can see that this line
gets displaced so this is what I added
over there so this is how the sharing
works and similarly the same thing if
you start you can you can start adding
details you can create any number of
files in in this directory and you can
add any any data that you want to these
files and the same changes will be
reflected even on your server side so
yeah that's how NFS works and that's how
really really awesome NFS is you know
you can create one shared repository for
the entire organization and it's really
fun to work on Linux and also to do such
things so now let me quickly just clear
the screen and move on with the next
part of the session because we've
already wasted quite out of time so I
don't wanna waste any more time here so
I was talking about I was I just gave
you a demonstration of NFS and the next
topic that I am going to talk about
today is that of squid right I'm going
to show I'm going to tell you what what
squid is and how administrator's Lunas
Armas Raiders use web proxy servers
right how they use squid as the web
proxy servers to improve the network
bandwidth and block users from accessing
certain web sites so let's learn that
here right so first of all before I talk
about squid can I ask a quick question
here
can I just find out how many people you
know what's a proxy server in the first
place
you
okay I'm getting a yes but okay I'm also
getting or don't know from Abdul so
filter tunnel says kumara well yeah
pretty much there so the whole see what
a process over is that it's basically
intermediary between a host and the
outside Internet so if you want your
machine to connect to the outside
Internet then you can install a proxy
server it's not necessary everywhere but
you can install a proxy server to gain
some additional benefits like
controlling the IP traffic and you know
monitoring what people are accessing and
all these things right so that's the
that's what a proxy server is and our
squid here is again it's a web proxy
server which primarily supports HTTP
HTTP and FTP requests and a few more you
know other protocols and you can ask me
what's a big benefit with squid well the
biggest benefit is that squid caches web
requests and when another host makes a
similar request the response time
reduces now for those of you who didn't
really get or understand this line so I
have this diagram here which I can
explain it with so you can see that
there's internet access here right so we
have the different hosts in the network
and if these people need to access to
they they can either get access directly
to the Internet but if you have a proxy
server these people will be connected to
the proxy server and the proxy server
will in turn connect them to the
Internet
so whatever requests they make so if
they want to access some URL if they
want to access ESP and Starcom or if
they wanna access any other site the
torrent site or Facebook then they would
be sending the request to the proxy
server the proxy server would get that
web webpage requested from the internet
and it would again transfer it back to
the host one and that's where the
advantages now since everything goes
through the proxy server there's
something called as web caching right
so whatever requests emit they will get
temporarily cached over here because
caching is basically temporary storage
right so proxy server also does that
same so what the thing here is that when
when the hosts toward the host three
tries accessing the same web page which
the host 1 accessed previously then
their web service
can be you know their request to be
serviced much faster that's because the
proxy server itself can give them what
what is needed they don't have to again
go back to the internet and fetch all
the data now take an example of
downloading a movie from torrent calm
okay now if the host one downloads the
movie let's say it's gonna be 1 GB or
even if it downloads open source Hadoop
right that's about 200-300 mean if we
download that he'll first of all
download that from the internet internet
but a version of that would be cached in
the proxy server and this is where the
benefit comes so the other hosts which
are there in the network they can
indirectly download the same thing from
the proxy server the next time and they
are downloading it and oh yeah they will
save much they will save a lot of time
because once it's in the proxy server
it's all about just transferring it to
two different files in the same network
right so that's gonna be much faster so
if the first time they don't wanna get
if it takes almost 10 times the 4 sorry
10 minutes the first time then later
when these two hosts are trying to
access it it would probably take two
minutes or three minutes max tops right
so that's the big advantage that's what
we say by caching web requests and the
response time reduces for the other
hosts and along with this there's
another big benefit and that is of you
know improved bandwidth for the entire
network now first of all one horse is
downloading something for 2 GB or 3 GB
and if you try to you know avoid other
hosts also downloading the same item
from the same webpage for 2 GB to 3 GB
then you are reducing a lot of you know
fu P and also the bandwidth that's being
consumed for downloading it every time
that also you save up right you save up
on these two things and when you say
upon these two major factors then yeah
of course you're gonna have a bigger
better bandwidth for the other users and
there's not gonna be any reduced service
all right so this one a big advantage
with proxy servers and especially squid
is is a very popular web proxy server
which is used for this purpose so yeah
and money says DNS server 2 has a cache
memory in it yes of course it does
because that's the whole point of a
proxy server right almost all the proxy
servers will have it and you know but
our implementation today is going to be
on squid because squid is my favorite
there is much more that you can do on
squid which you cannot do on
DNA Sawa right so I like squid and the
reason why I've chosen squid for today's
session is the third point here so third
point here says that squid implements
ACL for blocking certain web sites or
web pages and it also improves security
by filtering traffic now when I say this
is the reason what I mean is this is the
demonstration I want to show you so I'm
going to show you a demonstration of how
to block certain websites or web pages
by using your access control list so any
seal stands for access control list and
if you can create an ACL rule with the
help of squid and in that rule you can
mention the list of websites that you
don't want your users to access now take
an example of sadness waiter in any
company and if the company or the
organization's policies state that the
employees cannot use any social media
sites like Facebook or Twitter during
workers then as an analyst traitor I can
write a rule of that so I can simply I
can my job is so simple that through ACL
I can write a rule blocking those
websites and I can just implement them
and none of them none of my users will
get access to those to get to access to
Facebook or Twitter when they are on my
network right so that's one big
advantage so yeah I mean her number of
employees are gonna hate me for that but
yeah but the one who's paying me is the
boss right so I'm making the boss happy
by doing this so that so yeah my pocket
is full and that's what I need so I can
do that as an administrator and another
big benefit of this is in colleges and
schools you know off late there are a
lot of students accessing pornographic
sites so the administrators there can
again implement a CL and they can block
such websites and web pages and you know
block those porn sites so that no
student access accesses anything during
you know during schoolers or working or
doing schoolers right so that's the
other benefit with a CL so yeah by now
I'm pretty sure you guys would have
understood what a CL is and how was quit
works how it implements a CL so I can
now straightaway get to my configuring
or you know configuration so okay just
one says explained about a DNS server
well just one time really sorry for that
see we are already running short of time
so I unfortunately I would not be able
to show it today but
surely I would have taken this request
probably the next time we have a Linux
session I would try to include DNS over
there all right yeah but you don't have
to worry too much because DNS and
squared they are all pretty similar
they're all proxy servers at the end of
the day so there's not gonna be much of
a difference and yeah so yeah now seems
like known as everyone else is fine so
let me get started and talk about the
steps that are involved in setting up
squid so we have four important steps
yeah and the first step is to it so
definitely install squid so with all
that record of anything so you install
squid with all its dependencies the
second step would be is to I know
configure the squid dot corner file and
that would be present in the etc' slash
squid directory under root so I can go
here I can configure this configuration
file so by default there will be a lot
of configuration files already so you'll
have a lot of ACL rules and a lot of
HTTP access rules defined by default and
if we want to if in my case if I want to
set up an easy rule for blocking
websites then I can do that by adding
two lines there to three lines I can
also add the hostname and all these
things so I'll be configuring this
failure so the third step would be to
enable a proxy server in the default
browser now since you know it's a linux
administration session I would be using
Mozilla Firefox right because Firefox is
Linux has default browser and similarly
if you are setting up squid on a Windows
server then you would have to probably
enable the proxy server settings from
your internet explorer and similarly for
Apple for Mac systems it would be Safari
because your proxy server settings will
be present only in the default browser
which that OS supports so in my case
here I would be using Firefox that's the
third step and the fourth step would be
to of course restart your squid service
and when you do when you do that you're
all up and running you are ready I can
show you how how the sites are blogged
in all these things right so yep so now
comes the hands-on part and let's see
how to configure squid by making changes
to the Cana file and ambling the proxy
server in the default browser great so
for that let me again go back to my
we am here this is my master VM I can go
but go to my slave VM also I can go to
any of these VMs and clear and let me
just close any services nothing is
running so first of all to download
squid we can run the command sudo yum
install squid right okay so for me it
says it's already installed on the
latest version I have so there's nothing
to do but you guys can go ahead use the
same thing to do downward squid and
implement squid the second step would be
to to configure the file right so the
your file is present under this
directory etc' squid and squid dot
corner file so I'm gonna use the VI
editor to edit this file so enter and as
you can see there are already a number
of rules like I said earlier so these
are some of the comments so wherever you
have a hashtag it means that these are
comments probably for highlighting the
heading or things like that so we have
the we have various ACL rules define
your and we don't need to touch all
these rules for now right we don't this
is not what we're into touch about you
know no worry about buddy I just need to
know that we are the ACL rules there and
we have the HTTP access rules starting
from here so we have a number of them it
says HTTP access allowing for you know I
love manager of the localhost deny
manager you know on deny connect SSL
ports we have number of rules and one
rule which I want to show you here is
that of the port number as you can see
there's a HTTP port that is 3 1 to 8 and
this is the port number on which my
squid will be running by default if you
want to change the port you guys can go
ahead and change the port but otherwise
this is very good the three one to eight
is good enough and we have to mention
this port while we are resetting our
proxy server because the process of
would be listening to squared right so
yeah we have to mention the this port
number in our proxy server I will show
you how it's done but before I go to
that third step and before I go there
let me add the ACL rule here okay so let
me come here so I'm adding an ACL rule
and the ACL rule is a CL blocked
websites space destination domain and
now let me say facebook.com and
twitter.com and probably any other
domain that you want to block well in my
case if I have an employ if I have a
number of employees in my organization I
don't want them to access social media
sites I would be doing this and in the
next line I can simply call the HTTP
access okay
I can say HTTP access deny blocked
websites now let me explain this rule
over here now what I've done is I've
created a new ACL called blogged
websites and the rule here is that which
word destination domain is there so
these two domains basically Facebook
common twitter.com right so I have so
I've defined these two domains in the
destination domain and whenever they are
being accessed then they would be denied
so that's what the deny blog websites is
there so every time the HTTP access is
an enemy you know try to access a new
website it would check this ACL access
control list and it would check if
anything is blocked from that list so if
any site is being blocked then that
would simply be not shown right so it
would not let you to navigate there now
that's about it so that's how simple it
gets I can just go simply save and quit
and I can go to the third step now and
the third step is to open my Firefox
browser which is the default browser
with Linux and over here yeah we need to
go to the settings and we have
preferences right so go to prefer
and under preferences we have advanced
let's go to advanced preferences go to
network connection settings so over here
you have the option to set your proxy so
right now it's using the system proxy
settings so if you try accessing
anything so if you try accessing
facebook.com or twitter.com they would
all work fine so as you can see Facebook
is running now there's no problem at all
right ok yeah it's open
login page is working but if you want to
configure Firefox to work through a
proxy browser then you can click on this
and add the IP address now since I don't
have a network here with me since my
since this machine is not the actual
proxy source it's not the actual server
through which all my network is being
routed through because it is not that
I'm going to just specify my own IP
address but ideally what would happen as
you know the proxy server which is being
used to to route all the traffic right
all the IP traffic on that on that
server the administrator's would add the
the whole network they'll add the
network address instead of just a
specific address but in my case I'm just
gonna add the address of one ninety two
dot one sixty eight dot fifty six dot
four because that is my IP address and
the port number that I mentioned earlier
was that of three one two eight so this
is where it runs by default I'm gonna
say use this proxy for so for all
protocols when we say all protocols in
it includes out of SSL FTP and Sox right
when you do this just click on OK now
your proxy settings is also enabled now
you guys can ask me one question as to
why we need to set the proxy settings
over here
does anybody have that question
okay great you people know it so I don't
need to touch up on that but yeah well
for the unfortunate few let me just tell
you that to enable squid we are using
this proxy server we are saying use the
proxy server right which is running on
the port number 3-1 to it and our squid
is running on port number three one two
eight so every request sure that that is
that the my Firefox get it would be
routed through my squid server so that's
the that's the thing here right so now
that I've done with this now let me try
to access facebook.com and now when I
hit enter or draw refresh see what
happens or for that matter of fact I can
now I can access any other website so
Facebook or Twitter okay
so it's working now right so this is
good news flow right now nothing is
implemented now that's because
everything is all fine but there is one
step that I need to still complete that
is of restarting squid now even though
my squid is being activated it's running
on my previous rule my new rule which I
activated that has not been updated so
to update that I need to run this
command sudo service restart service
squid restart
and the password is this stopping squid
so once it stops and once it restarts
then you can see that Facebook and
Twitter will not open anymore right
yeah take some time to stop squid so
let's just be a little patient here yeah
starting squid okay so it's all good now
let me try and refresh facebook.com
bingo the proxy server is refusing
connections correct this is what we
wanted so anytime any employee of yours
in your organization or in your network
tries to access Facebook or Twitter
during work time he's going to be shown
this kind of a page right so it does not
say that you don't have access to that
you know it does not say that the web
page is down it does not say Facebook is
not reachable or that is not reachable
it only says that your proxy server is
refusing new connections so this is like
a slap on the face to those people who
are trying to fool around during workers
so that's how that that's that's a path
that we have as administrators we can
control a number of things we can
control basically the life of the social
life of the other folks in her
organization so that's one fun thing and
these are the these are the two
important and the really nice thing that
I want to show you in my session right
so this brings an end to my
demonstration also so I hope you guys
have had the good fun probably I go I
made you guys wait for a little longer
during my previous demo but yeah that's
part of a Linux right so that's that and
let me just quickly revise what I cover
today so the first topic that I spoke
about was that of for the different
timeless Linux admin tasks and it's
timeless because they are everlasting
right so these kind of these tasks are
never going to end
these are going to be there as long as
companies are using Linux as long as
yours are being hosted and as long as
Linux administrators are there these
tasks will definitely have to be
performed these are the things which you
cannot not do later so that's the first
thing and then I spoke about what
exactly is the NFS the network file
system what are the steps there are
needed to configure them at your server
side and client side and then I spoke
about what a squid you know how to I
know what the role of a proxy server how
squid
you know performs as a proxy server and
how you can use it and finally I gave
you a demonstration of the same I give
you a demonstration of NFS and squid so
yeah that's it guys I'm sorry for
keeping you
for an extra 10 15 minutes I should have
finished it a little earlier but yeah
it's been a pleasure so I had a good
session here and oh yeah Robert says
thank you I learned a lot thank you
Robert thank you for being ever so
patient even I learnt a lot actually I
learned how to be patient in front of an
audience when one of your demonstration
doesn't work right so yeah I didn't I
don't do anything I was just restarting
the same service again and again and it
just happened to you know work suddenly
so sometimes that happens so that's all
about Linux so that's there and yeah I
totally enjoyed the session guys I hope
you all
oh yeah so guys yeah I enjoyed this live
session and i hope you all have learned
something new today if you guys are
looking at a structured training you can
probably check out at reyga's linux
course right in fact we have in our next
course starting every month and let me
just quickly go to the next page and
show you that right so this is our Linux
landing page and at Erica we have this
Lynott's administration certification
training you can check out the course
details over here we have a bat starting
on the 22nd of July in a couple of days
and we also have one starting on the
19th of August so you can check out that
you can check out the price details you
can change the the currency to us and
also you can check the the US timings
for the batch you can do all these
things if your us customer if you're
from us you can check out or you can
call our sales team at this toll-free
number and similarly Indian customers
can use this number to contact our sales
team if all else fails you can you can
just drop a mail to CL saturate it
record Orko and yeah there'll be
definitely there'll be someone who will
get in touch with you regarding this
course right so you can also have a look
at the various other features that you
will get when you buy another when you
buy your course or mentor a car you can
see all these things are there and
you'll also get you can get details
about what you'll be learning in the
course so you have the course curriculum
and the course objectives and all these
things over here so do check out our
course here and yeah stay tuned until we
have our session again right so thank
you guys well we will come up with more
live sessions do subscribe to our
channel like comment and share our
videos and there's one important thing
that I want to talk about so and that is
