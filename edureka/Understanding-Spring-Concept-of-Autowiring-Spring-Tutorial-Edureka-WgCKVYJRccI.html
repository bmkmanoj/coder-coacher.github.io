dependencies using auto wiring spring
offers Auto wearing feature that helps
cut down the amount of XML configuration
that the developers have to write so
that is what I had shown you right that
line will not be there
once we implement Auto wiring spring
offers following types of auto wiring so
we can Auto wear by using name by using
type and by using constructor okay we
will see one by one Auto wearing by name
spring container looks at the beans on
which Auto wear art attribute is said to
by name in the XML configuration file
based on the name of a property a bean
because that same name will be injected
into this property if it exists okay so
what does it mean we will understand
about these students in the next layer
because it has the XML configuration
file with the relevant information don't
worry ed this moment see I have a
hostile class and our student the class
so here I have a reference of hostile so
usually we know that we need to write a
bean for hostile and we need to write a
bean for student and we need to refer in
vertical we have to refer the hostile
bean for this hostile that we know by
using refs for attribute but if you see
here if you see here I supplied value
for name I supplied value for ID but I
eat broad hostel completely free I do
not see the property with respect to
hostel at all for the beam for the class
student fee here I had written for only
two properties and the hostel two
properties because if you see how
I have two properties four of those I
set the values student it has three
properties but I had set the values for
name and ID but I completely ignored
first why if you come here it says auto
way by name Auto while by name if you
see ID is hostile here property is
hostile here so it is going with the
property name it is going with the
property name if it finds any bean which
is the same property name then it will
go for it that's it
see I no need to write that dependency
for student bean at all just because of
auto I equal to by name so everything
else remains him see nothing changed
forever test class next I don't want to
write this life that's it that is my
requirement it should be Auto wild it
should automatically inject the specific
value for this property based on either
by name or by ID or sorry by name or by
type or by constructor argument okay
this injection has to happen
automatically be thought writing this
mapping information so that is my
ultimate goal that is my ultimate goal
so I want to remove this line and I want
to write something like this auto wire
Auto wire by using by using either
name or type so when I say name it will
search for it will search for a beam
with the ID equal to this name equal to
this name what is that I have a beam
with I did this so then I can remove
this got it then I can remove this so
this is the whole funda behind that
example that means I am just decreasing
the amount of effort that has to be put
by the developer in writing the XML it
should automatically wire with the
dependent beans so that is the ultimate
goal of this session okay next go to the
plied yeah so here we understood we have
two classes student and hostel and we
understood application context our
texture may look something like this
where we are writing auto wire okay and
that this remains same okay now we will
see an example on the same
module two we have student and hostel
see these many tabs are open read these
many files are open right so I don't I
want to close all of them in one short
so the shortcut for Eclipse it will
shortcut is ctrl shift to double you see
all the open files were closed
ctrl shift W student class looks
something like this which has a
reference to hostel and with ok the here
we are talking about constructor
injection no problem I'll comment this
out ok next
yeah how it looks now with the three
properties and centerline getter methods
that's it okay and go to hostel it
remains same go to beans to dot XML so
far River in beans beans not XML which
corresponds to module 1 and module 2 we
are going with beans to rot XML this is
just for readability purpose that's it
nothing more than that
ok so what I will do I will comment this
piece of code and I will see here enable
this piece of for to explain auto where
by name so let me enable this
see now here hosta for the class hostel
I am writing a beam with the ID hostel
and with two properties hostel name and
city and the values that I passed her
hostel name and City are Hyderabad
famous Austin and heroin and fur being
for the class student I am passing only
to attribute two properties for name and
ID it has the third property faster but
I am not passing any value or I am NOT
mapping any beam for that property
why because I explicitly said that I
explicitly said that boss boss go with
hostel feel in student the property name
is what hostel so in that case serves
with a beam hose i des hostel and the
map with it that can be done
automatically by this so does this XML
file has anything with ID hostel yes it
has then it should work then it should
work
that means the mapping part is extracted
away from XML and it is made automatic
by this go to test so this is same again
so here I am going with beans to dot XML
this is the only change I am trying to
get up being with ID student as it
written student I am casting it so now I
got a student instance on which I am
firing to string just to do get the
information of it okay so forget about
this for some time okay now run this
program fee here
student name is Ramon and I des Barham
one two three four five and hostel
details from Maine peas were injected
these were injected because of auto wire
by name auto wire by name so we are
going to the next level we are going to
the next level any question on this
okay so as there are no potions
which is it's crystal clear
Thank You G next no Auto vary by type
Auto wearing by type not by name so type
refers to that last type for example if
it is employee type is employee if it is
book it is book so like that now it
should not depend on the property name
rather than the property of type so here
in this example the type refers to
hostel this hostel so this property is
this is property name and this is
property type now it has to well based
on the type available it has to work
based on the type available so in this
case in this case how it behaves by type
specifies Auto wearing by property type
not by name spring container leaves the
XML configuration file and then for the
beans on which auto wear attribute is
set to by type it finds and then inject
that be according to type match so what
we are trying to convey from these two
lines is see here see now this is
capital hitch we made it intentionally
to tell you guys that it is not the
property name we are referring because
the property name is small hitch there
okay so now this on based on the name it
will not work so that we ensure by
giving capital hitch here next
but how still it is able to work because
I said auto whereby type so the property
hostel is of type hostel what am I
saying
the
Kirti hostel is of type hostel so it
will find for being host type is faster
so fortunately it for a being host class
is of type hamster that's it
it will inject it it will inject it how
if you see it remains theme
it remains theme okay next sorry
yeah till this point only here go to
bean stew dot XML and instead of by name
which would have by type I'm commenting
this piece of board and let me uncomment
this piece of code okay see here see the
ideal ideal five-star hostel five-star
hostel okay and by type I said but if
you go to student the class how to go to
student the class from XML just click on
that class name and f3 it will take you
there so now I am in the student declare
the property name is hostel
okay come back but I do not have a
respective property not even respective
bean within the same property name
because it is five-star hostel but still
it will work why because I am Auto
wearing my type so what is the type it
is looking for a bean with the type
faster yes it phone then it will match
it it will match it see I save it go to
test and execute it
see hope your client
will not change because we are doing it
configuration level any questions on
this got the difference between by name
and the PI type name refers to property
name type refers to property type that's
it okay so as there are no questions let
me go to the next slide
Auto wearing my constructor this is
third way to achieve the same if a beam
is set to auto wire by constructor in
configuration file then spring container
tries to match on the wire its
constructor argument with exactly one of
the beans host type matches with the
type of constructor or Q mentor so again
this is by type but it constructor level
by dead but it constructor level so for
that what I will be doing is and just to
modify this let me enable this and let
me disable all my said now I want to go
with constructor injection you can help
your sector methods also but I just
wanted to differentiate between
constructor and setter injection no I
have a constructor with name ID and the
hostile that's it no changes made to
hostile come back to beans now we will
be commenting this out let us uncomment
this piece of code now see if you see
here again five
star hotel so a five-star hostel and
this is hostel and I am giving passing
the values were only hostel and city
because then it does not contain
anything else and for being of type
student instead of property I am using
constructor
org because I am using constructor
injection here and I am ignoring the
third type that is for hostel so again
the IV is file star hot hostel but how
it will work because of constructor Auto
wearing my constructor but it will go
with a game by type again by type but it
a constructor injection level okay so
let me save this and go to test executed
nothing change right so again the
program is working as expected so let me
repeat this again three things I will
repeat we have by ID then by type and
constructor three things by ID sorry by
name by ten and the constructor by name
is most bothered about the property name
by type is most mother
abort setter injection place property
type constructor most bothers about
constructor injection less by type
that's it
yeah so again this is homework for all
of you guys loading multiple beam
configuration files generally in it
spring based in a spring spring based
application we have multiple beam
configuration files if a good practice
to define your beans in different XML
file rather than defining all means in
one XML file one
that comes to mind is how we will learn
multiple beam configuration files so we
will write a parent that is men dot XML
and we will import all the other XML
files by using an import tag as shown
here and importing a resource so that
refers to the path to the respective XML
file so as I have this many XML files
and these are the box so I am referring
to all those XML in one main dot XML
file and I will supply this one main dot
XML file to the application context so
this is one way of achieving that and
the other way is if you see here if you
see here it takes in array also it takes
in array also so this is also one of the
way to go for it
got it so either we can load multiple
configuration files in this way or in
the other way suggested so I am giving
this also as homework to all of you I am
skipping it intentionally as there is
nothing rocket science in this example
next beam definition inheritance being
definition inheritance a child being
definition
inherits configuration data from a
parent definition so it is nothing but
you the inheritance that you know taxes
inheritance that you know parent-child
relationship so you can acquire the
properties of parent that's it so the
change definition can overwrite some
values or add others as needed
what does it mean Charlie can have its
own properties and it acquires the
values are sent to the properties for
the parent but again it is up to child
within coop whether to go with the
values of the parent or give some
speciality values to the parent the
properties so that is what this overlaid
some values refers to using parent a
child being definition can save a lot of
typing that the developers have to do
otherwise so what does it mean you no
need to redefine those properties in
parent and a child rather if you define
it in parent it will be acquired by the
child if you establish those this is my
parent a relationship with the child
okay so how we will do that see here
this example I was not convinced so I
have another example this is very very
basic example and it is not carrying any
value so I'm not going with this
so parent-child relationship I have book
as a parent and ebook electronic book as
the child okay it could it could be a
paper book or it could be a ebook so I
have an e-book electronic book it is a
child which extends parent that is a
book okay so what book contains book
contains these many properties these
many properties so whether it is an
electronic book or paper book name of
the book author of the book number of
pages and the cost would be same
that is ready sister married and the
property specific to evoke r5 in mb 5 in
mb ok so I have set parameters for all
these four properties along with the two
string and I have sector methods for
this property along with two string tax
it now
I could see parent and the child
relationship some meaningful parent and
held a little ship in this example
okay then how then how this looks
so I'm deleting this then how this looks
book core not a Jew record or the module
2 dot book and I give values to all the
four properties or the parent book okay
by default by the theory of inheritance
all these are available to ebook all
these are available to ebook ok so in
that case in that case
two beats two dot XML so all these
values whether you write it or not will
be available to ebook will be available
to eBook
okay so ebook now I am saying parent as
book parent as book then I had defined
only size in MB per he book okay then
when when I create an instance of ebook
that means what I will do is I will
check for this ID in my tester dot Java
C here C ebook okay under it is written
it will written an instance of a book
then if you say both dot to string it
will written what everything all the
file properties see ebook says in MB is
25 tour - and what book contains book
contains all this information while
because I establish some pain in child
relationship in beings the parent-child
relationship in beams okay understood
there no need to be inheritance
relationship established also for
example
you
yeah this is coming because of
inheritance relationship okay fine
got this point any questions on this
inheritance
what is parent and all
yeah which is this yes it is very if you
feel it is hard just go with this
example it is very easy see here for it
has only one class father and it has
father and now the other bean there is
no class a defiant for it see there is
no class different for it but you still
you are treating it as a parent as a
parent and it has a father that means it
is referring to this that means first
him and lost them
both are available to this child be but
again you are overriding the value of
first name by shame so that is what this
light box report okay so next topic yeah
according to interfaces when using
spring for dependency injection it's a
good practice to use interfaces for the
parents referencing dependencies so what
it means so for example in our earlier
example assume I have a student class
and I have two kinds of hostels one is
5-star hostel and the second one is
priest or hostel but both the hostels
are implementing an interface called
hostel so here do not write either file
on hostel or priest or hostel rather
write hostel because it is a reference
which which can accommodate either it is
a three-star hostel or are five-star
hostel that is what the meaning of this
is let go with the interfaces rather
than their implementations because the
implementation may vary but if you refer
it with the interface that is super
interface then it can accommodate any
orbits in
meditations that is what the meaning or
dislike next animation based container
configuration so far whatever we had
same that is XML based configuration XML
based configuration now we would be
seeing how to configure everything using
annotations using annotations so here
comes the again chicken problem we will
ask whether this is good or that is good
is it XML configuration is good or
annotation configuration is good both
have their own advantages as well as
disadvantages ok we will understand that
stuff better will be developed more will
be develop more annotation based
container configuration so now we will
be adding this XML namespace with
respect to to the context in order to
your annotations work the container has
to know the context related to all your
annotations so this line was missing in
other XML if you see bins two dot XML do
we have that context see XML namespace I
have it for only beans not fur not for
context so that we need to add that we
need to add I had added see XML
namespace context this okay that is the
only change with respect to talk
container but how to add it let me
create a new
xml configuration or beam configuration
XML for second application of dummy next
see here you can select the required
namespaces from here so I want beans so
it will ask you which so we had chosen
for that 1.4 per our being total jars
right so I'm going with this and we have
something called context here so I will
use the same 4.1 finish see you can see
the context added you can see the
context added got it so this is how you
will create that we will add the context
information to our XML file any
questions on adding this context to our
XML file okay uh next what is this life
context : annotation - config it tells
that boss I'll be using annotation based
configuration so I will see container
I request you to please consider those
configurations so that is that is said
by this life so I would be using
annotation driven configuration also
along with my XML based configuration so
I request you to consider those along
with the XML configuration that is said
by this context : annotation - confit if
you means to add this
do you rate your annotations but they
will not work because your eye will see
engine is not aware of those until
unless you write this line okay so it
should be the first line of your
configuration file after beans okay
first annotation we will check for is a
great value on notation so a great value
annotation defined in jsr 313 so J Elsa
yesterday also I give some hint on jsr
258 330 right so J's are 330 Jays have
stranded Java specification requests and
that that is 3 that the image used to
inject string values into members of a
beam usually we use a great value
annotation to provide default value to
beans properties for example by default
it has to take John doing for name and 1
1 1 for ID so whether I set each in the
beam definition or not so for example if
you see student 1 did I write these two
properties no but still if you create an
object for this bean ID it will have
John Doe
under 1 1 1 as the result why because a
great value specifies that these are the
default values for the associated
properties default values for the
Associated properties but when you
overrate or explicitly write them or
does it means you are overriding the
default value you are overriding the
default well if you come here I had
created an object for course
student 1 and student 2 and when you try
to see the IDs you could see the
difference got it
ok
going next yeah I'll see here student
with annotations so for ID I'm taking
this as the default value per name I'm
taking this as default well and if you
go to beans with context added see here
the context is added and you can see
this student one we thought any property
defined then student two with one
property defined and how it behaves if
you go to test annotation beans you
could see I had created two objects
student 1 and student little from being
IDs student 1 ID student it should
populate with the two default values it
should populate it what default value
and one overridden value okay if you run
this you will come to know see this is a
default value this is the port word and
this is default value this is the
overridden value so how these are these
are working because we set the container
that please consider all my annotations
well you prepare your engine so where is
that where is that line of code this can
fix colon on annotation - conflict this
will ensure that container will be aware
of all your annotations got it
next next
Eldred required this is the second
annotation that we are going to learn
today this annotation simply indicates
that the affected bean property must be
populated at configuration time through
an explicitly explicit property value in
a bean definition or through or two
while the method could be either auto
wearing or explicitly used at the
property but it should have the value
supply to that property other way being
initialized
will not happen when when we add at the
right record it is something like
mandatory field it is something like
mandatory field because though you were
student class has two properties but
when you ignore okay not this though you
were student property has two properties
but for the first student one when you
ignored both the properties still it
accepted why there was no mandatory
condition is there on the values to be
said for these properties that is when
there is no exception but but see now I
have int value and I have a setter
method for that I am adding a required
annotation on it and go to beans with
context added dot XML and see how my
required annotation looks like how it
looks like see I am setting the value
attribute but if you ignore it what
happens now
I am not supplying any value I am not
supplying any value for my required
annotation class attribute is value I'm
not giving any value but but here I said
the sector method as required that means
I am saying that the property value is
required but you did not say what
happens go to test annotation beans and
see no bean initialization friends being
initialization exception while property
value is required for being required
annotations which you did not sit that
is what the meaning of it so how I can
rectify it by my own go to beans with
context added and just uncomment this
what I mean by that pass the value for
the property value then I'm passing 123
if you go back to your program that is
that sanitation based for this now you
will find it's working why because when
it qualified itself as a required and
when you pass the information there is
no problem at all right so that is why
it is working so now did you understand
what is required and how it will
influence the bean initialization any
questions on that
yeah which is clear hope everything is
clear on this otherwise let me know I
will explain again yeah
yet the problem with these kind of
courses like this is a kind of crash
course I'd you're learning entire spring
in eighteen to three I am very poor at
mathematics but still I'll play 24 so
you are trying to learn total spring
with so many admin to topics in 24 hours
but usually people take two and half
months into one and half hour so that is
the time period people dedicate for
Spring Framework with all these concepts
so this is at end of crash course so so
many concepts we are covering in Eden so
it will be confusing until you try it by
your own the best part from this course
if you have a week them to practice the
two-day session but if you do not
practice from module 3 and 4 I will
increase my speed much more so you need
to be very clear about all the concepts
that we covered so far ok next
yeah auto right now the annotation is
out of it
we have seen Otto - wide for Dean
definition right now we will do it using
annotations you can also apply the
annotation to methods with arbitrary
name and or multiple or comments you can
apply a thread auto head to constructors
and fields also by default auto wiring
fail whenever 0 candidate beams are
available that means you are saying Auto
word but the respect to beam is not
available then it fails the default
behavior is to
treat annotated methods constructors in
the fields as indicating required
dependencies this behavior can be
changed as demonstrated below edit or
the word of the queer equal to phones
because automating by type may lead it
to multiple candidates see multiple
candidates that means we have him five
star and 3 star example rate so how can
we get rid of that problem even see it
is often necessary to have more control
over the selection process more control
over the selection process one way to
accomplish this is bitter springs a
delayed qualifier annotation so when I'm
trying to oughta wear it by type what
happens it might there might be
possibility or more than one type can be
qualified for it we have seen that
exception right so then I can say that
though it has more than one been
associated with the same type but I'm
looking for this that we will explicitly
see
