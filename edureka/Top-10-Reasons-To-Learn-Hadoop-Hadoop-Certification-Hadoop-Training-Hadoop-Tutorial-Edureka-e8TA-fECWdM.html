Rica and in today's video I will be
telling you the top 10 reasons to learn
Hadoop reason number one the top
priority of organizations is now big
data analytics well Big Data has been
playing a role of a big game-changer in
most of the industries over the last few
years in fact Big Data has been adopted
by vast number of organizations
belonging to various domains and by
examining large datasets using big data
tools like Hadoop and spark they are
able to identify hidden patterns to find
unknown correlations market trends
customer preferences and other useful
business information let me tell you
that in an article in Forbes it was
published at big data adoption has
reached up to 53% in 2017 from 17% in
2015 with telecom and financial services
leading early adopters and the primary
goal of big data analytics is to help
companies make better and effective
business strategies by analyzing large
data volumes the data sources include
web server logs internet clickstream
data social media content and activity
reports text from customer emails phone
call details and machine data captured
by sensors and connected to the Internet
of Things IOT as we call it big data
analytics can lead to more effective
marketing new revenue opportunities
better customer services improved
operational efficiency competitive
advantages over rival organizations and
other business benefits and that is why
it is so much widely used an IDC says
that the commercial purchases of big
data and business analytics related
hardware software and services are
expected to maintain a compound annual
growth rate or CAGR of 11.9% through
2020 when revenues will be more than 210
billion dollars and that is HUGE
and the image here clearly shows the
tremendous increase in unstructured data
like images mails audio etc which can
only be analyzed by adopting Big Data
technologies like Hadoop spark hive and
others this has led to serious amount of
skill gap with respect to available Big
Data professionals in the current IT
market and hence it is not at all
surprising to see a lot buzz in the
market to learn how to reason number two
Big Data is revolutionizing various
domains now big data is not leaving any
stone unturned nowadays what I mean by
this is that big data is present in each
and every domain allowing organizations
to leverage its capability for improving
their business values the most common
domain which are rigorously using big

mentioned here big data is spreading
even more across different domains as
the technology is evolving the data is
increasing and hence big data is getting
adopted across a wide range of domains
hence you can build your career in any
of this domain by learning Hadoop reason
number three increasing demand for
Hadoop professionals the demand of
Hadoop can be directly attributed with
the fact that this is one of the most
prominent technology that can handle big
data and is quite cost effective and
scalable with the Swift increase in big
data sources an amount of data Hadoop
has become more of a foundation for
other Big Data technologies evolving
around it such as spark hive etc and
this is generating a large number of
Hadoop jobs at a very steep rate you can
check out different job portals like
indeed.com now creed x job etc and
you'll see the demand of Hadoop
professionals when he browsed through
the job postings
reason number four scarcity of Big Data
Hadoop professionals now the demand must
be more but the supply is quite less and
as we discussed Hadoop job opportunities
are growing at a high pace but most of
this job roles are still vacant due to a
huge skill gap that is still persisting
in the market and such scarcity of
proper skill set for Big Data and Hadoop
technology has created a vast gap
between supply and demand chain and
hence now it is the right time for you
to step ahead and start your journey
towards building a bright career in Big
Data and Hadoop in fact the famous
saying now or never this is an apt
description that explains the current
opportunities in the Big Data and Hadoop
market reason number five Big Data and
Hadoop salary this in fact is quite
rewarding one of the captivating reason
to learn Hadoop is the fat paycheck that
you're gonna get the scar city of Hadoop
professionals is one of the major
reasons behind their high salary and
according to payscale.com the salary of
a Hadoop professional varies from ninety
three thousand dollars to one hundred
and twenty seven thousand dollars per
annum based on different job roles you
can see the different job roles and
their annual salaries over here but of
course it can vary according to the
organization that you're joined in and
also with the experience you have reason
number six the Big Data and Hadoop trend
and asked for Google Trends Hadoop has a
stable graph in the past five years and
one more interesting thing to notice
here is that the trend of Big Data and
Hadoop are tightly coupled with each
other you can see over here that they go
hand in hand and have a direct
correlation big data is something which
talks about the problem that is
associated with storage curation
processing and analyzing of the huge
amount of data and hence that is quite
evident that all of the companies need
to tackle the big data problem one way
or another for making better business
decisions and hence one can clear
that big data in Hadoop has a promising
future and is not something that is
going to vanish into thin air at least
for the next 20 years reason number
seven it caters different professional
backgrounds Hadoop ecosystem has various
tools which can be leveraged for
professional from different backgrounds
if you are from programming background
you can write MapReduce codes in
different languages like Java Python etc
if you're exposed to scripting language
a partial pig is the best fit for you
and if you're comfortable with sequel
then you can also go ahead with Apache
hive or Apache drill the market of big
data analytics is growing across the
world and it's strong growth pattern
translates into great opportunity for IT
professionals it is suited for
developers project managers software

disruptive technology when Hadoop came
into the market it completely disrupted
the existing market and created a market
of its own Hadoop has proven itself as a
better option than that of traditional
data warehousing systems in terms of
cost scalability storage and performance
over variety of data sources it can
handle structured data unstructured data
and semi structured data in fact Hadoop
has revolutionized the way data is
processed nowadays and has brought a
drastic change in the field of data
analytics
besides this Hadoop ecosystem is going
through continuous experimentations and
enhancements in a nutshell I will tell
you that big data Hadoop is taking out
the world by storm and if you don't want
