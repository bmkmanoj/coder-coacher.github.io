now let's see the implementation of
activity basically the implementation of
shared preference just need to simply
come once again just need to simply come
to your Java part here what i will do is
i will create a shared preference in the
same example itself i will create a
shared preference you creating a
reference like let's say i will name it
as a speed okay now
you
this app this particular method will
allow me to get the shared preferences
thing which takes two parameters a
string name and the int mode the end
mode is something which should return if
the preference does not exist if you can
see in the definition itself here the
first one parameter name desired
preferences file if uh preferences file
by this name does not exist it will be
created when you retrieve an editor and
then commit changes the mode is
processing what can also be used if
multiple processes are moot ating the
same reference file okay so we will
use this method we will create the name
by which we want to create a shared
preference file so we'll create a shared
preference file name as share the file
there is the name of our reference
and we'll put the mode as zero that's it
now our shared preference is ready the
second part comes we want to put some
data inside it so on the click of a
button as I am coming here I will do
same part that is I will put this a
string value which I was sending to
another activity I'll put this value in
the shade reference so I'll say SP
shared reference
shipra friends dot editor SP edit is
equal to P dot edit now using the SP
edit method I would write something
inside the shuttle ins so I am trying to
write is peridot put a string the same
way you have to pass a key so let us say
pass this time the key as SP and escort
key and the value as str you save it now
we have edited now we have to commit
this so SP the same object SP edit dot
commit this will commit that
that is your saved you can save it now
you can come to the next part this is
how your reference is created here
if I create a shared reference then you
may want to give it as shared file pass
you 0 and then I will try to access
something out of it
now what I want is I want to retrieve
the value out of this preference for
simply say get a string and I want to
pass the value so value i will pass is
what key i have passed the key
hypothesis bender score key and the
value the second parameter is something
which ask that if this value does not
exist then what the reference
should return you then I say shared
reference should return me the value as
not available and instead of using this
bundle this time I will simply use the
shared reference to set the text inside
my edit text just come down said it
