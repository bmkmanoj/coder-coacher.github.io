welcome to this interesting tutorial on
springboard services so thank you all
the attendees for joining in today's
session before we get started all of you
just give me a quick confirmation on the
chat window whether am audible or not
okay I've got a yes from Sonia Rahul
Aman puja and now what a few more yeses
too so that's great let's get started
let's start by looking into what we're
gonna cover in today's session we will
start by knowing what exactly rest is
and then list the rest constraints after
that I will tell you the principles of
restful services and then deep dive into
how do we set up restful services in
spring world applications so is the
agenda clear to everyone
okay I've got a yes for most of you so
let's get started now so what exactly is
rest well rest is the abbreviation for
representational state transfer restful
web services are built to work best on
the web so did you get an idea what rest
is let me define it for you
rest is an architectural style that
specifies constraints such as uniform
interface that if applied to a web
service induce desirable properties such
as performance scalability and modify
ability so this means that rest is a set
of constraints that you need to avail
and once a service away this constraints
it is called a restful service coming to
the rest architectural style data and
functionality are considered resources
and are accessed using Uniform Resource
identifier the resources are then acted
upon by a simple set of well-defined
operations the rest architectural style
constraints an architecture to a
client-server architecture and is
designed to use a stateless
communication protocol typically HTTP in
the rest architecture style clients and
servers exchange representations of
resources by using a standardized
interface and protocols so at the end
you can understand that the REST API is
communicated between the clients and the
databases so what exactly are these rest
constraints well the first one is the
client server this means that you should
have a client and a server that is there
should be a service provider and a
service consumer the next one is that
you should have a uniformed interface so
you should know the functionalities of
the application you should know the
resources required and then you have to
decide on how to expose them out the
other things are the services should be
stateless and also they should be
cashable that means that the values
returned should be stored in cached and
the last constraint that I would like to
mention is that it should be a layered
architecture
so basically clients should not assume
to get a direct connection to the server
so now that you know the rest
constraints let's deep dive into what
are the principles that encourage
restful applications to be simple
lightweight and fast restful web service
exposes a set of resources that
identifies the targets of interaction
with its clients resources are
identified by URIs which provide a
global addressing space for the source
and service discovery the second thing
is that resources are manipulated using
a fixed set of create read update and
delete operations so the put creates a
new resource which can be then deleted
by using the delete get retrieves the
current state of resource in some
representation and post transfers a new
stage onto one resource resources are
decoupled from the representations so
that the content can be accessed in
variety of formats just HTML XML plain
text PDF jpg JSON and other
so metadata about the resource is
available and used for example to
control caching detect transmission
errors negotiate the appropriate
representation format and perform
authentication or access control the
final principle that I would like to
tell you is that every interaction with
the resource is stateless that is
recurse messages are self-contained so
stateful interactions are based upon the
concept of explicit state transfer
several techniques exist to exchange
states such as you are a rewriting
cookies and hidden form feels state can
be embedded in response messages to
point to valid future states of
interaction so now that you know what is
rest and its principles how do we set up
less full services for Springwood
application well there are three steps
that we will follow first we will set up
a simple Springwood project using
embedded tomcat that is in the Eclipse
IDE then we will add a guest service to
it after adding a guest service we will
learn how to handle the post service so
let's get started with it now let's look
into the project we will use the
concepts of customers ordering various
products so we will start by creating a
guest service to return what are the
products are customer as ordered then we
will also create another cat service to
retrieve the orders that is the details
of the specific order for a customer so
basically what I'm trying to do here is
tag I am trying to get the details of a
customer going for a particular product
so is that clear to everybody
okay I've got a yes
after that I will also create a post
service to register a customer for a
product so let's get started now so let
me just open my Eclipse ID so before
getting into the project structure let
me show you how to create a simple maven
project for that you just have to go to
file if to go to new and choose maven
project in the window that opens up you
have to choose create a simple project
and click Next
after that you have to fill the
following such as the group ID artifact
ID name description for your project and
then click on finish
this will create your maven project so
now that all of you know how to create
your own projects coming back to the
project that I've already created let me
take you to the project structure of
this project so let me just open all the
files
okay
now let's start with the customer
controller dot Java file well this is
the file which exposes the service
methods such as get post put okay so
Sonia just asked me a question if I can
just tell you guys what do these methods
get post would do well get does not
update anything it just gives the same
results in multiple calls coming to post
post creates a new resource ideally it
returns a JSON file with a link to newly
created resource I will explain you in
detail in the video now to update a
known the source you have to use the put
service so Sonia is that clear to you
okay that's great now continuing with
the project structure the product that
Java the customer dot Java and the
customer service dot Java is the main
business logic for the application we're
trying to implement so I would show you
how does the customer service exposes a
couple of methods that are consumed from
the res controller
coming to the customer controller ID the
Java it is basically for the integration
test for less services and customer
controller tester Java is for the unit
test for the rest services and the main
file here is customer service
application Java which is the launcher
of the Springwood application
lastly you can see a pom file which
houses all the dependencies you need to
build for this project so in this
project I'm using spring boot starter
web okay now that all of you are
familiar with the project structure let
me get you guys into the business
service for our application as all of us
know that a single application has
various layers such as web database and
business all these layers have their own
specific responsibilities that you can
understand by the name so now let me
open the customer service to Java file
well so as all for snow than
applications need data instead of
talking to a real database I will be
using an ArrayList which is kind of a
memory data source so now let me explain
you the business logic on which I've
built this application well in today's
world as all of us do online shopping
you can very well understand that a
customer can order multiple products so
a product must have an ID name
description similarly a customer as an
ID name description and the list of
products he or she has ordered so this
customer service that Java file is
basically exposing the methods let me
brief you a little bit about the methods
so let me just scroll down so basically
this retrieve all customers method
retrieves the details of customers the
public customer retrieve customers for a
specific ID retrieves a specific
customer details
this particular method retrieves all the
products a customer is bought scrolling
down okay so this method retrieves
details for a specific product a
customer is bought and finally if a
product has to be added to an existing
customer then this method is required so
we'll these are the methods that we have
we also have some entities such as
product with Java and customer dot Java
so when I open this product dot Java
file I can see that the product is
nothing but a simple object which has ID
name and description coming to the
second entity customer is also an object
which has ID name description and also
customer has a list of products he or
she has bought coming back to this
customer service file all it does is it
initializes the list of products let me
just explain you the code now so we
start by using a simple static ArrayList
to store our data to keep it simple so
basically we're storing all the list of
products here we are creating this
application for five simple products and
two customers buying those products so
we have product one two three four five
and payal and Neha buying those products
other than that we also have some few
important methods that I told you
previously so let me just scroll it down
for you so we have a method to retrieve
all the customers to retrieve a specific
customer for a product to retrieve all
the products that we have and also to
add products so let me just tell you
that
all of these are very simple metals that
we have created for a service now
question comes why have we created this
method well the answer to this question
is that we just want to use these
methods from the controller so now that
we have a business logic ready which is
very important to us it's everybody
clear with it okay I've got it yes from
most of you that's great so now coming
to the main concept how and where should
we add and get service so to add a get
service you just need to add a delayed
class control annotation which is used
to expose the rest services so let me
just open the controller file and show
you okay so this controller file will
expose our rest services as this
annotation is included here so now if
you scroll on this file you can see a
couple of ket methods well let me tell
you the meaning of all these methods
look at the first method which says
customers customer ID products
so basically slash customers is the part
we are using and the one in the flower
bracket that is the customer ID is the
path variable so you can see that the
path variable is mapped to the customer
ID so if I say suppose customer slash
customer one that I'm talking about
customer one and want to get the list of
products that customer one has ordered
similarly if you go to the second method
that is the customers customer ID
products and product ID you can see that
this method is used to retrieve a
specific product for a specific customer
one interesting fact that I would like
to tell it is that we have used the
annotation at the rate or two wired what
does it mean why are we used well in
details you can refer to my previous
video on spring boot tutorial but let me
just give you a little bit about it well
at the rate or the wide annotation is
used to auto wire in the customer
service so now if you just want to check
whether the service is working or not
let's just learn this application so let
me just right click on this project go
to run as and choose spring boot app
well at the end of the console you can
see that Tomcat has started on port
number 80 80 and the customer service
application has started so now to check
if your application is working or not
open the browser and type localhost
colon 8080 slash customers suppose if
you want to check for customer 1 given
the parameter as customer 1 and map it
to products
okay so on the screen you can see the
details of products the customer one is
bought so have you ever just thought how
are we getting the output as Jason filed
when we just listed the data as a list
when this happens because of something
known as message converters so
Springwood has this thing called order
configured through which it configures
many message converters so message
converters basically look at the request
and identify what exactly client is
looking for so if a client is looking
for Jason file then the message
converter would convert this Java object
product to a Jason file now let me just
tell you that the message converter is
auto registered with the springboard
okay so the post method that I mentioned
in the starting of the video well I told
you that we use it to create a new
resource so just in case if I have to
create a new resource for this
application I'm going to post map and
map the URL to it so what does this post
mapping do so post mapping would be to
expose this as a post request and path
variable is mapped to it now one more
thing that you can see here is the
request body product new product so
whatever product you would put in the
request body would be automatically
bound to here so when you execute the
request we will put the details of the
product in the body of the request and
then the request gets bound to the
request body once the product is found
the location of the product is printed
but if the product is not found then it
returns null so guys that's all for
