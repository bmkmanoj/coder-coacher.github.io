Rica and today we will learn about quick
view I hope that you can all hear me
properly if you all can so drop make
information on the chat window so that I
can get started alright so uncle says
yes Xena says yes she can hear me and so
does Adam a bell and sign up alright
guys so let's get started by looking at
the agenda first so this little be
learning today
so since quick view is a business
intelligence to will learn what is
business intelligence and we'll take a
look at the other business intelligence
tools also then we'll focus on learning
what is quick view and since quick view
is a data discovery tool and a lot of
people are confused about what is data
discovery so we'll learn about that also
then we'll take a look at the different
features of quick view to understand
what click view can enable us to do then
we'll learn more about quick view by
understanding its architecture and then
finally we'll learn how to use quick
view in order to make different apps
where and I'll show you a demo and
finally we'll talk about how people have
benefited by using quick view so we'll
see that in the could do success section
so this is what we'll be learning today
any doubts on the agenda alright so
we'll move on to our first topic now and
we'll understand what is business
intelligence so basically business
intelligence is an umbrella term it
encompasses different applications
different tools infrastructure some best
practices that enables access to
information that help you to improve
your business by digging out different
problems and also offering a solution
for it and for that you need to do a
couple of things so first you have to
collect the information now this
information could be your organization
data your internal research and
development your market research your
customer feedback and even social media
and the next step is to integrate all
this data together since all of this
data and information are coming from
different data sources and also that
might
not be even similar some may be
structured some may be unstructured so
it's very important for you to integrate
them all together so that I can move it
to the analysis part and for integrating
all the structured semi-structured and
unstructured data you can use different
integration tools you have got data
integration tools like informatica the
IBM data stage the SSIS Pentaho and many
more and the next and the most important
part is to make an analysis of all this
data that you have collected and
integrated together because this will
enable you to get business inside so
that it can make better decisions after
you have analyzed all this data together
and then the final step is to present it
because it might be a little hard for
other people to understand the raw data
that just came out from the analysis
stage so you need to present it in a way
so that even the non-technical people in
your organization can understand it so
even for that you've got different data
visualization tools like quick view
tableau Spotfire Domo and many more so
as an old business intelligence helps
you to support your business so that
your business can grow it can solve
different problems that you are
encountering it will offer you a
solution in order to solve those
problems so this is all about business
intelligence this is just a collection
of different tools practices all
together so I hope that you've
understood what is business intelligence
Center this tutorial will be just
learning about one part of it which is
the visualization part and the data
discovery part because we're going to
learn about quick view here so we'll not
talk about the data integration tools
like informatica and the other examples
that I just gave you all the tools for
analyzing data like our SAS Python
talent not that we are going to talk
about data visualization the
presentation part of business
intelligence today but then there are
still people who do not use business
intelligence there is there more like
why do we need it someone like this guy
so he says that he doesn't need it
I'm happy with my spreadsheets they also
have Muskaan
suctions about business intelligence
that it requires a lot of IT expert ease
and resources which is completely false
and also the thing that it is
complicated and intimidating which is
also false because the tools that are
recently developed for bi they are very
easy to use even non-technical members
in your organization can easily use it
and present data to gain insight from
them so it's very important and it's
very essential for your company to use
business intelligence nowadays because
in today's era everyone is using
business intelligence and business
intelligence has been helping a lot of
companies so if you want to move forward
it's time that you should use it and why
should you use it I'm going to tell you
about the benefits of using business
intelligence or incorporating business
intelligence in your organization first
of thought he can gain deeper insights
in business if you want to improve your
business you need to make some insight
so then you can take steps in future in
order to improve it so after that
improves productivity and efficiency so
since when you have got a logical
explanation to solve your problems and
everyone in your company every team
member agrees to it it definitely punish
everyone up and it proves productivity
and efficiency of all your employees in
your company and the next benefit is
that it gives you an informed decision
making so when you know the consequence
is already if you know that if I go with
this step I will get this consequence if
I go with the other sub all get sense so
it is very easy for you in order to make
decisions now the next is to analyze
data in a business meaningful way
now as business intelligence it is
specifically focused on your business
data only it will help you to make
analysis in such a way that it gives you
a solution as a direct output in order
to enhance your business then it open
hands this team sharing and
collaboration now it's not all about the
different steps and business
intelligence starting from collecting
information in order to present it all
teams need to collaborate together in
order to
find the final solution for the problem
in order to improve the business it also
knows how to optimize cash flow and
increase your profit then it also
improves customer service and
satisfaction since you'll be analyzing
all your customer feedbacks using
different BI tools it will definitely
label you to reach the maximum level of
customer satisfaction that will also
help you to enforce regulatory
compliance it will increase flexibility
and agility in your organization and
because you are using business
intelligence everything is organized and
that is like this also streamlined
budgeting and planning also so these are
the benefits of using business
intelligence so why not use it so now
let us take a look at how to use it for
that we'll need different business
intelligence tools so what's going to
look at what are the different BI tools
that are available in the market right
now there is the Oracle VI SAP Business
Objects Microsoft power bi and there is
tableau and Pentaho and many more that
you can see in front of your screen
right now but we'll learn about QlikView
today so let's start by looking at what
is click view so quick view is a
business discovery platform that is used
vastly in business intelligence
supporting creation of dynamic apps for
analyzing information now this is not
just a common data visualization tool we
can do much more in click view so in
quick view you can make apps and these
are kind of visualization apps you can
add different buttons and list boxes you
can even go ahead and define your own
data model so we'll learn that later in
this tutorial I'll show you how to make
your own visualization app with click
view now these are some of the
highlights of click view so the core of
quick view is the patented software
engine that lets you to generate new
views of data on the fly the next
special thing about quick view is as
in-memory technology now quickly
compresses the data with its own
technology and it holds it in memory
where it is available for immediate
exploring
by multiple users and four datasets
there are too large to fit in memory
could be connects directly to the data
source and the next is that it's
associative click two delivers and
associative experience across all the
data used for analysis regardless of
where in a sort you can start anywhere
and go anywhere and this is not limited
to any predefined drill path or any
pre-configured dashboards so this is
just a brief introduction to quick view
so we'll dig in deep don't worry about
that if you didn't understand any of
this but if you still have any questions
till now you can go ahead and ask me
so guys you have any questions ok no
questions but if anything pops up in
your mind you can go ahead and ask me on
the chat window whenever you want so now
I've been talking about quick view as a
data discovery tool so let us see what
exactly is data discovery so this is the
definition of data discovery so it is a
user driven process of searching for
patterns or specific items in a data set
so in the in discovery you deal with the
raw data sets itself and you look for a
patterns - in order to study about it so
that he can make analysis in a better
way and data discovery uses different
visualization techniques in order to
find out those patterns now you can
define data discovery in two ways now
one way could be about the information
management processes and the other could
be about the front and analytics but
basically data discovery is a way to let
people get the facts that they need to
know in order to do their jobs
confidently in a format that is
intuitive and available so if you can
convince people that this is the problem
and this is the solution with a logical
explanation everyone would understand it
and hence they can proceed with
different practices in order to
accomplish this so basically it's all
about getting answers without a big
turnaround time or reliance on a
particular technical resource now data
discovery is designed to answer
immediate spur-of-the-moment questions
so it is very usable it means that
you should also have your data
presentable because presentation is a
core focus and data discovery it stays
as far away from actual query syntax as
it can get
now data discovery is also targeted it
means that it is not meant to be
monolithic enterprise wide practice
that's everything to everyone it is
optimized to meet a specific need it
gathers quick trusted initial results
that satisfy different business
departments when they need a quick fix
it is also very flexible because it can
apply to any department or function it
can access data for and it supports
speed and usability aspects of this
approach then it also helps you to
collaborate because it helps to gather
the organization's interest and lets
everyone pitch in in order to help move
goals forward whether they are technical
or not
now data discovery is very important
even though I know that this term is not
frequently used and not many people have
heard about it but QlikView is a data
discovery tool more than a visualization
tool now if you compare the
visualizations with other tools you
might think like it is not as apt or it
is not as good looking but it can enable
you to do a lot more than just
presenting the data or visualizing the
data so this is why data discovery is
important and we'll do that by using
quick view now we understand the
benefits with quick view data discovery
applications because we click view these
are not just normal visualizations
it's our visualizations app that enables
you to do data discovery so understand
the benefits of it so now let us
understand the benefits of using a quick
view app by comparing it with a normal
analysis report and a visualization so
the first thing the reports and
visualization it is impractical and non
sustainable in practically any sense
that it asks users to build new analysis
by themselves that is quite impractical
then it requires experts to build more
reports for them so that is why it's not
sustainable but with could view
applications the answers are already
there they are just available through
simple clicks or taps on your dashboard
and that is why it is scalable and
effective and the next problem with
reports and visualization is that the
more users the more requests for new
reports because every user might have a
different requirement every user will
offer n't questions and to answer all
the different questions you'll have to
make numerous reports so the new reports
are built by IT or business lines to
serve the request and the number of
requests that spin out of control if
there are more people involved but in
case of quick view applications there
are more users the more quick but the
same apps so the users can go ahead and
simply click to refine views and answer
questions and apps deliver new views of
information dynamically so that's why
users can get instant feedback with
click view applications and let's talk
about one more benefit with quick view
apps now since I already told about that
you need multiple reports in order to
answer multiple questions so this is not
cost effective you will have to burn
more money in order to create more
reports you have to do the analysis
again in a different way so that's why
it is mentioned that more reports for
more questions it will have backlog and
cost now in order to answer multiple
questions from different groups of
people let's say that this is the IT
department this is the operation so they
are asking different questions so why
not just build them each app so every
person here will just go ahead and click
on the apps that you have provided them
and then get the answers themselves and
that is why it is called as economies of
scale you could save a lot of money a
lot of time by only creating a single
applications and give it to multiple
people so these are all the benefits of
using quick view up and very sure that
once you start using it you can
understand it yourself and there is one
more fun fact that I will tell you that
quick view actually conducted an
experiment where they have 17 people to
ask some questions they have build them
an application related to their business
and there were 17 people were asking
questions again and again
after another and in 20 minutes with
just one click the application 170
questions were answered so that is the
power of using a quick view apps in 20
minutes if you can't answer one so many
questions that is huge so do you agree
with me guys all right so a Belle and
I'm kid seems very interested they're
saying that's great
obviously this is very powerful so so I
hope that after this tutorial when you
go ahead and use it I'm sure you guys
will do benefited too
so any question is still now alright so
we'll move on to our next topic now and
we'll take a look at the quick view
features so quick view is unique in many
aspects but still flexible enough to
meet the needs of businesses from
various scales and industries here are
some of the main benefits that companies
experience when working with QlikView so
we'll take a look at the features one by
one so the first feature is its unique
data discovery and global search so
quick view utilize this natural search
to navigate complex information and
accelerate discovery and alongside is
default connectors quick view offers
custom connectors you can install upon
need including subscribe import data
from Salesforce or HIEs teradata
and other popular systems it means that
quick view is perfectly applicable in
all analytic scenarios both when you're
running a smaller local business and
when performing enterprise grade big
data analytics the next feature is its
ability to collaborate because all
insights and data visualizations in clip
you are shareable and employees get to
discuss them in real time you can send
those in cloud or VI your enterprise
server or simply you've rearranged
parameters and permissions to make data
more accessible
the next is absolute control over your
data so what users appreciate the most
about quick view is that it allows them
to create personalized data-driven
discoveries with guided paths and
analysis so all discoveries are tightly
governed and highly customizable which
means that your employees will be guided
while developed
insights and instructed on how to use
those to make more meaningful business
decisions
the next is providing a secure working
environment so the be assistance kako
sensitive corporate data and which is
why you need quickly to ensure total
control of data access management and
permissions for the purpose quick view
ensures granular control of all
dashboards and layouts and assigns roles
to all users the next feature is
flexibility and integrations so unlike
most traditional systems quick view
gives users the exact tools that they
need to build their workspaces
and process data and desired ways in
fact you can use the script to build
custom apps or extend development with
the Handy workbench and on top of that
quick view is easily combined able
system and offers extensive api's for
you to connect with multiple apps and
business systems and finally there is
the ability of consistent reporting so
the system is packed with appealing
templates you can use to build accurate
reports which can later on be
distributed as Microsoft Office document
are printed directly from the platform
and let me also tell you that could you
also makes it possible to generate
custom and business specific reviews so
these are all the features of quick view
so now we'll understand more about quick
view by looking at its architecture so
this is the quick view architecture so
it has a front-end back-end and these
are the infrastructure resource so let
me start with the backend first so this
is where the quick view source documents
are created using the quick view
developer here and this is all where all
the source documents reside so this
source file over here they either
contain scripts within the qvw files to
extract data from various data sources
like data warehouses Excel files
Salesforce or
they might actually store binary data
extracts themselves with
the qvd files so the main clip you
product component that resides on the
back end is the quick view publisher so
the publisher here is responsible for
data loads and distribution and within
the back end the windows file system is
always in charge of authorization quick
view is not responsible for access
privileges it is managed by the windows
file system only so now let us talk
about the front end so the front end is
where end users interact with the
documents and data that they are
authorized to see the other could view
server so it contains the quick view
user documents that have been created
via the quick view publisher at the back
end and the 5/5 seen on the front end
are qvw they are meta file and shared
documents so all communications between
the client and the server occurs here
and this handle via HTTP in case of the
age of client or it is via the quick
view proprietary qvv protocol so within
the front end the qvs the QlikView
server is responsible for the client
security and this is the infrastructure
resource this are the sources or the
data sources this contains the data
sources this is where click view fetches
data from so this is a quick view
developer that is in the backend so this
is connect to the back-end all the data
sources are fetched onto the backend and
the quick use developer here this is a
windows-based desktop tool and this is
used mostly by designers and developers
it is used to create a data extract and
transformation model or you can go ahead
and create a graphical user interface
also using quick suit developer so this
is how it works so after that what
happens in the front-end the quick view
server over here it handles the
communication between the client and the
quick view applications so it loads
click the applications into memory and
calculates the present user selection in
real time and the quick view publisher
here is load data from different data
sources and reduces the quick view
application and
tributes to a qvf so this is the entire
architecture and this is how quick view
works the hope that is understood this
any questions all right and questions
now it's the time that you learn how to
use quick to you so we'll start this by
understanding how to load data so now I
need to do a little bit of script work
and quick view you can also go ahead and
use the wizard directly I'll show you
how to use the wizard as well in the
demo section so in order to note data if
you want to open the Edit script so you
have to press ctrl + E together and this
will open up a script like this and here
you can go ahead and write command to
load data you can load data from your
local files or even onto connect your
external databases also so now you have
to define the type of connections when
you want to connect to a particular data
source see I've got three options so the
first one is the ODBC which is already
you know this is an open database
connection so this is a open standard
API for accessing any database so by
using odbc statements in your script you
can access file in a number of databases
including Microsoft database access db2
excel txt files anything so you can use
this for connecting to files that are
present in your local bank the next
column is the oledb so this is used for
object linking and embedding database
connections so this is an API designed
by Microsoft and it allows you to access
data from a variety of sources in a
uniform manner so the API here provides
a set of interfaces that is implemented
using call the columnist component
object model so this is used to connect
to external databases so when you select
the oledb connection you will see a few
options if you want to connect to a
microsoft access database that is hosted
somewhere on the web but in case that
you don't see that option when you
select oledb you should discuss it with
your IT service provider
so you have to make a initial setup
before using or before connecting quick
view to an external database and finally
this is the qvs admin data provider DLL
now this is a custom connector and it is
completely managed by the clips you
server so this directly loads
information from the data management
system and server objects so this is not
particularly of connector to any kind of
database this is the data management
system within quick view itself so these
are the type of data connections that
you can use so any questions here all
right now questions so now we'll move
ahead and see how to make associations
in quick view now associations are
nothing but they are joint that have not
been evaluated so when you load
different tables onto quick view click
you automatically associate different
tables together if they have got the
same field day so like here over here we
have got the rel ID and graph and
relationships also for they're linked
together now let me talk about synthetic
keys and tables so when we load two
tables in quick view and they both have
a common field name like in this case we
have gar L ID similar in graph and
relationships so they get associated
automatically based on the comments view
so however when we have more than one
common field between two or more tables
so the quiz would create a synthetic key
and table and the keys are added to the
user uploaded table and are joined with
synthetic tape so let me go ahead and
show you an example so this is a data
model for the quick view in build
database this is the movie database so
you can see that these are synthetic
keys you can see that we have got
lengths in films we have got lengths in
interval match lengths also then we've
got title in films and title and film
count also then we've got film ID in
films and actors also and directors also
so here you can see that the length is
joined by you
synthetic keys so if you want to avoid
synthetic keys you can go ahead and
change the field name in each of the
tables if you don't want any kind of
confusion so these are synthetic keys so
you might encounter that so till then
we'll just move ahead with our
presentation so now when you have made
the analysis and you have created your
data model it's time to present it and
you can present it by using charts see
have got options for these charge you
can create a bar chart trade table pivot
table line chart pie chart or God's
chart we can use a bar chart in a
scenario where you want to compare this
in groups together you can use a line
chart when you want to detect or you
want to observe or visualize changes of
something over a particular time pie
charts are very helpful when you want to
compare parts of the whole let's say
that you want to compare that how is the
sales going for each particular year any
one divided in month so pie chart would
be very much helpful and very good
visualization in that scenario you can
use straight tables when you want your
data in a sorted manner you can use
pivot tables when you want your data
group together and God's charts like
this can be used as radial charts so you
can use it in different scenarios or
whatever suits your data set the best
and finally this is what your quick view
dashboard is going to look like so this
is the selection box and these are
different list boxes you can sort your
list boxes you can add different buttons
over your list boxes these are different
visualizations in one place so you can
see that there is your spatial chart
there are bar charts so this is what you
can do with quick view so we'll go ahead
and we'll add different charts will have
input boxes selection boxes will add a
few buttons also will give it objects
and also tell you how to add notes and
comments on a quick view dashboard so
these are the features of quick view so
I hope that you have understood this so
now it's time to show you a demo so that
you can understand how to use quickly on
how to create the dashboards that I just
showed you so this is my click view
desktop this is the personal Edition and
this is on the latest version till the
date which is quick view 12 so we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
click this button over here which says
new document so after clicking this this
will open up a wizard for you so you can
create your new document using this
wizard so we're going to go ahead and
use this wizard only so here you can see
an option to load your data so you can
load or insert your own data set here by
clicking this button here and moving to
the location where your data set is
contained or you can use the quick view
data set also now this is for
demonstration purposes I'll just go
ahead and select the quick view data
source only so just click this button
insert data now this is the data set
that we're going to deal with the sales
order and this is an excel file so we're
going to go ahead and use this data set
the next click on next step so this is
what our data set looks like right so
this has got different key links like
customer sales order ID ship date
product sales and quantity so next you
have to choose whether you use column
headers from the data file itself or if
you want to add your own column headers
now you can see that our data set
already has column headers which are
customer sales order ID so these are the
feelings which are column headers so
we'll go select this option only and
this is already selected so we'll let it
stay like that and click on next step
you have to go ahead and save this
project first so I'll just call it add
Eureka and save so move on to the next
step now you have to choose what kind of
chart do you want so either you can go
with a bar chart line chart or a pie
chart now I've already explained you
when to use a bar chart a line and a pie
chart so here in this case we're going
to represent sales so we'll just go
ahead and select the bar chart only so
we'll click on that and next step so now
you have to choose the dimensions so let
us go ahead and select sales from here
then you also have to mention
or I have to select the aggregation
function that you want to use in your
expression so there is the sum average
and count so we'll select the sum only
and let us choose the ship date so we
want to see how many sales are
associated with a particular ship date
so we have chosen our dimensions now we
want to develop our chart so click on
next step and you can add objects for
making selections also so you can add
list boxes or table boxes so I'll be
adding list boxes so we'll go ahead and
click create so this you can see so this
is the bar chart of sales that is
created according to ship date so here
is your visualization you can go ahead
and create some list boxes to just right
click and use sheet object so here you
can find all the different kind of
objects that you can add in this sheet
over here so I'll go ahead and click on
list box so now let us choose the field
so let's say that we want to see the
sales order ID okay so we're going to
use this as the title itself and just
click on ok so this is my list box these
are the different sales order ID now if
you click on it this will be changing so
your visualizations will change
according to the sales order IDs so now
let's go ahead and create a new list box
now let me create the customer 1 only so
click on ok so here the A to Z solutions
this is the bar graph for them according
to ship date and the sales so you can
just go ahead and make different
selections and your visualization will
keep on changing according to the
selections that you made and you can see
your selections over here in the current
selection box this is how useful quick
you can be if you want to see different
visualizations according to different
customers the visualizations will keep
changing according to the quicks or
according to the selections that you
make now you should know about the
colors that the green represents the
green color represents the current
selection that you have made
eight and then the grade represents that
is not associated with your current
selection so this is what you can do
with quick view we can also go and
select multiple numbers at once so
you'll have different visualizations for
it and you can also go ahead and
customize your list boxes also so let me
just show you so just click on the list
box and click on properties by
right-clicking on it and then you can go
to caption right I want to add a Clear
button also so I'll just go ahead and
select this clear and click on OK
so you see that there is a little Clear
button there disappearing in your list
box so this is what you can do you can
go ahead and do it the same list box
also now we have created this
visualization using the wizard we can
also go ahead and write our own scripts
also let me show you how to edit your
scripts so just press control E so this
is your script so even though you use
the wizard for creating the
visualization but the loading is also
mentioned in your script so this is the
code for loading the load customer sales
order ID so these are the different
field names so this is the directory or
the path from where the data source or
the data set has been loaded so these
over here are environment variables so
these are automatically set when you
open your script so you might not want
to mess around with this so this is the
time stamp format how it should be so
let it stay don't mess around with this
part of the script so you can also go
ahead and load your own data sets by
using this command load so this commands
look like simple sequel queries and
nothing else so this is very simple I'll
go ahead in my next tutorial I will tell
you a lot more about scripting we will
not use the wizard there we will do it
with scripts only so this is just to get
started with quick view so I'm using the
wizard and I've shown you how to create
visualizations using the wizard so we'll
just go ahead and close it let me just
go ahead and also show you the tables
just press ctrl T so this is the data
set and these are the different fields
now if you load some more data sets the
same name will be associated like the
example and movie database that I just
showed you so you can bring this screen
or the table editor over here by
pressing ctrl T so this is what you can
do with quick view if you have any
questions you can ask me or if you want
me to do something else with this you
can still go ahead and ask me so is
there anything all right then so we'll
just move ahead and see our next topic
so now let us talk about how people have
benefited using quick view let's start
with Swedbank
so the head of marketing and online
banking of Swedbank so the head of
marketing and online banking of Swedbank
unki our note he says that quick view is
an immensely powerful business discovery
platform the solution gives users the
power to gain access to and freely
analyze data it makes it possible for
them to climb the knowledge ladder from
raw data to refine information for
analysis and conclusions resulting in
relevant actions similarly gain Sharpe

connected our organization from
grassroots right up to the top of the
