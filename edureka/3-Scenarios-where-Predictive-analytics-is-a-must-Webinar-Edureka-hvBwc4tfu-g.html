are going to discuss as part of this
particular webinar even before that
let's look into the agenda first we will
start off the agenda discussing about
the water what are the various types of
analytics why do we need to do
predictive analytics what are the
domains where predictive analytics is
creating wonders and finally we look
into three scenarios where predictive
analytics is majorly used and I'll show
you a hands-on which I've performed as
part of sentiment analysis right though
i'll not be executing the code what line
by line and explaining you nevertheless
i'll explain what is sentiment analysis
in how we have actually come up with
that so that's a case study use case
that you'll be exposed to as part of
this issue what are the types of
fanatics that we have we have one part
which is called as a descriptive
analytics what is descriptive analytics
you just describe the data set which is
thrown at you you come up with the
measures of central tendency such as
mean median mode by yourself variants or
dispersion right as part of that you
look into Willian standard deviation
range and you look into some kind of
graphical analysis all that is part of
your descriptive analytics after you
describe the data set that you have with
you you try to predict the future and
you look into how your future is going
to behave and take corrective actions in
taking you course of correction that is
predictive analytics predicting on what
will be my sales in the future
predicting what will be my prophet
predicting on how will my employees
strength grow predicting on who are
those employees who might leave my
organization that's all predictive the
third part are the stage third stage of
analytics is called as prescriptive I do
not just analyze and predict the future
however I'm also going to provide you
with the step of actions right action
items on what should
be done to ensure that you are on a safe
zone so this is how you travel the path
so here we have advanced and emerging
analytic capabilities if you see here
the percentage seventy percent is
descriptive what is descriptive mean we
just analyze we take the data and
analyze on what has happened right only
thirty percent of the times we actually
analyze and try to answer this question
on why did it happen right this is
called as getting to the root cause
basically
what will happen if you're coming to the
future this is all about the present you
take the data whatever has happened
until now you analyze the data and what
has happened and you try to find out the
root cause on why did it happen however
if you move to the predictive zone or
you if you move from the present to the
future you see these two components
there in the future predictive what will
happen right that is predicting the
future only sixteen percent of the
entire globe actually uses this
capability right customers across the
globe clients use only sixteen percent
or sixteen percent of your entire market
which is into business uses this
predictive analytics the last thing is
prescriptive look at this here is where
you have a lot of potential if you are
looking into shifting your couriers and
I would say look into this percentage
there's still a lot of opportunity for
you guys to explore and actually
flourish well there three percent only
are looking into what should we do in
the future normally what happens once
you get to know what is your predictive
prediction this information is given to
some kind of a strategist or strategy
and operations person who is from a nice
b-school he is going to analyze and come
up with the next steps of action however
can we come up with a model which also
suggests on what are the steps that need
to be taken that is the way we are
moving forward right that's the next
generation of analytics all about and
not just giving the solution giving deep
best solution given the constraints that
is called as optimizing prescriptive
being prescriptive or coming up with
prescriptive model is nothing but coming
up with the best solution not just the
solution but the best solution right and
in the current world you have a lot of
business applications and from
that those business applications you're
getting the data using which you're
coming up with your analytics using
which you're coming up with your
forecasting prediction and all that
however the way the world is moving
forward we will see that analytics would
begin or would take the center stage and
all of your business applications will
be built based on your analytical
capabilities so that you reap maximum
benefits no matter how many business
applications I have what if I cannot
analyze the data how good is that data
right hence look into your analytical
capabilities and build your business
applications so that your profits or
whatever results you have our multi food
what are the industries it's applicable
and we are coming to that in a while so
what is predictive analytics predictive
analytics is all about using your data
which you have the data which your
company generates as part of using
enterprise resource planning erp
applications or any of your company
applications which generates structured
data and also looking into the
unstructured data meaning the data which
is getting generated and Amazon reviews
on your social media Facebook Twitter
etc the images that you're uploading the
videos that you're uploading the signal
processing which is happening your GPS
system your wife eyes everything is
generating data however this data which
have spoken off littering is
unstructured data so predictive
analytics is all about taking structured
and unstructured data and also
semi-structured data and then use some
kind of statistical algorithms and
machine learning techniques this is
becoming the norm machine learning right
I believe at Eureka has a separate
course on machine learning decision tree
okay so using statistical algorithms and
machine learning techniques
you look into what is the probability
that a particular event might happen in
the future that is your predictive
analytics all about right you can use
this for looking into consumer behavior
who are the consumers who enter into my
store on every weekend but do not
purchase anything probably that's
important for me why are they coming are
they coming for window shopping or
shoplifting or what is your objective or
who is that cus consumer who comes once
in a month probably in the first week of
every month and does a purchase of worth
fifteen thousand rupees I want to
provide him special discount probably
then you have machine learning if you
think about Google car right driverless
Google car this particular mission has
started long back however it's still not
live the reason being it's still
learning that algorithm is learning on
what do i do if there is a left turn
what should be the radius of the
steering what should i do if there's a
pothole what do i do if pedestrians are
crossing the road across zebra crossing
what do i do if there's a red signal
right it learns your algorithm learns as
on how you progress right and this
google car is being exposed to variety
of routes in variety of traffic
situations right on highways on in lanes
with a lot of speed breakers toll gates
and all that so that the car learned
algorithm becomes so much so robust and
then it we can actually launch that
particular car in the market recognizing
the radius patterns if you upload your
image on Facebook not your image say
your image along with your friends a
group of friends the moment you upload
Facebook is going to quickly scan and
check those images with all of your
friend images and it's going to
automatically tag a mean against your
friends food that's called as
and much scoring visualization pretty
too so on and so forth right so let us
move on and try to understand what is a
life cycle of a predictive analytics
project basically so first come first
what is a preliminary step identify or
formulate the problem what is your
problem if you go wrong in this step no
matter how robust your application might
be how robust your predictive prediction
results might be how robust your
prediction model might be its of no use
right so you spend significant amount of
time in identifying what is the business
problem that you're trying to address as
part of your project then you prepare
your data here is where you spend a lot
of time cleansing your data rhyming your
data bringing your data from
semi-structured and unstructured to some
kind of a structure then you do ed a
exploratory data analysis elementary
analysis then you try to transform the
data I mean this is again advanced
concept on if data is not normal what do
you do and things like that then you
build a model based on your data type
right either you end up using some kind
of a regression technique logistic
regression or some kind of data mining
technique water would be once you build
the model you need to validate and check
what is accuracy of the model if you
feel that the model is very accurate or
if you feel that the model is satisfying
your business requirements then you
deploy it where is it deploy you are
going to use this prediction model to
predict your future whatever future your
prediction model is predicting you
should have some kind of confidence on
that hence you validate the model like
you into the accuracy of the model etc
and then finally whatever outcome your
model is going to give you you are going
to evaluate those results and monitor
those results on ongoing basis normally
in the current world you know I did not
see I mean maybe in the large
projects it might be prevalent however I
haven't seen a situation wherein there
will be a different business analyst a
different data miner or statistician a
different ID systems management guy and
a business manager right most often
they're not all these four roles are
performed by a data scientist that is a
kind of market which we are looking at
here we go so someone was asking on what
r the radius industries it's applicable
and it's applicable in a lot of
industries and here are few advantages
of using your predictive analytics one
is campaign management what does that
mean suppose you are promoting your
product or say you're sending a
particular email to a person did that
person even open the email or say you
have sent email two thousand folks out a
thousand people how many people have
actually seen your email and how many
people have acted on your email right
that's most important and how do you
effectively manage your campaign it
should not so happen that I send email
if it's an email campaign it should not
so happen that I send email to all
10,000 of my customers right if fear of
your customers see email every now and
then probably they'll spam it so we have
to be extremely cautious and careful on
how many emails are being said what kind
of emails what improves the efficiency
of the conversion right if you're you're
selling say samsung phone email
marketing campaign how many of them have
actually purchased so all that is
something which you can analyze even
before you send an email customer
acquisition how do you acquire the
various customers right you actually
gather all the data on what is the age
of a person gender income geographic
location married or not you collect all
this information and based on this based
on your historical data you actually say
that hey this person who is a male
who is 33 years age who is married who
has two kids whose income is so much
would most likely purchase a product
right so you come up you actually end up
using historical information and then
based on that historical information you
try to predict on who are those
customers who might most likely get
converted whom you can actually acquire
budgeting and forecasting forecasting on
whether there will be a rain or not
forecasting on whether there will be a
flood or not forecasting on how many 100
rupee note I have to mint how many 500
rupee note do I need to mint right
forecasting what will be the GDP of the
nation right what would be the inflation
what will be the interest rate so all
this is forecasting basically fraud
detection if I lend a loan if I give a
loan to a person will that person
default or not should I even approve the
loan in the first place the moment a
person applies for a loan should I even
approve alone or not right if you are
making a number of transactions using
your credit card we choose those
transactions it's fraudulent transaction
you actually get a call from the call
center right sometimes you you get a
call from the call center the moment you
swipe your credit card and are the and
they asked on whether that's a valid
transaction or not do they call you for
each and every transaction do they call
you only for the high-value transaction
no it is based on some algorithm where
you are swiping that car right for how
much amount at what time right based on
all these things this information is
received promotion say I've got an email
promoting Samson I've also seen that
particular advertisement on a newspaper
while I was reading the newspaper I had
my news channel on and there was an ad
on the TV which said iphone s6 edge
right and while I was trying to you know
board my flight I have seen an ad there
right and hence I've gone to a store and
purchased samsung s6 now which of your
promotions has actually triggered
go and purchase Samson was it the
newspaper ad was it the email ad was it
the television ad was it the other of
seen in airport which ad actually
triggered that's the most important
thing your analytics will help you
decide on which is that ad which has
fools this person to actually purchase
or was it combination of multiple ads
which has triggered the drive to go and
purchase Samsung s6 right pricing what
should be the price of apple iphone 6s
or 6s plus right why how much should i /
the prices of iphone 6 and 6 plus or by
how much should i / the price of iphone
5 just because i'm about to launch
iphone 6 plus if I / too much my old
customers would be upset if I do not /
the sales of my iphone 6 plus would not
agree what should that appropriate price
be right we're in the there will be a
right balance and that is all about
predictive analytics demand planning
think about your logistics company think
about fedex or whatever bit how many
stores do i need to have here in india
in which states how many do I need to
have right what is the pace at which
urbanization is enhancing urbanization
is happening what is the pace at which
people are ordering or parceling the
goods using fedex based on all these
things a new branch should be open it's
not open just because there are a lot of
people here know it looks into a number
of other parameters what kind of goods
are being ordered from which location
right what is your duty fee on that are
you really making profits or not by
delivering or by opening a new branch
right even before any open a new branch
of FedEx I'll analyze all these things
think about oil company oil and gas the
moment you rely land gas right no doubt
all that analysis would be done based on
your geologist and all that who's going
to tell you that hey real here so that I
get oil no doubt about that but your
predictive analytics will say how many
wells do you need to have right how deep
should you rill should you do a
horizontal rail or a vertical drill
right from there when you extract crude
oil how do i transport it back to the
factory should i transport using ship
sugar transport using road or how do I
actually transport what is that which is
going to help me get maximum benefits
alright abhishek as this question is
predictive analytics related to data
mining absolutely data mining is one
aspect of predictive analytics abhishek
and machine learning in the initial few
slides have discussed about machine
learning machine learning is nothing but
your data mining right so I think I've
answered on rocks question however there
are a few more slides are believed on
industries why predictive analytics
because let me give an example of target
how many of y'all know target target is
a big retail firm right in u.s. they
have lost approximately eight billion
dollars just because they have launched
a new store in Canada eight billion
dollars what if you could have done some
kind of predictive analytics and check
on whether the new store that you're
going to launch in Canada will make
profits or not what if you had done that
you would have save eight billion
dollars right hints you have to get or
each and every company will move towards
that soon eventually most of them have
done a few of them will do eventually so
need of Kumar has this question what are
the issues in predictive analytics for
big data so the main challenge is that
to bring your big data into a structured
format and another big data another
problem is that
which system or what should be the
computing speed of your machine to
manage the big data hence there is a
concept called as population and sample
wearing you just take a subset of the
big data and build your predictive model
on top of that your entire statistics is
based on this population sample concept
right so you should not really be
worried about how big that he dies you
should be worried about what are the
variety of places from where you're
getting the data right from big data
perspective look into the variety
wherein you get a video file an audio
file an image a text file and how to
analyze all that how to bring that to a
structured format that is where your
challenge likes once you bring it to a
structure format it's just click of a
button right I mean it's not going to
take a lot of time for you to build a
model so this is what your folks has to
see the top objective for between
two-thirds and three-quarters of
executors is develop the ability to
model and predict behaviors to the point
where individual decisions can be made
in real time tomorrow if you want to
invest in a real share market what
happens your mutual fund broker might
call you or your stockbroker might call
you and say hey sir can you please
purchase this share in the next 15
minutes before see that it's going to
increase by five percent or two percent
or whatever beat right so that's the
kind of behavior that we are looking at
the moment you enter a store I should be
able to track you based on your GP MCPS
system and then I I need to look into
your past behaving past purchasing
behavior and send you a coupon saying
that all right you are in my store now
there's a special ten percent discount
for you go fetch is your favorite denim
jeans real time as and how you cross say
you're going to office on a daily basis
right from point A to point B and online
you have searched 2d for mac mac book
pro for example apple macbook pro you
want a laptop
you have just done that search tomorrow
while you start from your home and on
the way to your office if there is any
store which is going to sell macbook
they're going to send you an SMS even
before you approach that store even if
before you cross that store they're
going to send you an SMS saying that hey
there is a store here which is going to
sell macbook pro right and it's 500
meters away from the place that you're
driving what else do I want to make my
life more easy there are a lot of
companies which have started you know
implementing predictive analytics and
they have reaped the benefits in a very
big way best buy right a live green RSC
it can be applied across all these
domains if you see trading what will be
the share market what should be the
share value at what price do I need to
sell at what price do I need to sorry
bye so on and so forth banking should
even provide a credit card should I
prove a credit card sure I approve alone
will that person default or not
ecommerce a person who purchases this
will also purchase something else right
how do i D set up on that dating based
on your behavior based on your a gender
the location that you're in your dating
websites are going to suggest you few
people with whom you can do so on and so
forth right so it's applied across these
industries the an issuer has this
question on what is the difference
between machine learning and statistical
algorithm your statistical algorithm
gana sure okay if others do not
understand the technical aspects forget
that statistical analysis means I try to
build some kind of a regression some
kind of a model which is based on
regression for example i can use linear
regression or logistic or poisson
regression or negative my normal our
binomial or we will or whatever betrayed
i do some kind of irrigation i will be
predicting until then however when it
comes to your machine learning
techniques take example of your gmail
the moment a meal comes to your inbox or
Mele comes to your gmail it gets
classified as as either span or it goes
and enters your inbox how is that
decided can I do a one-time activity on
that no it's an ongoing activity each
and every time a new email is received
and each and every time you mark a
specific email is spam right your
machine is learning your algorithm is
learning there suppose I get a travel
related email I select that and click on
mark as spam what happens the next time
any such email similar kind of email
automatically goes to my spam that is
called as teaching your algorithm your
algorithm learns or a period of time
however in statistical analysis you just
implement that however you improve the
model at a later point of time once you
collect sufficient data but it's not
real time here in machine learning it's
real time that's a difference ah the
remainder has this questions how much in
learning is changing data analytics and
why someone should use machine learning
instead of legacy data mining techniques
I do not understand the difference
between legacy data mining techniques
and that one's data mining techniques
data mining is a topic and the topics
are getting enhanced no doubt about that
so earlier it was neural networks then
came SVM alright sorry SVD and sorry SVM
my mat and now neural network is again
trying to you know come up with some
advanced techniques which would
supersede your SVM so on and so forth so
they're building upon each and every
topic so there's nothing called as
legacy whatever data mining techniques
which we are using as if now is advanced
only machine data mining is nothing but
machine learn that means within data
mining you have supervised and
unsupervised learning right and most
often than not we relate this term
machine learning to supervise data
mining techniques anurag has this
question is it related to CRM as well if
it's customer relationship management
in some extent to some extent years it
is related right not to a great extent
but to some extent it is related whether
all company using social media for
corrective anthis directly or they
collect data from social media to local
storage native Nero has this question
whether all company using social media
for Brickton electrically or they
collect the data so what happens you
know you can use a lot of connectors or
some kind of applications which are
going to link your social media to your
analytics tool yeah it's an ongoing
thing it in a few companies they
actually extract the data from the
social media and do the analysis and few
are the companies they directly
establish a relationship so there will
be some kind of intermediate tools which
will establish the link between the
social media and your tube which will
continuously dynamically keep doing the
analysis mayang has this question being
a dotted developer what are the
prerequisites to start learning
predictive analytics so since you are a
dotted developer I would say that you
have an additional edge in using
analytical tools which requires some
amount of coding however you need to
know statistics you need to know
forecasting you need to know data mining
techniques in order to you know do a
proper shift from being a dot net
developer to a data scientist so I'll
take a few of your questions in a while
let us first try to look into the three
scenarios where predictive analytics is
used the first scenario that we are
going to cover for today's call as turn
term means say today I'm using a tool
network tomorrow I might move to
Vodafone that's called as shown so today
I'm employee of company a tomorrow I
might quit the company and move to
Company B that's called as churn
accretion basically right when your
customers reduce their usage or complete
stop using your products or services
what's happening they are leaving your
brand and might be shopping with your
competitor this is one indication right
there's a customer who is not using the
internet there is no use it since one
month or so or there's a person who used
to always purchase levi's jeans right
once in a quarter also now he stop
purchasing these are all the indications
for you would say that customer is
moving on is trying to go to a different
provider competitor right and the cost
of acquiring a new customer is extremely
high right so let us first understand
this most important reasons for doing
churn analysis first one is reduce
marketing costs I don't want to send you
promotional email to acquire new
customers at the expense of losing my ex
existing customers the cost of retaining
my existing customer is very very low
way low in comparison to acquiring a new
customer the more that I'm going to
spend on marketing for acquiring a new
customer is extremely high in comparison
to satisfying my existing customers so
that's one reason on why churn analysis
is so much so important you reduce churn
through predictive models if your
predictive model says hey this person a
my cleaver company he might resign in
the next three months or in the next two
months if a person actually sends her
resignation email and then if you sit
with him and try to convince it might
not be fruitful however even before he
resigns before he sends a resignation
teaming if you go have a chat disqus and
try to satisfy the requires probably
chances are high that you might retain
him or her segment market into a light
clusters as per their profits you can do
some kind of clustering say this is your
entire customer base you can say that
hey out of so much of customer base
these are the top profit-making
customers so probably I do not want to
lose them at any cost I will churn
analysis only for these
customers rest of the customers are less
profit-making soiled I probably not want
to do any kind of what you call churn
analysis right so you can do all these
kind of things right understand
customers and their behaviors right only
and only if you understand the customers
and the behaviors you'll be able to
arrest the churn and you know for a fact
that each customer who is gone means
profit is gone for you each customer
that you lose along with him you lose
some dollars so you're losing your
profitability cause of acquiring new
customer is much higher than retaining
existing customers this is the most
important you have to convince the new
customers but if you have an existing
customer you need what convince to such
an extent if you just send an
appropriate offer probably he'll stick
with you and not just losing that
customer right you don't just lose a
lose an existing customer you also lose
the reference along with those customs
this customer if he was with you
probably he would have referred your
product to 10 other customers so you did
not actually lose one you have lost 10
customers in that sense churn analysis
is extremely important why do you want
to predict churn because otherwise your
profits would shrink because your number
of customers would shrink and your
social media sentiment people who are
dissatisfied with your product nowadays
are going to spread word like wildfire
they're going to post about your product
whatever is wrong in the social media
left right and center that's only going
to harm you it's going to shrink your
profits once again it's going to
increase the computer market share it's
even more dangerous if people stop
purchasing iPhone and start purchasing
Samsung to a great extent then what's
happening compt you're killing Apple
right customer service requests are
going to increase so these
are all the radius reasons why it makes
sense for us to predict the churn and
you know customer retention you want
reading the customer cross and upsell
means people who purchase iphone
probably want to purchase iPad you can
sell them iPad people who purchase iPad
probably you can sell macbook pro so on
and so forth you'll be able to predict
their behavior and when a person might
want to leave so on and so forth so
these are all a bunch of advantages that
you have if you predict your churn cost
to acquire a new customer is five times
higher than retaining the existing
customer and remember your top 30 of the
existing customers comprise 500 to one
fifty percent of your profitability so
what if customers are leaving from this
top 30% it's even more dangerous and we
know for a fact that ten percent to ten
plus ten to twenty percent churn
annually is a norm in industry right
given the kind of competition that we
are seen and if you have a higher churn
rate it's going to impact your growth
and if you feel that let my customers go
i'm going to acquire the new customers
it's wrong strategy you are not going to
survive as a business if that happens
and this is your churn prediction
landscape so what we can do about it
first thing is identify who are the
customers who are churning evaluate and
try to find out what is the churn rate
measure your financial loss and monitor
how is it training how is your turn rate
whether it's increasing or decreasing or
staying constant or whatever be so what
you have to do is you have to come up
with the churn likelihood and
probability matrix I'll not be doing a
deep dive into these things right we'll
do a deep dive in the next case study
given the time right what does very less
amount of time left so
the churn rate was so much in jan right
and then you try to do some kind of
analysis and probably a churn might be
stabilized after a few days or after a
few months that is what this entire
churn likelihood and probability matrix
it's rather than spend time here let us
actually spend time on the real key
study that I have in interest of time
and that is sentiment analysis right
what is sentiment analysis a person
might speak about my product on
different forums what if a person ops
amazon reviews amazon reviews are by the
way extremely active forums so if a
person goes to amazon reviews and starts
writing few review comments about my
product and what if that turns out to be
a negative review i need to be in a
situation to act upon that if a person
is writing something positive then also
i need to analyze because i need to know
what is my strength what are the
features that i need to retain in my
next release see there is iphone 6 and I
flies come up with iphone 6s right so
Apple might have done this analysis on
what are the features which people are
extremely happy about in iphone 6s they
want to retain those features and what
are those features which customers are
unhappy about about iphone 6 i want to
get rid of those features in iphone 6s
probably right in those kind of places
the sentiment analysis makes a lot of
sense so let me show you one such small
example suppose you go to Amazon right
and you want to look into the Amazon
xbox reviews it will be in this format i
have do i have captured only a few of
those you'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
