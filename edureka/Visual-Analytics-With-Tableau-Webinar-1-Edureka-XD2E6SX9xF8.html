data visualization to which was placed
in the leaders quadrant for the third
straight time there's a third time that
tableau is appearing in Gartner's Magic
Quadrant and when it comes to the
ability to execute they are at number
one position there this is one reason
why tableau is fast gaining its ground
as debased analytical tool also can I
use tableau for analytical purposes also
can I do some kind of analysis on that
because data scientist is the sexiest
job now oh yes you can do that as well
so here we go
I'll display that for Prasanna in a
while so here is a presentation right
visual analytics with tableau first I'm
going to run through this entire session
and then I'm going to take your
questions because we have lost some time
right all right here we go these are the
new features of tableau 9 you can
directly connect with a few of the
statistical packages you can directly
connect with SAS packages right you can
directly connect with SPSS packages and
then R which is the buzzword in data
scientists or the world of business
analytics you can directly connect to
our data files as well here is a new
thing right you really connect with the
statistical packages do a better
visualization because we know a picture
speaks a thousand words right so you can
directly connect to all these things how
let me display that in table 9 for you
all so here is tableau 9 this is the new
interface of tableau 9 if I click on
that their nightly I have an option
which says statistical file all I need
to do is click on that job here you can
select the files of your choice you can
select the size find there or you can
select IBM SPSS or you can select an R
file so these are the advantages so each
and every advantage which I'm going to
speak right is going to help you
understand so each and every new feature
that I'm going to speak about now will
help you understand on why tableau is
better in comparison to the other data
visualization tools or VI tools such as
power bi Pentaho right or MicroStrategy
do you have this kind of or interface
where you can quickly drag and drop and
do the visualization of your charts I
don't think so so this is one good
advantage of tableau 9 wherein you can
connect to all the statistical packages
right when I say all these three and
quickly go about coming up with your own
visualizations that is a slide all about
another thing splitting the data is
extremely easy now for example say you
have a customer name you'll be having
the first name and the last name of the
customer how do I split that can I do it
on a click of a button right not sure
about the other visualization tools now
you guys tell me if you all are working
on different other visualization tools
or BI tools you tell me whether these
kind of options are available or not so
let me quickly open a new sheet there oh
let me delete these because I've just
done that all right here is a customer
lien let me drag and drop it to the rows
here so here are the names of the
customers which has the first name and
the last name each and every customer
has the first name and the last name hey
if I want only the first name is there
an easy way I'm not saying there is no
other way right in ways other tools
there might be real but is there such an
easy way when I right click go to
transform and split
jatta it automatically split into the
first name here is the first name
dimension right and if I wish to see the
last name I can do that just right click
on that I wish to rename that this is
customer first name and this is your
customer last name there my job done
alright let us look into few more
features this is how we have transformed
the data we have flipped the data
editing the data doing all your P vote
or doing the modification right is
extremely easy in tableau 9 now this is
the new interface of tableau 9 right for
those of you who are knife to tableau
who wants to you know quickly know the
basics of tableau and things like that
here we have the features few of the
features let me show you that sorry if
you click on this new icon which is new
to tableau 9 right this tableau icon
there if you click on that you'll go to
the home page and here the moment you
enter tableau you quickly get to see few
of the getting started read here's
connecting to the data all the basic
stuff is available here the basics not
the advanced ones right in various table
being used currently the Singapore
private properties market that is where
tableau is being used and this is the
visualization of the week you get access
to all the latest blocks right we're in
new features about tableau this cased
right errors or if you are finding it
difficult to find few of the navigations
few of the visualizations right you can
always drop into the blog look into the
forums and help each other right if at
all
there is any conference those details
are available here so if you have a
conference coming up in a location close
to you you can always go out in that for
new insights I'm not looking to your
questions now I'll just complete this
and then I'll probably take your
questions right so here is another new
thing right in tableau 8 you might ask
me hey is this and similar to tableau 8
series let me go to tableau 8
this is tableau 8 by the way right if I
wish to click on a database connect to a
database right I need to click on that
here how weird is is that I need to
scroll and check whether a database of
my choice exists here or not and one
good thing is that you can connect a
blue to all your big data database is
more or less cloud era right harden
works Google Analytics book Google
bigquery right Amazon rich if I Amazon
EMR right math our Hadoop hive all your
big data tools you can easily connect
there and start analyzing right but this
is tableau 8 series right if I look into
version 9 there if I wish to connect to
the servers the frequently connected
service up here here they say was which
you connect most frequently and here I
click on that I click I search a
database of my choice there and quickly
connect there rather than scroll and see
which file I need to connect and things
like that if you want to connect a few
other databases there you can do so
right do you want to connect to excel
files or ms access databases or VCO data
samples if you wish to connect to few
other databases there here are the list
of or extensions of various databases
you can connect to all these sources one
which realisations tool you can connect
to all of these databases how cool is
that
this is one more feature of tableau nine
and one quick thing which I want to show
which is amazing feature by the way
right whenever you cover your tooltip
right in 8 version I'll be alive for 8
seconds and then it disappears but in
tableau 9 it's real-time super fast
super responsive let me show you that
ah you can click on home to go here or
you can connect to any of the sample
databases there that is how it's going
to open up but I'm going to limit here
so let us put some details there and try
to hover the mouse and see how it's
going to work there
let me put GDP right and let us put the
region there in columns right now if I
hover my mouse right it's going to take
split second for the pop-up to come
right that is called as a tooltip it
takes a split second for me to get those
details they're split second and if I
wish to hover across C afraid seconds it
has disappeared there and if I want that
it's taking a split second it's a split
second let me do the same thing in your
tableau here there's already a sheet
which I have created look at that do you
see the split second there and see how
slowly I'm holding my mouse look at how
slowly I'm hovering my mouse real time
real time there is no lag absolutely
right isn't that a cool feature and that
is going to appear as long as you keep
your mouse pointer there how many are
seconds you keep right so look at that
right it's super fun
cannot be more responsive than this yep
so these are a few of the features not
just that I wish to show you two more
quick things right you can play a lot of
animations on this and tell your own
stories while you do the animation here
for example let me open tableau 9 there
let me connect your dearest data source
let me connect to the world indicators
these are the sample data sources right
you can connect to that and start
navigating your path so I've connected
the world indicators there at any given
point of time you can have multiple data
sources there right so I have opened the
world indicators let me open a new
worksheet I just click on this and your
sheet has opened up now now let me drag
and drop life expectancy of me to the
rows let me drag and drop health
expenditure per capita on to your column
shelf there from your measures you see
only one point there if I want to
disaggregate that just need to go to
analysis click on are great measures I
get all these data points to here right
if I want to reduce the size of that
click on the size and reduce it job done
I reduced it drastically right or if I
want to increase that yeah there I go
it's all on me right on how to quickly
reduce the size or increase the size and
things like that now let me drag and
drop the region into the colors shelf
here you see different circles
representing different regions there now
let me drag and drop eruption from your
dimension on your pages there here we go
right now I can play a beautiful
animation and also in the background I
can you know give a story for example I
click on that look at the movement you
know the health of male in Europe is
increasing drastically right
if I if I go back there I can reduce the
speed also I can make it very slow and
start playing that look at that look at
that already America's meal health
expenditure per capita is on the peak on
the rise right and it's slowly moving
there slowly moving European region is
and let me stop there look at this data
point there in here 2006 the life
expectancy of meal in Middle East region
has increased drastically what happened
in 2006 what was so special probably you
can explore arm that and you know tell a
story while this visualization or
animation is in progress yep look at
that in 2007 round so it was seemed then
it has drastically dropped in 2008 why
what was it the reason because of
recession or what was a reason and if
you see Europe has you know in 2011
European region had highest health
expenditure per capita when in you know
life expectancy of male is not
increasing greatly in African region
right so you can make all these stories
right and then represent your beautiful
animation you can put in the slideshow
just play that tell your story and walk
off right this is another good thing
that you can do another last thing that
I want to show you
even before I take the questions he's
you know can you do analytics on this
can you do analytics because data
analytics building the prediction models
is a big thing nowadays right so can I
build a prediction model even before I
proceed right let me show you quickly
I'll take your questions later just one
minute
right how do you build your prediction
models any prediction model anything
that you want to predict probably the
seals in the next quarter if you want to
predict now or maybe you want to predict
your fraudulent data fraud transactions
who is going to default on the loan who
is going to fall sick all those things
can be predicted and you represent that
as Y right Y is the output and you also
have various inputs right so probably
you know you want to measure the weight
gain of a person weight in weight gain
is dependent on what calories consumed
gender age and all that using that you
can build your prediction models if I
provide calories consumed age and gender
of people it can predict and tell me
what will be the calories gain that is a
simple prediction right but you need to
do a lot of statistics around that a lot
of regression and all that how can I do
it in simple way in tableau let me show
you because one of the unique selling
propositions of tableau ease analytics
right it does a lot of analytics and you
have a new tab there call it analytics
right so instead let us do this first
let me connect to a new data store which
is sample superstore I have connected to
this data set now right all we need to
do is drag sales to the columns shelf
there drag
our drag profit to your Rochelle's there
you see this aggregated symbol there but
if all that is aggregated when I say
aggregated it is added up together and
you see only one point there if you want
to see all the different data points
then I just uncheck that so this is a
scatter plot right this is a scatter
plot what is a scatter plot see hey for
most in for most of the data points as
your sales increase your profits also
increase however there are a few weird
cases wherein as your sales increase
your profits are dipping decreasing
that's weird right it should happen the
other way around so we have done that
what else can we do in tableau this is a
scatter diagram to show the relationship
between two continuous variables just
right click on that go to trend lines
say sure trend lines
hey here it's showing the trend line but
what does that trend line show if I
hover my mouse right you see this
equation now if someone is going to tell
me that hey your sales are $12,000 I
simply replace those $12,000 in this
equation and it says profit is equal to
0.18 double 0 6 7 multiplied by the
12,000 sales and I subtract it from 12
point 7 3 to 9 this is called as a
regression equation and you see the
p-value their probability value if it is
less than 0.05 you see that this
equation is good for me do you want to
do a deep dive on this statistics right
click go to trend lines click on
describe trend line here you go you have
just seen an equation right what was the
equation all about
profit is equal to 0.18 double 0 6 7
times of your sales so 0.18 double 0 6 7
times of your seals multiplied by your
seals that is and you add or subtract
this value intercept there you add this
value minus 12 point 7 3 to 9 right
simply you can predict now your profit
how many clicks did it take you to
actually build a prediction model 5
clicks not more than that
and what is the amount of code that you
need to write in any other statistical
tool
oh my god you need to write lee crazy
right so let me show you our for example
right you need to write all these things
if I want to do a prediction model I run
this command or run this command or run
this command I run this command or run
this command or run this command or run
this command or run this and then I look
into the summary of the model right and
then I look into the summary of the
model of course there are various other
things which I'm trying to do so you get
that equation right here it's a
different data set instead how cool is
this just drag and drop I need not know
any code whatsoever and I can do all the
job here so Raina middle name is also
clot as a different split if you have
three names right first name last name
and middle name through your split
differently they're a garnish
do you want me to do the split once
again there do you want me to show you
that alright let me show you I'm not
sure whether you've seen that or not
let me need that let me need need that
right let me add a new thing if you drag
and drop the customer name right I have
the first him in the last name here
right Renu had a question what if there
was a middle name alright just right he
can split you're going to get the middle
name also split there create it to there
it's going to create three splits this
is the first name split right and if you
want to look into the last name there
you pick that when I click off a button
you're getting your job done here that's
the beauty of this iron will you be able
to share this light at the end of the
session only you need to check with a
Eureka folks probably they'll be able to
very firm that establish Riku null table
is not free it comes for a license right
and the license cost is I think $2,000
there just click on buy when you go to
the tableau website right you'll see the
license cost I'm using the professional
Edition which is nineteen ninety nine
dollars per user right per year and if
you want a personal Edition it costs you
999 dollars tableau online is for five
hundred dollars right and if you are a
student if you are a student if by any
chance then you can probably get this
student pricing which comes for a low
cost I think it's alright so that's a
pricing part I'm taking the questions
one by one extract option explain now
Pallavi what extract option so if you
want to view the data right not sure
what you're asking about if you right
click on that you can view the data
right you can use the data of that
particular thing you can look into the
complete underlying data and you can
export everything there so if that was
your question - here is a simple answer
next thing is how different is ARF with
tableau is a question from my uncle my
uncle R is extremely different to
tableau tableau is more into
visualization and it is all fleet coming
up with all kinds of analytics also
within that for example this analytics
option here it gives you median with
quartiles box plot right trend lines
forecasting you can come up with a
distribution band you can look into the
average with 95% confidence interval and
all these things right but R is
extremely advanced when it comes to
analytics when it comes to analytics
data scientist kind of a job right R is
extremely advanced but tableau its
unique selling proposition is
visualization you can come up with some
beautiful visualizations using tableau
right are also can do visual ization but
it won't be as beautiful as
visualizations in tableau how to ID
filter option to extract yeah I think
I've shown you that probably right that
option is also there you just go there
you go to online option there right and
you can drop down and do all that and if
you want to do kind of analysis that
you're asking right you need to go to
the particular data source then you can
do all that right whatever you want to
do you can do so you can split the data
right you can do P word also by
selecting the multiple fields there
right all those options are available
right but you cannot you know don't
assume that it is as good as your
no it can't be that easy right and then
can Table nine be installed on a Mac
absolutely Kunal way it works on Mac
also for developing the tableau which
languages are used
Pallavi there is no such language right
but if you know sequel and things like
that it's easy for you for example see
here I have clicked on a profit ratio
right I've created a calculated field
how do I know that it is a calculated
field there will be a small equal to
sign before the measure there so right
click on that click on edit right and
here we go oh wait thank you all right
here it is so you can write these kind
of small functions there and get the job
done if you want to look into the bunch
of functions which are available here
they are right
so it's as simple as that so you need
not know any programming language
specifically to work on tableau how it
works internally I mean getting input -
showing output there now that's a bigger
architecture Pallavi by the way tableau
has a bigger architecture it as a server
client architecture we are working on
the client right and it has its own
architecture which is you know part of
the Advanced Course Sao Paulo he has
another question how it works internally
I mean getting input is showing output
there all right that is a bigger thing
in the designing any graph for example
as you show scattered graph how many
axes are used as x y&amp;amp;z like this no it's
only X and y axis because if you are
plotting a scatter plot right scatter
diagram the basic logic is that you do
it for only two variables x and y
because always it's based on the
prediction equation which I have to
write prediction whatever output you
want to predict is equal to function of
inputs
so it's not that you're representing on
a three-dimensional scale 3d no you're
not representing in a three-dimensional
you are representing only the output and
their input their scenes profit in our
case profit was your output which you
wanted to predict based on the scenes
right sales is the input so that is why
you do it only using two axis X and
y-axis all right let me take the next
question
Rakesh has a question the p-value that
is being considered
has it been said it no it is set at 95%
confidence interval Rakesh Arun has a
question the trend line functionality
and the description of the model is
something that is available in previous
versions of tableau right oh yes it is
available around I'm just saying that
tableau also has these features I just
wanted to show that for people who are
new to tableau Arun what is the scope of
job opportunity and future with respect
to tableau the way we see it tableau is
enhancing and venturing in a big way
into analytic space also and you know I
was finding it a little difficult to get
you guys the tool is right top 10 tools
in data analytics there's a good article
which was published off late not sure if
this is that let us see non this one
right so there is one good article which
was published which was seeing that 2015
by the way let us see whether or
predictive analytics 2015 tools
there's one last right if it's not there
it's not there all right so what it was
showing is I'll just explain you quickly
there it was saying that that article
was saying that dual R has 46 percent of
the market share in 2015 right and SAS
SAS which most people think that is the
market leader and things like that no it
has only 11 percent of the market share
as of 2015
why is that so there are 2 million users
accessing our right and this is all
analytical tools within this tableau has
found its position no doubt that when it
comes to visualization tools tableau is
number one in data visualization or bi
right business intelligence tableau is
number one undisputably it's number one
right however it has also found its
place in the top 10 analytical tools
that's a good part right so very soon
probably I am assuming right tableau
will be a one-stop solution for a
visualization as well as analytics both
can be done at one go that is a way
tableau visionaries are looking at right
so Janish horses yes what is the scope
of job opportunity there are plenty my
dear friend Samuel Wright thus tableau
has any limitations while working with
data cubes no - sure I have not
personally seen any you know limitations
and such it's very fast in it's good at
dealing with your big data also what is
the ideal configuration of the system
should be for performance of this while
dealing with large data sets I normally
have 16gb ROM rakesh and it works well
even with the big data sets
Johnny sure
please explain the prediction again all
right let me quickly show you that so
what did we do well let me open a new
sheet there what did we do we have rag
dar profit whatever profits or what is
the output which you want to predict
should be on your y-axis which it should
be on your rose there whatever inputs
you're providing for your prediction
should be on the columns there and you
have one data point here tableau by
default creates a blue circle right and
it's aggregated good analysis and
aggregate the measures you see that
right it's a scatter diagram now
right-click on that good trend analysis
and show trend lines and if I hover my
mouse in that it is giving me the
prediction equation if I if someone
gives me the sales value from here on I
will be able to quickly predict the
profit value that is the equation right
so all right I want that how to use in
Linux environment it's limited as of now
right Linux environment you can use it
in Mac I look can we right use a
different statistical functions code in
tableau right that is why you know you
can input your our files also into this
Prasanna yes can you show the regression
again please it's not very clear Kunal
I've shown you shown this again for you
out how we stab with more beneficial
then click for you other than less
coding in wall
I have not do a great extent work on
click for you now you see me
Jenny party you see me right you know
I've shown you the bunch of
visualizations and all that right but
click view in tableau considers close
competitors to but still tableau when it
comes to analytics right
I do not think you can do all this
analytics and QlikView so that is where
tableau has an additional edge right you
have the data you should a visualization
you also can show some analysis right
predictive analysis you know the
examples for predictive analytics for
example right you go swipe your credit
card you keep swiping your credit card
but once a while you receive a call from
the call center which says here mr.
Kunal have you just made a purchase for
twenty five thousand dollars right or
fifty thousand rupees they would call
once a while right each time then I'm
going to call you but they'll call you
once a while when do they call you when
the feel that you have swipe your card
in an unknown entity somewhere and this
is the first time you are spending such
a huge amount probably right so how do
people come to know that that might be a
fraudulent transaction
how does call center come to know about
that based on predictive analytics
they're predicting that something might
go wrong right how different is our with
tableau Mike I have shown that right R
is completely into analytics tableau is
into data visualization however our also
has data visualization right but it's
not as robust as tableau tableau also
has analytics but it's minimal at this
point of time but yes rather than just
doing your visualization you can do some
amount of analytics also using tableau
oh I'm a repeating on this question
giving repeating can you please connect
hour to hour and showcase a small demo
for instance can you please compute the
correlation coefficient of two variables
in tableau using our hey that's gonna
take some time around it's not going to
you know happen just like that we have a
special three hour session three hour
session which happens you know working
on connecting tableau with our computing
a
whatever statistics that you want right
correlation coefficient is just one of
those is it possible to perform advanced
analytics using tableau and no it's
limited at this point of time Rakesh or
no regression I've shown you recognition
I've shown you right and let me show you
one more thing here right if you're keen
on knowing that edit current lines there
you can do a logarithmic model you can
do an exponential model or you can do a
polynomial with a number of degrees of
your choice right you can show the
confidence bands there you can force
y-intercept to zero you can do all that
you can do all that right it's not just
linear regression there you can do
various other things also all right as
of now these are the four things which
are available in tableau so since you're
asking more about analytics I'm just
telling you but it's not extremely
advanced right decision trees and all
you cannot do Rakesh no that's the data
mining concept which you know probably
are is a good bet or wake up if tableau
is coming with analytics option then is
it possible with it no no no it cannot
be a replacement because as of now there
are two million people working on R and
enhancing there are right two million
people enhancing it how many people do
you think are there in tableau in R&amp;amp;D
division there might be very few you
know these two are different entities
tableau look into that from more of a
visualization perspective but yes it has
a capabilities for analytics also are
looking to that from a completely
analytics tool perspective but it also
has data visualization you know
options are available there but ask
whose data visualization is supercooling
tableau can we regionalize data from
hadoop in brief can we connect Aruba oh
yes absolutely
Gaussian we can do that
we have that right let me show you click
on that go to more service type huddle
there look at the kind of integration it
I'm sorry
how do cloud era Hardin works map are
there you go this is the answer you can
connect to a roof process data and then
do all the visualization there pallavi I
think I cannot do that right with QL
it's out of school sorry
offline I can take that below me for you
any good tutorial online help to gain
expertise in tabla and at the same time
gain experience hands-on experience
right are in it to get started right you
can click on this tableau home icon
there and probably you know go through
that but these are not advanced topics
right right now just to get started
these are good but if you want advanced
program right here at Eureka has one for
you yeah look I've just shown you those
options right click on more servers
there here is high right sorry hardened
work hard up high and then you have map
our hive Apollo 8 dual axis graphs can
be done amazing graphs can be done dual
axis brats yeah we can do that can we
have three-dimensional view also
alright let me tell you this my young
cried there are a lot of data
visualization concepts which people
should be aware of right for example
showing a three-dimensional graph on a
two-dimensional picture is not a good
option why why is that not a good option
let me see whether I have one to show
you guys or not mine just looking to
this I'm trying to put a 3d graph three
dimensional graph out
dumansky what is wrong here and if we
represent the same thing in the line
graph am I the one which is appearing
here on the right side appears oh here
it's showing me that everything is
increasing however here it's showing the
day there is a dip there your 3d graphs
are going to lie a lot
so you should be aware of those kind of
concepts right and any good
visualization tool will take into
account all these things we do not want
fancy-looking graphs we want good grass
which is going to explain story why are
we visualize in the first place because
for me to read the entire table for
example let me connect to this right and
I think it's getting updated sorry so
say I'll put sales there you know let me
breathe there and subcategory there so
instead of reading all these numbers
right it's extremely difficult there for
me to go through each and every number
remember here which number or which
particular subcategory which segment has
the highest sales instead of the
simplest or I can do this right the
number which is the darkest is having
the highest fields the number which is
the lowest is having the least things
lightest is having the least isn't this
good right this is extremely good right
so that is visualization all about
explaining your story in you know
condensed format will it be easier for a
person who has hands-on SQL query
capabilities any good block resources to
learn tableau for beginners so you have
tableau official guide you can go
through that sagar
but tableau official guide for mine
would be released in October not now
yes absolutely if you have sequel query
c'mon it's good for you on the client
movement right I do not have any access
to the server here whatever work I do on
the client right I can install on the
server
that's the server client architecture
that's a different concept and an
advanced concepts by the way and that is
part of your ad rocket program how is it
compared to pyramid analytics I have
seen pyramid analytics has advanced
visualizations and tableau as I've told
you moment creating advanced
visualizations versus being in line with
the visualization concepts that's the
most important thing at tableau you know
looks into this advanced visualization
concepts and ensures that the common
pitfalls are not or are not repeated so
probably in that terms I would say
tableau is better than pyramid analytics
maybe maybe I'm not debating on that
because I do not have complete exposure
on pyramid analytics but tableau I would
say that you know they have good
visualizations which do not default on
your data visualization concepts basic
concepts for example using a pie chart
wherever you have more than three
categories is a wrong thing is a wrong
thing pie chart people are so you know
close to the pie chart concept right but
if you are displaying this to a client
or a board of group of my mother board
of directors right if they know you in
basics of data visualization they would
say that hey why did you stab a pie
chart there and aakriti see is a word
and quickly for CRM is tableau so used
for making dashboards absolutely right
here is option there for creating your
dashboards you can drag the drag and
drop everything to you know
place of your choice put that yes
absolutely awkward you do all that and
I'll take sibility the only difference
for click for you yeah quickly went a
blur more or less competing with each
other so they'll be bringing in all
those concepts from a garnish where I've
done that if I know sequel excellent
SPSS is easy for me to start working
with table absolutely awkward tea it's
very easy for you
can you explain level of detail feature
to sharp I'm afraid that's a different
concept once again you need to always
start at a high level view and then
start drawing it down so let me let me
try to do that see let me try to do that
for you because you haven't asked that
let me drop sales there and I'm sorry
and let me put ear day there sorry not
all the date you did there right there
will be plus sign here in tablets
extremely easy if I click on that I go
and see the quarrels if I click on the
plus sign I can see the months if I
click on that I can go to the DS so that
is how simple it is right that is our
simple eighties so there you go if you
see if your workbook then where it goes
yeah files and specific extension if I
save as right I can save it as a tableau
workbook there or I can save it as a
tableau package will package what what
means all these things everything
together that here are the extensions
can we have three-dimensional view also
my uncle you can try
all that we can do that by doing some
you know changes but on the face of it
you cannot get it right but you can
modify and create your own 3d view also
mom what any answers to my questions I
think I've answered normal if not please
ask me
so he's multiple linear regression not
possible in tablet to develop a complete
model no accurate it's not possible can
connect opens his heart as well I mean
Apache Hadoop yes
Kunal it can can you please throw some
light on when is the tableau and our
integration session happening much
interested in that aren't probably you
need to check with that Eureka team on
that yeah but in the the India Coast
module they have the stab learner
integration section also you can no way
see what's happening with one of the
dimensions it can confusing what you
don't know I didn't get that question
cannot sorry will you be taking any
sessions on tableau in future you need
to check with a gyrator Ram ROM ROM not
can SAS be complete with tableau SAS has
its own visualization to yes you can
compare that with tableau but SAS is
into various other things not
specialized only in data visualization
right but at this point of time still
tableau is a leader right it's not sad
it's as more more into analytics front
he's visual analytics and tableau
different the things which we have seen
has us now is all visual analytics right
but if you're looking into visual
analytics Percy it is also inclusive of
Rama
it is also inclusive of your video
analytics image processing that's a
different topic deep learning basically
right you need to know that in which
fields tableau is more used which fields
meaning which industries and sectors in
domains Pallavi
is that your question but no if you see
the bunch of companies which are using
tableau you'll be surprised to see that
almost all the sectors and
industries are using tableau for the
visualization because it's very easy
right drag and drop what I've seen in
tableau is more of a dragon drop and
changing some properties and less of
Cody so does that mean business users
can also use and do analysis as pretty
choice and requirement without idea
moment they can do so if they are well
was in your writing some kind of small
code sequel queries and things like that
how do we deploy it on the server to
server for accessing into another web
site so what you can do is of course
there has to be a server license there
and you have to provide the server
details in this client and then once
you're done you can publish onto the
server all those options are there here
you have server write write whatever you
want to publish your workbook you can
publish there and it goes to your server
but if people who do not have server
they can just use tableau public right
or they can use tableau reader to read
those finds ooh that's a good part one
of the best features tableau has is
compared to EXO I know is excellent in
Excel but what is different but between
excellent handle how do you put that
it's more or less the same but one
difference that I if you ask me right
Excel doesn't handle your big data Excel
doesn't handle your big data tableau
does that that's a basic difference
right why do why are people getting into
tableau why are people getting into
Hadoop and things like that because of
the advent of big data the traditions
tools are unable to handle such huge
volumes of data that's a basic your
friends is to see is right sucker what
is that SSE for showing graph with
language which language is used or for
visualization
hey table has its own you know a
different code and things like that in
the back and if you want to get into the
back in and look into the development of
tableau and all that yeah I mean just
interested to know whether SSA is can we
complete the tableau yeah all these are
accompanied your sagar you can compare
all that I'm not discounting on anything
right all the tools have their own you
know benefits and you know pros and cons
but you need to look into what is a
market leader now what is going to give
you a better job now which tool do you
need to learn to ensure that you also
are a visionary for example right do not
look into the short-term benefits look
into the long-term benefits look into
all these tools
what are these companies doing how are
they enhancing what are the new features
that they're trying to bring in are they
in line with the market trend right
there are thousands of tools you can
learn all those right no doubt about
that
but are they investing in your research
and development in trying to come up
with some kind of analytics because
nowadays the buzzword is data analytics
right maybe that's a question that you
need to ask actually slower - all right
yeah how about data cleansing their
preparation building models using no
Shantha unit you can do all that you
need to do cleansing data preparation
beforehand and then load it into tableau
and then look into your models or things
like that can you show the first slide
when you what is the first layer Amma
are you speaking about the what you call
godness Magic Quadrant is that what
you're asking
all right MoMA does a question right can
we create record level reports you can
do some MoMA
can we schedule - what's to deliver on
schedule here you can do
livestreaming moment you can do all that
life streaming ensure that the live
dashboards go yeah they're happening as
we speak right in Twitter there are
thousands of people tweeting right if
there's tweeting about a specific topic
I want that information through good to
go through how do have some data
cleansing done then come back to table
and display you some beautiful
visualizations to the client or not
ongoing basis yes you can do that
streaming right you can do that I'm not
alright let me show you that or I'm not
want to see this yes from is this what
you wanted to see right in here is
tableau in ability of executed complete
and salvation that is godness Magic
Quadrant
I'm trying to compare with other
competitors someone was saying click for
you were actual few is here behind
tableau both in terms of completeness of
vision and ability to execute there SAS
probably they are good at your vision
vision is what we have to achieve in the
future but when it comes the ability to
execute right tableau is there all right
friends I think we have spent sufficient
time and you know having a good
discussion around tableau and its
advantages and disadvantages right if
you do not have any questions we can
probably call it a day thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
