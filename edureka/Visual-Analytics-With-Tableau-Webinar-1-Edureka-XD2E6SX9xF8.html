data visualization to which was placed
in the leaders quadrant for the third
straight time there's a third time that
tableau is appearing in gartner's magic
quadrant and when it comes to the
ability to execute they are at number
one position there this is one reason
why tableau is fast gaining its ground
as debased analytical tool also can i
use tableau for analytical purposes also
can i do some kind of analysis on that
because data scientist is the sexiest
job now oh yes you can do that as well
so here we go I'll display that for
prasanna in a while so here is a
presentation right visual analytics with
tableau first I'm going to run to this
entire session and then I'm going to
take your questions because we have lost
some time right all right here we go
these are the new features of tableau 9
you can directly connect with a few of
the statistical packages you can
directly connect with SAS packages right
you can directly connect with spss
packages and then r which is the
buzzword in data scientists or the world
of business analytics you can directly
connect to our data files as well here
is a new thing right you really connect
with the statistical packages do a
better visualization because we know
picture speaks a thousand words right so
you can directly connect to all these
things how let me display that in
tableau 9 for you all so here is tableau
9 this is the new interface of tableau
nine if I click on that their nightly I
have an option which says statistical
file all I need to do is click on that
jump here you can
select the files of your choice you can
select the size find there or you can
select IBM SPSS or you can select an r5
so these are that one cages so each and
every advantage which I'm going to speak
right is going to help you understand so
each and every new feature that I'm
going to speak about now will help you
understand on why tableau is better in
comparison to the other data
visualization tools or VI tools such as
power bi pentaho right or MicroStrategy
do you have this kind of all interface
where you can quickly drag and drop and
do the visualization of your choice I
don't think so so this is one good
advantage of tableau 9 wherein you can
connect to all the statistical packages
right when I say all these three and
quickly go about coming up with your own
visualizations that is a slide all about
another thing splitting the data is
extremely easy now for example say you
have a customer name you'll be having
the first name on the last name of the
customer how do I split that can I do it
on a click of a button right not sure
about the other visualization tools now
you guys sell me if you all are working
on different other visualization tools
or bi tools you tell me whether these
kind of options are available or not so
let me quickly open a new sheet there
well let me delete these because I've
just done that all right here is a
customer lean let me drag and drop it to
the rows here so here are the names of
the customers which has the first name
and the last name each and every
customer has a first name and the last
name hey if I want only the first name
is there an easy way I'm not saying
there is no other way right in wages are
the tools there might be real but is
there such an easy we were in a right
click go to transform and split
job done it automatically split into the
first thing here is the first name
dimension right and if I wish to see the
last name I can do that just right click
on that I was training that this is
customer first mean and this is your
customer last name there my job done all
right let us look into few more features
this is how we have transformed the data
we have flipped the data editing the
data doing all your P vote or doing the
modification right is extremely easy in
tableau nine now this is the new
interface of tableau nine right for
those of you who are knife to tableau
who wants to you know quickly know the
basics of tableau and things like that
here we have the features few of the
features let me show you that sorry if
you click on this new icon which is new
to tableau nine right thus tableau icon
there if you click on that you'll go to
the home page and here the moment you
enter tableau you quickly get to see few
of the getting started videos connecting
to the data all the basic stuff is
available here the basics not the
advanced ones right in various tableau
being used currently the singapore
private properties market that is where
tableau is being used and this is the
visualization of the week you get access
to all the latest blocks right wearing
new features about tableau dis kissed
right errors or if you are finding it
difficult to find few of the navigations
few of the visualizations right you can
always drop into the blog look into the
forums and help each other right if at
all
there is any conference those details
are available here so if you have a
conference coming up in a location close
to you you can always go out in that for
new insights I'm not looking to your
questions now I'll just complete this
and then i'll probably take your
questions right so here is another new
thing right in town below eight you
might ask me hey is this and similar to
tableau 80 series let me go to tableau 8
this is tableau 8 by the way right if I
wish to click on a database connect to a
database right I need to click on that
here how we it is is that I need to
scroll and check whether a database of
my choice exists here or not and one
good thing is that you can connect a
blow to all your big data database is
more or less cloud era right harden
works Google Analytics book Google
bigquery right amazon redshift I amazon
mr.right map our Hadoop hi all your big
data tools you can easily connect there
and start analyzing right but this is
tableau 8 series right if I look into
version 9 there if I wish to connect to
the server was the frequently connected
service up here here they say was which
you connect most frequently and here I
click on that I click I search a
database of my choice there and quickly
connect there rather than scroll and see
which file I need to connect and things
like that if you want to connect a few
other databases there you can do so
right do you want to connect to excel
files or ms access databases or visually
examples if you wish to connect to few
other databases there here are the list
of or extensions of various databases
you can connect you all these sources
one visual ization tool you can connect
to all of these databases how cool is
that
this is one more feature of tableau nine
and one quick thing which I want to show
which is amazing feature by the way
right whenever you cover your tool tip
right in 8 version will be alive for
eight seconds and then it disappears but
in tableau 9 it's real time super fast
super responsive let me show you that
are you can click on whom to go here or
you can connect to any of the sample
databases there that is how it's going
to open up but I'm going to limit here
so let us put some details there and try
to hover the mouse and see how it's
going to work there let me put GDP right
and let us put the region there in
columns right now if I hover my mouse
right it's going to take split second
for the pop-up to come right that is
called as a tooltip it takes a split
second for me to get those details there
a split second and if I wished you were
across see afraid seconds it has
disappeared there and if I want that
it's taking a split second it's a split
second let me do the same thing in your
tableau here there's already a sheet
which I have created look at that do you
see the split second there I'm see how
slowly i'm hovering my mouse look at how
slowly i'm hovering my mouse real time
real time there is no lag absolutely
right isn't that a cool feature and that
is going to appear as long as you keep
your mouse pointer there how many are
seconds you keep right so look at that
right it's super fast cannot be more
responsive than this
so these are a few of the features not
just that I wish to show you two more
quick things right you can play a lot of
animations on this until your own
stories while you do the animation here
for example let me open tableau 9 there
let me connect to adidas to data source
let me connect to the world indicators
these are the sample data sources right
you can connect to that and start
navigating your part so I've connected
the world indicators there at any given
point of time you can have multiple data
sources there right so i have opened the
world indicators let me open a new
worksheet I just click on this and you
she does open up now now um let me drag
and drop life expectancy of me to the
rose let me drag and drop health
expenditure per capita onto your column
shelf there from your mages you see only
one point there if I want to
disaggregate that just need to go to
analysis click on our great measures I
get all these data points to hear right
if I want to reduce the size of that
click on the size and reduce it job done
i reduced it drastically right or if I
want to increase that yeah there are you
it's all on me right on how to quickly
reduce the size or increase the size and
things like that now let me drag and
drop the region into the colors shelf
here you see different circles
representing different regions there now
let me drag and drop eruption from your
dimension on your pages there here we go
right now
I can play a beautiful animation and
also in the background I can you know
give a story for example I click on that
look at the movement you know the health
of mail in Europe is increasing
drastically right if I if I go back
there I can reduce the speed also i can
make it very slow and stop playing that
look at that look at that already
America's meal health expenditure per
capita is on the peak on the rise right
and it's slowly moving there slowly
moving European region is and let me
stop there look at this data point there
in here 2006 the life expectancy of meal
in Middle East region has increased
drastically what happened in 2006 what
was so special probably you can explore
arm that and you know tell a story while
this visualization or animation is in
progress yep look at that in two
thousand seven rounds so it was same
then it has drastically drop in 2008 why
was it the reason because of recession
or what was a reason and if you see
Europe has you know in 2011 european
region had highest health expenditure
per capita win and you know life
expectancy of male is not increasing
greatly in african region right so you
can make all these stories right and
then represent your beautiful animation
you can put in the slideshow just play
that tell your story and walk off right
this is another good thing that you can
do another last thing that I want to
show you even before i take the quest
geez you know can you do analytics on
this can you do analytics because data
analytics building the prediction models
is a big thing nowadays right so can I
build a prediction model even before I
proceed right let me show you quickly
I'll take your questions later just one
minute right how do you build your
prediction models any prediction model
anything that you want to predict
probably the seals in the next quarter
if you want to predict now or maybe you
want to predict your fraudulent data
fraud transactions who is going to
default on the loan who is going to fall
sick all those things can be predicted
and you represent that as Y right why is
the output and you also have various
inputs right so probably you know you
want to measure the weight gain of a
person wait in weight gain is dependent
on what calories consumed gender age and
all that using that you can build your
prediction models if I provide calories
consumed age and gender of people it can
predict and tell me what will be the
calories gain that is a simple
prediction right but you need to do a
lot of statistics around that a lot of
regression and all that how can it do it
in simple way in tableau let me show you
because one of the unique selling
propositions of tableau ease analytics
right it does a lot of analytics and you
have a new tab there call as analytics
right so instead let us do this first
let me connect to a new data store which
is sample superstore I have connected to
this data set now right all we need to
do is drag sales to the column shelf
there greg rose or drag
it to your roast shells there you see
this aggregated symbol there by default
is aggregated when I segregated it is
added up together in you see only one
point there if you want to see all the
different data points then I just
uncheck that so this is a scatter plot
right this is a scatter plot what does a
scatter plot see hey foremost in for
most of the data points as your sales
increase your profits also increase
however there are a few weird cases
wearing as your sales increase your
profits are dipping decreasing that's
weird right it should happen the other
way around so we have done that what
else can we do in tableau this is a
scatter diagram to show the relationship
between two continuous variables just
right click on that go to train lines
say sure train lines hey here it's
showing the train line but what does
that friend line show if I hover my
mouse right you see this equation now if
someone is going to tell me that hey
your sales are twelve thousand dollars I
simply replace those twelve thousand
dollars in this equation and it says
profit is equal to zero point one eight
double 0 67 x the 12,000 sales and i
subtract it from 12.7 329 this is called
as a regulation equation and you see the
p-value their probability value if it is
less than 0.05 you say that this
equation is good for me do you want to
do a deep dive on this statistics right
click GO train lines click on describe
trendline here you go you have just seen
an equation right what was the equation
all about
profit is equal to zero point one eight
double zero six seven times of your
seals so 0.18 double zero six seven
times of your seals x your seals that is
and you add or subtract this value in to
sit there you add this value minus
twelve point seven three to nine right
simply you can predict now your profit
how many clicks did it take you to
actually build a prediction model five
clicks not more than that and what is
the amount of code that you need to
write in any other statistical tool oh
my god you need to rightly crazy right
so let me show you our for example right
you need to write all these things if I
want to do a prediction model I run this
command or run this command or run this
command I run this command or run this
command or run this command or run this
command around this and then i'll look
into the summary of the model right and
then I look into the summary of the
model of course there are various other
things which I'm trying to do so you get
that equation right here it's a
different data set instead how cool is
this just drag and drop I need not know
any code whatsoever and I can do all the
job here so r a new middle name is also
clubbed as a different split if you have
three names right first name last name
and middle name through your split
differently there again issue
do you want me to do the split once
again there do you want me to show you
that all right let me show you I'm not
sure whether you've seen it or not let
me need that let me need need that right
let me add a new thing if you drag and
drop the customer name right I have the
first him in the last name year right
renew had a question what if there was a
middle name alright just right-click and
split you're going to get the middle
name also split their create it to
Derek's going to create three splits
this is the first name split right and
if you want to look into the last name
there you pick that on a click of a
button you're getting your job down here
that's the beauty of this iron will you
be able to share this light at the end
of the session only you need to check
with a Eureka folks probably they'll be
able to vary from that establish Rican
all tableau is not free it comes for
license right and the license cost is I
think two thousand dollars there just
click on buy you when you go to the
tableau website right you'll see the
license costs i'm using the professional
edition which is nineteen ninety nine
dollars per user right per year and if
you want a personal edition it costs you
nine ninety nine dollars tableau online
is for five hundred dollars right and if
you are a student if you are a student
if by any chance then you can probably
get this student pricing which comes for
a low cost I think it's alright so
that's a pricing path I'm taking the
questions one by one extract option
explain now Pallavi what extract option
so if you want to view the data right
not sure what you're asking about if you
right click on that you can view the
data
right you can use the data of that
particular thing you can look into the
complete underlying data and you can
export everything there so if that was
your question to here is a simple answer
next thing is how different is arf with
tableau is a question from my uncle my
uncle r is extremely different to
download tableau is more
individualization and it is all fleet
coming up with all kinds of analytics
also within that for example this
analytics option here it gives you
median with cod oils box flower bright
trend lines forecasting you can come up
with the distribution band you can look
into the average with ninety-five
percent confidence interval and all
these things right but are is extremely
advanced when it comes to analytics when
it comes to analytics data scientists
kind of a job right r is extremely
advanced but tableau its unique selling
proposition is visualization you can
come up with some beautiful
visualizations using tableau right are
also can do visualization but it won't
be as beautiful as visualized ations in
tableau how to add filter option to
extract yeah i think i've shown you that
Paula be right that option is also there
you just go there you go to online
option there right and you can drop down
and do all that and if you want to do
kind of analysis that you're asking
right you need to go to the particular
data source then you can do all that
right whatever you want to do you can do
so you can split the data right you can
do p what also by selecting the multiple
fields there right all those options are
available right but you cannot you know
don't assume that it is as good as your
no it can't be that easy right and then
can tableau 9 be installed on a mac
absolutely Kunal it works on mac also
for developing the tableau which
languages are used follow me there is no
such language right but if you know
sequel and things like that it's easy
for you for example see here I have
clicked on a profit ratio right i've
created a calculated field how do i know
that it is a calculated field there will
be a small equal to sign before the
measure there so i click on that click
on edit right and here we go oh wait it
thank you alright here it is so you can
write these kind of small functions
there and get the job done if you want
to look into the bunch of functions
which are available here they are right
so it's as simple as that so you need
not know any programming language
specifically to work on tableau how it
works internally I mean getting input to
showing output there now that's a bigger
architecture pallavi by bit by the way
tableau has a bigger architecture it as
a server client architecture we are
working on the client right and it has
its own architecture which is you know
part of that once it cools Sao Paulo he
has another question how it works
internally I mean getting input to
showing output there all right that is a
bigger thing in the designing any graph
for example as you should scatter graph
how many axes are used as x y&amp;amp;z like
this no it's only x and y axis because
if you are plotting a scatter plot right
scatter diagram the basic logic is that
you do it for only two variables x and y
because always it's based on the
prediction equation which i have to
write prediction whatever output you
want to predict is equal to function of
inputs so
it's not that you are representing on a
three-dimensional scale 3d no you're not
representing in a three-dimensional you
are representing only the output and
their input their scenes profit in our
case profit was your output which you
wanted to predict based on the scenes
right sales is the input so that is why
you do it only using two axis X and
y-axis all right let me take the next
question rakesh has a question the p
value that is being considered has it
been said it no it is set at ninety-five
percent confidence interval Rakesh Arun
has a question the trend line
functionality and the description of the
model is something that is available in
previous versions of tableau right oh
yes it is available around i'm just
saying that tableau also has these
features i just wanted to show that for
people who are new to tableau our own
what is the scope of job opportunity and
future with respect to tableau the way
we see it tableau is enhancing and
venturing in a big way into analytic
space also and you know i was finding it
a little difficult to UM get you guys
the tool is right top ten tools in data
analytics there's a good article which
is published off late not sure if this
is that let us see not this one right so
there is one good article which was
published which was seeing that 2015 by
the way let us see whether or predictive
analytics 2015 tools are there's one
last right if it's not there it's
not there all right so what it was
showing his I'll just explain you
quickly there it was saying that that
article was saying that tool r has forty
six percent of the market share in 2015
right and SAS SAS which most people
think that is the market leader and
things like that no it has only eleven
percent of the market share as of 2015
why is that so there are two million
users accessing our right and this is
all analytical tools within this tableau
has found its position no doubt that
when it comes to visualization tools
tableau is number one in data
visualization or bi right business
intelligence tableau is number one
undisputable its number one right
however it has also found its place in
the top ten analytical tools that's a
good part right so very soon probably
i'm assuming right tableau will be a
one-stop solution for a visualization as
well as analytics both can be done at
one go that is a way tableau visionaries
are looking at right so janish horses
yes what is the scope of job opportunity
there are plenty my dear friend Sam
you're right thus tableau has any
limitations while working with data
cubes no to shower I have not personally
seen any you know limitations and such
it's very fast it's good at dealing with
your big data also what is the ideal
configuration of the system should be
for performance of this while dealing
with large data sets I normally have
16gb ram rakesh and it works well even
with the big data sets Johnny sure
please explain the prediction again
alright let me quickly show you that
so what did we do well let me open a new
sheet there what did we do we have rag
dar profit whatever profits or what is
the output which you want to predict
should be on your y-axis which it should
be on your rules there whatever inputs
you're providing for your prediction
should be on the columns there and you
have one data point here tableau by
default creates a blue circle right and
it's aggregated good analysis and
aggregate the measures you see that
right it's a scatter diagram now right
click on that good trend analysis and
sure trend lines and if I hold my mouse
in that it is giving me the prediction
equation if I if someone gives me the
sales value from here on I will be able
to quickly predict the Prophet value
that is the equation right so all right
so I want that how to use in linux
environment it's limited as of now right
linux environment you can use it in mac
a look can we write use a different
statistical functions code in tableau
right that is why you know you can input
your our files also into this prasanna
yes can you show the regression again
please it's not very clear Kunal I've
shown you shown this again for y'all how
we stop live in official then click for
you other than less coding in wall I am
NOT to a great extent work on click for
you now you see me Jenna party you see
me right you know I've shown you the
bunch of visualizations and all that
right but click view and tableau
considers close competitive too but
still tableau when it comes to analytics
right I do not think you can do all
those analytics and click view
so that is where tableau has an
additional edge right you have the data
you show the visualization you also can
show some analysis right predictive
analysis Kunal the examples for
predictive analytics for example right
you go swipe your credit card you keep
swiping your credit card but once a
while you receive a call from the call
center which says a mr. kunal have you
just made a purchase for $25,000 right
or 50,000 rupees they would call once a
while right each time then I'm going to
call you but they'll call you once a
while when do they call you when the
feel that you have swipe your card in an
unknown entity somewhere and this is the
first time you're spending such a huge
amount probably right so how do people
come to know that that might be a
fraudulent transaction how does call
center come to know about that based on
predictive analytics they're predicting
that something might go wrong right how
different is our with tableau Mike I
have shown that right r is completely
into analytics tabloids into data
visualization however are also has data
visualization right but it's not as
robust as tableau tableau also has
analytics but it's minimal at this point
of time but yes rather than just doing
your visualization you can do some
amount of analytics also using tableau
oh I'm a repeating on this question
getting repeating can you please connect
hour to hour and shook is a small demo
for instance can you please compute the
correlation coefficient of two variables
in tableau using our hey that's gonna
take some time around it's not going to
you know happen just like that we have a
special three hour session three hour
session which happens you know working
on connecting tableau with our computing
or whatever statistics that you want
right correlation coefficient is just
one of those
is it possible to perform advanced
analytics using tableau and no it's
limited at this point of time Rakesh or
no regression I've shown you recognition
I've shown you write and let me show you
one more thing here right if you're keen
on knowing that edit current lines there
you can do a logarithmic model you can
do an exponential model or you can do a
polynomial with a number of degrees of
your choice right you can show the
confidence bands there you can force
y-intercept 20 you can do all that you
can do all that right it's not just
linear regression there you can you
whereas other things also all right as
of now these are the four things which
are available in tableau so since you're
asking more about analytics I'm just
telling you but it's not extremely
advanced right decision trees and all
you cannot do rakesh now that's the data
mining concept which you know probably
are is a good bet or wake up if tableau
is coming with analytics option then is
it possible with it no no no it cannot
be a replacement because as of now there
are two million people working on our
and enhancing the are right two million
people enhancing it how many people do
you think are there in tableau in R&amp;amp;D
division there might be very few so no
these two are different entities tableau
look into that from more of a
visualization perspective but yes it has
a capabilities for analytics also are
looking to that from a completely
analytics tool perspective but it also
has data visualization you know options
are available there but as crews data
visualization is super cool in tableau
can we regionalize data from Hadoop in
brief can we connect are open oh yes
absolutely Gaussian we can do that we
have that right
oh let me show you click on that go to
more service type huh Duke there look at
the kind of integration it as I sorry
how do Cloudera harden works map are
there you go this is the answer you can
connect to a root process data and then
do all the visualization there pallavi I
think I cannot do that right with ql
it's out of school sorry offline I can
take that below me for you any good
tutorial online help to gain expertise
in tableau and at the same time gain
experience hands-on experience right re
need to get started right you can click
on this tableau home icon there and
probably you know go through that but
these are not that once topics right
right now just to get started these are
good but if you want advanced program
right here at Eureka has one for you
yeah look I've just shown you those
options right click on more servers
there here is high right sorry harden
will kharab hai when then you have my
power hive Apollo 8 dual axis graphs can
be done amazing graphs can be done dual
access grats yeah we can do that can we
have three-dimensional view also alright
let me tell you this my unk right there
are a lot of data visualization concepts
which people should be aware of right
for example showing a three dimensional
graph on a two-dimensional picture is
not a good option why why is that not a
good option let me see whether i want to
show you guys or not mine just look into
this i'm trying to put a 3d graph three
dimensional graph on two-dimensional ski
what is wrong here
and if we represent the same thing in
the line graph ama the one which is
appearing here on the right setup ears
oh here it's showing me that everything
is increasing however here it's showing
the day there is a tip there your 3d
graphs are going to lie a lot so you
should be aware of the skin of concepts
right and any good visualization tool
will take into account all these things
we do not want fancy-looking graphs we
want good grass which is going to
explain story why are we visualize in
the first place because for me to read
the entire table for example let me
connect to this right and I think it's
getting updated sorry so say I'll put
sales there ah endo let me be eased on
that and subcategory there since of
reading all these numbers right it's
extremely difficult there for me to go
through each and every number remember
here which number or which particular
sub category which segment has the
highest sales instead of the simpleness
or I can do this right the number which
is the darkest is having the highest
feels the number which is the lowest is
having the least things lightest is
having the least since isn't this good
right this is extremely good right so
that is visualization all about
explaining your story in you know
convince format I will it be easier for
a person who has hands on SQL query
capabilities any good blogs resources to
learn tableau for beginners so you have
to have low official guide you can go
through that sagar but tableau official
guide for mine would be released in
october not now yes absolutely if you
have sequel query command it's good for
you
on the client moment right I do not have
any access to the server here whatever
work I do on the client right I can
install in the silver that's the server
client architecture that's a different
concept and an advanced concepts by the
way and that is part of your ad rocket
program how is it compared to pyramid
analytics I have seen pyramid analytics
has advanced visualizations and tempo as
I've told you moment creating advanced
visualizations voices being in line with
the visualization concepts that's the
most important thing a tableau you know
looks into this advanced visualization
concepts and ensures that the common
pitfalls are not are not repeated so
probably in that terms i would say
tableau is better than pyramid analytics
maybe maybe I'm not debating on that
because i do not have complete exposure
on pyramid analytics but i blow i would
say that you know they have good
visualizations which do not default on
your data visualization concepts basic
concepts for example using a pie chart
wherever you have more than three
categories is a wrong thing is a wrong
thing pie chart people are so you know
close to the pie chart concept right but
if you are displaying this to a client
or a board of the group of my muscle
board of directors right if they know
you in basics of data visualization they
would say that hey why did you stop a
pie chart there and aqua TC is a word
and click view for crm establish for
making dashboards absolutely right here
is option there for creating your dash
boots you can drag a dragon drop
everything to you know place of your
choice
put that yes absolutely awkward you do
all that and I'll take sibility the only
difference for click view yeah quickly
went a blur or more or less competing
with each other so they'll be bringing
in all those concepts from a garnish
where I have done that if I know sequel
excellent SPSS is easy for me to start
working with tabla absolutely ah quality
it's very easy for you can you explain
level of detail feature are too sharp
I'm afraid that's a different concept
once again you need to always start at a
high level view and then start drilling
it down so let me let me try to do that
see um let me try to do that for you
because you're as bad let me drop seals
there and I'm sorry and let me put ear
day there sorry not all the date you did
there right there will be plus sign here
in tablets extremely easy if I click on
that I go and see the quarter's if I
pick on the plus sign I can see the
months if I click on that I can go to
the DS so that is how simple it is right
that is all simple it is so there you go
if you say we are workbook then where it
goes yeah files have specific extension
if I save as right I can save it as a
tableau workbook there or I can save it
as a tableau package will book package
worth what means all these things
everything together that here are the
extensions can we have three dimensional
view also my uncle you can try
all that we can do that by doing some
you know changes but on the face of it
you cannot get it right but you can
modify and create your own 3d view also
more mod any answers to my questions I
think I've answered normal if not please
ask me so he's multiple linear
regression not possible in tablet to
develop a complete model no accurate
it's not possible can connect to opens
his heart as well I mean Apache Hadoop
years kunal it can can you please throw
some light on when is the tavern our
integration session happening much
interested in that aren't probably you
need to check with that Eureka team on
that yeah but in the the India coast
module they have the stab learn our
integrations H natsu you can no way see
what's happening with one of the
dimensions it can confusing what you
don't know I didn't get that question
cannot sorry will you be taking any
sessions on taobao in future you need to
check with a director ROM ROM ROM not
can SAS we compete with tableau SAS has
its own visualization too yes you can
compare that with tableau but sasses
into various other things not
specialized only data visualization
right but at this point of time still
tableau is the leader right it's not sad
SAS more more into analytics front is
visual analytics and tableau different
the things which we have seen as us now
is all visual analytics right but if
you're looking into visual analytics /
see it is also inclusive of rum not it
is also included of your video analytics
image processing that's a different
topic deep learning basically right you
need to know that in which fields
tableau is more used which fields
meaning which industries and sectors in
domains Halloween is that your question
but no if you see the bunch of companies
which are using tableau you'll be
surprised to see that almost all the
sectors and
industries are using tableau for the
visualization because it's very easy
right drag and drop what I've seen in
tableau is more of a dragon drop and
changing some properties and less of
coding so does that mean business users
can also use into analysis as per the
choice and requirement without idea
moment they can do so if they are well
was in your writing some kind of small
code sequel queries and things like that
how do we deploy it on the server to
server for accessing into another web
site so what you can do is of course
there has to be a server license there
and you have to provide the server
details in this client and then once
you're done you can publish on to the
server all those options are there here
you are sir will write write whatever
you want to publish your workbook you
can publish there and it goes to your
server but if people who do not have
several they can just use tableau public
right or they can use tableau reader to
read those fine sue that's a good part
what are the best features tableau has
it compared to XO I know is excellent in
Excel but what is different but between
excellent tableau how do you put that
it's more or less the same but one
difference that I if you ask me right
exel doesn't handle your big data Excel
does it handle your big data tableau
does that that's a basic difference
right why do why are people getting into
tableau why are people getting into
Hadoop and things like that because of
the advent of big data the traditions
tools are unable to handle such huge
volumes of data that's a basic your
friends is to see his right sagar what
is that sse is ideal meeting for showing
graph with language which language is
used or for visualization
hey tabla has its own you know a
different code and things like that in
the back in if you want to get into the
back in and look into the development of
tableau and all that yeah i mean just
interested to know whether SS a is can
we compete the tableau yeah all these
are our competitors sagar you can
compare all that I'm not discounting on
anything right all the tools have your
own you know benefits and you know pros
and cons but you need to look into what
is a market leader now what is going to
give you a better job now which tool do
you need to learn to ensure that you
also are a visionary for example right
do not look into the short-term benefits
look into the long-term benefits look
into all these tools what are these
companies doing how are they enhancing
what are the new features that they're
trying to bring in are they in line with
the market trend right there thousands
of tools you can learn all those right
no doubt about that but are they
investing in your research and
development in trying to come up with
some kind of analytics because nowadays
the buzzword is data analytics right
maybe that's a question that you need to
ask actually slower to all right yeah
how about data cleansing their
preparation building models using no
shantha unit you can't do all that you
need to do cleansing data preparation
beforehand and then load it into tableau
and then look into your models and
things like that can you show the first
slide when you what is the first layer
on that are you speaking about the body
called godness magic quadrant is that
what you're asking all right moment as a
question right can we create a record
level reports you can do some woman can
we schedule dash boots to deliver on
schedule here you can do
that live streaming moment you can do
all that live streaming ensure that the
live dashboards go yeah they're
happening as we speak right in Twitter
there are thousands of people tweeting
right if there's tweeting about a
specific topic I want that information
through good to go through how do have
some data cleansing done then come back
to tableau and display you some
beautiful visualizations to the client
or not ongoing basis yes you can do that
streaming right you can do that I'm not
all right let me show you that or I'm
not want to see this um yes from is this
what you wanted to see right in here is
time blowing ability of executed
complete and salvation that is gartner's
magic quadrant I'm trying to compare
with other competitors someone was
saying click for you where I click view
is here behind tableau both in terms of
completeness of vision and ability to
execute their SAS probably they are good
at your vision vision is what we have to
achieve in the future but when it comes
the ability to execute right tableau is
there all right friends I think we have
spent sufficient time and you know
having a good discussion around tableau
and its advantages and disadvantages
right if you do not have any questions
we can probably call it a day thank you
