from Mary Rica on EWS today in this
session we're gonna see how you can
secure your AWS account using the AWS I
am Services right so let's go ahead and
see what is our agenda for today to see
what all we are going to cover in this
session alright so we're gonna start
with why do we need access management
and then move on to what is I am after
that we're gonna see what are the
components for a different components of
I am and move on to discuss the
multi-factor authentication service
offered by I am and towards the end
we'll be doing a hands-on where in will
be creating or I'll be demonstrating to
you an application which will upload
your files to s3 using the I am policies
alright so guys this is our agenda for
today I hope it's clear to you alright
guys so I welcome you all to the live
session any doubts that you have during
the session please put it down in the
comment box my team is here to help you
out and anywhere if you feel if it is
not a live session on your side anywhere
if you feel you have a doubt please put
it in the normal comment section and
we'll be happy to answer it for you
alright so let's go ahead and start with
today's session with the first topic
which is why do we need access
management all right so to discuss this
topic let's understand it using an
example say you have a company in which
you have a server and this server has
everything in it it has all the modules
in it and it gives you the puppet it
gives different users the permission to
use the different servers right now in
your company first of all you should
have an administrator which will have
all the rights to to access the server
right so nobody in the today's IT world
works on the root account right so there
has to be an administrator account so
first we will create an administrator
account with all the permissions now
tomorrow say a UI developer comes into
your company right now a UI developer
will only work on the graphical tools
right so he should only be allowed the
graphical tools and not some other tools
maybe he shall not be given the internet
access or something like that right
maybe he's not giving the PowerPoint
access
maybe he's not given some folders access
some drives access anything like that so
I wanted that can be defined in the
server by the administrator and specific
rights will be given to a UI developer
right similarly if - if after that
business analyst comes in so he should
only be able to access the analytics
module which is there now so right he
should not be able to get into the UI
development pod or you should not be
able to see the other aspects of what is
there in your server right so each and
every user each every rule will have
specific rights assigned to them all
right and this is done by policies which
are in turn given by administrators
right so this is what access management
is that giving each role the specific
rights that they deserve and this is
what we are going to accomplish today in
AWS right so this this is why we need
access management let's go ahead and
understand how can we accomplish this in
AWS right so doing accomplish this in
AWS you need a service called I am you
have a service called I am which uses
this this concept of access management
and allows you to give it to your users
who are going to use your account right
so what is I am so I am is basically a
service from AWS using which you can
give permissions to different users who
are using the same AWS account that you
have created alright so in a company
like in any company be it you don't have
to have two or three AWS accounts you
can have one AWS account on which a
number of people can work right for
example you can define that may be a
developer would like to work on your AWS
account and you should only have the ec2
instances or you should only work on the
ec2 instances you decide that right so
you can only define you can define a
policy like that that only the dwell the
developers will only be able to access
the ec2 instances on-air AWS account
similarly if say a database
administrator comes in so you should be
able only able to
access the DB instances on your AWS
account and so on right so all of that
as possible using I am but I am is not
only about creating users and creating
policies it's more there is more - I am
right and hence we will be discussing
the different components of I am now so
let's go on and see what are the
different components so there are
basically four different components and
I in the iam service so the first
service is user then we have groups then
we have rows and then you have policies
alright so the way we are going to go
about these are first I'm going to
explain you each role on each service
and I am each component and I am and
then we're going to see how we can
execute them or create them in the AWS
console right so let's start with the
users so the very first time you
actually create a AWS account that is
basically the root account that you have
created all right so then there is no
user inside it so why do we basically
need a user you need a user because you
are supposed to give permissions to
someone right so say I have all want to
give administrator rights to a user
right so you understand you have to have
an entity first to which you can assign
permissions right so these entities are
called
users and ews so any person who wants to
access your AWS account has to be added
as a user in I am and then you can
attach different policies on to that
user alright so this is what user is all
about let me go to my AWS management
console and show you how you can create
a user in I am alright so give me a
second alright guys so this is my AWS
sign sign-in page alright so this email
ID when you log in through your email ID
and your password that is basically your
root account so what I'm going to do
right now is I'm gonna login using my
root account and first create a admin
account for myself alright guys so you
should never work in your root account
you should always have an administrator
account through work in the root account
should only be used when there is an
emergency say you have been locked out
of
mr. account only then you should be
using your root accounts the first thing
that you should do when you enter your
root account is go to I M which is just
right here go to I am and then you will
have this dashboard thing right over
here you can see there is a thing called
users you will click on users and you
will click on add user all right so now
it will ask you for the user name so you
can provide a user name say I'll add my
name first so that'd be hey month right
and what what kind of access do I want
to give to this particular user so there
are basically two kinds of access that I
can girls first is the AWS management
console access and then we have the
programmatic access right so what is
these two so if you want to so there are
basically two ways you can access the
AWS resources right you can either
access them using ApS that is using your
code say you have created an application
which is interacting with your AWS
resources right so in that case if you
are interacting with the APS using the
API is that is called the programmatic
access right secondly is the AWS
management console access that is when
you are using the AWS website to
actually deploy resources or create or
create or remove policies or whatever
right so that is called the AWS
management console access so for my user
I'd be giving in it both the accesses
that is programmatic access and the
management console access also guys when
you enable the programmatic acts
programmatic access basically you get
the access key and the secret key as
well what are these I will be explaining
you in a bit all right so we have
selected both of these options and then
move ahead to choose the password so do
you want an auto-generated password or a
custom password I'll choose a custom
part for password since I'm creating
account for myself right so I choose a
custom password and do I want to reset a
password on a first login no I don't
want that so I'll click on next
permissions all right so what kind of
permissions
do I want my account to have I will
become drink configuring that over here
so as us now there are no groups there
is no existing user that I can copy from
so I'll attach existing policies and
since I want to attach the administrator
access that is the first policy over
here I'll select that and click on next
alright so you can review all the
settings that you did over here and
click on create user this will create a
new user in your AWS account so as you
can see I have got my access key ID and
a secret access key now why is the
secret access key you only get to see
one time only one time when you have
created a account so it is essential
that is stored your access key and a
secret access key once you get this page
all right so let me store it quickly so
this is my access key ID why we are
copying it you'll get to know during the
session don't worry my secret access key
which is this let me copy this and paste
it in a notepad alright so don't worry
you you might be thinking that I have
exposed my secret key to you so I'll be
deleting this account afterwards so you
don't have to worry about that alright
so I've got my access key ID and my
secret access key so that is done now
what I'll be doing is I'll be logging
out from my from my root account and
logging in this user account that I just
created
alright so one more thing that you have
to be very careful of that you will not
be logging in through the same login
page that is just saw right so you'll
have to log in through a different login
page now and the URL for that is this
right right so you'll be logging in
through this link as from now on
so what whenever you create a user if
you want them to log into your account
you have to give them this link to login
to write so let us copy this link over
here and logout from a root account
all right so I've logged out I'll close
this and I'll come here and go to this
particular link all right so once you
reach this particular link it will be
asking you the account name which will
be self filled by your link right so you
have to get your username now which is
Haymond and then the password so I'll
type in the password that I've given it
and click on sign in so now I have
basically signed in to my coma tool to
the user that I've just created on my
root account right so I no longer have
to use my root account I can basically
lock away my root account for emergency
purposes I using my administrator
account from now on I can do everything
from admin site has gone that could be
done from my root account as well but
there are cases where and you get locked
out from your administrator code in that
cases you will be needing your root
access all right so moving on guys
so I'll go to I am now so as you can see
we have created a user and we have
logged into that user and if I go to I
am now you can see that it will show
that one user has been created that is
you right so let's get back to our slide
and discuss the next component all right
so we have discussed what our users
let's move on to the second component
which are groups
all right so whenever you create users
they can also be combined into groups
now why do we need groups we need groups
because say let's take an example so say
you have five users and these five users
have to be given identical access right
say these five users belong to the
development team and the development
team has to have some common access that
they all will have right now one way of
doing this would be that I will go to
each and every user and attach a policy
that they need right the smart way to do
this would be to to include them inside
one group and to that group I will once
only
I will attach the policy and it will
apply to all these five users right so
these are my groups are very important
now how we can create groups let me shed
a light on that so you will go to you
can see you can click on groups over
here and what you'll do it basically is
you'll click on create new group alright
so let me dip the group name as live
demo alright and I'll click on next step
now it will ask me the policy that I
want to attach to this particular group
alright so say for example I just want
this group to be able to access the s3
service from AWS so what I'll do is I
will select the policy which says Amazon
s3 full access and I'll click on next
step now this policy basically tells you
that you can only use the s3 service in
the management console and no other
service all right so I'll click on
create group and now whatever whichever
user I will be putting in putting inside
this group will have this property
alright so I don't have to configure the
policy for any user now so what I'll do
is I'll create a new user now so say I
create a new user saying test alright
and then I'm not giving him the
programmatic access I'm just giving him
the management console access all right
I click on this and I give it a custom
password and then I don't want him to
reset his password I'll click on next
right and now it has asked me whether I
want to include it inside a group so yes
I do I want you to include it inside the
group that I've just created and I'll
click on next and review all the
settings that are adjusted and click on
create user alright so the test account
has just been created now as you can see
you guys in the case of my account which
I created I got an access key and a
secret access key right so in this case
I'm not getting any because I didn't
select the programmatic access only when
you select the programmatic
it will give you the key so that your
application can actually interact with
these services that you have launched
all right so I have I've created the
test user successfully let's login to
this test user so I will type in the URL
that has been given to me right now when
I'll reach this page I'll enter the user
name as test and the password as what I
have been told right and I'll click on
sign in now with this you can see that I
will now be able to see the Magnum
condom admin console will exactly look
like how it was used to see how I used
to see it in my root account or my
administrator account but when you will
try to access say a service which you
have not been assigned to say for
example I only have access to s3 right
now because I've deployed it in the
group where it has only the access to s3
if I try to go inside ec2 let's see what
will happen right so it says you're not
authorized to describe running instances
as a matter of fact I'm not authorized
to see anything on my ec2 page all right
so that is because I cannot I don't have
access to the ec2 dashboard but let's
see if I can see the SV dashboard so I
quickly go to s3 and if I have the s3
access I'll be able to see all the
buckets which are there in my history
and yes I do
so let me go inside a bucket and delete
something so that all right let me
delete an object from this particular
bucket so yes I can delete it all right
so let me check if what if what happens
if I delete or I detach this particular
policy from that group all right let's
see what happens
so I go to I am and I'll go to groups
I'll go to this particular group and I
can see that the policy is listed over
here what I'll do is I click on the -
policy and let's see what happens now
right so I'll go to management console
so on if now I try to access as three it
will show me that access is denied right
so I no longer have access to the s3
service on my AWS console so this is how
you can control access to different
users you can revoke access you can
include access and you can do all of
that and I am alright so let us come
back to a slide to discuss our next
component all right so we've discussed
what our users we've discussed what a
groups now let's come back come down to
rules
alright so rules are similar to users
but rules are actually assign to
applications
all right so users are actually assigned
to people right so whenever you have a
developer in the company you will assign
him the developer rules right but when
you have rules rules are basically
assigning to applications how oh let me
explain you say you create an e zero
instance and inside that in zero
instance you are hosting your web
application now that web application has
been has been designed in such a way
that it has to interact with your s3
services for example that will be doing
- it will be I will showing you the
demonstration today for this right so
see that application has to interact
with the s3 service now if I want to
want that application to interact with
the s3 service I have to give it
permissions and to give it permissions I
will use rules so I will create a rule
wherein haven't specified that this role
can access the s3 service and I will
attach this particular role to that
particularly zero instance in which my
application is hosted and in that case
my application will be able to interact
with the s3 service right it might say a
sound complicated guys but it is very
easy to implement let me show you how so
what I do now is I will go back to my
- console which is here alright I'll go
to the dashboard and say I'll go to
rolls now alright so I'll create a new
rule now roles can be assigned to any
interviewer service which is listed here
what I'll do is I'll assign it to I'll
create a role type of ec2 all right so
I'll select Amazon ec2 and what type of
role do I want to apply to I want to say
have the access to s3 right so I will
select Amazon s3 full access over here
and I click on next step so it will ask
me the role name so let me specify the
rule name as ad Rekha underscore one
right and I'll click on create role so
with this a role has now been created
but mind you guys have not attached this
role to any zero instance right so what
I'll do now is I'll go to my ec2 console
so over there I already have built any
zero instance it is stopped so I'll
start it and attach this particular
policy to the adizero instance all right
so my easier instance name is hemant
underscore one so here it is go to
actions I start this particular instance
right and what I can do is I can attach
the policy using instance settings it
says attach or replace I am role I'll go
here I will go to the drop-down and
select the role that I've just created
which is Ellie Rekha underscore one I'll
select that and I'll click on apply now
with this what will happen is my role is
now my sorry my ec2 instance is now
configured to interact with the s3
service in this particular account
alright so any application that I deploy
in this e 0 instance will be able to
interact with the s3 ok so I don't have
to specify any access key any secret
access key if you're still confused
that be patient we are getting on -
where do we actually use these keys and
where do we not all right so this is
what your roles are all about right so
roles like I said they are four
resources in AWS users are four people
roles and users are similar things
you attach polled policies on to them
and they basically identify a particular
instance or a particular person as the
owner of that particular service right
so I've discussed what roles are let's
move on and discuss policies so if you
think about it guys we have actually
been dealing with policies right so
policies and nothing but permissions
that you give to your with whatever role
or user or group that you have created
right so for example I want to give the
ec2 instance access right so that ec2
instance access is basically a policy
that I will be attaching to the user or
to the rules all right let's see how we
can create policies guys so I'll go to
my management console I'll go to I am
right so though you can either create
policies or you can actually use already
existing ones so there are there are a
couple of policies that have already
been created in your AWS account but you
can go ahead and create your own policy
as well all right so let me show you how
so see for my test account what I'll do
is I will go inside a test account right
and I will add permissions and I will
attach existing policies directly and
Here I am guys so now you can you can
create policies as well so you see the
tab over here guys it says create policy
so if you feel you're the kind of policy
that you want to create is not listed
over here in the default policies you
can actually create one and creating a
policy is very easy guys you'll just
click on create policy and you will see
this page alright so you'll have three
options you can either copy an AWS
manage policy that is a default policy
you can create our own policy by just
typing in the JSON code and if you're
not comfortable with coding what you can
do is you can use the policy generator
now what is policy generator let me
explain you so with policy generator you
just have to select what effect do you
want do you want it to allow it or do
you want it deny it right so say I want
to allow the ec2 service to this
particular test account all right so
I'll go - easy - all right here it is a
selected easy - what kind of actions can
in perform say I want to give them all
the actions you can do anything with ec2
and the source name is basically a
particular resource so with AR and you
can identify a particular resource so I
don't want a particular resource to be
assigned to him I want he can access
every resource and easy to write so I
just add star for all of them right and
click on next step so with this as you
can see it has automatically created a
policy document for you all you have to
do now is click on create policy and it
will create the policy for you so as you
can see there are 18 customer manage
policies that are now 19 so I can go
here and select the policy a policy over
here alright so if I go to my user now
which is test guru permissions I will
just click on add inline policy policy
click on select again go to easy to
select actions all actions right and put
it to star so I click on add statement
click on next step and click on apply
policy so a policy has been applied on
the test user that it can actually
access the ec2 instances now so if I go
to my test user
which in which I was not allowed to
access the ec2 instances I can actually
use the ec2 instances now so if I go to
ec2 you can see it will not give me the
access denied thing right so I can
access all the instances over here as if
I was using the root account but only
for the ec2 service right if I go to s3
you can see I will still have the access
denied page because I have not been
assigned the access to this particular
service alright one more thing is if
what if you add and allow and a deny
policy together inside a group what will
happen then so in that case so since I
have allowed easy to access what I'll do
is I'll deny zero access as well in this
particular user
so I'll click create one more policy and
I'll say deny I'll select ec2 right I'll
select the actions as all actions
I'll give the resources all at the
statement and click on next step apply
the policy so now I have denied ec2
instances as well and created and
allowed ec2 instance ec2 instances as
well what do you think will happen now
so if now I try to go to easy - let's
see what will happen
so it's say you're not authorized to use
ec2 anymore because whenever you're
creating policy guys you either get the
alapanai the deny option if you have
selected both of them it will always
prefer the least permission that you
have given so in our case that is the
deny option right so it will always deny
the case even if you have allowed it in
the same user right if you have
mentioned that that particular service
has to be denied to that particular user
alright so this was about policies guys
let me come back to my slide so we have
discussed what our users what a groups
for the rows and what apologies let's go
ahead and discuss the very important
part of authentication which is called
the multi-factor
dedication so what is multi-factor
authentication guys so multi-factor
authentication is basically something
like OTP that you get when you are
logging into your gmail account right so
you enter a gmail email ID you enter
your password and when you click on
continue it'll ask you for your OTP
right so same is the case here as well
you can configure your AWS account in
such a way that you will enter a
username you'll enter your password and
when you click on login it'll ask also
ask you for her code that has to be
given to it now that code is basically
the multi-factor authentication thing
that we document so there are basically
two layers of security now one layer is
a password and second layer becomes the
code that we'll be entering right now
with AWS there is an application called
the Google Authenticator right which you
can use to create a virtual multi-factor
authentication device now for those of
you who already are using multi-factor
authentication in your companies you so
there's a thing called Gemalto right so
people who work from home and they have
to connect to their company's network
the veu connected is using a gemalto
token right and so those of you who are
from the IT background you can relate to
it right but if you want to go through -
through a simpler way you can actually
create a virtual multi-factor
authentication device and to create that
in your AWS is please simple you just
have to download an application called
do Google Authenticator on your phone
and you have to connect that application
to your AWS account and that is it now
it might sound tough but it's very
simple let me show you how so you will
basically go to your a doubles
management console and you will go to
the particular user that you want that
multi-factor authentication to be
assigned to alright so for example I
wanted to be assigned to the test user
right so what I do is I go to users I'll
go to tests right and in the security
credentials tab I will have this page
which says assigned MFA device so it
says no as of now so I'll assign it a
device
can edit and now he'll give me an option
between a virtual MFA device and a
hardware MFA device now I have to choose
among the two so since I said you can
create a virtual MFA device very same
easily so I select the virtual MFA
device and now it is basically asking
you to install the application on your
phone so we have already done that let's
click on next step and now you'll be
presented with the screen so basically
now what you have to do is you will be
logging into your Google Authenticator
app and you will be scanning this
barcode from your phone so let me show
you how let me connect my phone to the
computer so that you can see the screen
you give me a second
all right so this is a screen to my
phone guys so what I what I have to do
now is I have to go to the Google
Authenticator app idol ask me to create
an account so I'll click on begin and
once I have that basically now I'll have
to scan the barcode from my mobile so
the way to do that is I'll click on scan
a barcode and then I'll scan this
barcode over here right it might take
some time so be patient
yeah so it's done now you're all set
right so you just click on done and now
you have to enter two codes that you
will be receiving on your on your Google
Authenticator so basically these codes
change from every 30 seconds right so I
have rendered these codes over here so
it's two zero four and then three five
sorry zero two zero and three five three
zero two zero three five three and I
have to enter the next code as well so
let's wait for the next code and it's 1
2 7 8 9 1 so I will enter that over here
as well so it's 1 2 7 8 9 1 and that is
it guys so now I click on activate watch
with MFA and it says the MFA device was
successfully associated so I click on
finish and that is it guys you're done
right so now if I log out from my test
account that is from here right this is
my test account so if I log out from
here right now
and try to log in again using test
so I come to my normal login page right
so I'll enter my username and my
password which is this and now I'll
click on sign-in so now it will ask me
for the MFA code so let's see what is
our MFA code as of now so it has changed
to 7 3 4 5 5 - so let us enter that 7 3
4 5 5 - and click on cement so with this
I will now be able to login to my AWS
console using the test account which I
configured using the administrator
account and I am right so it's very
simple guys it you can actually get
world-class security with a click of a
button using I am alright so we have
seen how we can do multi-factor
authentication let's move on to the
hands-on part now so this is what is you
guys have been waiting for so just give
me a second so that I can configure
everything on my end
all right so what we'll be doing now is
I have created an application which can
interact with the s3 service all right
so using that s3 service now we'll be
uploading files to our s3 console and
how we are going to do that first we are
going to do that using localhost and
that is where our secret Keys and my
access key comes in and then we'll be we
have assigned a role to re zero instance
right so we'll be accessing that website
using easy to without the access key and
the secret access key and we can and
you'll see
do we get the access to our SD service
or not all right so let us do that so
now what I will do is I will go to my
local host application so guys this is
basically my application what I have to
do is I'll choose a file upload a
picture from any sample pictures and
then it will upload it to a particular
bucket that I've defined an s3 and that
the bucket looks something like this it
show that buckets name is quarantine
demo so let me show you the bucket so as
of now I think there are some of objects
so let's delete those objects so here it
is this is the bucket quarantine demo so
I have like three objects over here as
of now let's delete these objects
alright so now what I'll be doing is
this is the code for my application guys
alright so in this code as you can see
I'm not specified the key and the secret
key has us now so I'll get the key and a
secret key from here right so let me
quickly so let me show you without the
secret key an access key how is this
localhost website functioning so if I
try to upload a file
as of now say this is the file that I
want to upload I'll click on upload
image and I'll get an error right
because it is not authenticating its
selves to the service that I want to go
to so now I'll add the credentials that
that is a key and the secret key now the
way to do that is like this so I copy it
and paste it here delete this and this
is well not required and now i base my
key and my secret key which is this
right so I'll copy the key over here and
then my secret key as well over here and
now I'll save it if I try to access my
localhost website now I should be able
to upload a file right so if I try to
upload the file now it says well done s3
upload complete so these credentials
that have just entered are basically
credentials for my payment account so if
you want to see where did I get these
credentials from again you can basically
go to users you can go to your user and
you can go at security credentials and
over there it will list you the access
key ID it will not list you the secret
access key because it is only available
once you can only use it once copy it
once you will not be able to see it
again and if I make this particular key
inactive from over here and if I try to
upload anything again I will again get
an error because without the keys my
account will not be will not be
authenticated to the s3 service as you
can see it says invalid access key
because it does not valid anymore all
right
so I can make it active again but that
is not required as now so what I do now
is I have already configured this
website on the ec2 console alright so
let me go to my ec2
right here does so remember in the
starting of the session we created a
rule for s3 full axis right so that role
has been attached to my easier instance
so let me show you the website here it
is alright so I can access the website
on my ec2 now if I choose the file as us
now and I try to upload the file I'll be
able to do so because my policy has been
attached now let's see what happens if I
be attached the policy right so I'll go
to this and I'll select no role click on
apply yes the touch and now if I try to
upload a file again as you can see I see
a blank page which basically means that
an error has occurred all right so I am
NOT able to upload any file because my
role has been detached from my ec2
instance so if I wanted to be working
again I will just simply go here go to
actions settings attach the rule that is
this click on apply it will again work
right I'll choose a file see this file
upload the image and your work again
works like a charm right so that is it
guys you don't have to configure much
you just have to have the knowledge of I
am and with that you can do complex
procedures with the click of a button
and you don't have to swear about it all
right you might want you might be
wondering did I change anything in the
code when I uploaded it too easy to so
you don't have to do anything guys you
just have to delete the credentials key
and secret and you will upload the code
as it is you don't have to change
anything it will if it doesn't have the
key mentioned in this particular
function it'll basically get those keys
from the metadata of easy to and
metadata is a place where your role is
actually assigned or your role is
actually attached right so if it doesn't
find the key in the code it basically
goes to the metadata and picks the key
from over there all right so guys that
is it for the demo part and that is it
guys so that is all for today's session
