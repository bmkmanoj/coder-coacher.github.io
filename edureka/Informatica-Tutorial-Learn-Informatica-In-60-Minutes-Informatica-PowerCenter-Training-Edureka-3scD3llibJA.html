Eureka and welcome to this ad Rekha live
session on learning informatica in 60
minutes this is the second installment
of a business intelligence tool series
and in our previous session we had
looked at ba ba
now informatica is the markets leader
when it comes to data management data
integration data processing basically
anything that deals with data now even
if you have a three-hour session on
informatica we would still not be able
to complete it
explore it as such however post today's
session I'm quite sure most of you would
be able to work with informatica and
begin your journey on playing with data
through informatica power center now
moving forward let's look at today's
agenda to get a better understanding of
what we'll be discussing as part of this
session now the first thing we'll try to
understand is what exactly is business
intelligence now informatica is a tool
that provides you a business
intelligence based solution so let's try
to understand what is business
intelligence first after that we'll try
to understand what does extract
transform and load because this is a
tool that performs this operation so
it's essential that you understand how
extract transform and load works moving
on from there we talk about informatica
power center 10 and then we'll be
looking at the various tools associated
with informatica power center starting
from informatica power center
administrative console and the four
remaining tools of informatica would be
explored through a demo as part of this
session now I hope you guys are
definitely looking forward to this
session and I request you to be a bit
patient because this is a long session
as such now we will begin with the first
topic of today's session that is what
exactly is business intelligence now
business intelligence is one of the
biggest buzz words in today's industry
everybody wants to know what it does how
it works out
so let's try to understand business
intelligence first now business
intelligence basically this is a group
of techniques as well as tools wearing
you gather your data from different
sources once you have your data from
different sources you bring it onto a
common platform that is usually a data
warehouse once I have my data present
here that is all the data from different
sources in a calm
point then from this data I can perform
various analysis and make it quite easy
for the end-user to understand this now
to put it quite simply let's take it in
this way let's say your boss comes up to
you and tells you ok gather the data
from all my sales departments and then
show me a result or a visualization
which tells me how my sales department
is performing now for that first what
you need to understand is that not all
the departments would be using the same
kind of application to store their data
so first what I need to do is that I
need to bring the data from all these
applications to a common platform once I
have a hit here then I can go on to
perform my required analysis operation
now this is what business intelligence
lets you do now again if you look at the
example here I have my data present in
different databases as well as in
different files as such it could be in a
sequel server database it could be an SI
p database oracle or any other database
as well it could also be present in an
XML file a workbook a PDF file a CSV
file and so forth so I need to extract
the data from all these sources
transform it to my requirement and then
load it into a data warehouse so this is
what is the process that we are going to
follow that is extract transform and
load now this is one of the techniques
that business intelligence follows and
it's again one of the most widely used
as well going forward let's try to
understand what exactly is extract
transform and load now to be quite
straightforward extract transform and
load basically is a four stage process
that happens in the first stage you
capture the idea of what exactly is
present in your source system once
you've got an idea of the data that is
present here you're gonna scrub and
clean this data that is you got to take
only the required data or the consistent
data from the source once I've done with
this then I'll move forward and then
perform the required transformation on
this data I'll only take the data that
meets my requirement ahead finally I'm
going to load it ahead into my
enterprise data data warehouse that is
ok so here I have the data from all the
sources as well as the data that meets
my requirement as such let's now try to
understand what exactly is informatica
power center
okay informatica is the markets leading
data integration tool
apart from being a data integration tool
it also lets you migrate your data from
different data sources it helps you
integrate your application data the data
that is present in different application
as well as it helps you transform your
data as per your requirement as such now
talking about the various informatica
power center applications these can be
classified into two categories the first
would be an administrative tool now in
the Administrative Tools section you
have mainly two tools present here you
have your repository manager as well as
you have your administrative console now
let me first address the administrative
console as the name suggests this is
basically a console through which you
would be performing most of your
administrative tasks here you would be
working with various services as well as
performing operations on your domain
let's say I have two teams who are
working with informatica power center on
my own in my organization that is now
each one of them would be referred to as
a node and the collection of these nodes
together would form my domain so all the
operation from creation configuration as
well as management of these nodes would
be done from my administrative console
apart from that there are various
services that are associated to each of
these applications as well
it could be a repository service or an
integration service as well
so the creation the starting the
stopping the deletion of these also will
be managed on this administrative
console itself let's say you want to
backup your data or you want to restore
an existing data as well then that also
can be done from the existing
administrative console as well so again
this is a tool that most informatica
administrators would be playing around
with after that you have informatica
power center repository manager now this
basically helps you create your various
repositories manage your various folders
as well as the users and groups now
again what is the repository here you
need to understand is that it's quite
similar to the project folder that you
would be creating in your PyCharm or
Eclipse as such so all the work that you
will be doing usually is stored in a
project here it's referred to as a
repository as such now in your
development site you have mainly three
tools you have informatica power center
designer workflow manager and workflow
monitor your designer helps you mainly
create
the ETL mappings are such basically what
you're going to do is that you're going
to define the flow of data from the
source to the target definition in
between any operation that you want
would be considered to be a
transformation and that would be
included as part of your mapping now
mappings themselves are not directly
executable assets so for that you need
to create a workflow associated with it
so once you create your workflow then
you can go on to execute your mapping
which will be done in the workflow
manager now if you want to see the
status of your workflow you want to
manipulate it you want to start it stop
it restarted or even check the status of
an executing workflow you can do that in
informatica power center workflow
monitor as such now again just remember
each of these tools because these are
the most essential tools with
informatica power center now moving
forward let's look at informatica power
center administrative console now again
as the name suggests this is the console
where you would be working with and
again you'd be mainly performing
operations like managing various
applications various services creating
new domain objects configuring your node
and so forth now move forward let me
connect to my cloud service where I have
already configured my informatica power
center
okay so this is my cloud service on
which I have already configured my
informatica power center so always make
sure before you're working with
informatica power center the informatica
service is running in the background
okay I'm sorry about that okay so this
is my informatica power center
administrative console so here you can
see that the service is presently not
running so I'm gonna start this okay and
let me login to my administrative
console again the reason that I have
started the service is because if it's
not running in the background the
communication would not take place
now again by default the first page that
you would be looking is the managed
domain now here basically you can manage
your various services as well as
associated applications running here so
let's say if you are running an email
service I'm running a workflow and there
and what happens is that after every
workflow executes
I need a mail sent to me so I can
configure that here apart from that you
have two major associated services in
informatica that you always need to
remember you have your informatica
integration service and you have
informatica repository source now
remember how I told you what repository
service was basically it's basically
it's like your project folder so
everything that you're going to be
creating in informatica is going to be
stored in a database as well so
repository service is basically the
service which collects all the objects
that you are creating and stores it in
your database so let's see if you're
working with the source that would be
considered as an object let's say if
you're working with and target that is
also considered to be an object a
mapping that you create also an object
so everything is going to be stored in a
database and your repository service is
the service that does this now
integration service is the most
essential service while you're working
with informatica
this is the service that actually does
all the work now once you've designed
the workflow and the mapping the
integration service is the actual
service that takes the data from the
sources performs all the operations that
you have specified and finally stores
stores it in your target database as
well so remember these two service
because these are the Extension Service
in informatica now apart from this let's
say if you were configuring your
different nodes and services so you have
the option present here now you can see
here by default I have my informatica
integration service my repository
service and license management present
here as well there's also a single load
now what I've done here is that I have
basically installed my informatica
server and client on the same system so
that it's easy for me to show you both
the tools as such but usually what
happens is the server is stored on the
actual server and usually each system
gets the client installed on this now
there are various things that you can
explore here let's say if you want to
monitor what each one of the people are
doing each one of the nodes you can do
that as well
or if you want to see you want to log to
refer to as what operations each one has
done or let's say you want to see who
has called for which service all these
can be present viewed here so again this
is something most administrators would
be working on with now the final thing
that I want to show you here is with
respect to the security aspect now since
I am a single user I have not defined
the security users or roles here now
what you need to understand here is that
not everyone would get the same access
while you're working in a company now
let's say there's a new team who's
working on an informatica product
usually what happens is it's the team
leader who gets the access to the
repository manager and that members
would usually get access to the client
tools now this is mainly because once
you make any changes with respect to the
repository
it cannot be reverted back let's say by
a mistake someone actually deletes your
repository or let's say the project
folder as such then you cannot recover
this so this is where your users roles
and security features actually come into
picture
okay now going back to our presentation
I hope you've got a simple understanding
of the administrative console as such
now the next tool next tools to explore
will explore it through a demo as per
the session now what we're basically
trying to do is that we have a retail
organizations data and we want to
understand our customers better so I
have my product as well as transaction
details present on flat files and my
customer detail is present in my
database I'm going to load all this data
into informatica power center and then
I'm going to create process various
transformations on this and finally
store it into a data warehouse future
anytime that I want the data would be
present in the data warehouse from which
I can create various data visualization
now we'll break down this solution into
four phases now in our first phase will
be using informatica power center
repository manager now here basically
we're going to create our work folder
and ensure that all the sources
transformations mapping and workflow
would be stored here
so let me go back to my remote desktop
okay and let me launch the informatica
power center repository manager you know
again if any of you are actually trying
to look into install informatica you can
check out the link to install
informatica on your system and then
begin your journey as well so again
these are the four tools that you will
be working with informatica power center
a+ manager designer workflow manager and
workflow monitor so let me start with r
a+ manager so this is what my repository
manager would look like so here again
you can configure your various domains
and then you can also configure your
various repositories now it's not
necessary that one domain should just
have one repository and it's something
usually major Pro and usually in major
practices what happens is you have
multiple repositories working when there
are different teams working on different
projects so each project would be under
a specific repository as such okay
now I've already configured my
repository so let me just connect to it
okay now by default you would not be
seeing any fold up present here so first
let me begin by creating our work folder
so click on create and it's going to ask
you a name for the work folder so for
today's session what I'm going to do is
that I'm going to call it live folder
okay one thing you need to remember is
that in naming convention of informatica
you cannot use space okay
so always remember that white space
cannot be used in naming convention okay
so I'll just click on OK and a new
folder gets created now here there's
nothing present as part of this folder
because if you go inside this
configuration folder present here in
future when we are going to create the
various sources the targets mapping and
workflow each one is correspondingly
going to get a separate folder as such
now again as i stoled repository manager
can be used to check the details with
respect to the project's present so
let's say you want to search for
something that is present in a folder so
you can do that as well okay you have
the analyze option here where you can
analyze the various dependencies as well
as search for a specific mapping or a
source now let's say there's a specific
mapping that you have created and you
want to use it again but you're not sure
where exactly it's present so you can
search it by a target keyword or let's
say you want to search it completely you
can do that as well now again this is
something that's very important for and
informatica administrators and project
leaders as such moving forward let's
look at the second phase of our project
okay now here what we need to do is that
we need to create a mapping through
which we'll be loading our source
definition adding the transformation
creating the target definition and
finally we will connect them all as part
of a mapping so let me go back to my
informatica repository manager and
launch the informatica power center
designer now there are two ways that I
can approach this I can either go back
to my start option and launch
informatica power center designer from
there or I can actually launch it from
here now informatica provides you this
option of quickly quick launching of
each of its tools so if I click on the
designer option present here it will
automatically launch informatica power
center designer so this is my
informatica power center designer
okay now I'll just give you a brief so
with respect to how this works so to
your left you have the navigation panel
when you can find the different folders
for both sources targets cubes
dimensions transformations so everything
that you get everything that you create
here as I said would be considered as an
object and then it would be stored
inside these corresponding folders as
such okay now the bottom the bottom pane
is for your output so this is where the
output for any operation that you
perform would be present now coming to
the workspace now there are mainly five
workspace in informatica power center
design will be mainly working with three
as part of this session the first is
source analyzer workspace here basically
any operation that you wish to perform
with your source can be done okay so
let's say you want to load your source
you want to modify it or make or remove
specific rows from a source as well
every of those option would be done here
because moving further you cannot
manipulate the source details in any of
the other workspaces similarly you have
the target designer workspace so any
operation you wish to perform with
respect to your target definition also
has to be done here let's say you want
to create a target definition that would
be done here
or let's say you want to modify an
existing target definition again has to
be done here as well the third and the
most important workspaces are mapping
designer workspace okay so here what
happens is this is the place where you
are going to create all the mappings and
define the data flow so let's go back to
our source and source design our source
analyzer workspace and begin by
importing our sources okay now first
what I'm going to do is that I'm going
to import it from a data so you just
click on the source option present here
and click on import from database option
now once you do that it is going to
specify which connection do you want to
specify use okay now what you need to do
is that let's say you have a database
present in your system you need to
create a connection object from
informatica to connect to the database
so again just click on the three dots
present here and then you get this
option of user DSN here press on add and
then you can specify which kind of
driver it is now I have already
configured this so I'm not going to
reconfigure it as of now okay now I need
to specify the user to the state
and once I click on connect it's going
to give me which tables are visible to
this user okay so this is my customer
table so I'm just going to import this
so if I click on ok it's going to load
my customer table now before I move
forward here let me show you the table
in my Oracle database
so this is my Oracle database which I've
connected using the SQL Developer now I
want to connect to my HR underscore SRC
database now here let me select star
now let me just run this query so that
you can get an idea of what kind of data
we are working with so here you have
your customer ID you have the name of
the customer the address city country
contact number and their corresponding
email okay now there are 10,000 entries
in this table so we'll be loading this
completely to our informatics our Center
now again with respect to the capability
of informatica power center it can
process thousands of rows in just
minutes now we will be seeing how
effective and useful it is why we have
executing this mapping as well
okay so I have loaded my customer
database now let me load it from let me
load my product as well as transaction
details from a flat file so let me click
on sources and import from file so I
have my customer details so I don't want
this because it's all be present in my
database
now again while you're loading a file to
informatica you can load only a single
file okay so what you need to do is that
select the single file and then process
with the file wizard now this is a flat
file basically a comma separated flat
file now it said it's using a delimiter
rather than a fixed width difference now
in the first step what you basically
need to do is that ensure which type of
flat file it is and then ensure that you
have clicked import field names from the
first line because this helps
informatica understand the headers for
the table ok once you've done with this
click on next now in the second step
basically you need to specify whether
it's using a text qualifier or if it's
using a delimiter that is not comma so
you can choose anything's present here
finally click on next and you'll be
reaching the third step this step
basically helps you specify the data
type as well as precision associated
with respect to each column as such so
again once you're done with this just
click on finish now again what you need
to understand here is that it's not the
complete data that gets uploaded here ok
this is basically a metadata of the data
that is present in your database or the
flat file as such let me load the third
file as well so we've load our crust
load
customers our product now we need the
transaction details
so again import from file
so I hear I have already loaded my three
source files so now let's begin creation
of our mapping so let's go back to the
mapping designer workspace and here let
me bring in all the sources as such now
here you can see the separation right
inside the source folder there is based
on fat file and then there is based on
the database so this is how informatica
differentiates these okay now let me
bring in all the sources let me bring in
the product table that me so first thing
I need to do is set the name for my
mapping now again by convention you
follow you start every mapping with a
small M followed by the name of the map
again no white space is here so live it
M underscore live as such so click on OK
and we are going to create a mapping now
you see when I had only just one source
definition now something new has been
added this is basically a transformation
that informatica automatically creates
okay so this transformation is called
source qualifier transformation this
gets created whenever you are working
with either a relational table or a flat
file source basically what it does here
is that it converts this data types of
these relational tables into informatica
supported data types okay I'll just show
you the difference here
okay just notice here where my product
already initially was of type number it
has changed to decimal now again this
basically helps informatica integrate
your data from different sources and as
one of the major factor why informatica
is so effective while working with
different data types different data
sources I am sorry okay now
simultaneously let me load my
transaction details as well
and let me load in my customer tables
okay it's a very big workspace so I hope
you guys can see it so again see the
same I had loaded a relational table
from my database and I had loaded two
flat files so for all of these the
source qualifier transformation is
created now this is really helpful when
you want to process the data before you
perform any operations on this let's say
there are two tables that are coming
from the same database and I want to
join them I can do that using the source
qualifier transformation without using
any other transformation here okay just
go inside the source qualifier
transformation and you have the option
to edit the transformation now once you
double click on any transformation you
can modify this now if you go into the
port's option this tells you the
different ports or the column numbers
which are associated from the source
okay so any operation that you want to
change here can also be done now coming
to the statement of joining two tables
that can be done here okay so let's say
I have two tables and I want to specify
a join condition with respect to that is
the user defined chart so I can just
click on this arrow mark and then it
will help me specify which column to add
now since transaction is a flat file I
cannot do that so let me go down to my
customer table and just show you an
example okay so you can see here we use
a defined joint field is open here so
click on the sarama and then I can
actually choose the port based on which
I want to join these tables okay so
again let's say two tables coming from
same database based on the condition I
specify here I can join them once I have
specified the condition if I click on
generate SQL it will also automatically
generate an SQL for the expression that
I have specified so that is the join
condition okay so it's really helpful
and your work gets cut short to do a lot
of huge extend actually okay now again
let's say I don't want all the data to
come from my data source I want to
specify a filter condition you can do
that as part of my source filter
condition
so here I just specify which data needs
to come through and it filters the state
apart from that if you want to ensure
only distinct values come from the
source you can just click on select a
state so there's a lot of operations
that you can perform and again as I
mentioned informatica is a
limbic pole so spending even days on
this you would still have not exploded
completely I myself have not completely
exported informatica so definitely this
is something that is quite interesting
now what will be first doing is that
let's try to join our transaction
details to our product details basically
what this will help me understand is the
details with respect to the products
which are bought in each of the
transaction okay now for that we're
going to use our first transformation
now again informatica has close to 38
different transformations as part of it
and a lot more that keeps coming so
which to choose is the first question
that you need to understand now since I
am going to join only two
transformations sorry two data sources
I'm going to use something known as to
join her transformation so click on
transformation option here and select
create option once you do that you get
the complete list of transformations
that are available here now again as I
said there are different kinds of
transformations present to perform
different operations and informatica
will leave you completely puzzled with
respect to how it works out
so let's try to explore each one of them
in our upcoming sessions but today let's
start with joyner transformation okay
now again let me start neighbor J in our
product underscore transaction
once I click on create this
transformation gets created so this is
my transformation I'm done with this so
let me bring it and add it here now what
I need to do is that I need to connect
my source qualifiers to my joiner
transformation and it needs to have the
corresponding columns also present in it
so for that just click on select all
drag it and drop it into my joiner
transformation this basically does two
things firstly it replicates all the
columns or ports present in this
transformation into my joiner
transformation as well as it creates a
connectivity between the source
qualifier transformation and the joiner
transformation that I have just created
now only one transformation or one
source definition has been linked to my
joiner transformation it's time I linked
the second one so again select all drag
it and drop it okay now I have created a
connection between my source to my
joiner transformation but my job is not
done here I need to still specify the
condition based on which these data has
to get join so for that I will click on
the joiner transformation and then go to
the condition tab here basically it's
going to ask you whether you need to
take the master or the detail now let's
come back to the master and detail
little later let me just click on add a
new condition option okay now here it is
going to give me different columns
present here so I have my invoice number
stock code description quantity so again
what I can understand from this is that
it is coming from my transaction table
so my master refers to my transaction
table detail basically is then going to
refer to my product table
so here what informatica is doing that
is this labeling the two tables as
master and detail to help you
differentiate between them
now usually masters are tables which
have the signal refills okay let's say I
want more detail with respect to a
product then I am going to set the table
which has the product ID as the master
and the table which has relevantly all
the details with respect to product as
detail okay so this by default has set
it now what I'm going to do is that I'm
going to specify the join condition now
I'm going
based on the product ID so product ID
one from my transaction table is equal
to my product ID so if we go back to the
properties table I'm sorry if we go back
to the ports table here you can see the
different ports that are present so
there are 17 ports present here now I
don't want all of them to be taken out
so what am I going to do is that I'm
gonna uncheck the option from
input-output so you see the I and hope
resin here this is not 1 and 0 guys this
is I and Howe
so it basically helps you understand
which is an input port which is an
output port basically again with respect
to a data flow it helps you
differentiate between which is an
incoming value and which one you should
go out now in our case let's say I do
want the rating nor the seller details
the the price day I'm gonna remote
department company number sold discount
I'm going to keep the invoice number
stock code
I don't need description quantity state
I'm going to keep an invoice date unit
price okay customer ID yes definitely
and I don't want the product ID again so
I'm going to uncheck this basically what
I have done here is that two mites will
join a transformation all the ports are
inputs but only the select port should
go as output now this is what I have
ensured by checking these options here
ok once I'm done with this just click on
apply and ok so till here what I've done
is that I have joined the data coming
from these two tables based on a
condition that the product ID from the
product table is equal to the product ID
from the transaction table ok now based
on this all the data would get joined
and sent across from here now again
talking about join operations normally
in SQL you have four different types of
charge similarly in the joiner
transformation you also you have that so
just double click here let me go back to
my properties so here you have the joint
types option ok you can either have a
normal joint master outer join detail
outer join and full outer join
basically your left join a right Chuck
ok so this is how it has classified it
so we are not going to change with
respect to know the type of child
okay so fury here I hope you guys find
it quite interesting now moving forward
I want to join this detail that is the
details with respect to transaction and
product to my customer data okay
so what I'm going to do I'm going to
create another Joyner transformation so
again I can either go back to my
transformation tab and select Joyner or
I can select Joyner from here so this is
basically a shortcut to different
transformations now again you might be
wondering why am i using two different
join us to join three tables basically
the restriction with the Joyner
transformation is that you can only join
two sources or two inputs from through
Joyner transformation okay so with the
second Joyner I'm going to join these
two these three tables are such okay so
here first I will bring my customer
details select all drag and drop it
similarly let me select everything from
here and drag and drop it to my gist
second joint transmission now what you
need to understand here is that all the
tools that are present here all the
columns that are present here how many
columns are present here I think there's
seventeen two columns present here let
me see in the second join a
transformation if everything comes here
now again if you see here there are
close to 24 ports now I don't need all
of them as part of this so I don't need
a duplicate Product ID select this let
me remove it let me remove quantity I
don't want description
so this basically happens because I have
dragged and dropped let's say
individually select it then this would
not happen but again even though these
columns are present here they are not
selected as output if you'll notice here
they're just inputs they are not going
as output so it does not make much
difference but I don't want data
inconsistency to happen here so I'm
going to remove all these ports which
does not have an output specified again
the alternative to this manual work is
that you manually drag and drop the
columns okay
okay this is a bit better now I have to
basically work with 14 different columns
now again let's specify the condition so
the condition here our new condition is
always with reference to the customer ID
so customer ID is going to be linked to
the customer ID of the customer table
customer ID from a previous joint to the
customer ID of my customer table okay
and let me go back let me just check
this once again alright everything seems
okay I'll click on apply and click on ok
so with this we've almost completed our
transformation now I basically have the
details of the product of my customer
has purchased with respect to every
transaction so this becomes a highly
detailed data so let's say I want to
filter or group it with respect to the
customer details for that what I'm going
to do is that I'm going to create a new
transformation known as aggregation
Transocean now aggregation
transformation basically as the names of
this helps you perform various
aggregation operation so here I'm just
going to click on application
transformation and then again click in
the workspace so here I have an
aggregation transformation created to
this I'm going to select all the columns
present here and then drop it so
automatically these gets replicated here
as well as linked now inside my
aggregator transformation I have a
useful option known as group by ok if
you see the last column sure is group so
I'm going to group by the customer
details or the customer ID now again
there are two customer IDs here so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to uncheck
this option present here okay now this
ensures that there is only going to be
one customer ID and it's going and my
data is going to be grouped based on my
customer ID as such so once this is set
I'm going to click on OK but again let
me show you one interesting thing now
aggregation transformation can also be
used to specify a value to a port or a
column as such so let's say there's a
column that is present here to which you
want to create annual now
can give you a better example let's say
I have the details of my employees now I
have their basic pay I have their HRA I
have their TA and then I know how much
tax has to be cut so to specify the
total amount what I'll do is I'll just
use an aggregation transformation
wherein I'll specify the condition based
on which the total salary has to be
calculated so for that there's this
option of adding an expression so let's
say let me just show you how it's how
you going to do that so the moment you
uncheck the output option it basically
assumes that this value is going to be
sorry the moment you uncheck the input
option it basically understands this
value is going to be computed so it it
unlocks the expression column present
you if you click on this arrow option
then you get the expression editor so
here you can specify the expression
based on which the value has to be
computed now again if you look at the
various functions that are present in
aggregate or transformation this is the
complete list okay there are a lot of
options that you can perform so again
this is something that you can
definitely explore
apart from this any expression that you
wish to perform there's also a separate
transformation known as expression
transformation so again there are
different ways to approach a problem as
such so for now let me just cancel this
and click on apply so with this let me
just summarize what we have done till
here we have taken the details of our
product we have taken the details of our
transaction and joint them based on the
product ID after that we bought in the
details of the customer and then we've
joined the earlier details with the
customer details as well finally I have
created an aggregator transformation
based on which this data is going to be
grouped finally I need to create a
target definition target definition
basically is where my target has to be
stored now again there are two ways to
approach this first I can begin by
creating a target definition from
scratch now that's a very tedious work
that I have to follow rather than that
I'm going to take the second approach
this basically is modeling the target
definition based on a transformation I
have already created now there are two
advantage of this firstly it reduces of
my work of
designing the structure of my target
table secondly it copies all the
transfer all the columns as well as data
types decisions associated in that
transformation now rather than telling
this let me show you how it start so if
you want to model a target definition
based on any transformation right click
the transformation and go to the option
of create and add target once you click
on this a target definition gets created
based on the transformation okay so if
you notice here it's almost the same as
my aggregated transformation but if you
see I had unchecked the option for
customer ID 1 so that is not present
here now I want to modify this target
definition now if you remember I had
mentioned you cannot manipulate the
source definition or the target
definition in any other workspace apart
from their respective workspaces so
let's say I want to make anything this
then I need to go to the target analyze
a target designer workspace
ok so helping you understand let me
double-click this and if you go to the
poor's option you cannot modify any ants
this present here so let me go back to
my target this target designer workspace
and here let me bring in the target
definition so I'll drag this and drop it
now first what I'm going to do is that
I'm going to begin by renaming this now
I don't like the name aggr trance so I'm
going to rename it TGT that is for
understanding it's a target definition
and I'll call it final ok with this
click on OK and the target definition
gets renamed now by default it has
selected as the data database type to be
Oracle now I don't want it to be an
Oracle database file I want it to be a
flat file then I can change now there
are various different types of database
files that you can create now I'm going
to choose flat file for this now even
when I choose flat file it's going to
ask me for more information whether it
has to eat delimited file or it should
be a fixed width 5 if you click on
advanced you have the option of even
specify what the delimiter should be ok
so let's say if you want to make any
changes with respect to the columns and
let's say you want to change the name of
the column or if you want to set the
column to be key
all the operations can be done here so
basically this is a workspace where you
can modify your target definition so I'm
not going to make any changes with
respect to this I'll just click on apply
click on OK and we have our updated
target definition now if you go back to
your mapping design of workspace first
thing that you need to notice here is
that the target definition present here
is not updated so let me first delete
this and then bring in the updated
target definition ok so finally what I
need to do
is that I need to close this data flow
so for that I need to link this
aggregator transformation to my target
definition again I can either select all
and then join it or right-click and then
I have the option of auto link auto link
basically it helps you link to
transformations and complete your flow
now here it's asking me from which
transformation so it should come from my
aggregator transformation ok so as you
see the name is similar now it is going
to ask me to which transformation so it
needs to get connected to my TGT final
transformation so with this you know the
next step is basically by defining how
the auto link should happen either
should it be based on name or based on
the position of the ports for now I'm
going to keep it as name because they
follow the same naming conventions so if
I click on apply now automatically the
link gets created finally when I click
on ok I have completed my mapping design
ok now this is slightly complicated for
me to get a complete view so what I'll
do is I'll just right click ok let me
just click on the workspace and I'll
choose arrange all iconically
so this will convert the entire mapping
to an iconic representation so I have my
customer table I have my product table I
have my transaction table product and
transaction is going to get joined to
adjoin a transformation then this joint
data is going to get joined with the
customer data so basically I'm
performing a double join here once this
is done I'm going to pass it to an
aggregator transformation through which
I'm going to group the data based on my
customer details and finally I'm going
to store into my target definition which
is a flat file ok now the final step of
this is basically to save this operation
now once I press control s it is going
to save this while this is done
basically it also checks if it is a
valid transformation valid mapping
assets now if you see here this
operation which has happened so it's
trying to validate it now it sees that
the data flow is correct but again it
finds her inconsistency now in my
aggregator transformation customer name
has an invalid reference
okay so thereby it ensures that my map
that I buy it has notified me that the
mapping has become invalid so I need to
go back to my aggregator transformation
and check it again so this is why
informatica is really helpful so even
while you're designing a mapping it
checks now so this is something that was
mistake on my part I had to recheck the
input option here because we I had shown
you the expression option it has
considered this to be an invalid thing
so again click on apply the pink click
on OK and save this so now you can see
it has considered it to be a valid
transformation because I have specified
that the value of customer name is going
to come as input I clear to here I hope
you guys have an understanding so moving
on now is the time that we go to the
third phase of our solution okay in
phase 3 we basically have to create a
workflow involving various tasks and
components which will help us execute
our mapping ok as I had mentioned we
have basically just defined a flow of
the data from the source
what kind of operation has to happen on
the data and finally where it has to get
stored now we actually have to initiate
the data flow for that we need to create
a mapping so let me go back and here
launch the third third to last part of
today's session that is informatica
power center workflow manager
okay so this is my informatica power
center workflow manager okay let me just
hold on to this one second I'll just
give you a brief overview with respect
to the two workspaces that we have
missed out here now as you can see there
are different transformations I have
created now let's say there's a specific
transformations I want to use across
multiple mappings that I'm going to
create let's say the same aggregation
operation has to be performed on
different mappings it's gonna get the
same input it's going to give the same
output and the same aggregation
operation has to be done now rather than
recreating it every time what I can do
is that I can actually make this
transformation as a reusable
transformation this will basically
ensure the same transformation can be
used across different mappings as such
remember how each of the source
definitions gets added in the source
folder and the target definition inside
the target folder similarly if you make
a transformation reusable it gets added
inside the transformation folder this
will make it easy for me to use it again
and again now let's see this series of
mapping let's say there's a complete
mapping that I want to use again and
again let's say I want to create a basic
mapping and then from there branch out
for different purposes then I can create
that I can call that as some applet
again similar to how you had a reusable
mapping reusable transformation you can
have a reuse will not be so the two
remaining workspaces that is an applet
designer workspace basically is used to
work with rust with your reusable
mapping and the transformation developer
workspace is used to work with respect
to your reusable transformations okay
now coming back to our flow manager this
is a workspace where we are going to
create our workflow or basically you're
gonna create a task which is going to
help execute your mapping as such okay
now again there are three workspaces
here you have a tossed out upper
workspace vocal a designer workspace
and workflow designer now in our session
we're just going to use the workflow
designer workspace here let me begin by
creating a new workflow so click on
workflow option present here and you
have the option of creating a new
workflow
now the naming convention for creating a
new workflow is that it should start
with WF followed by
the name of the mapping M underscore
life okay
so I'll click on okay and I have a start
I can present here this basically is
helping me understand that my workflow
is going to start from here now again
this is something that is useful this is
something that is very useful when
you're working with multiple mappings
because when you are working in the
industry you don't just create one
single mapping or one single operation
as such you have a lot of data you have
lot of analysis that you have to do so
for that you'll be creating multiple
mappings and these mappings can
themselves be interrelated as well so
this is just a simple understanding for
you but again in real times in order
when you're working with multiple
mappings you're going to create a very
big workflow as such so for today's
session we'll just create a simple
workflow so for now for create linking
our workflow to a mapping you need to
create a task known as a session task ok
session tasks basically helps you on
informatica understand that this is the
mapping that needs to get executed so
click on the session tasks present here
and then again click on the workspace
now it is going to ask me if which
mapping should be associated with this
session so I'm going to select the M
underscore live mapping workspace
mapping I'm sorry so once I do that
automatically a session gets later now
again this is not complete I know my
workflow is going to start from here I
know this mapping has to get executed so
what there needs to be is that there
needs to be a connectivity between these
two as these would not get executed
so select so dragged from start and drop
it to session so this becomes a flow ok
now my work flow is going to start and
then the following session is going to
get executed and in that session the
corresponding mapping that we have
defined is going to get executed as such
now again it's not completely we need to
actually specify from which data source
the data has to come where my flat file
is present and where the output file has
to be stored as well so for that you
need to go into the session properties
for that double-click the session icon
present here and then go to the mapping
option
now here you can find the details with
respect to your sources as well as your
targets and transformations now if you
click on the products or let me take the
customer okay now here it is going to
use a relational reader basically
because it's going to read from a
relational table and then it is going to
use a connection object now I have
already created a connection object to
my database so in case if you are
wondering on how to create a connection
object you can check out our video on
informatica tutorial where i have talked
in detail about creating connection
objects and working with informatica
power center as well so let me just
cancel this now there are no changes
here but let's say if you are working
with a flat file by default or
informatica checks in its default path
for it's so so for these source files
are such now this is not where the
source file is present if you actually
see my source file is present in my
downloads folder ok this is where my
source file is present so I have to
update this power so copy this and then
paste it here
ok so this it will check for my
transaction dot CSV file in this
location up same I need to do with
respect to my product table as well
now one last thing that I need to do is
with respect to my target folder now
with target file I'm sorry so in my
target file there are again two things
that I need to it firstly I need to
ensure that headers are present in my
target fat because this is what helps me
identify which column is for what
purpose so in my header option choose as
output field names this basically will
set the field names as headers as well
as the second thing that I need to do is
that I need to change the extension of
that okay by default what informatica
does is that it creates an output file
of the extension dot o UT but I needed
to be dot CSV because it's a comma
separated flat file so I'm changing it
to dot CSV let's say you want to put
present this file in a different
location you can specify the location as
well but right now I'm not changing this
because I can help you understand where
it is going to store this target file as
well so once I click on apply I am done
setting my session properties now again
let's save this workflow and as you can
see informatica is validating this as
well so here you can see informatica has
completely checked all the details with
respect to my workflow and then given me
a valid order so this is a very good
option from informatica which checks
every step of your process so every time
you save informatica ensures that you've
not made a mistake now again this is on
a very high level till here what I have
done is that I've just defined from
where my data has to come what operation
should be done on this data and where it
has to be stored now there may be still
some errors that occur while the actual
transfer of happens so for that you have
informatica power center workflow
monitor now automatically when you
execute this session workflow monitor
gets executed now to start a workflow
either go to the workflow tab and select
start workflow or just right-click on
the workspace and select start workflow
once you do this you can automatically
see the workflow monitor getting
launched so here you have the details
with respect to the session as well as
the workflow as such so you can see here
it has taken just four seconds for the
session to execute now to get more
details with respect to a session double
fill corner
and then you have the task details apart
from that let's see if you want to see
the source target statistics this is
something that is really helpful for you
to understand the transfer of the data
between the source and the target now if
you see here I had 10,000 rows of my
customer 3,000 of my product and 50,000
transaction data okay now I have loaded
all this data I have performed the
required operation and finally I have
nine thousand nine forty five rows
present here so basically informatica
has processed close to sixty five
thousand rows of data and then converted
it to just nine thousand five hundred
and forty five rows in a matter of four
seconds ok informatica is really
powerful in process in terms of data
processing this is just one example
earlier I had processed hit coreos equal
rows and I had performed almost close to
twenty one transformations all it took
me to get fifty thousand roses output
was just me eleven so that's how capable
informatica power center is okay this is
to give you a simple idea again to see
the output file okay by default
informatica target path is going to be
your installation folder inside so
inside informatica 10.1 server Infernus
koshered and this are these are the
default path for informatica so by
default informatica will check for the
source files in informatica installation
folder server in Fernandez core shared
and source file and the target files
will be created in the same directory
with respect to the target flights so
this is my target file okay now I do not
have a csv viewer but this is a rough
idea with respect to the target file
okay now there are basically 9000 rows
almost 10,000 rows present here so i'm
not able to show you it completely okay
but again i hope you've got a simple
understanding of how it works
now again I'm quite sure post the
session you've got an understanding of
each of the informatica power center
tools and how they work with each other
what is the role of each of the tools
and how you can work with respect to
them so I'm quite sure post this session
I my team would be sharing the
informatica installation
linked as well so you can you can go on
and install informatica on your system
and begin exploring your data okay now
with this we have come to the conclusion
of this session you can just to
summarize what we've started off we
start off by understanding what is
business intelligence we talked about
extract transform and load then we
talked about informatica power center
and then we saw a demo now for more
information on our informatica
certification training you can check out
our page yury korotkov slash informatica
and get the upcoming details with
respect to the informatica courses we
have both we day and weekend batches and
if you enroll and give us your detail
today as a goodwill gesture from our
side we can give you an additional 15%
discount since you've all stayed for
this long I would have written a
recommend that you do that so just given
your details here and our team would
correspondingly get in touch with you
now if you're looking for blocks that
can help you can check out our ad
ricardo dot co / blocks and find all the
details with respect to our informatica
blocks you can check out the interview
questions you can find it more details
on the transformation as well as get an
insight with respect to what is
informatica as well so here's the
installation block that is installing
from erica i9 is steps so with this you
can get started with informatica on your
system itself now finally if you're
looking for more details on informatica
you can check out our informatica power
