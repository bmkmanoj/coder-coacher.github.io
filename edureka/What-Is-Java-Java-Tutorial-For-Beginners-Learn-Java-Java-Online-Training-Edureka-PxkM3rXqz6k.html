eureka and today we'll be talking about
what this java now you must all have
heard about java from either your
colleagues your friend and must be
wondering what it is and what it is
going to be used for that is exactly
what we're going to be talking in
today's session so let's not waste any
time and let's move forward to today's
agenda so we'll start off by first
understanding what java is and where it
is going to be used then moving forward
we'll be discussing about the various
features of Java and the java
environment after that I'll help you
understand how Java works and then we'll
be deep diving into java by discussing
the various data types the operators as
well as functions in java finally
towards the end of the session we'll be
talking about the object-oriented
concepts in Java now to those of you who
do not know what object-oriented
concepts are this would be a good
insight to that so any questions with
respect to today's agenda
all right Laurence's is clear so is B
park Rachel Emily Stefan that's great to
see guys so without wasting any time
let's move forward and discuss the first
topic that is what is chella now Java is
a programming language that was created
by a team led by James Gosling in 1995
for Sun Microsystems now to help you
understand better the need for creating
a separate programming language in
itself while C and C++ we're dominating
in the industry was quite
straightforward
now James Coughlin and his team were
working with various Mobile's and pages
at that time when they had to develop
applications to handle the messaging
systems for these it became quite a
tedious task by using C and C++ so what
did they do they went ahead and created
a new language itself must say quite fun
people waiver so one of the key features
that made gel of one of the most popular
languages and is still the most popular
language is that of its platform
independence now when I say platform
independence you need to understand a
key term here that is right once and run
everywhere now what do I mean by right
one-cent run everywhere in Java
once you
have written your application you can
run it across any device any machine
that supports a java environment all you
need to have to run a Java program is to
have a simple Java environment present
in that device and then you can go ahead
and run your java application
now Java in itself is not just a
programming language it is also an
operational platform now when I talk
about your Java being an operational
platform what basically means that Java
gives you the simple virtual environment
through which you can run the various
Java programs now this virtual
environment once you have added to your
device or your machine then you can
without any hassle or any problem go
ahead and run a Java program
now with this I hope you've got a simple
understanding and introduction to what
this Java node to give you an
understanding of how Java grew
throughout the years let's look at the
history of Java versions now
the first version of Java again was
released in early 1996 and it was called
oak at that time but then again was
completely renamed to Java because of
width favorability now throughout the
years till 2014 you have eight versions
of Java that were released and the next
version Java 9 is also going to be
released in July of 2017 now there was a
lot of progress that happened throughout
the different versions of Java but we
are not going to go in depth with
respect to that so what we are going to
do now is we're going to address the
biggest question that all of you may
have that is where is Java being used
now to help you understand this I'm
going to discuss one of the most popular
domain as well as one of the key factors
which led to high demand of Java
developers and that domain is the
Android term now we are all familiar
with Android it is an operating system
that was released by Google but how many
of you know that the Android
applications as well as the Android
operating system in itself make
extensive use of Java as part of it now
even the Android operating systems are
built using core Java and still now use
the various KPIs that Java has to offer
again when you see with respect to the
various Android applications they are
completely written using Java as their
programming
now to give you even a broader
perspective I have just selected eight
of the most influenced domains by Java
now don't misunderstand that these are
the only domains which used other Java
is used pretty much everywhere starting
from your phone to your setup box to
satellites as well now we discussed
about each of these domains and how they
make use of Java to start off let's talk
over the most popular and trending
technology presently that is the Big
Data technology now here as of most of
you would have heard Hadoop is the most
preferred framework now Hadoop framework
was extensively developed using Java and
still makes use of various Java API as
part of its features you even have a key
concept of MapReduce that you're going
to be using and the big data domain then
comes the stock market domain now here
the algorithms which help you understand
which stock to buy are designed using
Java the applications in itself that is
used in the stock market is built using
Java as its core feature now the next
domain is the scientific and research
community now all of you are quite
familiar that in the scientific and
research community a lot of calculations
are going to be performed and the
numbers on which these calculations are
going to be performed is going to be
very huge now when you're using an
application to perform these operations
this needs to be highly powerful it
needs to be highly scalable and needs to
be precise and in that field Java is one
of the most preferred language to build
applications so most of your scientific
community applications are built using
Java as part of their code then comes
the IT domain now ID is the domain that
hires most of the Java developers on a
daily basis you have closed 50 million
applications developed using Java as
part of its code now this is not a
number that's going to reduce any day
and therefore this in itself should give
you an idea of how much job
opportunities there is once you have
grasped Java completely when you come
down to the banking doubling your
transaction processing and your
transaction management involves Java as
perfect security feature you're going to
be using various components of Java to
achieve your security feature
finally when you come down to the retail
domain when you go down to a supermarket
the billing application that you see
there that also is developed using Java
as part of that code again your
financial domain that your server-side
applications that is a heart of a
financial service that extensively is
written using Java itself now with this
I hope you've got a simple understanding
of how Java is going to be used across
different domains but again coming back
to my main point that is Java is used
everywhere so you can consider jar to be
a wide ocean that is spread all across
size but don't think of it as a bad way
think of it as an opportunity for you
when Java is spread across so many
domains when it's present all around us
just imagine how much job openings how
much opportunities it can bring free and
that exactly is what we're going to
ensure as part of your loan so till here
do any of you have any questions with
respect to what is Java and where it is
being used
so I usually is all clear Emily says
understood
so does Rachel Shruthi Varun Deepak
that's great to see you guys again I'm
going to emphasize that if at any point
if you have any doubts or if you do have
any queries pull it across to me
immediately so that I can clarify it
there in there itself now moving forward
let's look at some of the key features
that made Java one of the most popular
programming apps now these are the eight
key features that Java has to offer now
these are also referred to as the
buzzwords of Java and this is basically
because when Java was introduced in 1995
there was a white paper written on now
in the white paper these were the main
concepts that was focused on and that's
why they are referred to as buzzwords of
self now we'll be talking about each of
these features one by one we'll start
off with the simple feature now Java is
one of the most simple as well as
fundamental programming language that
anyone can pick up and trust me guys
Java is so simple at the same time the
possibility of what you can develop
using Java is infinite now compared to
the other fundamental programming
languages like C or C++
one of the key features that I like with
respect to Java is that the concept of
memory management is abolished here that
is you do not need to worry about the
Pointer concepts that you may have heard
of in C or C++ Java completely takes
care of your memory management here so
automatically everything is done by Java
here again moving forward to the next
feature that this portability now we've
already discussed of how Java is
portable but to give you a better
understanding let's say you are
developing an application in a Windows
system but your client is going to
require to run that program on a Mac
machine you do not need to worry about
as long as he has a Java environment set
up in his system the code would be
optimized to his system and it can be
run without any problems now this is not
this between Windows and Mac it could be
any operating system it could be a Linux
operating system like Red Hat or UNIX
and your Java code would run across all
these operating systems
apart from that your Java program also
would not bother about your
configuration of your sister it will
optimize itself to meet the hardware
requirements of that system now we've
already talked about how Java is an
object-oriented programming language now
there are mainly two styles of
programming language you have your
procedural style and object-oriented
style Java follows an object-oriented
approach here everything is an object
starting from the variables that you'll
be using to the operations that you're
going to be performing are going to be
done through objects okay so I have my
first question here Emily is asking me
what do I mean by procedural style and
how is it different from object-oriented
programming style now Emily you need to
understand few things here before I go
into that now basically these are two
approaches that the programming
languages follow now when you look at a
procedural oriented programming that
basically you follow a top-down approach
that is let's say you have certain
sequence of operations that you wish to
perform in a procedural oriented
programming then you'll be executing
each of them one after the other but in
an object-oriented programming style if
you wish you can perform them one by one
or you if you want you can even execute
them simultaneously the order does not
depend on a top-down approach
basically whichever is important will be
executed first again when you talk about
the procedural style then mainly the
sequence of actions is given importance
but in an object-oriented programming
style here you are giving more
importance to the data on which you're
performing these operations so with this
I hope you've got a simple understanding
of how they're different and what each
one is so any other questions ok so
moving forward let's look at the next
feature that is the secure feature
now when we talk about security it's
always a concern that when you're
running an application from someone else
will it corrupt my data will it affect
my data will it take some of my data and
give it to someone but with a java
application you do not need to worry
about that java basically has this
sandbox that is present inside your
virtual machine which is an isolated
environment so what I mean by isolated
environment is what happens is your Java
program is running inside a virtual
machine which has no access to your
actual machines hardware therefore in
itself it prevents the access of the
application to your hard disk and your
data is completely secure again here the
concept of memory management also comes
in where you do not need to worry about
how the memories management takes place
that is completely managed by Java in
itself after that we have the
distributed feature now there are mainly
two things that you need to understand
when we talk about the distributed
feature of Java the first is that once
you've written a java application then
you can go ahead and distribute it to
anyone who wishes to run the application
as long as they have a Java environment
on their device now again as I've told
this device could be from a setup box to
your high performance computer as long
as they have a simple Java environment
present in the system they can go ahead
and take your application and run a
passion that Java has this unique
feature known as remote method
invocation now let's say you're going to
give your user a program but that
program requires a specific method
inside another program now this becomes
a hurdle while you are executing a
program because there's a certain
dependency that is not met but through
the RMI it is achieved where you can
remotely execute that method that is
present on another system and this
system could either be connected locally
or it could be connected even through
your internet now don't worry too much
about what the RM is we'll be talking
about it in our upcoming sessions but
with this I hope you've got a simple
understanding of the five features that
we have discussed now moving forward
let's talk about the dynamic feature
Java is a highly dynamic book the reason
that I'm telling you this is because
there is
a lot of dynamic detailing that comes in
before you execute that program now if
you go back to our portability feature I
told you how your Java program once
written can be run on any system this
basically is because of its dynamic
feature where all the execution
environment details is only taken just
before you run that program this in
itself decreases a lot of dependencies
on that program and makes it highly
dynamic as such then comes your robust
feature now there are two concepts here
that you need to be clear of the first
is that every program that you write
that is checked before you compile the
code as well as before you run a test so
a quality check is always ensured before
you compile it as well as before you run
it as such and the second main feature
is that Java takes care of memory
management again here it takes about
your memory of your system then
correspondingly allocates the memory for
its required variables and operations
finally consider Ava's high performance
feature now you already seen how Java is
used in different of it even the
scientific community where you're
dealing with huge amount of data makes
users are extensively that in itself
should have given you a simple idea of
how Java is achieving its high
performance now there is a key term here
that you need to be aware of that is
byte code basically the Java code once
you've written will not directly be
converted to a java application as such
first it's converted to a byte code and
then this bytecode is converted to your
java application when you want to run it
now this bytecode is something that can
scale as well as exist to your system
configuration now through this you're
going to achieve high performance so a
java application may run differently on
a system with low configuration and may
run differently on a system that has
high configuration always the
performance is kept in mind and as well
as the other features of Java now any
questions still here with respect to the
different features of Java
okay well Rudin's asked me which will
have more preference performance or
memory management now warren by default
both would have equally high preference
by
then again you can change it as per your
requirement let's say you have a device
which has slow configuration then you
can configure your program to be more
favorable to memory management but let's
say you wanna achieve high performance
then you can configure it to meet the
high performance stamp was that key
overrun all right so since there are no
more questions let's move forward to the
next topic that is Java environment now
we've talked about how Java works as an
operational platform but we have not
gone in depth with that and some of you
may still be fuzzy on how you're going
to run a Java program on your system and
this concept will help you clarify that
now the first thing that you want to run
any Java program is a java virtual
machine this is not an actual machine
it's just an abstract virtual machine on
which you're going to be running your
java program so as long as you have a
java virtual machine present on your
system you can go ahead and run a Java
program
we need to have the JVM present on that
system now this is basically in case of
a simple application but let's say you
want to develop a slightly complex
program that uses different features of
Java then you're going to need the
second component that is the Java
Runtime environment this basically is an
extension of the Java Virtual Machine
but you're going to have with these
classes and libraries in which all your
features are perfect so if you want to
execute a complex application then you
need to have the Java Runtime n-well but
again last but not least comes the most
essential component for a developer that
is the Java development kit this
basically is again an extension of Java
Runtime environment but here you will
also have the development tools so in
case as a developer if you want to write
a Java program if you wanna develop Java
applications then you need to have the
Java development kit present in your
system so are you clear with respect to
the different Java environments
available ok so screw T is clear source
Rachel Deepak is also clear that screen
now moving forward let's try to
understand how does Java work now once
you've written your Java code
then how do you convert this Java code
pure java application the first thing
that you're going to do is that you're
going to give it to a java c compiler
now this will be present in your system
itself when you compile the program a
java c compiler is called and that will
convert your code to a class file again
when i say a class file this is a
bytecode so basically it's your
intermediate file now one key feature
that you need to understand about the
bytecode is that not anyone can create
this code so through the bytecode you
are not only achieving high performance
but you are also ensuring the security
of your code now this basically is an
intermediate file it is neither similar
to your high level language nor is it
similar to your low-level language and
therefore it ensures both security and
high performance as such so let's say
you are working for an organization then
what you want to do is that you are
going to go ahead and create your Java
source code then you're going to give it
to your Java compiler and then you're
finally going to get your class file now
once you have this class file you can go
ahead and give it to your client he will
neither be able to see your code but at
the same time his requirement for the
application would also have met but once
he has the code how will he be able to
execute and that's exactly where your
Java Virtual Machine comes here you have
a Java interpreter as well as your JIT
compile this basically will translate
your bytecode to an object file an
object file basically is a file which
you can go ahead and execute and once
you've executed this code you can see
the output okay so I have another
question here from Shruthi shooties ask
me what is a compiler and what is an
interpreter now it should be the basic
functionality of both a compiler and
interpreter are the same they check if
there is any error present in your code
but how they differ is that a compiler
completely reads your code and gives you
all the errors present in your code but
at the same time what an interpreter
does is that it reads the code line by
line and checks if there is any error at
any point if it meets an error then it
returns the error and does not process
further so until you have cleared that
error your Java interpreter will not
move
so are you clear fruity alright now to
give you a little more detailed
understanding of how this works let's
look at three diagrams here now we have
talked about the first half of this
operation where you have a Java source
code which is then again sent to a Java
compiler which will change it to a
bytecode that is a dot class file once
you have a dot class file that is the
bytecode then you can go ahead and
transfer this Java bytecode either
locally or through a network now in the
runtime environment that is the
environment where your customer wishes
to execute this program you basically
have three different competence now your
first component is the class loader
again when we talk about class loader
this basically loads all the
dependencies that your program requires
then comes your bytecode verifier now
the main objective of the bytecode
verifier is to ensure that the code that
you have written has not been tampered
with
now again this could be something that
would happen while you are transferring
the file or someone would have
purposefully changed your code and your
bytecode verifier always ensures that
your code is the same that you had
written before you compile it now once
your bytecode verifier has set and
ensured that your code is correct then
this code is passed to your Java
interpreter and your JIT compiler which
is then translated and give it to your
runtime system once your runtime system
has this code then it will give it to
your operating system which will then go
ahead and give the details to your
hardware so I hope with this you've got
a complete understanding of how your
java code works ok debug is clear so is
where own should be Rachel Emily that's
great to see now enough of theoretical
knowledge let's go ahead and first
install Java on your system what you
need to do is that you need to download
JDK that is Java development kit not
just Java when you search for Java and
download it it basically is your java
runtime environment so i'll just show
you how it's done so all you need to do
is go to google and search for jdk
download
so here you can go ahead and click on
the first link and this will direct you
to the Java development kit download
page so here all you need to do is click
on download which will redirect you to
the download page and here you can
download your Java development kit
according to your system configuration
so if you're using a Linux machine or if
you're using a Mac you can choose the
corresponding version and download now
the installation of java is quite
straightforward all you need to do is
just keep clicking next and once you're
done please let me know in case if
you're facing any troubles also do let
me know so that I can help you debug
your problems that's great so now that
all of you have installed Java
development kit on your system comes the
most important part that is setting the
path of your java environment now there
are basically five steps that you need
to follow let me show you how it's done
now you can follow the steps in case if
you're using Windows 7 or any later
versions as well so once you're inside
your my computer just right-click and
then go to the properties option here
you have an option known as advanced
system settings just click on that and
you get a pop-up here at the bottom you
have an option that is environment
variables once you click on that you get
your next pop-up and here for most of
you you may have to add a new variable
but I already have available so what you
need to do is click on new and then you
need to specify the variable name to the
path and then you need to give the
location of your JDK now in case if you
do not know the location of JDK let's go
back to my computer by default your Java
development kit is stored inside just
see Program Files Java JDK
and--but so take this complete path
copied
specified name to be path and then give
the path now I've already configured it
so I do not need to reconfigure it but
in case if you already have a path felt
in this double click on it go to the end
put a semicolon and then give the path
so let me know in case that any of you
are facing any troubles I will be able
to assist you now the final step to
check if your java environment has been
configured successfully is you need to
run a specific command so just open your
command prompt and then just type Java C
now if you get the following message
then you have correctly set your Java
path but in case if you do not get this
message do let me know so that I will be
able to assist you all right so now that
all of you successfully installed Java
and configured Java path available let's
try our first program now to write your
Java program you can use any editor
I'd recommend notepad plus plus so you
can open your notepad plus plus and you
can just copy the following syntax
so start off with the following syntax
you
now this basically is your syntax for
your HelloWorld program basically what
you're doing is you're printing hello
world in your screen now don't worry
about the structure we'll be talking
about that as well but what you need to
understand is that every code that
you're going to be writing is going to
be written inside a class so here you
can see inside my class I have this
function that is public static void main
now again don't worry about these
modifiers but your void main basically
is the first function that is always
going to be executed so anything written
inside your void main would be the first
statements that would be executed before
any other treatments would be caught and
here to print any text or any data on to
your screen you're going to be using the
following syntax system dot out dot
println so this is a standard format
that you're going to be following to
print anything onto your screen now it's
time we say this file one thing you need
to keep in mind is that whenever you're
saving Earth dialogue program you need
to name the file with a dot Java
extension as well as the name of the
class should be name of the file because
these are standard processes that you
need to follow
so since my class name is hello I'm
going to name it hello and then I'm
going to make sure it is a Java file
type so you have various file types
present here so select on Java source
file this will ensure that the extension
is dot Java click on save now we need to
execute that program before you execute
that program launch your command prompt
and there are few things that you need
to do go to the directory where the Java
file is present first
now here you cannot directly execute
this file what you need to do as we have
seen earlier is that we need to create a
dot class file now let me just show you
how the directory is at present
so I have my hallo file present here now
the first process if you remember
earlier was that we need to give this
Java file to a compiler to get the dot
class file now to provide the file to
Java compiler use the following syntax
Java C followed by the file name
and then just click on okay so here you
have provided your file hello dot java
to java compiler now if you go back to
the location which had the java file you
can see a new file is also created it
means to enable the extension so that
you guys are clear
so you can see I have one hello dot Java
file as well as I have a hello dot
classifier so basically my original
source code which looks like this has
been passed to a Java compiler and let
me show you how the bytecode looks like
now here you can see this file contains
various symbols it has specific
characters as well but to a user it is
not something through which he can
identify what might code does or what my
code looks like so therefore your code
becomes highly secure as well as your
portability feature is also achieved
here now finally to run this code what
you need to do is specify Java and then
the dot class file name so hello and
just click on OK you don't have to
specify the extension here and you can
see hello word is printed so please go
ahead and try to score and in case if
you are facing in trouble or you are not
sure on any of the steps do let me know
so that I will be able to help you now
this is a basic way of creating and
executing your Java program but let's
say you're working with different files
it becomes a huge problem for you to
maintain these files as well as organize
them therefore what you are going to do
is that we're going to be using an IDE
that is an integrated development
environment where you can both create
your file you can compile it as well as
organize your various files now the most
popular and the most widely used IDE is
the Eclipse IDE and I'd recommend that
you go ahead and download via his ID
from their website it gives dot word let
me just show you how it's done so just
go to eclipse dot o-r-g and here it says
from the home screen you have the
download option
now the most updated version of Eclipse
presently is Eclipse neon and this is
the same thing that I would request you
to download now you can download
packages
here I'd recommend you to download
Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers
edition so all you need to do is specify
the version of Windows that you're using
and it will automatically download now
in case if you are using Linux or Mac
all you need to do is click on this link
and to your right you have your option
for various operating systems so go
ahead and download eclipse for your
system and the installation process is
quite simple this is basically a zip
file once you've extracted this you can
directly launch the Eclipse from that
folder okay so now that all of you
installed Eclipse on your system let's
go ahead and launch eclipse such as
double-click on it
so this is basically the welcome page
just close this and we need to start by
creating a new project now when a
project basically is a collection of all
the codes that you're going to be
writing so it's always suggested that
when you're writing codes that are
similar to each other let's say you
working on the first module then I
recommend you create a new project for
the first module now to create a new
project what you need to do is just
click on the new option present here and
then you have the option of the other
project click on it and click on next
option so you need to specify the name
of your Java project so what I'm going
to do is that I'm going to call it water
shell
down on that just click on finish
so you've created your java project file
now if you open that you have basically
two elements present here you have your
source file as well as your java runtime
environment
now just right-click on your source file
and then go to the new option here here
you need to create a class now as I have
told you everything in Java every code
that you will be writing in Java is
going to be present inside our class so
what I'll do is I'll just show you how
easy it is to execute the same
HelloWorld program using eclipse
so let's call it hello and click on
finish
so I'll just copy the code I had written
earlier
just save it you can do that by pressing
ctrl s then it's time to execute this
program so you see the plus option here
this is for running your code just click
on it
and you can see the output below here I
have hello word so you can go ahead and
try running the same program that you
had run earlier using ATS I hope you
understood how easy it is to run a
program using eclipse okay we're own is
asking me can I use NetBeans instead of
eclipse okay to those of you who are not
aware of what NetBeans is NetBeans is
also an ID that is provided by Oracle
now one you can use it but I'd again
recommend that you go ahead with eclipse
because this is the IDE that most of the
industry works so you will also get an
exposure using this IDE before you move
into your job role in the industry as
well as it's easier for you to work with
Eclipse when you compare with NetBeans
alright so now that all of you installed
Eclipse and understand how easy it is to
program using an IDE let's begin deep
diving into Java and the first thing
we'll be discussing is the wave data
types that are present in Java now when
you look at each of these primitive data
types there are various sub data types
as well now when you look at integers
there are basically four subtypes under
integers if you have short you have long
you have byte and you have it under
float you have double and float
character and Williams how only one
corresponding but you may be wondering
what each of these are used for so to
give you a better understanding of what
is used for when so let's look at our
next slide that gives you an
understanding here now let's say you're
going to be using a byte now as the name
suggests a byte use only one byte of
memory location but the problem here is
that using a byte you can store a value
only between minus 128 to plus 127 if
you try to store a value that is more
than that then the correct value is not
store but at the same time to solve your
problem you can use a shop now a short
can store a value that is between minus
30 2007 68 to plus 30 2007 67 so this is
huge range and if you want to store a
number between this then you can go
ahead and do that using the short video
if you want to go beyond that then
you're going to be using int now int is
something that can be used to store a
numerical value that is greater than
shot now generally we make use of int
rather than using byte and shot and in
case if you want to store a large number
then only you will be using B log
variable now here again the difference
between using float and double is the
range of numerical value that it can
store
generally it's preferred that you use
double because it gives you a more
precise value as such when you come down
to character it can store a value that
is between 0 to 65,535 so let's say
you're going to be using a then the
ASCII equivalent of a would be actually
stored inside a character variable
finally you have your boolean like this
use to store true or false
now one thing you need to be aware of is
that a boolean just use one bit of
memory because it means to only store
true or false and this can be done using
a 0 or 1 therefore it requires only one
bit of memory so are you clear with
respect to what each of these data types
are used for ok I've got a confirmation
from Emily Rachel's also given me clear
ok let me go ahead and show you how you
can initialize and create variables of
these data nets let's go back to our
Eclipse
and here let me create a new class file
now to create a new class file you can
just click on this see I can present
here we will create a new class file
here itself so let me call it data types
and one thing you need to do is that you
need to check this option of public
static void main so this automatically
creates a public static void main inside
your class
so now let's go forward and let me show
you how to declare a variable in Java
now coming back to our Eclipse here now
let's say you want to declare an integer
variable so again you're familiar with
the four different types of integers
that we have but as I had said generally
if you want an integer variable it's
suggested that you use in now once
you've called it then you need to
specify the name of the variable you
want to create let's say I'm going to
create a variable num 1 and then at the
end of every statement you need to put a
semicolon ok
this basically means that this is the
end of that statement always remember at
the end of every line put a semicolon
if you don't Java will in turn give you
an error but again since you're using an
IDE here you basically will see that
across the line itself so if I remove
this you can see here an X present you
can see an X present here so this is
basically telling me there is a syntax
error and to insert a semicolon to
complete the block statement so again
these are some of the key advantages of
using a IDE so I have an integer number
then let's say you have a floating
variable num - so now let's go ahead and
create a second variable which is of a
floating type but again as I had said
earlier to be more precise let's use a
double here let's say num2 and then
again save equal so here what we have
actually done is that we have completed
the Declaration of a variable along with
the Declaration of that variable you
have also specified which type of
variable it is
now comes the essential part that is the
initialization now initialization
basically means that you can assign an
initial value to that variable now this
is something that will definitely come
into handy when you want that variable
already to have a value while you're
using now let me give you some examples
let's say you're going to be using a
float variable called PI and as you all
know pi is going to have the value of 22
divided by 7 that is 3.14 so that is a
huge number so instead of declaring it
as part of my program itself when I am
creating this variable that I'm when I
am declaring this variable first then
itself I can initialize it to a value
that I want so let's say I am going to
each lies my num1 to equal to
se5 now here what I am doing is
basically I am declaring as well as I am
initializing now if you don't want to do
it here then you can also write it as
part of your code where you can say num
1 equal to 5 so here again I have
initialized it to a fixed well so I guys
clearly here or how to work with
variables okay one is clear so is Emily
should be I you she Deepak that's quick
now let's see phenom 2 what I'm going to
do is let's say nam 2 is equal to 20 2/7
now again your arithmetic operators will
work here as well but let us not go into
with respect to these operators will be
talking them in our upcoming flight but
for now just understand that 22 divided
by 7 is going to be stored in my nacht
now I need to print num1 and num2 so if
you remember our previous statement for
printing we have to type system dot out
dot println
but in Eclipse there is a shortcut for
this types this out
and then press control space this your
sis out gets automatically expanded to
system dot out dot println so here just
say you want to print num one similarly
let's type
number two as well
and run this program now again to run
this always save the program that is
press ctrl s and then right-click and
select run as java application option or
you can go to the run option present
here and directly execute this program
so just click on run us and there you
have it our output so one is storing
five and the second is storing three
point one four two eight five seven one
and so far so idea with respect to both
integer and floating vanity
yes ask me instead of saving num1 as
five what will happen if I save twenty
2/7 okay let me show you that as well
Divya so I'll just change it here
20 2/7 let's go to run option here so
just click on run and then click on ok
and here you go you have the output so
I'm performing the same operation and
storing it in two different variables
but because the difference in the data
type the different values are being
stored one is saving it as three point
one four two eight five seven one and
the other is just storing three so I
hope this clears your doubt Divya all
right not a problem so any other doubt
okay so before we go ahead as you show
you how to declare a character and a
boolean value so again for character
it's care space the name of the
character let's say yes equal to now
here what you need to do is you need to
specify the character in single quotes
so just use single quote and specify
what character you want to say so let's
say Y and a semicolon and that's it so
you declare the character and then comes
million so for boolean you should type
the complete boolean then the boolean
name let's say output equal to then you
need to specify either true or false
let's say false
so you can see her Falls has been
highlighted so this basically means
everything that you see in purpose here
basically these are keywords so again
when you talk about keywords these are
specific words that have a reserved
value in Java so you cannot assign a
specific value to a reserved keyword so
let's say you're declaring a variable
name make sure you're not using a name
that is being used by a keyword because
what happens is that they have specific
values already as part of them and you
cannot overwrite it okay now whether
let's go back to our presentation so
we've seen the various data types that
are present in Java let's move forward
and talk about the various data
operations that you can perform in Java
now when you talk about the various data
operators there are mainly for different
types of operators you have your
arithmetic operator you have a unary
operator relational operator and logical
operator so we'll start off by talking
about the automatic operator now here
you have your normal operations like
addition subtraction division and
multiplication
apart from that you have a new operator
that is the modulus update basically
what the modulus operator does is that
it performs reduction but rather than
giving you a quotient like a normal
division here you get the reminder of
that division let's say you divide 5 by
3 normally you would be getting an
output of 1 but here what you would be
getting is the reminder which is equal
to 2 so I clear with respect to how the
modulus operator works sure sniffing
I'll just show you the output as well so
let me declare another variable as num1
so let's say you have multiple variables
of the same type
then that is not writing the data type
then the variable name date arrived in
the variable name what you can do is in
a single line you can specify the data
types and then following that be
variable so let's say num 3 and here
what I'm going to do num 3 and number 4
let me put num false
my number three is equivalent to 5/3 my
number four is equal to five modulo 3 so
for performing modulo operation you need
to use the percentage symbol here so
I'll just copy these two statements
stuff num2 let me make it number three
and I'll make it numb for now one thing
you guys need to remember is that let's
say you want to comment in Java for that
all you need to do is use backslash so
when you use backslash everything that
follows the backslash in that same line
is considered to be up come at so this
means that every statement that is going
to be present in that same line is going
to be considered to be a comment now you
need to understand that this is just a
single line comment now if you want to
perform a multi-line comment then all
you need to do is that introducing
double slash what you need to do is a
single slash then you can use a star
operator and then at the end point where
you want your comment to n then use a
star followed by a slash
so this basically means that everything
enclosed between this is a multi-line
card so just save the program and then
let's execute
so you can see here the output
difference and performing same operation
but I am getting different outputs now
don't go by the value now since norm 3
is an integer you're not getting the
decimal value here but I hope you can
differentiate between put so 1 is giving
me the quotient the other is giving me
the remainder so are you clear now
Stefan alright so the next set of
operators that we are going to be
talking about is the unary operator now
again when you talk about unary operator
there are basically two operators to
have your increment and then you have a
decrement so what basically you will be
doing using an increment operator is
that you will be incrementing its
current value by 1 or remember you're
incrementing the value by 1 but there
are two ways to perform both increment
and decrement operation if you look at
the slide here it talks about the same
so you have this concept of pre
increment and post increment so if you
are writing the variable name and then
following that you're mentioning the
increment operator so to perform
increment you need to use two pluses
again there are basically two kinds of
increment and two kinds of decrement you
have your pre increment and you have
your post increment and that's exactly
what is it discussed here so you see
here you have the variable name and then
you have the increment so this is a post
increment what you basically going to do
here is let's say I is equal to 5 if I
use this statement and print it what is
going to be my output can anyone guess
okay so have a lot of guesses here but I
am NOT going to answer this right now we
will just talk about what increment and
then we'll execute this and see who's
right so here what you're basically
doing is that you are specifying the
variable name and then you can find the
increment operator so this is a post
increment operation so what happened
here is that you're first going to use
the current value of the variable and
then you're going to increment it by one
similarly when you talk about pre
increment operator then what happens is
you're going to first increment the
value of the variable and then only use
it now let's say your value of I is
equal to five now who can tell me the
correct value for I plus plus and plus
plus I so
three statements are executed one after
the other i + + + + + I okay so a lot of
you have made different guesses let's
see who's right
let me just execute these two statements
I am going to use another variable i
equal to 5
print I plus plus and
plus plus I
wants to change that answers all right
so let me just run this run ass tap
Legation click on ok it see here five
and seven so I'm going to print the
current value of I equal to be five
so before I start my print statement
what actually happens is that it takes
the current value of I so it's found to
be five so what it does it goes ahead
and prints the value of I equal to five
but then what happens is the increment
operation comes so then it is basically
telling the system that it needs to
increment the value of five to six but
when you come down to the next statement
so here what happens first it says this
you are encountering an increment
operator
so first itself you are incrementing the
value of I from six to seven so directly
it is printing five and seven so I clear
with respect to the increment operator
and how prefix and postfix works okay so
I have a question here from DP she's
asking me where will I be using these
unary operators in Java under the
concepts of loop we have a loop known as
four so there is always a constant
incrementation and there you will be
mainly using the increment operator
similarly instead of increment operator
you can also use the decrement operator
but throughout your program wherever you
want to increment a value so let's see
working with multiple employee record
and the employee ID has to be increased
by one every time correct so there you
can use an increment operator all right
so DT Square any other doubt yeah
similarly the decrement operator also
works let's say - - save it
any guesses - the answer so let's run
this right click
is five and three so most of you have
got the answer correct then the next
type of operators are really discussing
is relational operators the relational
operator basically what they do is they
check the relativity so you have your
greater than greater than equal to then
you have lesser than lesser than equal
to equal to and not equal to operation
now in Java when you put a single equal
to it is considered to be an assignment
operator that is any value or any
expression to the right of equal to
should be assigned to the variable
present on the left of the equal to
operation but let's say you want to
compare two variables then you would use
the double equal to operators that will
check the two values now let's look at
each of the relational operators now
when you perform a greater than
operation the result is true only if X
is greater than Y else it returns false
so this basically gives you a boolean
value as the output all your relational
operators give you a boolean output you
need to remember that
similarly greater than equal to if your
value of x is greater than or equal to Y
then it returns true else it returns
false so here you have an additional
equal to value same focal lesser than
and lesser than equal to now comes your
equal to operation here you get the
output to be true only and only if both
values are equal and finally if you want
to check if both values are not equal to
you can use an exclamation mark followed
by equal to an exclamation mark is
considered to be not in Java so when you
say not equal to it checks both the
values and their if they are different
then you get an output to be true so I
here with respect to the relational
operators okay so now that you guys have
understood relational operators let us
go back to our Eclipse and try out
something now firstly as we know
relational operators give us a boolean
output so what I do is I will create a
new boolean variable let's say output
and give it a default value of false now
let's try out some of the relational
operations so just extend this comment
section P here and then let's say output
is equal to 25 greater than 50 now if I
need to print output
let's check out the corresponding output
for it let's say this
and let's run
so you can see the output to be true
here and if you print output before the
salon itself you can see the change in
its value so again here let's just save
I will change this so that you can also
understand how the value is changing I
just print output before I perform the
relational operation and I will print it
again once after so if you save it and
run it you can see you're getting false
to be the first output and true to be a
second so by default it had false value
but after I performed the relational
operator it is storing a value of true
same let's say if I check if both are
equal to each other and then if I rerun
this and then you can see both output to
be false now this is something that
extension will be helpful for you while
you're working with different variables
and you're not quite sure on the values
that each of them stoops okay now let's
say I'm going to check if num1 and num2
are the same so what I'll do is as you
say num1 equal to equal to num2
so as we had three an earlier number is
storing 22 divided by 7 and num2 storing
22 divided by 7 so basically they both
should have the same value and if you
read on this it gives you the value to
be true so especially when you're
working with variables and you're not
quite sure on the value that they
assumed your relational operators are
really helpful now I clear with respect
to how relational operators work you can
try out if they're not equal to as well
if you just make the small change here
and put an exclamation mark this is for
not equal to operation if you just save
it and run it you can see the value has
been saved so again any doubts with
respect relational operators ok so the
last type of operators will be talking
on logical operators now logical
operators are quite useful when you're
working with multiple conditions
now usually your logical operators are
combined together with your relational
operator and to help you understand what
are the logical operators let's look at
the slide here there are basically two
types of logical operators you have
logical and and you have logical or let
me just highlight it here
this is your logic land
and this geological art please don't
mind the bad handwriting okay so how do
they differ that's what you need to
understand now your logical aunt
actually compares the left and the right
operand with respect to their values and
if both of them are found to be true and
only if both are true will it return a
boolean value as the output to be true
again again same like your relational
operators logical operators also give
you bullion value as the output but only
in case is operand 1 and operand 2 that
is operand to the left and open to the
right of the logical aunt are true then
will you be getting the output to be
true but at the same time when you look
at the logical or how would the first
one be logical and is that if at least
one of the values is true then it
returns the value to be true so in case
both are true you have true and only in
case if both operators are false
we'll get the output to be false now you
may be wondering where these operators
are used again as I had mentioned
earlier you use them with your
relational operators now let's say you
have multiple conditions and you're
putting that inside the conditional
statement now only and only if all the
conditions mentioned are true do you
want to execute the code inside the
condition state in that case you will be
using a logical app but let's say if at
least one of the conditions is true then
you can go ahead and use the logical or
operator so I appear with respect to the
logical operators logical and and
logical or and how they're different
from each other and when to use them
okay these clear so is adam after
confirmation from everyone else that's
great to see so with this we come to a
conclusion about the different data
operators in Java so let's move forward
and talk about another very fundamental
and important concept that is functions
in job now what is a function is the
first question that would come to any of
your mind and let me put it very simply
a function basically is a block of code
okay
the purpose of the code inside is to
reuse it and reduce the cold redundancy
but you may be wondering what exactly
does that function so each function has
a specific purpose now let's say you
want to add 10 values and this has to be
done maybe five times so rather than
writing the complete
code for adding the value ten times what
you do is you just write a function that
takes ten numbers and then it gets
called every time that you want to write
now how it works are we talking in the
next slide but what you need to
understand is that functions are
something that help you reuse a set of
instructions used to perform a related
operation now again talking about the
types of functions there are basically
two types you have built-in functions
and user-defined functions built-in
functions are basically those functions
that are present already in your java
packages which you can use as per your
convenience once you've imported the
package to give you the most simplest
example your print statement is a
predefined function that helps you put
out an output to the screen now let's
say you want to perform a specific
operation then you can go ahead and
create a user-defined function now when
you look at the structure of a function
let's look at the example here the basic
syntax for a user-defined function is
the modifier type then the return type
that is what kind of output will be
returned from this function the name of
the function or method now don't get
confused if I use method instead of
functions they both mean the same thing
and the parameters or the input that
this function is going to be after that
you have the set of statements or
operations that you wish to perform
multiple number of times and here if you
look at the example here there is a
method known as add so it is basically a
public static method which returns an
integer output and takes two input in a
and int P what it does inside that you
have a new variable int result which
adds a and B value and returns this
result now if you look at the image to
the right basically this is a division
of the code so again your add function
has been defined here so these are your
function parameters this is the function
definition this is a function return
value and this is basically how you call
a function so you just use the name of
the function pass the parameters and
then it correspondingly calls the
function now if it is returning a value
you need to store it inside a variable
if it is not you don't need to do that
okay I have a question here from VP to V
please ask me what happens in case my
function does not have to go to another
definitely that's a very good question
between you bastard at the right now if
your function does not return a value
then the
turn type of that function will be what
usually this is done for certain
appending or changing with respect to
your value and in those cases you don't
need to return a specific value to the
user so crap and then explain it here
let's go back to our Eclipse and work
this up I'll create a new class let's
say
I call a function test
you
so again three we have a new class file
as well as a me now again your main is
one of the best examples of a method and
main is the first method that gets
executed when you're writing a code or
executing a code so always remember
execution starts from main and main in
itself is a function so here you can see
the modifier type the return type your
main does not return anything the name
of the function is main and these are
the parameters what do we mean by string
args
it basically is used when you're taking
parameters from V console now let's go
back let me create a new function here
now what I will be doing is I will show
you a simple function that computes the
Fibonacci series so let's say public
static
now it's not going to return anything so
I'll avoid feeble and
take an argument of integer let's say n
so who's not familiar with Ruben se
series here
you seem to be familiar with Fibonacci
series so it starts from zero and then
it keeps adding the consecutive numbers
so what I will do here is I will declare
three variables in num1 num2 and let's
say num three so I have three numerical
values here so my num 1 would be equal
to 0 and my num 2 is equal to 1 so this
is how your Fibonacci series starts so
here let's say this out
number one put a plus and then we need
to press space you're so coat and put
space plus
- so I print
first two numbers of the Fibonacci
series and now what I need to do is I'm
going to find the first n number of
elements present in the Fibonacci C so
for this what I will be using is I will
be using a slightly new concept here I
will be using a loop statement that is
the for loop okay now don't worry what
it exactly is a loop basically helps you
execute a certain number of statements
for a required number of types now just
look at the syntax and how it works out
we'll be talking about the loops in our
next session so let's say int int I
equal to two and my I has to be less
than
the value of n that is taken finally you
have I plus plus so this is what I was
telling the P where we are using the
unary operator
so this basically helps you increment
the number of times the loop has to get
executed so what I need to do is I have
printed the first number and the second
number now I need to print the third
number onward so in that case my num 3
becomes equal to num 1 plus num2 ok I've
identified these two and now I need to
print num 3 I'll add in a space here
plus num 3 ok now I need to update the
value of my num 1 and num2 so that the
series gets updated so who here can tell
me what value should my num1 and num2
take okay that's good sandy it has to
take num1 has to become down to num 1
equal to num - and my num 2 should be
equal to num 3
so you're basically updating the value
of number one and number two once is
completely printed number three and this
will get executed continuously now let
me create a new variable here int count
and let's say count equal to twenty I
want to identify the first 20 elements
of my Fibonacci series so here this
called feeble passed count here as the
parameter
and we are done so let me just save this
and let's execute this and see
okay so if you look here you have the
Fibonacci series printed for the first
20 elements again so what I'll do is
I'll make a small correction here I am
changing my println to print so that way
it comes in a single line save it and
read on it
then you have the first complete 20
elements of the Fibonacci series so 0 1
1 2 3 5 8 13 21 so you can feel your the
previous two numbers are getting added
and the next number is getting appended
so 13 plus 21 gives us 34
similarly 34 plus 21 gives 35 and so
forth now let's say I want to find first
hundred numbers so update the value of
count favorite and let's redirect
so this is the first 100 elements of the
Fibonacci series
now the reason that certain values are
negative is because it is going beyond
your range of integer values so we have
already discussed the data types and
their range so if you see here this is
more than the range of integers so what
should we do can anyone get it correct
sandy so the datatype has to be changed
to long so we can change it here
I'll just save it and let's try running
it
so now here you can see the values of
the first hundred elements of the
Fibonacci series so there is a
consecutive order recording so again I
hope this has also given you an idea as
to why we need to use different data
types for different numerical values so
any doubts with respect to what is a
function how to write a function how to
call a function in Java
okay DP is giving me a confirmation so
has some deep Adams that's great to see
everyone's given me confirmation
great to see that so again one thing I'd
like to recommend is that you try out
these code simultaneously in the Eclipse
so that you will be able to understand
it better while I'm explaining it and
even if you encounter any problems or
any errors I will be able to assist you
write of it so please make sure you are
trying out the code simultaneously and
if you're not sure at any point do let
me know so that I will be able to assist
you okay that's great so moving forward
let's talk about the next and the final
concept of today's session that is
object-oriented program now most of you
would have heard of this key term but
you may not be quite clear with respect
to what exactly is the object-oriented
programming paradigm so let's talk about
that in detail now the first thing you
need to understand before you talk about
object-oriented programming is what
exactly is an object an object basically
is a collection of a data which is
considered to be state in case of Java
and methods or behaviors in case of Java
that act on this data now to put it in
very simple terms everything that you
see around you is an object because it
has a certain amount of data and there
are certain amounts of behaviors as it
does let's take the example of a sitter
we have a certain state we have a name
we have our height we have a weight so
this is what basically we mean by a
state and we also have a behavior we
talk we walk we run we sleep and these
are some of these behaviors in terms of
object-oriented programming
anything that has these properties it
has a state and a behavior can be called
as an object now here you can see the
example of a phone that is quintic now
every phone has a specific size it has a
color it has a shape as well as certain
behaviors like turning it on making
calls sending messages what's up
Internet
your facebook so these are all method
that keep working error so I hope you've
got a simple understanding as to what an
object is again an object is anything
that has a state and a behavior
so basically everything can be
considered to be an object okay but when
you talk about object you need to also
understand what exactly is a class now a
class basically is a blueprint from
which objects are created if you look at
us we are basically objects that belong
to be human class so in the human class
there would have been defined number of
eyes everyone has number of nose number
of hands number of legs so these are the
certain common things that all humans
have
on an individual basis when you look at
us as objects we are slightly different
from each other but again there are a
lot of common things which are present
in the human class similarly if you look
at the example here as well we are
talking about this phone class now every
phone is going to have a brand value
it's also going to have a battery power
value even a processor that is going to
be using but what is the value for this
this is going to change from object of
all the class is telling us this the
object would have these corresponding
States and each of them will have a
common behavior as well now every phone
is going to turn on every phone is going
to have a method that helps you call a
method that helps you send a message but
how they work may be slightly different
but they do have these methods so all
these methods can be defined in the
class which basically tells how the
blueprint of the object is going to be
so I clear with respect to classes and
objects and their relationship with each
other okay I have a question here from
Sandeep Sandeep is asking me can we have
an object that does not belong to a
class that's a good question Philippe to
be very frank no we cannot have but to
help you understand better we use
objects to help us achieve a certain
behavior or to have a certain idea of
Rissa T so having an object that does
not belong to a class becomes
problematic because there is no
generalization or an idea as to what
that object can I clear Sandeep okay
that's great
so moving forward let's talk about the
four core fundamental concepts of object
oriented programming starting from
inside
what do we mean by inheritance basically
inheritance is a mechanism through which
we can acquire the properties and the
behavior of a parent object now let's
take this example of phones present here
I basically have a simple class called
as phone or mobile now in this class
there will be specific methods defined
and there will be specific values now
when I have style classes in this case I
have an apple phone
I have Samsung phone I have a Google
phone they may slightly vary with
respect to each other but they always
have all the Triads present in the
mobile class apart from having the parts
of mobile class they may have specific
unique triads as well but they always
inherit the properties and the behavior
of our parent class so your parent class
is called a superclass and the class
which is inheriting these properties is
called child class a clear with respect
to inheritance so basically it's quite
similar to your actual inheritance where
you get something from your parents who
have got that something from their
grandparents and so far now these things
are basically common to you but apart
from these things you will also have
some additional things so that's how
inheritance works clear to you
okay that's great the moving forward the
next concept is encapsulation now by
encapsulation what we mean is basically
it is a mechanism through which you're
going to bind both your code and data it
manipulates together into a bun now what
do I mean by this is that I'm going to
combine my variables and my methods and
hide it from the others only a object of
that class can go ahead and modify the
data corresponding to that class but if
any other object tries to do this it
cannot access it our modified Eric to
give you a simple example let's look at
the image below here now let's say I
have a phone that has a fingerprint scan
now unless and until I either press the
fingerprint scanner or enter the
password I'll not be able to open that
phone and make the required
modifications or changes this is same
thing that happens here if anyone else
tries to access it or modify it he'll
not be able to do that
because he doesn't have the
authorization same thing happens with
our code as well only
our method of us class can go ahead and
modify the variable values no other
object or method from a different class
can come and modify this and this is
possible only through encapsulation I
clear with respect to encapsulation okay
that's great to see now the next concept
with respect to object-oriented
programming is volume officer what do I
mean by polymorphism is that it is the
ability for a variable or a function or
even object to take multiple roles apart
from its usual and I don't think there
is a better example from apart from the
image shown below here the mobile phones
that we use today has replaced the
cameras remotes mp3 player video source
it has almost to an extent even replaced
the usage with respect to laptops as per
people are more convenient with working
to the mobile so your single entity that
is your mobile is taking up different
different forms here if it's acting as
camera is acting as a workstation it is
acting as a music player there are
phones which has IR blaster that becomes
a remote and so far is it here okay and
finally comes your concept of
abstraction now abstraction is a very
simple and straightforward process it
basically means that you are going to
hide the implementation details from the
user and only provide the functionality
now if you get the image below you can
see a phone that is getting a call from
genre we know that because there is a
notification that comes on a screen that
says there is a call from Zambrano this
is this number do you want to pick it up
or do you want to hang up but to any of
us actually know what is the code or
what is the program that is running
behind which is managing this call
absolutely not so that basically is how
you are hiding the implementation
details from the user but at the same
time you are providing the functionality
to the user to use so if I swipe a right
or swipe left there would have been a
specific code that would be written and
that would get executed what that code
is is not something I need to worry
about all I need to know is I can use
the functionality to achieve this
purpose so any dots with respect to the
for object-oriented concepts okay this
is great seeing that all of you have
understood up till here
now we come to a conclusion of the
session and just to summarize what we
have learned till here is we started off
with an introduction to Java then we
moved on to understand why we need to
learn Java B even so the various
features of Java we talked about the
Java environment and how Java works and
from there we went on to talk about the
various data types in Java the various
data operators the functions and finally
the object-oriented programming concepts
any doubts with respect to any of these
topics anything that you're not clear
with that you want me to repeat
okay since there are no more questions
let's go ahead and conclude the session
