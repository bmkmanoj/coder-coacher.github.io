and in today's session we'll be focusing
on Jango
so Jango is nothing but a web
development framework so without wasting
any more time let's move ahead and look
at today's agenda so these are the
topics that we'll be covering in this
session so we'll start with the session
by first discussing why do we need Jango
frame book once we get an answer to it
will they understand what exactly is
Jango after that we'll dig deeper into
MVC MBT pattern that Jango offers and
then we'll get started with it so here
we'll start building a web application
from scratch and then moving on to some
advanced concepts with it next we'll be
discussing some of the components or you
can say the building blocks of Jango
along with the packet all demonstration
and finally towards the end I'll be
showing you a project which is a website
where I have incorporated all the
components and some advanced stuff to
make the website look better so these
are topics that will be covered in
today's session so let's get started
with the very first topic that is why do
we need Django framework so Django is a
Python web framework but why a framework
so first let's understand what exactly
is a framework so a framework is nothing
but a structure or you can say a
placeholder where you can place all your
components so this has some tools or
libraries which reduces all your manual
efforts so let me give you a simple
example so that you can relate to it
very easy let's say you have to cut a
piece of paper with some dimension let's
say 5 centimeter by 5 centimeter surely
you can do that but what if I say you
have to do the same with other 50-100
pieces in this case you won't be
measuring hundred times right so
obviously you'll figure out an
alternative but you can repeat the same
task for you so in this example what you
can do you can create a frame of the
same dimension and then with the help of
it you would be able to cut those
hundred pieces in lesser time so this is
where a frame book helps you so
similarly in Django it performs the same
type of task or some repetitive codes
that can be done in a single goal now we
know that Django is based on a very
powerful language that is Python so
Django is a Python based web framework
so Django contains some codes or
libraries it help you simplify your web
operation let's say whenever you create
a website or say HTML you need to write
some code now what if you want the same
Aran's or the same HTML for different
links in your website or different pages
in your website now one way of doing it
is to copy the same HTML and paste it to
different pages or you can just simply
template eyes it now what exactly this
mean
so what django does for you it basically
automates your repetitive stuff so
django provides templates where you just
need to create one and you can link it
with different pages now don't worry
guys I'll be talking about these
templates in for Thermo slides
apart from these templates django offers
a lot of things which surely be very
useful for you so that is how django is
winning now apart from this django has
advantages like it has a built-in admin
panel it has RM which helps in data
operations and many other things so now
we know why django is preferred over
other frameworks or why django is
actually used so now let us go ahead and
understand what exactly is jungle so
django is a high-level and has an MVC
MVT architecture now MVC stands for
Model View controller and MVC stands for
Model View template so don't worry guys
we'll be discussing this architecture in
further most slides but first let's get
a clearer picture of what exactly Django
is so we know that Django is built on a
powerful language status Python now it
also contains some tools and open-source
libraries which makes a life of a web
developer much easier as it helps him to
build a very easy flexible scalable and
a maintainable web application
so to summarize in Django is used for
creating web application that is the
soft sphere which is backed up by a
database now it includes some kind of
interactivity that operates through a
browser so Django framework just
provides your structure and some common
methods for making this kind of software
so now let us move on to different
features of Django or what Django has to
offer us
so the very first feature of Django is
it is fast now how it is fast now Jambu
is faster because it is very easy to
code here and it's very good whenever
you have to meet some deadlines so that
is the very first reason why Django is
preferred over any other frame book next
Django is fully loaded which means it
has in numerous packages and libraries
to offer so instead of coding all the
use those packages or use the libraries
which are already developed by django
developers next django is very secure so
the security of any application is one
of the major factor of concern for any
developer now with django you do not
have to worry about that and it's
already taken care of and then django is
scalable so django divides the entire
project in multiple components or you
can say applications now let's say you
have to add another feature later on or
you just want to make changes in one of
the existing features so what you can do
you can always go back to the code and
change according to your wish or you can
also do one thing you can just go to
your code just create a new app and then
link it by our URL so this is how a
django is extremely scalable next let us
move ahead and look at the MVC MBT
pattern that django follows so I've
already talked about it that MVC stands
for Model View controller and MVC stands
for Model View template so as you can
see here you have three components that
is Model View and a controller so model
basically represents your database or
you can say it is responsible for
storing and maintenance of data next is
your view so view is used for the
presentation part or you can say it
displays the request portion of data to
the user and here is your controller so
controller regulates the interaction
between the model and the view so this
is all about Model View controller then
we have Model View template
functionalities are exactly the same
model stands for the storing of data
views just for the representation part
and here template is something new so
people also already discuss that how you
can use template and how you can
represent your data to the user so this
is how django MVC and MVP pattern are
different now django itself's take care
of the controller part so it doesn't
need a controller so that is a major
advantage of django now let us move
ahead and look at the architecture or
how this nbcnb deepak trim actually
works now as you can see in this image
so here we have model so model
represents your database or where your
data has been stored and then you have
template so template can be a web
application or front-end as well now
when I combine these two I have a view
and to connect to that view this is
going to be a specific URL also we can
have a separate URL for different views
now
Django is an interface or you can say
the middleman as it just helps the user
to connect to the exact URL this is how
Django works so I hope you got a basic
understanding of how Django works so
what exactly happens is just a developer
provides the model the view and template
just Maps it to a URL and Django just
performs the magic and serves it to the
user so this is how Django works now
enough of practical knowledge so let's
move on to the hands-on part we will
first create a basic application from
scratch so let's get started with it now
to create a web application you first
need to install Django so for that first
step is to go to this link and then
install the latest version of Django now
before going ahead and installing Django
in a system we know that we are using
Python to develop website so the first
thing that we need is Python now I think
you get this must be aware of the Python
and its programming because that is what
we're using here so just to verify it
that you have Python installed in your
system or not just go to the command
prompt and python version so I'll go to
my command prompt I'll run this as an
administrator
now why administrator because if they're
using any other operating systems such
as Linux or Mac you can use sudo
commands just to access the super user
privileges but in Windows you don't have
sudo so that is where advocator comes in
so here what we have to do you just have
to type in Python - - version so this
will display the kind question that I'm
using so currently I'm using Python 3
point 6 point 1 so since I have Python
now let me go forward and install Django
in my system so I just have to open my
Google and I have to type in Django
documentation
so this will link up to my official
documentation of Django so here you can
see this download tab so just click on
that so once you click on that you will
be redirected to this page which says
that you just have to type in pip
install Django and with the latest
version so right now the latest official
version is one point eleven point seven
also the next thing that you need to
check is that do you have Pippen stalled
or not
now what is pip pip is just a tool that
allows you to download things online so
once you're done with it you can go to
your command prompt and then you can
check whether Django exists your system
or not
so once we have this command we can go
back to a command prompt and see whether
we have Django installed or not so I
will go again to my command prompt so I
have closed it by mistake so let me just
open the game for you
so this command says tip install Django
with the latest version that is one
point equal to equal to one point one
one
now as you can see here my ladies
William Django is installed and what
they have done they have uninstalled my
previous version that was one point
eleven point four so now it has
successfully uninstalled this version
and currently my Django one point eleven
point seven is installed in my system so
let me go to any IDE and let me help you
to create a basic web application so as
we know there different idea is that you
can work on but I will be preferring
PyCharm because it is very easy and it
is very reliable
so let me open my PI charm
so this is my jetbrains by some
community edition so it'll just take a
few seconds
so now it's loading my existing project
now I don't want to see my existing
project inspired to create new one so
there are two methods to create it so
either you can use a spy chomp down
there itself or you can itself go to my
files directory and create any directory
and then you can lower it to pie chart
so I'll show you both ways so let me go
to my file directory and let me see
where I can place a new folder
settle create a new folder here with the
name ed Eureka
so now I'm inside my head Eureka folder
now what I can do here I can either
create a fold over here and name it as a
Django project or what I can do I can
just simply go to my pie charm
open the terminal' from here and I can
create a project using terminal so for
creating a new project you just have to
type in this command Django admin start
project followed by the name of your
project so let's say the name of the
project is my project or let's say first
project so once you hit enter it will
just take two seconds
and here as you can see your first
project has been created so once you go
into it you will see another container
with the same name and one man is file
so what is this so let me just go back
to my presentation and let's see what
exactly these are so as you can see have
already created this project first
project now ideally the directory where
I have placed this project it somewhat
looks like this so it has first project
so it was containing two files which was
managed at me by file and the first
project and inside first project they
were certain file so let me go back to
my files and if I click on first project
it tells me that there are more files
that is in it settings URLs and WSGI so
you can go back to presentation and let
me explain all these files so as you've
already seen this is my project
structure so first project is the name
of the project that I've just created
and inside that Django has automatically
two files one is managed or py and the
other one is first project so inside
this first project which is a container
that is provided by Django with the same
name and side of the project
it basically contains some set of
default files with it
which is in it that py settings URLs and
WSGI so let me go into detail and let me
help you understand the structure of the
project so as you can see in the left
side so this is my project structure so
this is the name of the project that
I've just created so you can rename it
to anything you want to now inside this
I have one loop container with Django
automatically creates with the same name
as out of the project so this is
basically the actual Python package
which contains some default files now
what are those default files it is
image settings URLs and WSGI so let me
go
one by one and explain you all of these
now in it tells python that this is to
be created like a packet so Django has
some different rules that you need to
follow next is your settings now this
file contains all your settings or the
configurations of your website so again
this is kind of your main hub so inside
this you have an option called as
installed app where you have to add the
application that you will be creating so
this is one of the most important things
that you need to do so every time you
add an application you have to manually
add it here also there are some other
stuff like secret key and all that so we
will go into details when you actually
see this settings or py5 next is a URL
find so this is kind of your main
control of the website which basically
connects all your links of the project
with the view next is a WSGI file so
this is basically for Douglas J
compatible web services which acts as an
entry point to serve your project and
finally towards the end we have manager
py file that basically interacts with
your Django project so this is all about
the structure that Django follows so now
let us go ahead and go to my pie chart
where we start building our own
application so I already inside my first
project so now let me just open from
here so I go to the same location and
going to Yoshi then Eddie a car so this
is where my project is so I just load it
up from here so as we have already seen
this is my project name it has two files
at its project first project with the
same name and then the Manish py file
that interacts with the jungle so once
we go into this project we have in it
settings URLs and WSGI that we have just
discussed now what is the first step
that we have to do so now we have to
create an application so before going to
create an application let's go to my
server and let's run my server so for
running a server you just have to type
in pipe and manage dot py and runs over
this is Dan so let me just go to my
google and type in localhost so here you
can write your local IP or you can say
the local host which is not accessible
outside your home network it is only
accessible inside your network so now it
says that it worked now let me go back
to my pycharm and let's see how you can
create an application and display a view
to it
so now for creating an application you
just go to a terminal and just type in
Python managed or py start a panda name
of the application
so let me name it as first application
or stop so as you can see here we have
some extra files added to this up now
what are these so in it we have already
discussed then is the admin so admin is
basically for administrator so I guess
I've already told you that Django itself
provide an inbuilt admin panel so we'll
look into that after some time and then
is your apps folder which basically says
that this is your configurations and the
name of the application is first up for
now then is your models so models is
nothing but it contains your data base
and submitted it over here then is your
test so test you can just leave it for
now because right now we are not
creating any test cases but yes in the
further sessions we'll be creating our
own test cases as well and last is your
view so we have already discussed in the
MVC NBT architecture which basically
stands for the presentation so the first
thing that you need to do is to go to
your settings of your main project that
is first project and let me go to your
settings of this so I'm going to told
you that we have something called as
installed app where you have to manually
write the application that you are
working on so I have created the
application which is named as first app
so I'll manually write here
so other things are just by default so I
don't have to worry about that so here
we have some templates which is default
given by Django so here this is wsgi
application so this is also I've
discussed and then we have databases so
Django provides some inbuilt database
that is sequel ID and Django has a
strong authentication so we'll be
discussing about this is when also the
important part of settings are P my file
is the secret key
so remember and never share your secret
key with someone else so for example if
you want to put your project on github
or somewhere else so do not put the
secret key because this is used for
encryption so basically what is that it
basically encrypts your session and
everything which is inside this project
can be taken by someone else so that is
might never share your secret key so
once we clear with settings our people
are filing now let's hop into the next
file that is urls dot py file now here
what it says it it just has one URL
which basically points it to admin side
so here we create our own URL which say
it should go to our web application so
let me just copy this and paste it over
here so this URL starts from a regular
expression so here I don't want to go to
admin so I can so I can have this so
here if you are aware of regular
expression it is well and good else you
just get a basic introduction to what is
its regular expression because you will
not be covering this in this session but
yes you should be aware of it so just to
give an introduction here this character
represents the beginning of the shrink
and dollar represents end of the shrink
so here I don't want to go to my admin
dot side dot URLs so in spite of that I
just include my application that I've
just created so that is first app first
tab dot u is
so now I have to import include as well
so we know that this first tablet URL
doesn't exist now so what we'll do we'll
go to this first tab and we'll create a
URL for it so before going to create
first tablet URL first let's see what we
have to display and then we can give a
link to that view here is my view start
be my file so this is my views of py5 so
inside this we need to imports of HTTP
response so for that you have to type in
from django import HTTP response
so we don't need this for now and here
we create a first method say define
index and inside this will send a
request and here we'll write whatever
you have to return same I have to return
HTTP response and inside this I will be
writing and he takes you one to write so
I want this text in header two and I'll
say hey everyone
when come to this Django tutorial
clothes of my h2 back
so now let me just remove these errors
so this is all in small step as well
so now everything is done so what next
so hey I need to link with a URL so the
whenever a person goes to that URL it
just displays me this view so let me
just go back to my application and here
I just create one more file that is URL
stop py5 URLs so inside my URL file
first of all I import my URL so for that
I have to just type in
and then I have to write from period
import view so here period is basically
a relative view or you can say you're
importing from the current view so
inside this we have to write a URL
pattern
so I already told you that this URL in
the regular expression form so this is
my regular expression where your carrot
stands for the beginning of the string
your dollar stands for the ending of the
string and after that we'll be just
giving we use dot index which is the
name of the function that we have just
defined in views dot py file and then a
namespace to it so you can write any
name to let me put AZ index only
so now we have specified the URL pattern
now what does it say whenever user goes
to this application it will open this
view which has an index function so if
we go to this function it has this index
function which takes the request and
returns the HTTP response so this is my
response so let me just go to my server
and let's just start the server so again
I have to type in Python manager py and
runs over
so here it gives me an error that it
cannot import name is a loose one so
here I have imported this Django I just
have to type in HTTP so I guess it's
been working fine now
so let's just check this once again so
what you've done till now we have just
created a project so inside this project
we have you our insert py file which is
the main controller so here we already
have admin URL I have included one more
URL that is full staff that URL so this
URL we have created by ourselves so I'll
go to this first tab that URLs so this
is my first app I go to URL so in this
file we have declared URL patterns which
says just go to my views and see the
index method and along with the name
space so they people directly redirect
to the views which has a method named as
index and this method will take the
request and return your HTTP spots so I
think this flow is right so let me just
go to my terminal and run the soul
so here if I go to my local host so here
it says that Jiang who tried these URL
patterns in this order so have we gone
to admin no haven't gone to first app no
so what we need to do we need to go to
the application which we have created so
it says first app say yes my view has
been displayed here so whatever we have
written in the view store py file it
says hey everyone welcome to jangle toil
and this is what it actually represents
us
you can also redesign it and bring your
phone in the way you want to so this is
a simple application that we have
created now let me go back to the
presentation and let's see what else we
have so hence we have successfully build
this web application which displays the
view next let us see what are the
different components or you can say the
building blocks of Django so there are
many building blocks of Django so let's
have a look on each one of them so
Django has these set of components or
you can say building blocks so let's
just start it with the very first
building block that is you're wearing
now our M stands for object relational
mapper so what happens exactly over m
Yoren is basically you can design or you
can define your own data model so what
exactly is a data model so whenever we
talk about data base or when we talk
about the data or related things
om comes into the picture so it's a code
library that automates the transfer of
data stored in relational database
tables into the objects so if you have
say here first of all get imported
models and then we have created a class
called as employees now inside this
class employees I have two pins witches
first-name and lastname so this is what
a model is storing so it first name
should be of maximum 10 and last name
should be of Aksum length 10 and after
that we need this string method so that
is why it is returning self dot first
name so this is how we can play with
objects and you can retrieve the
information present in any other
database and you can see the results
next very important feature is URLs and
views so we have already discussed about
URLs and views Django here encourages a
beautiful URL design so we have already
talked about views and how you can map a
view with the URL so what we have done
best specified the URL pattern in the
form of local expression and to say
at views on index index is a function or
you can say the method which is defined
in the view store PMI file and once we
go to the view star py file if it says
that it has look Metheny mass index that
accepts requests and returns HTTP
response so this is what we've already
discussed in the basic application that
we have just created so I think you guys
must be clear about these concepts and
till now guys if you have any problem or
any kind of question that comes into
your mind just come in below this video
and we'll be happy to help you with the
same so next component is your templates
so templates are basically your
front-end or you can save your view has
been displayed it is for front-end
developer who likes working with HTML
and everything like that so I think you
must remember that in the settings of py
file I showed you this temporary
directory so let me just go to my
PyCharm and just show you where this
template directory is present so this is
what django provides so you don't have
to configure any template or anything
like that
django does everything for you next we
have a very important topic that is a
form so django provides a powerful form
lighted now it handles all your security
or your HTML everything inside it so
form is basically a collection of
elements which helps you enter the text
it helps you select the options you can
manipulate your object and you can have
the control all over it so as you can
see here I have created a form which has
the fields first name last name email
and a button to register so basically
this is a registration form so let me go
ahead and help you create a form in
Django also in this form I will be
creating a template as well so that it
will help you to relate how we can
create a view and how you can create a
template with it so let me go ahead and
let me open my pie jump to create a form
for you so now coming back to a project
we have view stop me by 5 where I have
returned the HTTP response now I will
need this HTTP response now in fact I
need a template so for that I will
return render
which has a request
then you specify the part where a
template is present
and then we'll pass the dictionary so
now we have to create a form for this so
what I do here I first create a form
so hey I'll be passing the big story
that is context
and inside that I'll be having the key
so let's say my key is my registration
form
and farm is my instance
so here as you can see this is my
variable this is my variable which is a
class representation and then I have
passed this context which is a
dictionary over here so this is my key
and this is just the instance of it so
what I have to do I have to create this
index of HTA ceccolini where your
template is present so I first go to my
first app then I'll create a new Python
file
I can say html5 and hell I'll go to
templates folder which has the same name
as post application and then my index
dot HTML
so this is my HTML format now what I
have to do in this HTML I have to create
a form so after my body I have to create
a form so I'll type in form class
so here I'll be representing the path
and then the method which is post
so next I have to light CSRF underscore
token so I have already told you that
Jango itself's take care of the security
so CRA stands for cross-site request
forgery
so these security features are taken
care by Jango itself so inside this I
will pass my key which was my
registration form
just let me check it once to my
registration form Isis copy paste this
and yes my form is done after just
closing body tag over here and yes it's
done now next one I have to do I have to
create forms that py file in the
application so this is my first app and
here I create a new Python file that is
false so first of all here we need some
input so here I write from Django import
forms so this is a pre build thing in
Django so you don't have to create or
write manually things so I create a
class all our registration forms so this
is the instance that I am talking about
now this will basically allows you to
access all the fields so inside this I
will be writing with fees so let's say I
need first name
I need max England to be 20 then I need
last name
and I need one more field that is an
email field
so I'll simply write emails to form that
email wait
so now everything is done to let me just
go to my terminal let's see what happens
when you run the servo
so here it says that you have some
unapplied migration so first you need to
migrate it so I just break the server
using control-c so to migrate the
project I have to write Python managed
dot P by migrate so John goes literally
grade it Auto really tells you what you
have to perform next or what is the
problem you are getting the errors so
once you click on migrate it is
migrating so next if I run this project
let's see what happens so per project is
running so I will go to my project
so oops it gives me an error that name
registration form is not defined so let
me go back to my project and let's see
where I have not defined this
so I just made a silly mistake do not
add the :
so now I just go to my views and here
this registration form is still
appearing as a day so what I will do
here I'll first import registration
forms so I will do I will write help
from period import registration form
so now the red signal has gone so this
will work down let me go back to
terminal again
and let's see what happens
so as soon as you click on the refresh
button your form will be displayed so
here you have first name last name and
an email IEP so here in this first name
field if I save type a value that is IU
XI let's say the last name in Johari and
any email ID that is let's say I usually
add rated you recorder pool now but we
don't have any button or from where we
can submit this registration form so let
me go back to my code and let's see
where we can add this so this is my
views or py file so this is my template
that is index or HTML now here to add a
button to it you just have to type in
input type which is a submit button and
we can give a value or you can say name
such as register
so now when we go to this forum we have
a baton as well to register so he'll if
we type in any values the data will not
get ingested into it so why this will
not happen because we have not carried
these are models for it and from where
you can create data models you have to
create a separate file that is a model
store key by and then you have to create
different objects for it from where you
can retrieve it now if you want to play
around with this registration form just
go back to your code and just write but
as under scope P so let's see what
changes does it go
so here the view has been changed if I
do a stable again let's go to my first
app and if i refresh it it represents in
the tabular format next if I write you
will and I'll click over it so it gives
me in the bullet points so this is how
you can play around with the templates
so let me go back to the presentation
and let's see what else is left with
them so we have covered forms next we
have authentication so Django comes with
a fully featured and secure
authentication system so Django handles
user accounts the group's permission and
all the cuckoo based user sessions so
now if you see at this code it already
contains the earth which basically
represents the authentication so this is
how Django accepts take care of that
authentication part next is your admin
so admin is the strongest part or you
can save the main USP of Django so
Django provides an invade administration
panel
so this basically it takes your data
which is pink period in the models and
then it will retrieve you so this is how
my admin panel looks like you have a
user name and you have a password so let
me go back to my code and let me show
you how exactly an admin panel looks
like so if I go to admin
so this is my username and password for
now I don't have a username and password
so let me go back to my PI charm and let
me create one for you so i come out of
the server first and for creating a
super user you just have to type in
python managed or py create super user
so here it will ask you for username and
it also gives me an option that we blank
if you want to use the same username
that is Yoshi so I will just leave it
blank so it asked me an email address so
it's just an optional thing so the
password it is very important so let's
say I give a password I again ask me a
password so I've given a password which
is too short so let me just give a
better password
so here my super users created
successfully so now I will go again back
to civil both let me just run my server
so now I have a username which is Yoshi
and I've just set my password so let me
just type in he'll so as you can see
here this is my admin panel so he'll you
have groups you have users you can add
the users so if you go to users so you
just have one user which is IO XI so if
I want to delete it you can do anything
in this admin you can add to the users
you can select them with it's an admin
or it's not an admin so you have raised
options over here we can also change the
side we can logout and many other things
so let me go back to the presentation
and let's see what else we need to cover
so we covered the administration part so
this is how a Jango provides a suite
admin panel so now let us move forward
so next is internationalization now
internationalization basically
translates your text in different
languages it doesn't care about locate
specific formatting doesn't care about
the time numbers irrespective of the
timezone so choose the home page with
the welcome message that is translated
in a user's language so this is how
django keeps on winning hearts next we
have the last feature which is security
so I have already discussed some extent
of security so django provides multiple
protection now it provides protection
against clickjacking CSRF so CSRF you
already discussed in the forms so we
have implemented this as well they
provides protection against experience
action and remote code execution so this
was all about the building blocks of
django let us move forward with the
project so here I have just create a
demi website which displays all your
courses the description along with the
date and time backed up with the
database so in this I have used few of
the comples that we have discussed and
some of the advanced stuff so let me
just showcase the project view so let me
open my project just in my di oshi and
Django project jungle toriel
in concurrent winter so now let me just
run the server and let's see what
exactly displays
oops I guess I have not improved with
the manager py file so let me do it
again
so inside janitorial demo I have a
manage of py file
so again I have to run my server so
myself is now running so let me just
open it and I'm just go to localhost so
this is how my website looks like now
here I have some static files and some
text displayed so here is my Python
Django tutorial which is the header of
the website and here in the left hand
side I have their - reiga logo just
below that I have a navigation bar which
contain three tabs that is Home tab
courses tab and contacts tab after that
in the same div container I have placed
four static files which says Eddie Rica
has live classes
it has export instruction it has to
enforce and support and flexible
scheduling and towards the end in the
footer I have given contact you can
contact the Eddie record support or
educator for then we have Facebook the
Facebook page of a do Rica opens up next
we have YouTube so here I've given the
link which opens up the Eddie Aikau
channel so this is how a website looks
like now if I go to home it will just
say hey we will come to in Eureka but if
I go to courses so I do ever provide a
lot of courses so here I put a slider
which changes automatically with the
number of object that it has so right
now I just have Django and Python so if
we click on python the detail
description will be displayed so python
and the course subscription is below and
when it was published it's all written
it's the date and time has been
mentioned similarly if i go to courses
again same is case with django django it
displays the description and the date
and time with respect to it last we have
contact
so encounter I have just displayed the
view which says contact in support and
any record code which basically gives
24/7 support so this is how my website
looks like now in the courses tab I just
have two objects slamming go to admin
page and let's add few more courses
so oily creator username for this
project so the user name is Yoshi and
the password and specifying so this is
my ad mutation pattern that we have just
displayed now one more thing that you
must be noticing over here is the
courses now here you have just let me
pull it to here
so inside courses I have a model which
is post so once we click on this it has
post now here it displays just two
objects now here I can add unlimited
courses now let's have to upload a new
course which has a name let's say appear
and in description I just lied this is a
new course so then you can just provide
the date you can select today and you
can select the time is now and then you
just simply have to save it so now as
you can see the post has been added now
once you go back to your website he will
see the course will be added well just
refresh this page where as you can see
our PA is been added now if I click on
it it will display me the description
the date and time so this is how the
website works so now let me just walk
you through the code of it so for that I
just come out of my cell
so this is my project structure now the
main application that I have is demo so
I'll go to my project demo and I'll see
the settings or you can say the URLs
where the user has been hitting so there
are three URLs the first is the admin
which is by default secondly I have
created my dot URLs and then I have
create a separate application which is
courses and I've given a separate URL
that is course is not URL so these are
the two applications that I've created
and I've given a separate URL to it
so now let me go to my first application
that is mine
so I'll go to my application I go to URL
store py so here I've defined my URL
patterns now we know that you are your
patterns are in the form of regular
expressions so this is my home page
where we have a view where we have an
index method which must be placed in
view and we have given a name space to
it second we have contact where again I
have here a contact method and given a
namespace to it so let me just view
these two methods in the views of py
file so here these two methods are
defined so the very first method is
index so here we have again not returned
the HTTP response so here what we have
done we have simply returned the
templates so what I have done up I have
created a template which is home dot
HTML and there I have passed
dickster you which has a key post and
then it has post 1 and post 2 similarly
contacts I have created one mu H tml
that is basic to HTML and then I have
just passed a dictionary which has a
kiosk content so this is my dictionary
and then I have passed the content to it
which says contact supported at yokutoku
so these are my two templates which says
home good HTML and basic dot HTML so let
me just go to my template folders and
let's see what exactly is their home and
basic so as you can see here it first
extends header dot HTML and then it will
just display this text that is hey
welcome to Erica so this is present in
the ginger logic now if I go to header
dot HTML which it has extracted so let
me just go to here o dot HTML and here
your all HTML is present so this is my
header part where I have just displayed
come to aid Eureka and then I have load
some static files which are the images
now inside that I've also used some
bootstrap which has a link of this
so if you come down you have a body
class which has a diff container so if
you guys are familiar with HTML so you
will really catch up this soon so inside
this sub page for static file and the
text accordingly so here I have given
the source of the image I've cleared one
more folder that is static and inside
static I have my application then you
have folder name as image and then the
name of the image so if you see here I
have a folder which is static then it
has the same name as that of my
application and inside this I have
already told you that I've used some CSS
so this is the bootstrap that I've
already downloaded so it's up to you you
want to use it or you don't wanna use it
so just to represent this better I have
just downloaded the bootstrap and then I
have just pulled over here so I'll just
show you from where you can download the
bootstrap so I go to Google and I'll
just type in bootstrap
so this is the website from where you
can download a bootstrap so he'll it has
a lot of things that you can practice so
he'll say is download bootstrap you now
know the source and many other things
are there now if you see an examples you
can find a million of examples over here
so what I've done I've just simply
downloaded this bootstrap so this is a
zip file that comes with us so what I've
done I've just extracted this folder and
just paste it over here so this file
contains a CSS your phones and your
JavaScript so this already contains a
lot of things it has CSS it has themes
and many other things now the one thing
that I have added is the image folder
now here if you see I have added these
fixed images in the website if you click
on that so this is the first image that
I've added to the website let me show
you where this image is exactly on the
website so this is the first image which
has a name of life classes so this is my
first image similarly there is second
image
and similarly I have other feature
images as well so this is my feature -
this is my picture 3 and this is my
feature 4
so these are all the static files that
are uploaded to this website
so here in my div tag I have given the
source a static my image and the name of
my image similarly I have done it for
all the images next I have created a
navigation bar which is there in the
left hand side so this is my navigation
bar which contains three tabs that is
home courses and contacts so this is my
home
courses and contacts so here I've used
the list which goes to different URLs at
the same time so if I go to my home I
have a different view which is displayed
if I go to courses I have different view
and similarly with contact so this is
all about my left navigation bar again I
have created one more dip tag where I
have placed three static files
so next I've also created one more dip
tag where I have placed the slider so
this is a slider that I'm talking about
this is code for slider and in the end
I've just added a footer so input I have
just added the hyperlinks to it so if
you click on 'contact a new URL will
open if you click on facebook a new link
will open and similarly with the YouTube
so when my application is completed now
let me go to the other application which
is courses so if you go to this URLs of
the main project this I have already
covered so next let us go to the courses
application and just hop into courses
that URLs calm so courses I'll go to URL
stuff py file so here I've created a URL
pattern now here I've already told you
that in courses I have created a list so
the list it collects different objects
which is created in a admin panel so
here I have written a query set which
says post which is the name of my model
and then we have selected all the
objects and then we have ordered by date
now - it represents the descending order
and if you want to place a limit to it
you can place a limit let's say 25 so
only 25 courses can come at one go next
I create one more template which is
courses of HTML and if you need a detail
description to it you have to create
another URL which has a PK which is a
primary key now
you will not create a primary key Django
does it for you so here it will
represent your first column in the model
so here I have specified the model is my
post and here I have displayed one more
template which is inside my courses and
this is post on HTM so let me go to
courses and post at HTM so inside my
templates I have two templates that is
courses and post addition table so this
is the HTML for my slider so it's again
extending my main HTML which is header
dot HTML but inheritance is taking place
by the keyword that is extends now
everything is inside your ginger logic
now here I have started a loop which
says for post in object list now object
list is the list of all the objects
which are there in post now what is post
so post is my model
gentleman first go to my models so here
I have paid one model now I have clear
class which is post
I have different feels like course
description and date so this course has
the maximum 140 description it has X P
love this and similarly the date I have
cleared one more method which basically
returns your self dot course so once
your model has been created let me go
back to my courses on HTML and here
apply it for loop it says yet each
object should come in the list so here I
have displayed the post date day it
should come in this format to display
the year first and the month followed by
the date after that I've just given a
hyperlink which says courses and it will
fetch the post ID which is the work of
primary key basically it will just tell
which column or which courses it has
picked up from so this is my slider next
is your post of HTML so in this post of
HTML I have just inherit the same header
or HTML file and inside this I have to
display the course description and Dave
now if you notice here I have written
post or body-safe and line breaks so if
you go to my website and if I go to
inspect so you can actually see this in
different formats let's see if you want
to see this website in iPhone 6
this is how my website will look like in
iPhone 6 similarly you can try for
different devices as well also if I
close these tabs
now similarly if I open my tab and if I
squeeze this window it will not change
anything so this is what these things do
so this was all about my project so I
hope you get a simple understanding of
what exactly all these components and
how exactly these components work so
with that I'll just wrap up my session
so in this session here first talk about
Django famed book Ohio finval and Django
is used after that they've understood
what exactly is Django and what are the
different features of Django once we got
what exactly is Django if we move on to
the embassy enmity pattern the Django
follows next we just got started with
Django and they appeared a basic web
applications we just displays the HTTP
response after that we have gone to
different components or you can say the
building blocks of Django and finally it
was the end I have showcased my website
where I've implemented different
components and how those components work
so this was all about Django so I hope
you guys liked the session now if you
guys have any doubts or any query stated
to any of the concepts that I have
discussed you can just leave a comment
and we'll fly to it at the earliest
