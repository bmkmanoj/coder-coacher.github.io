building blocks of any Android
application so these are the various
components that are behind a very good
Android applications so if I talk about
the Android building blocks I have the
activity here I have the intent the
services the broadcast receivers and the
content providers so this is typically
an activity so if I talk about an
activity what I can say is an activity
is like a web page which every user can
see so if I have I have here two
activities one is the login activity
that I'm seeing and one is the newsfeed
activity that I'm seeing so in like
every web page you see you call I call
it an activity in Android so this is on
the left you see an login activity on
the right you see a newsfeed activity as
you can see here these are two texting
entries here a button at the book and
the below that and a label at the bottom
which says sign up for Facebook once I
key in the correct credentials I click
on the login button and I can see the
activity which is shown to me on the
right so what typically an activity is
something that you use the sees and the
user can interact with so most
applications in Android have multiple
activities that represent different
screens for example if I talk about one
activity you can see you can use to
display the various settings application
settings and then the second activity
you can see used to display the
application status so this is how I talk
about activities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
