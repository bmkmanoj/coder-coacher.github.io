Eureka in today's session we'll go to
reactive tutorial so if you guys are
familiar with the term reactive then you
might know that it's a front-end library
developed by Facebook so today we'll
learn in and out of reactive but before
we start let's explore a Yankee's
applications I'm sure all of us spend a
lot of time on Facebook if not a lot at
least some so all of you can easily
relate that this application looks
exactly like Facebook comment section in
this comment application we can add a
new comment division existing comment or
even then reply to some other comments
if we show you how here I'm adding the
comment I can delete my comment I can
even delete some others comment if I
have the authority and then I can reply
to others comment like this perhaps you
would have noticed whether I am adding
or deleting comments only that section
is getting updated instead of the entire
page so what I am trying to say is that
we do not have to reload or refresh the
entire application to see the updates so
how exactly is this happening well this
is the magic of free access and that is
what we are going to learn today but
here some of you might ask that why
react is when there are so many other
framers of label out there to understand
this let's take up Facebook as example
so let's go back to the year of 2009
2010 when Facebook used to look somewhat
like this if you guys remember during
this time you have to repeatedly reload
the page for new update at the back end
the Facebook was using the creational
data flow as you can see from this
diagram the detail came from various
sources like the initial later the
real-time video or then choose your
input data now this data was passed to
the dispatcher then to the store and
then ultimately came to the view now
Google is the part where the user is
actually interacting with applications
and being a user whatever you see on the
browser as a web page is the view itself
so if there is a change in data from any
of these sources from the backend in
order to reflect those changes on the
view you have to refresh that entire
page and
it's seen by the user this surely was
not user friendly and moreover this
traditional DW hats and drawbacks like
it use the Dom now what is the dog Don
stands for document object model it is
an object that is created by the browser
each time of webpages loaded
what does done did was it can
dynamically add or remove elements from
a web page at the backend but each time
it did that the browser had to create a
new Dom object for the same web page
this led to more memory consumption
which ultimately made our applications
slow let's take another example to
understand this suppose this is an
application in which we have for block 1
2 3 4 suppose there is a change in block
one from the backend but in order to see
those changes we have to reload the
entire page and then only we can see the
change now as you can see after
reloading the one became one over so
guys this is where the yajes comes into
the picture
with react our entire application is
divided into various components now each
time be done is added it will
automatically update the specific
component whose state has actually
changed so if we have change and block
one it will automatically change to
block one only without reloading the
entire page this reduced our Petri
loading task and because of this the you
I became more user friendly
moreover the react uses a virtual Dom
instead of the real dog which makes our
applications lighter and faster now what
does virtual Dom will understand it
later in this tutorial
for now let's see how we are changed
Facebook's UI so Facebook started
implementing reactive in its newest
restrictions since 2011 after this it's
you I became more user friendly now
whenever new updates gathered a new
storage button popped up at the top of
the page now clicking on this button
will automatically reload only the
newsfeed section without even touching
the rest of the page this drastically
improve the applications performance so
what changed at the back end at the back
end it still used the creation later
flow but now instead of floating in
p-ting what reacted was view of the
previous view rented the components with
updates and then place a new group in
place of the old one this was possible
because unlike other frameworks react
don't have any explicit data binding in
react the only thing we have is a render
function which gets called once for each
component in this render function which
is how our component will look like at
any point of time then this render
function returns a representation of our
view since the component can compose any
components the bridger function gets
called recursively resulting and
building up the whole view so now that
you have understood that why we use
reactive let's now proceed with our
tutorial before we start off let's take
a quick look on today's agenda today
we'll first understand what exactly is
reactive and then we'll find out some of
its major advantages then I will show
you how to install the answers on your
systems once we are done with the
installation
we'll start coding with reactive by
taking up a simple program of hello wood
then we'll jump onto the waves
fundamental concepts which all lie
behind through actuators so without any
delays let's take up our very first
topic that is what is reactive as I have
already told you that reactance is an
open-source JavaScript front-end library
that is used to develop interactive UI
though Facebook was using it since 2011
but it was introduced to the rest of the
world when made 2013 and later on March
2015 it was open toast
moreover the reality is is concerned
with the component that utilizes the
exercise Ness of JavaScript along with
the HTML a template syntax that is it
combines the features of JavaScript and
the HTML and then provides us a dynamic
language it is basically the view in MVC
that is the mode of view controller it
is not concerned with anything except
for the view that is it handles a
representation of our web page at any
point of time but what aspects make it
handle our dynamic view so effectively
it's proceed further and find out where
the react has three main aspects first
it uses the virtual Dom second it has
one-way data-binding
and put it pro
server-side rendering let's now discuss
them in detail the first is the virtual
law so as I've told that it uses a
virtual law now many of you might be
wondering that what is a virtual Dom and
how it is different from the actual door
well like an actual down the virtual Dom
is also a node tree that lists the
elements and attributes and contents as
objects and their properties the axe
render function creates a node 3 out of
the react component and then updates
this 3 in response to the mutations in
the data model which are caused by
various actions done maybe by the user
or by duct system now this virtual Dom
works in three simple steps first will
be whenever any underlying data changes
the entire UI is rear-ended in the
virtual representation after this
the difference between the previous term
representation and the new one is
calculated once the calculations are
done only after that the real Gong will
be updated with the only the things that
have actually changed you can sync it as
a patch as the patches are applied only
to the affected area similarly the
virtual log acts as a patch and is
applied to the elements which have
actually updated or change in the real
doc
this makes our applications faster and
moreover there is new memory base stage
unlike other frameworks react follows
the unidirectional DW let's now move on
to a next aspect that is one-way
data-binding
unlike other frameworks react follows
unidirectional need of loop or one-way
data-binding
as you can see from this diagram in
whole of the process the data is flowing
in the same direction
the major advantage of one-way
data-binding is that throughout the
application the data flows in a single
direction which gives you a better
control over it and because of this the
application stages contains in specific
stores and as a result of this the rich
of the components remains you will
recovered so our third and last aspect
is the server-side rendering focus side
rendering allows you to pre-rendered the
initial state of your react component at
the server side only because of this the
page loads faster with the server-side
rendering the server's response to the
browser is
of the beach that is ready to be
rendered thus the browser can now start
rendering without even having to wait
for all the tower script to be loaded
and executed all of these features
together mix react is a powerful and
robust language which provides us with
some major advantages like because of
the use of virtual on the applications
performance increases moreover it can be
used on client as well as server-side
the reacts j6 file increases the
readability of the code so it becomes
easy to debug and maintain and lastly
the reamped es can be easily integrated
with frameworks like meteor or angularjs
so now that we have already understood
that what is reactive and what are it
advantages
let's now proceed to its installation
when installing three arches is very
easy you just need to add the reactive
dependencies to your code and then you
are good to go
you can add these dependencies either
directly from online repositories or you
can also download them and then add them
to your project folder as you can see
from this code I have added the
dependencies here from the online
repositories now let me show you how to
add the dependencies after downloading
them for that you need to go back to
your project folder so now this is my
project folder inside this available
pasting all my dependencies for that I
will go to my downloads here I have
already downloaded the dependencies I
just have to copy this and then I will
go back to my project folder and paste
them here like this so inside this I
have all my dependencies which all I
need so now to start coding with react
you can use any text editor or any ID
you want so here I am using the webstorm
ID here inside my project folder you can
see that I have already all my
dependencies so now what I will do I
will create one HTML file here let me
name it as index now in this issue
inside we have to provide it with some
title like I have given it demo okay so
now inside the head of this file now we
have to tell
we have the dependencies so using the
script that we will add the dependencies
one by one so let me see the source and
my dependency sources the bill folder in
this first dependency which I need to
add is the react dot min dot Cheers
now this is the main react dependency
that you will need like this have to add
the rest of the dependencies okay so now
I am done with adding my dependencies so
next thing what I have to do is I have
to create one division I have to create
one division so that I can display my
Jack code over here so I will give this
division one ID as one okay so here I
have given the ID as content so for now
we are done with this HTML file now we
have to create one react j65
so for that we will create one file let
me name it as crypt dot j 6 so this J 6
file is a file in which we will add our
oldest yak code now J 6 is a type of
syntax that you can just type and it's
very easy to understand in the act as
you know that everything is a confident
and each component needs a class to
survive so first we have to create a
component and then provide a class for
it so let me just create one component
ok so as you can see I have created when
component name my component and then I
have created one class so now I have
created when conference with the the
name my component and then I have
provided one class for it to survive now
inside this class I will be adding all
the function and the attribute that my
class is going to do so now each
component has one render function which
returns an HTML representation so here
we'll add the render function which will
contain what we want to display so since
we are going to return the hello world
just so here first let me just create
the render function so render this is
all function ok since this will be
returning an HTML representation so
inside the written after right
we are returning only the hello world
well right hello world
okay so just save it so now we are done
with creating our component now you have
to tell react that you want this
component to be displayed over here so
for that
so here we are calling the render
function of react Dom now inside this
function I will tell that I want my
company to be displayed on the HTML feed
so for that I will fetch it by its ID so
I will call it document dot get element
by ID since we haven't win the ID and
it's ID is content okay so now here we
are done with our j65 just save it go
back to the HTML file so now you can
think this j6 file as external CSS or
JavaScript as we refer this file in our
HTML site similarly we have to tailor
HTML file that we have our reactive code
in some other files so for that I will
say script and its source is script dot
j6 okay so one thing we need to add here
is its type so its titles text babel
okay now we are done with both of the
files now what I need to do is just run
this file so now you can see that
HelloWorld it's showing that means we
have successfully compiled our program
and this is how the react is is folding
so here you will see that I've written
the same program here okay and this is
the my HTML file and then this is what
we saw in the up since we are done with
our first program let's now find out the
various fundamental concepts working
behind it here first we'll understand
what is a j6 file and how it is huge
then we'll learn about the components
and its different forms after this we'll
find out what are props
followed by the state then we'll have a
quick look on different pieces of
components life cycle next we'll learn
about the Jax events and how they are
triggered after this we'll see water the
references and keys and understand the
importance in react finally we'll
understand what is react router and then
we'll proceed to a demo so without
wasting any more time let's take up our
very first topic that is earth j6
so j6 stands for the JavaScript example
it says
it's shimmer like sistex that is used by
Z at this end it extends the across trip
so that the examination even like ticks
can coexist with dowser up react code
this syntax is used by the preprocessors
to transform the HTML like syntax that
is found in JavaScript files into
standard JavaScript objects with this
fine instead of just embedding the
JavaScript into HTML we can embed the
HTML into the JavaScript as well
this makes the HTML code easy and also
boosts of the JavaScript performance
moreover it makes our application robust
let's now see how this basics can be
used when the first since the regular
use of jo6 which we already saw in our
hello world program
next is the j6 nested elements now as
you know in react the render function
can render only one HTML element at a
time so in case you want to render
multiple HTML elements then you need to
put them inside the one enclosing tab
let's see how ok so let's try and add
one more HTML element inside this render
function so here let me say I have a ch3
you can see as far as I add this h3 tag
it's showing that here something is
expected that means it can't compile
when error symbol is coming so that's
right
we need to include this inside one in
closing tag so I will be using div here
so let me say Deus okay
so I will just cut it from here and
paste it now inside this tag I can add
as many limits as I want so let me just
use h1 you can use anytime you want so
just okay so now inside this I will say
ed urea I'll just save it go to my
browser
here you can see a jamaica and hello
world so this is how we can use multiple
HTML elements insider or j6 code so the
next is the specify attributes you can
always make your code beautiful by
adding the attributes to it let's see
it's how so inside this what you need to
do you have to create one grayble with
the CSIs element so here I will say that
I have a variable let me name it child
and I just say that in this the color
will be okay let me say the color is red
okay so here I will add this sense as a
style to my HTML element so like this
style I will say it will follow the
style so now the entire division will
spin to it so just save it go to the
browser and reload it now you can see
everything is in red you can specify
size for a single element as well so you
just let's just say that we have a size
two and here let me say the color is
yellow okay and I'll see my h1 tag will
come in yellow color so I will say that
it will follow down side to we just save
it go back to the browser and reload you
can see the edge occurs and yellow color
so this is how our attributes work so
next is embedding the out strip into j6
as a normal HTML we embedded JavaScript
expression similarly here also we can
add the JavaScript expressions directly
into the code let me show you okay I'll
go to the ID and I will say I'll take
one h3 tag and inside other sages some
is something I'll throw in some random
numbers over there so let me just say
save it go back and here it will give me
the sum so the sum is 13 so like this we
can use j6 in the print forms
okay so here we are done with all the
users of j6 let's now move to our next
topic that is the component since the
beginning I am saying that in react
everything is a component so now let's
find out what actually this component is
to understand this list again go back to
Facebook as you can see this is a
Facebook page now this page is divided
into various components like this is a
component this is also conference and
again this is also a company like this
there are many more components over here
since in react everything is a confident
and each component returns a Dom object
it results in splitting up the entire UI
into various independent and reusable
pieces to understand this better imagine
the entire UI as a tree here the
starting component becomes the root and
each of the independent pieces becomes
the branches and which are further
divided into sub branches now this
pattern keep our UI organized and
moreover it allows the design state
changes to logically flow from the root
to the branches and then to the sub
branches
moreover the component can always refer
to other companies let's see how this is
happening ok so here I have one
component named my component so let me
just create few more constants over here
for this again I will use the variable
and let me name it as head up so here
I'll call the reactor to create create
class so inside this again I will create
one render function now what I want this
this render function should return me
just one HTML representation to show
that this is my separate component so
therefore I will just simply write
return and I will put one edge tag over
here and I will say that this is header
component
okay thank this so
create one more component like this so
for that I will just copy this and I
will paste it up here and I will change
its name to footer okay and here it will
say this is food recorded so now how I
can refer these components from my
company for that I just need to go
inside the enclosing tab and here I'll
just sing header and moreover again I
can just say footer like this
save it go back to your browser and
reload so this is how our components
work we can call one government from
other component as we have seen okay I
hope this thing is clear to you now
let's go further in our PVD okay so here
a valid react comlink and always
accepted single object argument and then
produces react element now these are
quantum functional elements as they are
literally the JavaScript functions as
you can see so here we are calling one
handle clip function now whenever this
function is all it will always return us
of an HTML representation so that's why
these are called a functional elements
on addition to this we can simply define
a component through JavaScript as you
can see here we are creating one
function which is named próximo it is
accepting one prop and then it prints
returning one HTML representation so
this is how the conference were moving
further in this the components in react
is campaign to form the stateful and
stateless conference the stateful
conference is those conference which
remembers everything it does whereas the
stateless components and those
components which does not remember
anything it does
so let's now discuss these components in
BD so first we have the stateful
component these are the core components
which store information about this
component state in the Pembry now these
components can change the states as well
they contain the knowledge of the past
current and future possible changes in
state of the component in case there is
a change in state they will always
receive the information from the
stickiest components does this
I call the smart or active competence
next we have the stateless component
these are the stateless components which
always calculates the internal state of
a conference they can never change the
state
moreover they do not contain any
knowledge of the past current as well as
possible future changes of the state of
a component these stateless compounds
provide the referential transparency
that is for same set of inputs it will
always generate same output the Beast
openings are called the term competence
now I hope you have a fair understanding
about the confidence so now let's move
on to a next topic that is props the
simplest way of describing process would
be to say that they function similar to
HTML attributes these are the read-only
components which provide configurational
values thus by using the process we can
always pass data from pn component to a
child comp whenever the component is
declared as a function or a class it
must never change its props all such
components are therefore called the pure
functions if you see this function as I
have seen in this demo we have the
function Khalsa which is accepting
argument x and y so it's proper to
always return the sum so whenever this
function is called it will never change
it from India the only rule we have and
that we must follow is all react
components must act like pure functions
with respect to their prop so let's find
out how it's happening with the help of
practical demo ok so now here what I
will do I'll use the header and here I
will provide the prop but before that
inside this header since we have to
provide information from the parent to
the child
let me say that all my component is the
PM component and header is the child
company so from here I will say that
header has a name let me say name is it
me see Alex ok now what I'll do I'll
just copy and provide one more hidden
prop so I will just change its name to L
say max ok so now how we can provide
this information to try comparing for
that what we need to do here is and just
use one h3 tag and inside this I'll
refer my conference so here I will say
this dot props dot since I have given
the name so I will same name here
okay here we have to create one division
as well
okay so what I'm doing here is that I am
passing one name from my component from
here from my company to the header
company which is just printing out the
representation so this is how the props
per whatever you give an input it will
always display the same up so let's just
save this go back to the browser and
reload so here you can see Alex and Max
it's print so each time the header
components referred it will print this
element I hope you are clear with the
props let's now move to our next topic
that is state so what is the state and
how state can be assigned here in react
the states are the heart or we can see
the core of react components though most
of the components simply taken props and
render them but they can also provide
States these states are used to store
information or data about the components
which can change over time because of
user or system agents you can say that
they determine the components rendering
and behavior and therefore the state
must be kept as simple as possible using
the state it leads through a dynamic and
an interactive components which adjusts
tenses according to the changes so let's
now see how the states can be assigned
with the help of the demo oh yeah
so since we have already used the prop
I'll use this footer to show the state
now to express a state first we need to
a single initial state to the component
because by default its state will be set
to null so for that I will call one
function called get initial State
and three inside this class I have two
functions so I need to separate them so
I will put one come over here inside put
her is a I have user and let me sit it
initial state two and say Eureka so it's
the user initial state is Eureka so now
whenever we call this user it will
always display that Eureka now how can
we refer to this for this what we need
to do is okay now I'll add when do over
here it just cut this from here and
paste it and now here I'll say I have
one h1 tag and here I'll refer to the
state so to refine the current state
what you need to call is this dot state
and our element name is user so here you
will see you like this save it go back
to the browser and reload it
see so our user is in to Vega to make it
more clear let's go back to the and here
I'll say user is in Eureka
whatever you can put any number of
elements you want or let me just say I
have an idea also whose default state is
101 I'll save it and inside the cell say
okay here I'll use one break and then
I'll say ID is
and again I will refer this thing with
the this dot state dot ID so now again
go back to the browser and reload it so
here you can see use it as a direction
IDs 101 so this is how we set it initial
state but as I am told you that we can
change the state as well so let me just
say that after sometimes these two
elements change their state so in order
to do that what we have to do is we need
to call one other function which will
automatically change its state after
state say after two second it will
change the state so I will call the set
timeout function and it will
automatically after two seconds let me
see the two seconds it will change the
state so I'll write two three and after
two seconds it will call one function so
let me write this function as well okay
so now inside this function I'll call
this dot set state inside
60 so inside this a seed function what I
will say that my username should change
from it you record to let me 640 and my
ID should change from 101 to let me say
303 okay so let's now just save it go
back to the browser and rewrote this so
now you can see the user is in Eureka
and ID swati okay let me just go back
and I will increase it's time to let me
change it after five seconds so here
okay so let's now should see so here the
user is in Arica and ID is 40 but after
five seconds it will automatically
update to Swati and 303 so this is how
to react works it will automatically
update the Dom manipulations for us and
because of this the application becomes
extremely fast
so this stage is mainly used if the
component has some internal value and
moreover which does not affect any other
component then only we can use the state
so I hope you
here with the state okay so let's move
to our next topic that is lifecycle of
the components so reactor my 3ds methods
which notifies when a 13-3 of life cycle
of a component
occurs and these methods are called the
lifecycle methods now these methods are
not very complicated
you can think these methods as the
specialized even handlers which are
called at various points to area
components life you can add your own
code to these methods to one various
tasks when we are talking of the life
cycle the life cycle is divided into
four phases they are the initial phase
the editing phase the props change phase
and the last is the unmounting phase now
each of these wings contains some life
cycle methods which are specific only to
them so let's find out what happens
during each of these phases the first
phase in the components life cycle is
that initial phase or the initial
rendering phase this is the phase when
the component is about to start its life
and make its way towards the door so in
order to do so all these methods are
involved in the order the first automata
we have is the gate default props this
method allows you to specify the default
value of this dot drop it gets called
before your component is even created on
any props from the parent at first the
next we have that get initial State now
this method allows you to specify the
default value of this dot state before
you're confident is created just like
the previous method is two-bit called
before the component is created so next
method we have is the component will
mount method now this is the last method
that gets called before your component
gets rendered to the door there is an
important thing to note here if we were
to call set stick method inside this one
you are comparing both rerender then we
have our render method now this is a
method you should be familiar with every
convoying must have this method defined
and this method is responsible for
returning a single root HTML node though
this single root may have many child
node inside it so if you don't wish to
render anything simply return null or
then we have our final method in this
space that is the component did mount
wizard this method will get calls
immediately after your component renders
and gets placed on the door at this
point you can safely perform a Don
coiling operations without worrying
about whether your component has made it
or not
now one thing you need to remember here
is that except for this render method
all of these lifecycle methods can fire
only one so dis confuse an initial piece
then we can move on to our next phase
that is the updating piece so after the
company gets added to the dom they can
potentially update and regenerate only
when a prop or a state change occurs
during this time a different collection
of lifecycle methods gets called let's
see what happens when a state changes
whenever a state change occurs the
component will call it stranger method
again now any component that is relying
on the output of this component will
also call their render function again
well this is done to ensure that our
component is always displaying the
latest version of itself so when I say
change occurs all of these methods gets
involved in order so here our first
method is should comprehend update
method sometimes you don't want your
component to update when a state change
occurs now this method will allow you to
control this updating behavior if you
use this method and return a true the
conference will update it will skip the
updating part next we have the component
will update method this method gets
called Church before your component is
about to update one thing you should
note here is that you can't change your
state by calling this dot set state
forms this method now again we have the
render method so if you didn't override
the update via should convent update
method the code inside the render method
will get called again to ensure that
your component displays itself properly
again the last method we have is the
component did update method now this
method gets called after your component
update and the render method has been
called if you need to execute any code
after the update
if you can put it inside this method so
now let's move on to our next frame that
is the props change phrase after a
component has been rendered into the
term the only other time the component
will update is when a prop changes its
value now this is when all these methods
will be called the only method that is
new here is the component will receive
prop if you want to compare it we can go
back to the previous slide and you can
see we have the chute component of these
methods component will update method
render method and component did object
method and in next phase we have should
come rate update complaint will update
render and component did update so here
only this method in snoo now this method
returns one argument and this argument
continues the new prop value that is
about to be assigned to it the rest of
the lifecycle methods behave identical
to the methods which we saw in the
previous phase so this is how the props
change phase is completed now move on to
our last phase that is the unmounting
face now this is the phase when the
component is destroyed and removed from
the door there is only one lifecycle
method over here that is the component
will unmount method you can perform any
cleanup related tasks here so just
removing the event listener stopping the
timers etc after this method gets called
your component is completely removed
from the door so here we are done with
all the pieces of the components
lifecycle along the dual method so now
let's move on to our next topic that is
the evil well if you guys are familiar
with HTML and JavaScript then you might
know that what are evils in react also
even though the triggered reactions to
specific actions like mouse over mouth
clay key press etc and even these events
are very similar to handling the demons
in dog but here are some syntactical
differences in react the events are
named using the camel keys instead of
using the lowercase more overt entry as
the events are passed as functions
rather than the strings here the even
arguing contains assists of properties
which are specific to an event what I am
trying to say is that
even Christ contains its own properties
and behavior which can be exist only
wire eventhandler
moreover in other you I once even
handler is a sign for each event which
leads to more memory consumption and
also makes our work videos button react
the even handler is not attached to the
Dom elements directly rather it only
uses the route event handler which is
responsible for listening to all the
events and then calls the appropriate
event handler as the need let's now see
how the even is created and triggered
practically so to make you understand I
will be using one demo code here let me
show you how it will be looking so I'll
show you how to events work by the help
of this example here I have one bull
hour and one button with me so clicking
on this button will turn on the bull and
again when we click it will turn off so
let's see how this is happening for this
let's go back to our code ok so now what
I do and leave this file like this and
I'll create one more Jetix file so here
I'll see even script dot J six okay so
now inside this file what I will do I'll
create one variable and let me just say
its name as well okay so again we'll
call free app dot create class and
inside this will first we have to
mention our render function okay now
inside this range of function I will say
that I have one image and just close it
and I will say that it's coming from
some source and named that source later
then we have one button over here okay
so I forgot to put it inside the
division so here's to just cut it and
paste over it
okay so it's fine now and now I'll add
one button over here
here and say that this button on
clicking this button something happens
so what can happen
I love right at 8:04 now let me just
name it as quickly okay so here we have
one button clicking on which it will do
something and here is one image which
will be shown okay so here we are done
with the render function since we want
on our HTML page we want one button plus
one pulse so we here we have described
both of the things now we have to set an
initial state for our bulb status so let
me say get a shil state and this is a
function and since inside this bulge
class we have two functions we have tog
in separate things and inside this we
will say that - okay
let's return the status let me sit the
status first so I'll say the bulb status
is by default it's a false
so now inside this I have to add two
images as well because on the page we
are displaying the images for that I
will go to my downloads okay here I have
already downloaded two images and copy
them come back to my project and here I
will say that I need one directory and
I'll name it as image now inside this
I'll just paste them now here you can
see I have both one and two image so
this is the initial State
but now we want that on clicking this
thing this button something should
happen so let us create one function to
tell what exactly will happen on
clicking the button so for that I'll say
that we have one function named switch
so this is a function we separate it so
now this function will change the status
from false to true and true to false
because we want on each click the status
should change so here what I will see is
this dot set state okay inside this and
say that my status should change so for
that and say status status should always
change from whatever the current stages
so for that this dot state dot status
and we want each time the state to
change so for that I'll say not so
whatever the current status is it will
always change it to the opposite one so
if it is true it will change it to false
and if it's false it will change it to
true now we have to provide the souls
for this what I need to do is inside
this render function okay so here we
have to put this code inside the filter
which I forgot okay return since return
it will return all the HTML
representation you must remember this
thing okay so now inside this one what I
will do I will see I have one variable
and I'll say this
means displayable so which one will it
display so here I will put the sources
along with a conditional operator
whatever the condition is according to
that it will display the bulb so I'll
see this dot to state your status if
this returns a false it will show the
image 1 and if it is true it will filter
the image 2 so for that I'll give the
part of the image that is image 2 dot
PNG so this is the folder where are my
images and this is the name of my file
versus when my condition is false it
will show image / first image add a
image / paint
ok just save it ok so like this
difference we are changing the image
over here so here I'll say that image
source is dispar so depending on the
condition it will automatically retrieve
the image okay here we are done so here
what is happening depending on the
condition the image will change but now
we have to tell it also that on clicking
the button you have to do this thing so
for that here I'll say that this dot
switch that whenever I click on my
button then switch function should be
called so for that I've written the
third switch here we'll call the G act
Dom dot render okay and inside this I
will say that grab this bulk component
and displayed over the HTML page whose
ID is content
so here we are done so save this go back
to the HTML file and tell it that our j6
file is now even script or j6 so just
save this now and run it now you can see
we have a bulb along with a button now
clicking on this will turn this on and
again if wicked it will again turn off
so this is how the events are created
and react so now I hope that you can
create your own events so let's take up
our next orbit that is ripped trips and
for the differences now in react opinion
component and interact with it style
component only through props so if you
want to modify the child you need to
rerender it with the new prop this is
the typical data flow so in case you
want to modify the child without
following this typical flow what you
need to do is make the child an instance
of the react complaint or the term
element in such cases only you can use
as reference
now this rip attribute makes it possible
to store a reference to a portable
reactor element or a component
written by its company's render function
now this can be valuable when you need
to reference it from within another
company a render function as you can see
here one of my current function is
returning one reference which is then
used by another components render
function so let's now see how this works
practically so here I'll go back to my
code here what I will do I'll create one
more script file because I don't want to
confuse you guys with all these stuff so
here I'll create one more file and I'll
just name it as a ref script dot J so
what I'll do here I'll create one
variable let me name it as a riff
component and again I have to create one
class for this I'll call free act dot
free class
okay so inside this I'd be putting my
function so here first of all I have to
create one render function so this
render function will always return me
something okay so here let me create one
division first so what here I will do I
will create one input text box along
with a button so inside this text box
you have to type your name which I will
take and display it back to the webpage
so how we can do it with help of
reference will see so first let me say
I'll use one h2 tag here and I'll say
the name so here inside this I will
create an input element okay so it's
type will be 'text only and and next
I'll create one button for this
let me see
vector and here whenever we click this
button something will happen that is it
should retrieve the name from this input
ball and in this state for that I will
say that on click it will do something
so for now we are done with this so how
the references are created now so here
whatever we get an input I want this to
refer by this method so for that I need
to create one just here
so here I will say that we have a riff
and in this we have to take that input
so from here we'll graph the input
whatever the value is the user is
passing it will take that input and it
will be then referred by the function
which will be called on unpick so here
I'll just name this reference as let me
name it as input demo so let's say this
dot input demo okay and it will be
referred by the input like this okay so
now let me say that okay let me put one
break function over here so that this
input X box and a button should appear
in different lines okay so here we are
done with the rent function now what we
want to do is we are going to call one
function over here that whenever with
this is played it should retrieve the
value from this thing so for that I'll
create one function let me say display
function
this function will do whatever the user
give that input it will take the name
and it will display to win an HTML page
so for that I need to create one more
let me see
I have h1 tab over here and I'll say hi
to whatever the name is so here I want
to display my user's name so for that I
will create one span over here and I
will provide one ID do this so I will
just say this name okay so now what my
display function will do it will take
this input value and it will display it
on this area so for that let me create
one variable and say name so here any
here now this function can refer to my
difference so to refer this we will say
this dot whatever our reference name is
that is input demo I will just copy this
and paste it here and then I will say
that to receive its value so here we are
done so one thing here which we need to
do is we have to display this name
whatever the value is in name we have to
the state over here so for that what we
need to do is as you know to display it
on the web page we have to use the inner
HTML and for that we have to get the
span by its ID so get element by ID and
the ID name is dis ting just poisoning
and then we'll say dot inner HTML and
here we want to display the name
okay so this thing is done here now
again since we need to tell it react
that you have to rendered the stress
component over the content area so here
called the react Dom dot window inside
this you have to call ref component and
again get the division bar its ID so
document dot get element by ID where the
ID is content okay so here we are done
just save this file okay know here we
are still left with this thing we have
to tell that on clicking you have to
call it display function on each button
with this display function should be
called
so now we are done so I will just save
this and I will go back to the HTML and
I will tell that our J text file has a
gain change and now it's like rough
script so save this and run this so here
you can see that I have name and I have
been button and then it says hi so as
soon as I put my name over here and just
click it it will say - so this is how
the references are used but one thing
you should remember is references should
be used in the dire need only so
references can be used when you are
trying to manage the focus or X election
or media playback then it can be used
while triggering the imperative
animations and moreover when we are
integrating with the third-party Don
libraries then also we can use the RIP
so I hope now the rest concept is clear
to you so let's take up our next topic
that is keys we'll these are the
elements which helps we have to identify
different components unity they are
specially helpful when we are working
with dynamically created company
assigning the key value will help you
identify the components unity even after
they have changed as you can see from
this diagram here we have two components
with different key values one with key
101 and one
102 now these are ready for the first
time so the react will rain is them
without any problem but next time when
we try to render them here is the
complaint once key value is same whereas
comparing to key value has changed so
now the react will render only the
second component not the first one as
the first component key is same so here
this react will think that as we haven't
changed so the element is same so no
need to render this one and it will go
ahead and render the second component so
this is how the key works in real now
finally we come to our last topic that
is router in react router is a powerful
routing library that is built on the top
of react framework using the router we
can quickly add new screens and close to
the application
it keeps the entire URL in sync with the
data that is being displayed in the web
page moreover it provides us some of the
major advantages like it can easily
understand different views of the
application it can restore any state and
view of the application just by using a
simple URL along with this it can
efficiently handle the nested views and
resolution with react router the state
of the components can be easily restored
by the user himself just by navigating
backward or forward moreover by the
router we can maintain a standardized
structure and behavior of the
application also it can do implicit
thesis translations while navigating
only so here we are done with our router
also I hope now you understand about
three answers Perl what it is how it is
implemented and what all things we can
do with it you know now so I think you
guys are ready to create one application
with reactive thus without any more
delay let's now find out the code behind
your Facebook current application which
I use in the beginning so if you guys
remember I showed the demo of this
application
so now we'll see what are the codes
which are working behind this
application okay thanks so here we are
with our code
to save time I have already created HTML
the PHP and the CSS files which all I am
going to use in my application and well
I have already downloaded the pictures
also so that I can display the profile
pictures if you remember from that
application okay so this is our HTML
file I have included the dependencies
here and I have told that I have one
script on g6 since I will be naming
white g6 final script only and here I
have added the sea sized sheet as so now
next step what we have to do is create
the j65 so without any delay let's get
started with it so inside this as we
were doing earlier will create one
script ESX okay so now inside this file
I'll be creating some components along
with their functions and these all
components will be doing some or the
other work so here first we'll start off
by creating the base means first we'll
create one ball in which all our
comments will be posted for that I will
create one comparing named ball form and
then inside this I will be putting some
functions like get initial state means
to set different states I will be
setting different states inside this and
then finally I'll use one render
function which will be for this penguin
taste area so without any DA let's
quickly start
you
okay so here we are done with our first
component now let's move on and create
one another component and let me just
name it as well comment form
so now or what this comment is doing
that it will accept all the new comments
and it will at the back in process them
and integrate them with this wall so for
that again we'll set the initial state
and then tell that how many phases it
will go through and then we'll put it to
the gender function so let's quickly do
that
okay so we are done
component as well now that move on to
our third component that is where let me
see Almond grid okay so now this
component will be taking the comments
and then it will link them to a
particular user I have specified for
users in my PHP files now whichever the
user will add the comment if we take the
comment and it will just integrate with
it at the backend so for that what we
have to do this again create the class
and put some initial estate and then
give a render function to it and just
add some methods in order to integrate
them so let's proceed
so here as you can see in
function will provide one division in
which we'll place our comments along
with its related profile pic so this is
how we are integers in the comments
along with the way so now we'll create
another component and now let me name
this as comment to block
now this comment will be displaying the
comments along with its fusions in order
they are inserted like in this what we
are doing we are presenting ones in
presentation this component will be
taking in the comment and integrating it
with its related profile page and then
this block what will do it will do state
back on the HTML page so for that let's
see
so now we have done with our comment
block so since this complaint is done
after this will create one more
component and what this component will
be doing is it will be responsible for
updating our comment fold like whenever
a comment is deleted or any comment is
added at that time this component will
get activated since we are updating the
ball on this so let me just leave it as
wall update
okay I hope you can understand what's
going on so let's just quickly create
this component and see inside this
complaint we will have some function and
along with that we will have the render
function which will keep on updating the
HTML presentation place whenever the
comments are updated that is ever added
or deleted at that time it will assign
the particular profile pic and when
linking with the company and then
display so let's see how it's doing
you
okay so here we are done with our update
koala dates and then okay so here we'll
create one more component that is volte
and now this component will be
responsible for maintaining all the
comments on the wall so whether we are
adding the comment on we are deleting it
from there this component will range it
accordingly so let's just get on it
okay so finally we'll create one final
component so this will be the component
which will be triggering the render
function from this continent list all
the components will be triggered so
basically this is the one gram which
will be responsible for our view so
let's get started with this one
so this is our final and min conferring
so here we'll turn react at first you
have to render this wall container then
this ball container will call the ball
feet okay so this is our wall feet
company now this one feet will are in
returned in it will call one form and
ball updates like this internally one
component will call another component
and this will build up a whole view so
let's just quickly render this wall
container so for this we have to call
the reactor dot render and now in sight
this will tell that you need to render
the wall container and you have to put
it in the place of container so here you
see document dot get element by ID and
let me just cross-check the ID so IDs
container just copy this one and go back
and paste finally we are done with the
whole of the reactors code
no no in alphabet I hope yeah okay so
here I am on my browser so what I do
I'll just say localhost localhost
it is h1 and my application is react yes
so okay so you can see that my
application is up and running so let's
just edit it out whether it is working
or not so I'll say hi yeah it's
accepting the comments I can delete my
comment and let me try dripline cincy
hello so as you can see our application
is perfectly working so I hope I was
able to make it clear how it's working
how the codes are working so now I will
conclude this tutorial here thanks for
