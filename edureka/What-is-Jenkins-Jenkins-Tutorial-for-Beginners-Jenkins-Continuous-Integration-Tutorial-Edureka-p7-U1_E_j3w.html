Rekha in today's session we'll focus on
what is Jenkins so without any further
ado let us move forward and have a look
at the agenda for today first we'll see
why we need continuous integration what
are the problems our industries were
facing before continuous integration was
introduced after that we'll understand
what exactly is continuous integration
and we'll see various types of
continuous integration tools
among those standardized integration
tools will focus on Jenkins and we'll
also look at Jenkins distributed
architecture finally in our hands-on
parts will prepare a build pipeline
using Jenkins and I'd also tell you how
to add Jenkins slaves so I hope we all
are clear with the agenda kindly give me
a quick confirmation by writing down in
the chat box when it says yes
so does Quinn elucha says looks great as
a orphan all right cool
thanks for the confirmation guys now I
will move forward and we'll see why we
need continuous integration so this is a
process before continuous integration
over here as you can see that there is a
group of developers who are making
changes to the source code that is
present in the source code repository
this repository can be a git repository
subversion repository etc and when the
entire source code of the application is
written it will be built by tools like
and maven etc and after that that built
application will be deployed on to the
test server for testing if there is any
bug in the code developers are notified
with the help of the feedback loop as
you can see it on your screen and if
there are no bugs then the application
is deployed onto the production server
for release I know you must be thinking
that what is the problem with this
process this process looks fine as you
first write the code then you build it
then you test it and finally you deploy
it but let us look at the flaws that
were there in this process one by one so
this is the first problem guys as you
can see that there is a developer who is
waiting for a long time in order to get
the test results as first the entire
source code of the application will be
built and then only it will be deployed
on to the test server for testing it
takes a lot of time so developers have
to wait for a long time in order to get
the test results the second problem is
since the entire source code of the
application is first build and then it
is tested so if there is any bug in the
code developers have to go through the
entire source code of the application as
you can see that there is a frustrated
developer because he has written a code
for an application
which was built successfully but in
testing there were certain bugs in that
so he has to check the entire source
code of the application in order to
remove that bug which takes a lot of
time
so basically locating and fixing of bugs
was very time-consuming so I hope you
are clear with the two problems that we
have just discussed kindly give me a
quick confirmation so that I can move
forward or if you have any doubts please
write it down in your chat box I'll be
happy to help you any doubts guys so
shall I move forward or itag for the
confirmation now we'll move forward and
we'll see two more problems that were
there before continuous integration so
the third problem was software delivery
process was slow developers were
actually wasting a lot of time in
locating and fixing of bugs instead of
building new applications as we just saw
that locating and fixing of bugs was a
very time-consuming task due to which
developers are not able to focus on
building new applications you can donate
that to the diagram which is spreaded in
front of your screen as we always a lot
of time in watching TV doing social
media similarly developers were also
wasting a lot of time in fixing bugs
alright so let us have a look at the
fourth problem that is continuous
feedback continues feedback related to
things like build failures test status
etc was not present due to which the
developers were unaware of how their
application is doing so we have a
question guys it is from Anisha
she is asking the process that you
showed before continuous integration
there was a feedback loop present very
good question or Lucia so what I'll do
I'll go back to that particular diagram
and I'll try to explain you from their
solution the feedback loop that you are
talking about is here when the entire
source code of the application is built
and tested then only the developers are
notified about the bugs in the code
alright when we talk about Cantonese
feedback suppose this developer that I'm
highlighting makes any coming to the
source code that is present in the
source code repository and at that time
the code should be pulled and it should
be built and the moment it is built the
developer should be notified about the
build status and then once it is built
successfully it is then deployed onto
the test server for testing at that time
whatever the test data says the
developer should be notified about it
similarly if this developer makes any
commits to the source code at that time
the code should be pulled it should be
built and the base data should be
notified the developers after that it
should be deployed on to the test server
for testing
and the test results should also be
given to the developers I suppose you
have got the different solution between
the country's feedback and feedback
yeah I'll summarize it once again so
what happens when we talk about feedback
feedback is present as you can see first
the entire source code of the
application will be written it will be
built and it will be tested and then
only the developers will be notified
about the bugs if there are any when we
talk about continuous feedback suppose
the developer that I'm highlighting with
my cursor makes any commits in the
source code that is present in the
source code repository all right so at
that time the code should be pulled it
should be build the developer should be
notified about the build results
similarly it should be deployed on to
the test server for testing and the
developer should also be notified about
the test results similarly if the second
developer makes any coming to the source
code at that time the code should be
pulled it should be built developers
should be notified about the build
results and after that the build
application should be deployed onto the
test server for testing and the
developer should be notified about the
test results as well so I hope you all
are clear what is the difference between
continets feedback and feedback so
incontinence feedback you're getting the
feedback on the run all right thanks for
the confirmation anusha so we'll move
forward and we'll see how exactly
continuous integration addresses these
problems let us see how exactly
continuous integration is resolving the
issues that we have discussed so what
happens here there are multiple
developers so if any one of them makes
any coming to the source code that is
present in the source code repository
the code will be pulled it will be built
tested and deployed so what advantage we
get here so first of all any comment
that is made to the source code is build
and tested due to which if there is any
bug in the code developers actually know
where the bug is present or which commit
has caused that error so they don't need
to go through the entire source code of
the application they just need to check
that particular commit which has
introduced the bug all right so in that
way locating and fixing of bugs becomes
very easy
apart from that the first problem that
we saw the developers have to wait for a
long time in order to get the test
result here every commit made to the
source code is tested so they don't need
to wait for a long time in order to get
the test result so when we talk about
the third problem that was software
delivery process was slow is completely
removed in this process developers are
not actually focusing on the locating
and fixing of bugs
because that won't take a lot of time as
we just discussed instead of that
they're focusing on building new
applications now a fourth problem was
Cantonese feedback was not present but
over here as you can see on the run
developers are getting the feedback
about the build status test results etc
developers are continuously notified
about how their application is doing so
I hope we are clear with this any
questions any doubts please write it
down in the chat box guys I wanted to
add this thing let us make this session
interactive all right
you would even enjoy it if it's a
one-way conversation so whatever doubts
whatever questions you have please write
it down your chat box and I'll be very
happy to help you and if you have no
questions just give me a confirmation so
that I can move forward
okay so Quincy is cool Anisha says no
routes
Anusha says no doubts jessica says
please move forward all right all right
thanks for your confirmation guys so
I'll move forward now I compare the two
scenarios that is before continuous
integration and after continuous
integration now over here what you can
see is before continuous integration as
we just saw first the source code of the
application will be built the entire
source code then only it should be
tested but when we talk about after
continuous integration every commit
whatever change you made in the source
code whatever change the mind you change
is when you commit into the source code
that time only the code will be pulled
it will be build and then in be tested
they will oppose have to wait for a long
time in order to get the test results as
we just saw because the entire source
code will be first build and then it
will be deployed onto the test server
but when we talk about continuous
integration the test result of every
commit will be given to the developers
and many talk about feedback there was
no feedback that was present earlier but
in continuous integration feedback is
present for every commit you made to the
source code you will be provided with
the relevant result all right
so now let us move forward and we'll see
what exactly is continuous integration
now in continuous integration process
developers are required to make frequent
commits to the source code they have to
frequently make changes in the source
code and because of that any change made
in the source code will be pulled by the
continuous integration server it will be
pulled by the continuous integrations
over and then that code will be built or
you can say to be compiled all right now
depending on the continuous integration
that you are using or depending on the
need of your organization it will also
be deployed under the test server for
testing and once testing is done it will
also be deployed onto the production
server for release and developers are
continuously getting the feedback about
their application on the run so I hope I
am clear with this particular process
kindly give me a quick confirmation so
that I can move forward any questions
any queries guys please write it down in
a chat box
okay so Alicia says no questions when it
says no questions Quinn no doubts
alright thanks for confirmation guys so
we'll see the importance of continuous
integration with the help of a case
study of Nokia so Nokia I adopted a
process called nightly build nicely
built can be considered as a predecessor
to continuous integration let me tell
you what all right so over here as you
can see that there there are developers
who are committing changes to the source
code that is present in a shared
repository alright and then what happens
in the night
this is a build so this build server
will hold the shared repository for
changes and then it will pull that code
and prepare a build all right so in that
way whatever commits are made throughout
the day are compiled in the night so
obviously this process is better than
writing the entire source code of the
application and then compiling it but
again since if there is any bug in the
code developers have to check all the
comments that have been made throughout
the day so it is not the ideal way of
doing things because you are again
wasting a lot of time in locating and
fixing of bugs all right so I want
answers from you all guys what can be
the solution to this problem
how can Nokia address this particular
problem since we have seen what exactly
continuous integration is and why we
need so you can answer this question
guys come on all right so Jessica says
the build should be triggered for every
commit that is absolutely correct when
it says continuous integration so does
AJ or I let me tell you guys you all are
correct
now without wasting any time I will move
forward and I will show you how Nokia
solved this problem so Nokia I adopted
continuous integration as a solution in
which what happens developers commit
changes to the source code in a shared
repository all right and then what
happens is a continuous integration
server this continuous integration
server pose the repository for changes
if it finds that there is any change
in the source code and it will pull the
code and compile it so what is happening
the moment you commit a change in the
source code continuous integration
server will pull that and prepare a
build so if there is any bug in the code
developers know which commit is causing
that error all right so they can just go
through that particular commit in order
to fix the bug so in this way locating
and fixing of bugs was very easy but we
saw that in nightly builds if there is
any bugs they have to check all the
commits that have we made throughout the
day so with the help of continuous
integration they know which commit is
causing that error so locating and
fixing of bugs then take a lot of time
all right so any questions any doubts
till here guys any questions all right
so we have no questions
so shall I move forward okay before I
move forward let me give you a quick
recap of what we have discussed till now
first we saw why we need continuous
integration what were the problems that
industries were facing before continuous
integration was introduced after that we
saw how continuous integration addresses
those problems and we understood water
exactly continuous integration is and
then in order to understand the
importance of continuous integration we
saw case study of Nokia in which they
shipped it from nightly build to
continuous integration
all right so shall I move forward kindly
give me a quick confirmation jessica
says yes Bennet says yes as I say school
all right guys so we'll move forward and
we'll see various containers integration
tools available in the market these are
the four most widely used continuous
integration tools first is Jenkins on
which we'll focus in today's session
then buildbot
Travis and bamboo all right and let us
move forward and see what exactly
Jenkins is so Jenkins is a continuous
integration tool it is an open-source
tool and it is written in Java how it
achieves continuous integration it does
not with the help of plugins Jenkins
have well over thousand plugins and that
is a major reason why we are focusing on
Jenkins let me tell you guys it is the
most widely accepted tool for continuous
integration because of its flexibility
and the amount of plugins that is
support so as you can see from the
diagram itself that it is supporting
various development deployment testing
technologies for example get maven
selenium puppet ansible Nagios all right
so if you want to integrate a put
you need to make sure that plugins or
that tool is installed in your Zen game
now for better understanding of Jenkins
let me show you the Jenkins dashboard
I've installed Jenkins in my Ubuntu boss
so if you want to learn how to install
Jenkins you can refer the Jenkins
installation video so this is a Jenkins
dashboard guys as you can see that there
are currently no jobs because of that
this section is empty otherwise it will
give you the status of all your build
jobs over here now when you click on new
item you can actually start a new
project all over from the scrap alright
so any questions tin here guys any
queries you have regarding Jenkins
alright so we have a question from Roger
he's asking what is the difference
between Hudson and Jenkins as a let me
tell you this thing that there is no
difference between Hudson in Jenkins
Hudson was only the earlier name of
Jenkins all right so there's no much
there's no difference between Hudson and
Jenkins okay so we have one more
question it is from Quinn Quinn is
asking you've talked about plugins so do
we need to install those plugins or it
will come automatically with Jenkins so
what happens Quinn when you are
installing Jenkins it will give you two
options first is install relevant
plugins in which there are certain set
of plugins which are there and that will
be installed and on the right hand side
there is option called select the
plugins so what there you can go and
select the plugins that you want to
install and once you have installed
Jenkins then also if you need a plug-in
you can actually install that I'll tell
you how to do that later in the session
I hope this answers your question all
right Thank You Quinn for your
confirmation now let us go back to our
slides let us move forward and see what
are the various categories of plugins as
I've told you earlier is when the
Jenkins RC is continuous integration
with the help of plugins alright and
Jenkins approached Vale over thousand
plugins and that is a major reason why
Jenkins is so popular nowadays so the
plug-in categorization is there on your
screen
well there are certain plugins for
testing like j-unit selenium etc when we
talk about reports we have multiple
plugins for example HTML publisher for
notification also we have many plugins
and I've written one of them that is
sentence build notification plug-in and
we talked about deployment we have
plugins like deploy plug-in and we
talked about compile we have plugins
like maven and etc alright so let us
move forward and see how to actually
install a plug-in on the same event to
box where my Jenkins is installed so
over here in order to install
Jenkins what do you need to do is you
need to click on manage and conduction
and over here as you can see this is an
option called manage plugins just click
over there as you can see that it has
certain updates for the existing plugins
which I have already installed right
then there is an option called installed
where you'll get the list of plugins
that are there in your system all right
and at the same time there's an option
called available it will give you all
the plugins that are available with
Jenkins alright so now what I'll do I'll
go ahead and install a plug-in that is
called HTML publisher so it's very easy
what you need to do is just type the
name of the plug-in here it is HTML
publisher plug-in just click over there
and install without restart so it is now
installing that plug-in we need to wait
for some time so it has now successfully
installed now let us go back to our
Jenkins dashboard so we have understood
what exactly Jenkins is and we have seen
various Simpkins plugins is win so now
is the time to understand Jenkins with
an example we'll see a general vote flow
how Jenkins can be used alright so let
us go back to a slide so now as I've
told you earlier is when we will see a
Jenkins example so let us move forward
so earlier what is happening developers
are committing changes to the source
code and that source code is present in
a shared repository it can be a git
repository subversion repository or any
other repository alright now let us move
forward and see what happens now now
over here what is happening there is a
Jenkins server it is actually polling
the source code repository at regular
intervals
to see if any developer has made any
commit to the source code if there is a
change in the source code it will pull
the code a little prepare a build and at
the same time developers will be
notified about the build results now let
us execute this practically alright so I
will again go back to my Jenkins
dashboard which is there in my ubuntu
box over here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a new item alright
basically a new project now over here
I'll give a suitable name to my project
you can use any name that you want I'll
just write compile and now I click on
freestyle project the reason for doing
that is freestyle project is the most
configurable and flexible option it is
easier to set up as well and at the same
time any of the options that we
configure here are present in other
build jobs with
move forward with freestyle project and
I'll click on ok.now over here what I
will do I'll go to the source code
management tab and it will ask you for
what type of source code management you
want I'll click on get and over here you
need to type your repository URL in my
case it is HTTP github.com your user
name slash the name of your repository
and finally dot get all right now in the
build option you have multiple options
alright so what I'll do i click on
invoke top-level maven target now so now
over here let me tell you guys that
maven has a build life cycle and that
build life cycle is made up of multiple
build phases typically the sequence for
build phase will be first you validate
the code then you compile it then you
test it then you perform unit tests by
using suitable unit testing framework
then you package your code in a
distributable format like a jaws then
you verify it and you can actually
install any package that you want with
the help of install build phase and then
you can deploy it in the production
environment for release so I hope you
have understood the maven build
lifecycle so in the goals tab so what I
need to do is I need to combine the code
that is present in the github account so
for that in the goals tab I need to
write combined so this will trigger the
compile build phase of maven now that's
it guys that's it just click on apply
and save now on the left hand side is an
option called build now to trigger the
build just click over there
and you will be able to see that the
build is starting in order to see the
console output you can click on that
build and you'll see the console output
so it has validated the github account
and it is now starting to combine that
code which is there in the github
account
so we have successfully compiled the
code that was present in the github
account now let us go back to the
Jenkins dashboard now in the Jenkins
dashboard you can see that my project is
displayed over here and as you can see
the view color of the ball indicates
that as that it has been successfully
executed all right now let us go back to
the slides
now let's move forward and see what
happens once you have compile your code
now the code that you have compiled you
need to test it all right so what
Jenkins will do it will deploy the code
on to the test server for testing and at
the same time developers will be
notified about the test results as well
so let us again execute this practically
I will go back to my Ubuntu box again so
in the github repository the test cases
are already defined all right so we are
going to analyze those test cases with
the help of maven so let me tell you how
to do it we'll again go and click on new
item and over here we'll give any
suitable name to a project I'll just
type tests and I will again use
freestyle projects for the reason that I
have told you earlier click on OK and in
the source code management tab now
before applying unit testing on the code
that has compiled I need to first review
it with the help of PMD plug-in and do
that so for that I will again click on
new item and over here I need to type
the name of the project so I'll just
type it as cold underscore review
freestyle project click OK now the
source code management tab I will again
choose gate and give my repository URL
HTTP github.com slash user name slash
name of the repository dot cater all
right now scroll down now in the build
tab I'm going to click over there and
again I will click on invoke top-level
maven target now in order to review the
code I'm going to use the matrix profile
of maven so how to do that let me tell
you you need to type here - P matrix P
md : p md alright and this will actually
produce a PMD report that contains all
the warnings and errors now in the post
build action tab I click
publish PMD analysis result that's all
click on apply and save now finally
click on build now and let us see the
console output so it has now pulls the
code from the github account and
performing the code review so that
successfully review the code now let us
go back to the project over here you can
see an option called PMD warnings just
click over there and it will display all
the warnings that are there present in
your code so this is the PMD analysis
report over here as you can see that
there are total 11 warnings and you can
find the details here is when like
package you have then you have then you
have categories then the types of
warnings which are there like for
example empty cache blocks empty finally
blocks now you have one more tab called
warnings over there you can find where
the warning is present the filename
package alright then you can find all
the details in the details tab it will
actually tell you where the warning is
present in your code alright now let us
go back to the Jenkins dashboard and now
we will perform unit tests on the code
that we have combined so that again I
will click on new item and I'll give a
name to this project I will just buy it
test and I'll click on free side project
ok now in the source code management tab
I'll click on get now over here I'll
type the repository URL HTTP github.com
slash username slash name of the
repository dot skit and in the build
option I click on again invoke top-level
maven target now over here as I told you
earlier as well that maven build life so
I can have multiple build phases like
first it will validate the code compile
the tested package then it will verify
it then it will install it certain
packages are required and then finally
it will deploy it alright so one of the
phase is actually testing that forms
unit testing using the suitable unit
testing framework the test cases are
already defined in my github account so
to analyze that test case in the goal
section I need to write tests all right
and it will invoke the test
phase of the maven build lifecycle all
right so just click on apply and save
finally click on build now to see the
control output click here now in the
source code management tab I'll select
get right over here again I need to type
my reports to URL that is HTTPS so
github.com slash username slash
repository name dot kit and now in the
build tab I'll select invoke top-level
maven buckets and over here as I have
told you earlier as well that the maven
build lifecycle has multiple phases
alright and one of that phase is a unit
test so in order to invoke that unit
test what I need to do is in the go
stuff I need to write tests and it will
invoke the test build phase of the maven
build life cycle all right so the moment
I write tests here and I'll build it it
will actually analyze the test cases
that are present in the github account
so let us write tests and apply and save
finally click on build now and in order
to see the control output click here so
does pull the code from the github
account and now now dis performing unit
test
so we have successfully performed
testing on that code now I'll go back to
my Jenkins dashboard or it as you can
see that all the three build jobs that
I've executed are successful which is
indicated with the help of view colored
ball all right now let us go back to our
slides so we have successfully performed
the unit tests on the test cases that
were there on the github account now we
will move forward and see what happens
after that now finally you can deploy
that build application on to the
production environment for release but
when you have one single Jenkins over
there are multiple disadvantages so let
us discuss that one by one so we'll move
forward and we'll see one of the
disadvantages of using one single
Jenkins so now what I'll do I'll go back
to my Jenkins dashboard and I'll show
you how to create a build pipeline
alright so for that I'll move to my
Ubuntu box once again now in here you
can see that there is an option of plus
okay just click over there now over here
click on build pipeline view whatever
Nene what you can give I just give it as
ed you rekha underscore pipeline and
click on OK
now over here what you can do you can
give some certain description about your
build pipeline all right and there are
multiple options that you can just have
a look and over here there is an option
called select initial job so I want
compiled to be my first job and there
are display options over here number of
display builds that you want I'll just
keep it as five now the row headers that
you want column headers so you can just
have a look at all these options and you
can play around with them just for the
introductory example let us keep it this
way
now finally click on apply and okay now
currently you can see that there is only
one job that is combined so what I'll do
I'll add more jobs to this pipeline for
that I go back to my Jenkins dashboard
and over here a large code review as
well so for that I'll go to configure
and in this build trigger stop what I'll
do I click on build after other projects
are built so whatever project that you
want to execute before code review just
type that so I want compile yeah click
on compile and over here you can see
that there are multiple options like
trigger only if build a stable
trigger even if the build is unstable
trigger even if the build page so I just
click on a trigger even if the build
fails
alright finally click on apply and save
similarly if I want to add my test job
as well to the pipeline I can click on
configure
and again the build triggers tab I'll
click on the build after other projects
are build so we type the project that
you want to execute before this
particular project in our case it is
code review so let us click over there
trigger even if the build fails apply
and save now let us go back to the
dashboard and see how our pipeline looks
like so this is our pipeline okay so
when we click on run let us see what
happens first it will compile the code
from the github account that is it will
pull the code and it will compile it so
now this compile is done all right now
it will review the code so the code
review has started in order to see the
log you can click on console and we'll
give you the console output
now once code review is done it will
start testing it will perform unit tests
all right so code has been successfully
reviewed with the as you can see the
color has become green now the testing
has started it will perform unit tests
on the test cases that are there in the
github account so we have successfully
executed the three build jobs that is
combined the code then review it and
then perform testing all right and this
is the build pipeline guys so let us go
back to the Jenkins dashboard and we'll
go back to our slides now so now we have
successfully performed unit tests on the
test cases that the president of github
account alright now let us move forward
and see what else you can do with
Jenkins now the application that we have
tested that can also be deployed on to
the production server for releases with
all right so now let us move forward and
see what are the disadvantages of this
one single Jenkins over so there are two
major disadvantages of using one single
zankan so first is you might require
different environments for your builds
and test jobs alright so at that time
one single Jenkins over cannot serve our
purpose and the second major
disadvantage is suppose you have a via
projects to build on regular basis so at
that time one single Jenkins over cannot
simply handle the load
let us understand this with an example
suppose if you need to run web test
using Internet Explorer so at that time
you need a Windows machine but your
other build job might require online
export so you can't use one single
Jenkins over all right so let us move
forward and see what is actually the
solution to this problem the solution to
this problem is Jenkins distributed
architecture so the Jenkins distributed
architecture consists of a Jenkins
master and multiple Jenkins sleep so
this Jenkins master is actually used for
scheduling build jobs
it also dispatches builds to the slaves
for actual execution all right
it also monitors the slave that is
possibly taking them online and offline
as required and it also recalls and
presents the build results and you can
directly execute a build job or master
instances well now that we talk about
Jenkins slaves these slaves are nothing
but the Java executable that are present
on remote machines all right so these
slaves basically here is the request of
the Jenkins master or you can say the
perform the jobs as told by the Jenkins
master they operate a variety of
operating system so you can configure
Jenkins in order to execute a particular
type of builds up on a particular
Jenkins space or on a particular type of
Jenkins wave or you can actually let
Jenkins pick the next available Jenkins
space all right now I go back again to
my open to watch and I'll show you
practically how to add Jenkins slave now
over here as you can see that there is
an option called manage Jenkins just
click over there and when you scroll
down you'll see an option called manage
nodes on the left hand side there is an
option called new node just click over
there click on permanent agent give a
name to your slave I'll just give it as
slaves underscore one click on ok over
here you need to write the remote root
directories so I'll keep it as slash
home slash EDD Eureka and labels are not
mandatory still if you want you can use
that on launch method I want it to be
launched slave agents via SSH
right over here you need to give the IP
address of care force so let me show you
the IP address of my host or this my
tenkan slave which I'll be using like
Jenkins slave
so this is the machine that I will be
using as Jenkins slave in order to check
the IP address I'll type if config and
this is the IP address of that machine
just copy it now I'll go back to my
Jenkins master and the host tab I'll
just paste that IP address and over here
you can add the credentials to do that
just click on add and over here you can
give the username I'll give it as root
password that's all just click on add
and over here select it now finally save
it now it is currently adding the sleep
in order to see the logs you can click
on that slave again now it has
successfully added that particular slave
now what I will do I will show you the
logs for that and click on slave and on
the left-hand side you will notice an
option called log just click over there
and will give you the output so as you
can see agent has successfully connected
and it is online right now
now what I will do I will go to my
Jenkins slave and I'll show you in slash
home slash Eddie record that it is added
let me first clear my terminal now what
I will do I'll show you the contents of
slash home slash Eddie Rekha as you can
see that we have successfully added
slave door jar that means we have
successfully added Jenkins slave to our
Jenkins master thank you for attending
today's session if you have any
questions or any doubts please write it
down in your chat bot any questions guys
okay so we have a question from Bennett
he's asking what is the difference
between puppet and Jenkins but it the
basic difference between puppet and
Jenkins is Jenkins is a continuous
integration tool but when we talk about
puppet it is a configuration management
tool let us understand this with an
example suppose you have a code in your
github repository so Jenkins server will
pull that code at
build and that build application will be
deployed or to the test server for
testing so that test server will require
certain configuration or you get this or
environment in order to execute the test
so that can be a lab stack that that is
Linux Apache my sequel at PHP or it can
be map stack that is back a path shape
my sequel PHP anything it can be even a
path a tomcat anything alright so in
order to provide that environment we use
configuration management tools like
puppet ship etc same goes for your
production environment is win so if you
want to configure your production
servers what do you need you need tools
like puppet ship a stable etcetera to
configure those servers alright so I
hope you're clear or attack for the
conservation barrage so any questions
any other questions you have and we
shall say is no questions I you see says
everything's clear
so does Jessica alright thank you guys
