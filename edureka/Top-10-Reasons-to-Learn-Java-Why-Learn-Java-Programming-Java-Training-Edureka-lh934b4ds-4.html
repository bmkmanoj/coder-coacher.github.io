I'm going to tell you the top ten
reasons to learn Java well there's
certain things in life which you hate or
you may laugh to the goal but you
certainly cannot ignore them now one
such thing is Java so today I'm going to
tell you why more than half of the
programming globe loves Java now let us
start from the tenth point as to why you
should learn this language so firstly on
this list we have Java which is
extremely easy and open-source now we
all know that it is important that a
programming language should be easy to
learn so that it is more convenient for
everyone to just go ahead and use it so
what are the reasons that makes Java
easy so number one it is concurrent now
the fact it is concurrent makes it easy
to process your data parallely and
that's one of the major reasons then the
other thing is it is platform
independent so it might have heard
something called as bora which means
right ones and done anywhere and java
totally supports this feature so what
does this exactly mean so in Java
once you've written your application you
can run it across any device or any
machine that supports a Java environment
next it is open source so why is the
tool being open source so important now
the fact it is open source is because it
is available for anyone to use
also your JDK or JRE is completely free
now everyone out they wants to set up
their website for free and since Java is
free one can easily create Java
applications at no cost so Java is one
of the most simple as well as the
fundamental programming language that
anyone can pick up and trust me guys
Java is so simple at the same time the
possibilities of what you can develop
using Java is infinitum
now coming up next we have Java 9 new
features so the release of Java 9 and
Java 9 features is a milestone in the
Java ecosystem so I have picked up a few
new Java 9 features which I feel are
worth knowing about so now let's see
what are these features so the first one
is the project jigsaw it basically helps
you to achieve modularity so the main
aim of this project is to introduce the
concept of modularity that is the
support for creating modules in Java 9
and then apply the same to the JDK that
is modularized the JDK next we have J
shell scripting so for those of you who
are familiar with languages such as Ruby
Scala groovy and even Python you must
have heard repple from before now it
basically means read eval print loop now
with Java 9 dreadful tool has been
introduced it makes it quite easy to try
out different features so what it
basically does it helps you to write
simple code and then test them up so now
if you've worked with Scala you need to
write down println and then HelloWorld
but in Java you need to define a class
then define a specifier then go into the
function use the system dot out dot
println command and then only it will
get executed but with this station
scripting you can actually write your
code in your single go and thereby
making it quite easy so let me just show
you this with an example so I will just
open my command prompt now in order to
get into it you just need to type in J
shell
and you're inside it so as you can see
here it is prompted with a kind version
of Java that is nine point zero point
four well now we can do anything in it
let's say I want to print one plus two
so it's that simple nice now even if you
want to print a string you don't have to
type the system dot out dot println
command instead of that you can simply
type in hello world
and here it is so that's how jason has
made our life easy in order to implement
anything so now at number eight we have
Java Enterprise Edition and Stitch API
now the reason the API is quite popular
is because it becomes very easy for a
programmer to build an application as
well as use different technologies
without actually knowing the internal
implementation now coming to Java API it
has no issues with the compatibility and
handles a wide set of procedures and
functions also if we impress that there
are over 4,500 API available for
developers so the best place where I can
show you the API is our the Oracle
documentation so I'll just go to google
and type in Java API
so over here the first thing that comes
up is the official documentation of
Oracle so once you click this you will
get the complete list of API that are
associated as part of Java 7 edition
now to your left top you will see the
various packages below are the various
classes as well as the complete
description and details of all the
packages with respect to Java 7 Edition
now similarly you can change the URL to
8 and then you'll get the complete
documentation of Java 8 as well so here
again you can see the packages the
different classes and then you have
something called as compact 1 compact 2
and compact 3 which is nothing but the
different profiles and similarly you can
see the changes for Java version 9 as
well so I just have to change my url to
9 and here the changes in the Java 9
version as well
now Java also provides API for
input/output then we have networking
utilities XML parsing database
connection and almost everything guys
net number 7 we have tons of resources
and a wonderful community support so
Java as a programming language is only
present which means it is present
everywhere starting from your phone to
your setup box to satellites as well so
there is a huge job opportunity once you
have completely grasped Java then you
have it's wonderful support community so
learning is not at all a problem with
Java you have numerous resources
available online that can act as a
perfect companion along with the support
community so you have multiple forums
then you have Stack Overflow where all
your doubts or error set it to Java are
answered
now moving ahead at number 6 we have
Java applications well as I said Java is
everywhere and has ocean of
opportunities so now let me take you
through some of the technologies which
makes use of Java so here I have said
tip 6 most influence domains which uses
Java so don't just misunderstand guy is
that these are the only six domains
which uses Java Java is pretty much used
everywhere so first of all it is used to
develop web application with the most
popular frameworks such as spring or
hibernate Java is in highest demand now
even if you want to run any micro
service if you use Java as a programming
language or any of its frameworks as a
spring or spring boo then it is used in
Android app development so we all are
familiar with Android so it's an
operating system which is developed by
Google but how many of you actually know
the Android applications as well as the
Android operating system in itself make
extensive use of Java then you have
testing where you can test your web
application using various automation
testing tools so to name some we have
selenium qtp which is used to automate
web applications and perform testing
using Java so Java is definitely a go-to
language for mobile devices then we have
the most popular and trending technology
that is the big data technology so over
here you all must have heard about
Hadoop which is the most preferred
framework so Hadoop framework was
extensively developed using Java and
still makes use of its rich API also the
MapReduce codes are written in Java
next at number 5 we have Java
development tools now you have many
powerful development tools in which you
can do Java programming so the most
popular ones are the ones that are
majorly used on NetBeans then we have
IntelliJ an eclipse
so these not only helps you in the code
writing process but also offers a high
level debugging to the programmers also
Java is majorly used in Android
application development and hence
Android studio is a popular IDE which
again accepts Java programming next up
number 4 we have Java which is
everywhere so Java is all over the place
it's on desktop it's on mobile it's on
card and in fact everywhere so here I
have listed down few departments where
Java has been explicitly used so let's
start with banking so here you can deal
with the transactional management then
you have retail so whenever you go in a
store or a restaurant the billing
application that you see are completely
written in Java then you have
information technology or popularly
called as IP so here Java is designed to
solve implementation dependencies and
this is the domain guys that hires most
of the Java developers then it is
majorly used in stock market where you
can simply write algorithms as to which
company should invest in also the
applications in itself which is used in
stock market are built using Java then
you have many others such as financial
services which is used in server-side
application then there is scientific and
research community which again deals
with huge amount of data so it's not
limited to just one domain also if you
do analysis you will see that around 20%
of the opening calls for Java skills
either alone or in addition to any other
programming language also it is being
used by many big giants such as Google
Philips Accenture uber and many more so
you can be completely assured that Java
is not going out of the market any time
soon
next up number three we have oops
language or Java being an
object-oriented programming language so
most popular programming languages like
Java C++ C sharp Ruby they follow an
object-oriented programming paradigm now
object-oriented programming is a
programming style which is associated
with the concepts such as classes object
inheritance abstraction encapsulation
and polymorphism so an object based
application in Java is based on
declaring classes creating objects from
them and then interacting between these
objects and hence Java being an
object-oriented programming the concepts
of Java are highly readable and are much
easier then coming to the second point
we have Java which is portable and
versatile so by portable I mean Java can
be used across various platforms and
being an open source programming
language it is platform independent
across operating systems so as I've
already told you guys is famous tag line
that says write once and run anywhere so
it tells you to achieve this
functionality as well so what it means
you can run your Java bytecode on any
hardware that has a compliant JVM so you
can simply write your code or create
java application in a Windows
environment and then run on any other
environment let's say Linux operating
system so everything is possible in Java
next it is versatile now Java is said as
one of the most versatile languages now
why I'm saying this well we have many
reasons for it now first of all it has
dynamic coding so as I've already
discussed all the codes are organized
and they are stored in an
object-oriented format known as classes
then it is highly secured so Java
platform offers a secure environment
where even the untrusted codes can be
run and without causing any harm to your
hosts environment then it can easily
work with different resources across a
network so this is also what makes Java
Network insane tricks and a language
that is not going out of date anytime
soon
next coming to last but not the least is
the javis popularity and high salary so
as you can see I have a tee of
Programming index for all the present
trending programming languages so table
is a company that mainly deals with the
code written by a lot of organizations
so what they do they basically cleanse
and to improve the efficiency of code so
even if I have to give you a number the
deal with about 500 billion lines of
code every day so what they have done
they have conducted a survey based on
the usage of the programming languages
in the industry so the keyword searches
are taken from Google they were taken
from Yahoo YouTube and then this index
was generated so this index is something
which is released every year and you can
see the popularity of all the
programming languages so here you can
see how Java has dominated this field
from the early 2000 to the present 2018
so this in itself should give you an
idea of how popular Java is and how
widely it has been used in the industry
now apart from this Java developers are
the ones who get the highest salary so
in average Java developer earns around
110 K dollars in 19 states so isn't this
amazing guys so you should definitely
learn Java to kickstart your IT career
so anyone with the passion to become a
highly skilled Java professional can
easily become one through a professional
Java certification training so get
trained in Java and become the coolest
professional in the IT field now if you
are looking for online structure
training in Java you can let us know in
the comment section and we will reply
you back with a detailed course content
now if you're investing in learning
something be assured guys that this is
something which is not going out of the
date anytime soon so it's totally worth
the effort guys so don't just learn it
