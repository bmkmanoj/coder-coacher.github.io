analytics how can produce analytics
benefit you to find the right partner
what are the radius dating websites all
about and what is the stats are signs
that goes behind the scenes to help you
find a right partner this can be used
not just with respect to your reading
websites but also from matrimonial
websites perspective even before we get
started there is a question which has
come parmeshwari was asking on what is
predictive analytics can it be applied
to medical field just bear with me
parameshwari on that I'm going to
explain or give you a few examples in
the subsequent slides first we are going
to discuss about what is predictive
analytics why do we need predictive
analytics what are the various domains
where predictive analytics can be used
to give you some kind of a business
inference some kind of a solution to
your business problems and then we are
going to look into this very example on
how predictive analytic can be used to
find you to help you find the right
partner and then there's a case study on
application of predictive analysis and
how companies use predictive analysis
for love match so what is predictive
analytics i would say that there is one
equation which is the most important
equation when it comes to any business
decisions right and that is y is equal
to function of input your outcome any
outcome that you want to achieve
probably you want to increase your
profit your seals how should you price
your products right whatever be your
outcome that you want to achieve would
be dependent on few inputs what diseases
you might get in the future
depends on various input variables your
age your gender your genomes the kind of
lifestyle you're living in your sleeping
habits your calories consumed so on and
so forth right so if you want to know
the price of the used car it depends on
the miles driven it depends on the make
of the car variant of the car with its
petrol diesel cng lpg things like that
and multiple are the factors this we'd
be this would be the most important
equation when it comes to predictive
analytics y is equal to f of X right so
let us move on and try to understand few
more things about predictive analytics
so predictive analytics is all about
using some kind of statistics some kind
of algorithms some kind of data mining
techniques which is nothing but machine
learning right and all you do is you
look into your historical data
historical patterns historical consumer
behavior and come up with a prediction
consumer behavior are all the people
within the age group of 20 to 22 based
out of us California have a separate
tendency to purchase iphone 6 or iPhone
7 which is about to be released right so
do they have any specific pattern or
behavior associated right you can use
your predictive analytics to look into
that I'm going to look into your
questions towards the end so please bear
with me yeah another thing is machine
learning I'm sure you all might have
heard about google car which drives
without a driver Google car by looking
into Google car most of the other
car manufacturers have come up with
driverless cars toyota GM and all that
are actually investing a lot on the
research to come up with driverless car
how does a car identify on whether there
is a pothole 10 meters ahead on the road
how does it understand that this
breaking should be off so much intensity
pressure and you should not or your
vehicle should not by looking at the
pothole do a sudden break for example if
you were to take a left or right your
vehicle should decide whether it should
take a left or right if there's a red
signal chance to stop and all those
things should happen right so all these
things happen using this simple concept
called as machine learning it's
something like while you were a kid and
your journey to become an adult right
everything was learning that is called
as machine learning right you teach you
teen people and then they become
well-educated run of individuals
patterns this is used in your crime
industry to some extent right patent
machi is there a specific pattern of a
person see if you take a photograph or
if CCTV is capturing the robbery in a
bank can that CCTV footage video broken
down can that be broken down into frames
of images and can you go to the exact
frame where you have the rubber and try
to identify his face and try to relate
that face with the database of all the
citizens of the nation can you match
quickly and say hey these are the ten
matches right these are the tents
seasons whose features closely match
with this particular image and that way
you'll be able to you know counter crime
or get all of the criminal very easy
patterns scoring if you search say
online movies for example which website
comes on the top which website comes on
the second page third page or second
slot third floor these things are based
on some kind of scoring algorithm right
so you have the search engine
optimization which happens and all that
uses these kind of algorithms and
machine learning techniques in the
backing visualization is the most
important thing right if you have data
with millions of Records how can I
represent millions of records in a
beautiful visualization which gives me a
lot of inferences rather than looking to
those 1 million records I want all those
1 million records to be represented
visually so that I might make sense out
of that yeah Ramon you're right on that
recommendation and then we have the
predictive behavior a person purchasing
milk bread and diapers right probably is
going to purchase baby food also may be
right so based on your previous buying
behavior of all your customers you will
be able to predict on what would a
similar kind of customer purchase right
every man or woman of the age 35 every
week purchases milk bread and diapers so
she's most likely to purchase the other
thing also so any woman of that age
probably would try to purchase the same
kind of products in the future that's
predictive behavior this is part of your
recommendation engine
but recommendation is engine is all
about your online sales as opposed to
your store sales right physical store
sales is associated with technical as
association rules whereas online sales
is associated with your recommendation
engine decision making it will help you
make a lot of decisions not based on
your gut feel but based on crunching the
data so the decision that you take will
most often most likely be right right
for example if you want to approve a
loan see a customer has applied for a
loan you want to approve that what is a
probability that he'll not he's going to
default on the loom easy going to
default or not if he's going to default
and probably you not giving the loan
it's in Fred so you make judgment or
desu yo you take a decision based on the
data not based on your gut feel and then
it will help you communicate
communication in your telecom industries
and also it's used to a great extent
right to tease out the terrorist
conversations from the regular
conversations of billions of customers
around the glue think about that that we
thought about analyzing your audio files
gives you goose bumps is it not doesn't
it all right so let us look into the
predictive analytics lifecycle to some
extent first and foremost thing is you
try to formulate what is the business
problem and most of your time should be
spent here you know I didn't find a
problem if you end up identifying a
wrong problem no matter how good your
data collection is how good your
prediction model is have sophisticated
it is it's not going to achieve your
business object is we are building the
models we have coming up with the
statistics we are coming up with the
predictive analytics to ensure that our
business sustained
in the future right so for that reason
the business from problem formulation is
the most important part and then we are
going to prepare the data that means we
are going to identify what data we have
to collect we need to do some amount of
cleansing of the data because we know
for a fact that data comes from various
sources we get data from social media we
get data from YouTube we get data from
Pinterest in the form of images we get
the data from Wi-Fi logs from the
satellite locks from your GPS and all
that right how to bring the data to a
structure format that is your data
preparation all about then you explore
your data you do the elementary analysis
for example you look into your mean
median mode measures of central tendency
measures of dispersion so on and zoo and
then you try to transform the data if
you feel that the data is having a weird
patterns when I say transform you either
take the log of the values or
exponential things like that then you
build your prediction model remember the
equation y is equal to f of X your
outcome is equal to function of inputs
once you build the model is your model
even worth being used in real time what
is accuracy of the model that you have
built its accuracy robust or is your
accuracy very weak right so you need to
validate your model once you validate
your model you have to deploy your model
in the business scenario make it live
for example and then you're going to
frequently monitor the reasons evaluate
the results and remember this is an
ongoing process the moment you get the
result you're going to feed the results
data once again into the model and
enhance your model so once you start off
with your model right as in how you
proceed progress
your model is going to learn a new thing
right each time you have an output it's
going to learn new thing right and your
model thereby becomes very robust so
here are the various uses of your
advanced predictive analysis as I've
told you all right it makes sense for me
to just take these two questions because
these two questions seemed apt at this
point of time Association rule promotes
ace is a method for discovering
interesting relations between variables
in large databases absolutely right
promote super mode when a customer walks
into a retail store he purchases a
number of products in that way in any
retail store they could be thousands and
you know ten thousands of customers
walking in on a monthly basis so you
have a huge or larger database based on
that large database you analyze and see
what are the various products which
customers are purchasing in a single
transaction for example I'm going to
probably purchase a toothbrush in the
tooth be a toothpaste so it makes sense
for me to come up with a strategy
waiting I'm going to stack these two and
sell those two as a combo offer or I'm
going to place toothpaste and toothbrush
beside each other in Iraq that's going
to increase my seeds but Association
rules is used for generic purpose right
you look into all the customer buying
behavior and then you come up with a
generic strategy of placing products
together stacking them together having
your kids toys in the lower rack and
things like that however your
recommendation engine is more specific
so if I go and search for iphone 6 on
Amazon
it's going to recommend me Samsung
probably edge as 6 however if you go in
search probably it's going to show HTC
or it's going to suggest some other
mobile or some other device or probably
completely different thing probably if
you search for iphone 6 it might throw
you the cover for iphone 6 it so it's
very specific however association rules
is generic ok I'll take this question
from harshal harshal has this question
how could my problem statement be wrong
in what scene are you example please so
let me couple this with question which
permaisuri has Iran medical things right
um say you're performing clinical trial
see you're performing a clinical trial
you actually wanted to check which drug
and which research institute in which
location will help you successfully
complete a clinical trial right given a
drug given a location given a specific
Institute research institute which
institute should you opt for you to
successfully complete the clinical trial
however if you have chosen a different
disease altogether probably you want to
do this clinical trial on a person was
hasta ma but you have selected patients
who are diabetic right so your entire
problem statement is screwed up there
your problem statement should have
should be smart right it should be
specific it cannot be generic for
example if you are making a generic
statement such as I want to perform a
clinical trial and I have this drug I
want to perform in this location in this
institute you're being generic right
so if I were to perform a clinical trial
I can't perform one ask my patients I
can perform on diabetic I can perform on
people who have undergone some kind of a
treatment so on and so forth right but
if your problem statement has to be
specific you would clearly mention that
I want to perform this clinical trial on
patients who have asthma absolutely
promote asking the right questions is
very important so you need to understand
the problem right and it that is the
most critical objective yeah you're
right on that ok back to our discussion
advanced predictive analysis campaign
management right for my business to
increase should i do campaign email
campaign or should i do social media
campaign or shrey do an advertisement on
my television or should I advertise on
newspapers which campaign is the most
beneficial for me right for that you can
use your predictive analytics customer
acquisition so how do i acquire more
customers there is a customer who was
with us who has left us now write a
customer was using AT&amp;amp;T now he's using
eight till for example how do I get back
or win back that customer or can I even
identify on when will a customer leave a
particular service provider and go with
another service provider for example say
I'm with Ethel is there a probability
that I'm going to go with wooda phone
maybe may not be so that is your I mean
you can use a predictive analytics to
know that churn budgeting and
forecasting right can you sitting here
today forecast your sales for the next
quarter your profits for the next
quarter the number of products you are
going to sell for the next quarter that
is forecasting predicting what will
happen in the future fraud detection if
I go swipe my cred
it car right can someone quickly tell me
whether that's a fraudulent transaction
or not based on fraud detection that's
another thing promotions right what kind
of promotions are important similar to
your campaign management how many
coupons should I sell a sin how much
discount your offer should I send them
coupons what ten percent discount or 500
rupees off or what exactly is going to
help me there prising should the price
of iphone 7 b 0 60 thousand rupees or
should it be thousand dollars or should
it be twelve hundred dollars what should
the price of that be given your product
specifications what is the price which
the customers are willing to pay that is
your pricing analytics PC and then your
demand planning right needless to say in
a call center how many calls am I
getting right based on that are are my
calls trend increasing or decreasing if
it's increasing so do i need to hire
more resources and things like that yeah
shell so i'm just reading out the
question which version says okay
herschel is happy with the expression
hook so he says that the problem
statement should be specific absolutely
sha tau C fascist question sha way to
bring optimization in predictive
analytics I have to do a project to do
in the semester how can I bridge the two
together so you know optimization sits
on top of your predictive analytics you
come up with a solution right using your
predictive analytics you come up with a
solution however how to optimize that so
you should given your constraints right
that is optimization so it sits on top
of that it's a different thing
minimization or maximization problems
using your linear programming that is
what you use in optimization we can take
it offline per image where it says isn't
it similar to multivariate analysis
in multivariate analysis you have
multiple inputs and multiple outputs
right permaisuri but in optimization
given the constraints for example my
budget is only 1 million dollars using 1
million dollars tell me what is the best
mode or you know best way of
manufacturing 10,000 shoes or a million
shoes i have 1 million dollars yeah what
is the best way to manufacture 10,000
choose now you look into the various
things right how many manufacturing
plants do I need to have in which
countries do I need to have where am I
going to procure my raw material from
how is the inspection going to happen
how many people will work so on and so
forth so given those constraints how
would you optimize your solution that is
go absolutely shots for this is called
as charged with has this question can we
predict the employee who are going to
leave the organization or attrition
planning in organization absolutely
sauce for that is called as workforce
analytics even before an employee
resigns you can predict that this
employee might most probably resign and
you take an action even before he or she
resigns of course based on weather is
important for your organization or not
why predictive analytics is an ex
question we are all models right we are
not God or superhumans to be able to
foresee effusion hence we need a
mechanism to predict and see what will
happen to my future being reactive days
are gone now you have to be proactive
proactive with a certain probability
that your prediction about the future is
accurate you need that confidence right
your management needs that confidence
what if I want to open a new store
should I even open that or not market
leader target you know they have
suffered a lot of losses because they
have launched or their venture into
Canada with your retail store if I would
have predicted up front that hey target
do not launch that it's going to take
you into losses probably I would not
have launched right what if statistics
are predictive analytics or model or
forecasting would have helped mean that
right so it helps you save cross me
millions of dollars or if not more okay
here we go folks is a prestigious
magazine right this is the top objective
for between two-thirds and
three-quarters of executives it's
develop the ability to model and
predictive behaviors to such an extent
that individual decisions can be made in
real time as we are working now I want
real time just try out this do a google
search on purchasing any laptop or any
mobile or any of your garments or
anything for that keys just wait for a
couple of minutes and open your facebook
or any of the other website you'll see
similar product being placed as an ad
there that is real time and you have
various examples we are best buy a live
green RSC right all these companies have
used predictive modeling in one way or
the other to actually become more
profitable so best buy determined seven
percent of it customers who were
responsible for thirty-three percent of
its seeds so what so you have to do
segmentation you have to do clustering
so clustering is a different statistical
technique I would not say statistical
it's a different data mining technique
busy so in that way most of the
companies have been profited
it can be used in trading banking
e-commerce retail transport IT
healthcare so on and so forth right
health care right so since you have
raised this question in medical
industries or medical sector how can it
be used nowadays a lot of people are
wearing health monitoring devices I wear
a watch right which is going to try my
heart rate number of hours i sleep
number of hours i am sound asleep number
of hours i'm half awake or number of
disturbances while asleep it's going to
track the number of calories i consume
number of calories I burn number of
steps that I take number of floors is I
climb based on these things you can
build a prediction model which says that
hey person who lives this kind of a
lifestyle will get these scale of
diseases even before I get a disease I
can get a notification saying that hey
you are prone to get a heart stroke if
you continue living this kind of a
lifestyle those kind of things can be
used right ok sauce without this
question that means randomly occurred
data need to tabbed only to predictive
modeling yeah I didn't quite get that
question but if I'm understanding your
question correctly yes that's what all
right this is an interesting segment
where predictive analytics is being used
now in dating and these are all the
weight is dating website which we have
right so I went use these but I am
pretty much aware of most of these
things right for example we have
tinder right here we are you see tinder
tinder is an application dating
application and they have lingerie up in
2012 and in 2014 they have the data that
1,000,000,000 swipes per day were
happening on your appt 1 billion apps
swipes that means if you swipe if you do
a right swipe was ass left swipe you
will see the picture or you move on to
the next person things like that and
they have launched or and they're using
a concept called as location-based
analytics based on people were staying
in a particular location it's going to
do that and you have that app for iOS
and Android and they implement a
technique called as freemium did anyone
hear about freemium here free mean they
give you some amount for free few
features for free and if you want
enhanced features they come for a cost
that is called as freemium they'll
ensure that they have they give you the
basic features in such a way that you'll
crave for the paid features you'll crave
you'll actually want to use the other
features right to again here you can you
do your analytics and say hey these
features should be given for free these
features for a cost that is when your
profits increase that is when the free
customers will become paid customers
that's based on again design of
experiments and things like that you can
do that pritam has this question how is
it used in digital marketing tools like
adobe incite goal
how is it used in digital marketing I
can probably see that right for example
if for personalization right okay yeah
so pre them what happens you know
personalized advertisement works in this
way it works on based on what you are
doing right for example you are a person
who frequently searches for so it is
about image processing you know learning
about something around images and
photographs or if you have a passion to
its photography and things like that
then probably I'm going to mark it or
I'm going to advertise you adobe
products just an example because you are
searching a lot of things about
photography probably after taking the
photos you want to do the cleansing part
you know looking into flipping the
images taking out the Czech border kind
of things from your image and things
like that right so that's called as
personalization but you know it depends
on what you're doing based on your data
and google chrome is free for your
install facebook calling is free for
your install however the moment it
installs on your machine it's going to
save few files which is going to
frequently keep sending the information
to google etc not the sensitive
information but most of the other
information that information is captured
and then use for the marketing purpose
that is where google gets a chunk or
major chunk of its revenue rate based on
google ads sauce with as this question
text mining yeah it's captured using
cookies soo this mining from social
networking sites are data that occurred
randomly is what cha responses yeah they
collect the data from or text mining is
performed on initiation social
networking sites
not just that based on your browser that
you're using that also captures lot of
data using the cookies absolutely and
garnish were has this question what is
fraud analytics further analytics means
if I give you a loan are you going to
default or not if I give you a credit
card are you going to default on the
payment or not things like that what
kind of algorithms do they use for yep
so I'm about to discuss that suit just
see let me quickly explain about these
websites on what is happening on these
websites and post which your
understanding about the algorithms might
become a little clearer so we have a
tinder which is an application right
which was launched in 2012 and by 2014
there were 1,000,000,000 swipe buddy and
they have launched this application in
30 different languages that's tremendous
then you have Badu they've launched is
in 2006 in London and now it's used in
180 countries so look at the amount of
data which these dating website
companies are generating and think about
what would happen if you can help a
person find the right match the first
time that is when you know and you know
there are a lot of people who have gone
ahead with the long term relationship
got married right those stats are coming
up let me show you those stands it might
be more interesting for you and we have
something called as match com this also
is us-based company which is launched in
25 plus countries then you have blender
blender is a Jewish do social GPS it
works on GPS be second and this blender
uses another website called chemistry
com or sorry match match.com uses
another website called chemist
calm which just connects the service to
help identify the you know choices of
the people on whom do they prefer and
things like that and then you have OKC
okcupid i believe the complete name of
that and you have hinge harmony and all
that right int is also an application
nominee alrighty harmonies Los Angeles
based company which was set up in two
thousand it's there in 150 plus
countries however the key here is also
data security say I join dating website
my information I would most often than
not want it to be kept as a secret I
don't want someone to hack the password
look at my details and do all sorts of
things so privacy was once compromised
when with respect to e harmony right
that aiding website and immediately they
have sent email to all the customers
asking him to change the passwords now
if this information becomes public there
might be celebrities there might be
politicians right and if that comes up
in the media it becomes a huge to n cry
so for those reasons data privacy is
also the most happening topic as of now
because in this generation because a lot
of data it's getting generated left
right and center why do we use
predictive analytics endearing domain
these are a few of the reasons look at
how popular dating websites are one in
ten Americans have used a mobile dating
app or website one in ten in developed
countries it's very vastly used right
five percent of all committed
relationships in US began why something
as simple as liking swiping or matching
right and tinder uses that swipe so you
say in facebook I like or share on
Twitter you say tweet on similar lines
with respect to tinder uses swype
five percent of Americans who are
currently married or in long-term
partnership met their partner somewhere
online and among those who have been
together for 10 years or less levan
person met online look at that the
amount of data that your mobile online
dating applications are generating
number of visitors on the website amount
of data that they are generating and
there is a lot of potential right for
coming up with predictive modeling and
all that in these kind of situations
ninety-seven percent of Americans with
an annual household income of 75
thousand dollars or more know someone
who uses online dating and forty percent
know someone who made a spouse or
partner this way fifty-nine percent of
all internet users agree with the
statement that online dating is a good
way to meet people so people are
encouraging people are using the
application they are happy with the
service they are happy with the security
and privacy aspects they're happy that
they are able to find a perfect match
this is not India waiting you know your
parents are going to search a bride or
room for you right we are speaking about
a different country a different culture
developed knowing country which is
developed in terms of economy and all
that fifty-three percent of internet
users agree with the statement that
online dating allows people to find a
better match for themselves because they
can get to know a lot more people and
this is the last eleven percent of
Internet users say they have personally
used an online dating site there are a
few more interesting analytical insights
which are coming your way now you can
draw all these kind of interesting
insights from the data which we have
generated data which we have collected
right women get sixty percent more
attention a photo is taken in do so
probably this is an interesting quote
which you can mention on your websites
on your applications right in google tea
and men get nineteen percent more
attention if the photo is taken outside
full body photos boost both sexes
success by two not three percent posing
with animals or the best friend so these
are all the insights right which one can
draw just based on the amount of data
that get that's getting generated look
at the strength of the data and this is
a survey online dating industry made two
billion dollars that's a huge amount and
your match com alone has 2.4 million
paid subscribers not the free
subscribers and dinner is soon going to
charge premium to get a bigger piece of
the online market right is there any
question at this point of time I wish to
take once again so as far as this
question is it possible to do predictive
analytics from pictures audio audio
visual data if so how please explain in
shuts oh yeah I'll explain on in this
context right yeah people keep posting
the images yet so can you establish some
kind of pattern using the image can I
say that if the human has this can these
kind of features he is going to be very
selfish or if a person's image has these
kind of features does it say that the
person is trustworthy or not so you can
do those kind of analysis using audio
you know if you and I are having a
conversation or is it a terrorist
conversation or does a conversation
signal some kind of suicidal tendencies
or something like that that also can be
lies using your deep learning use Python
you use opencv and all that for image
processing for audio analysis and all
that assessment I'm not doing a deep
dive on that by the way that's my core
subject we on Alex and came across
energy pritam eyes this question does
predictive analytics use Hadoop no
sequel database or it is decided by the
tools it see how do pen no sequel
databases or for your big data if you
have data which is on structure which is
coming from different formats and things
like that if you want structured data
your statistical tools which are
currently the most happening such as our
right those can handle you can cleanse
the data you can bring down structured
data to the structured format our Python
and all that however if your big data
then you need to use some kind of Hadoop
which is framework it's a system file
system distributed file system or you
can use no sequel databases to get your
job yeah preetham hope that answers your
question okay so hinge right till it
matches based on your profession so your
profession would become your one input
variable your education would become
another input variable any other
interest that you are playing cricket
watching football playing American
football things like that those become
your x3 basically based on all these
input variables you can predict on the
nature of the person right you'll have
broad classification about the nature of
the person similar to your vehicle if
you're driving a car if you are driving
it very fast if you are turning radius
is too much if you're breaking a sudden
you'll be classified as a risky driver
and if you're very smooth if you're
switching the lanes at proper times if
you're driving at a constant speed in a
particular lane if if you're driving
radius is appropriate you'll be probably
categorized as a safe
I were right based on whether your risk
you are a safe driver your this
information goes to your insurance
company and then your insurance
companies either going to increase your
premium already user premium right so in
that way you can use this these values
these variables to predict on what is a
category of person then you have OKC
provides a slew of questions to
mathematically match you up with a comp
a compatible date right and whenever you
broadcast that message goes to the
people who are in your neighborhood all
right when are you available right you
can give a time range if you're
traveling to different country that I'll
be available from this day to this data
and I'm looking for other things like
that and blender is a game and finding
app for following of 4 million users are
there on this rain so based on your
location based on your social network
it's going to check and connect you to
the nearby single who is looking to
connect with you basically right so it
doesn't do this way right if someone is
in Japan and another person is in India
it's not going to connect these two
people it's going to connect people were
close to each other then you have tender
it's based on swipe right it uses
Facebook to determine mutual friends
interests and locations so it collects
some amount of data from your facebook
what do you do you like a profile if
they like you back you too can see more
information about each other chat and
make plans right so this is good for
data who values the privacy so what
happens not just that you're also going
to look into what kind of a person the
opposition is right there can be a lot
of fraudulent people who might register
their profile and do some kind of you
know fraud thing
or some kind of fraudulent things by
stealing away your images posting them
in some unwarranted locations and things
like that so a predictive modeling is
going to first of all identify who are
those people who might have to remove
from my system who are those people
whose account should be disabled who are
those people whom I should not even let
them you know register with me can I do
that kind of a prediction that is your
predictive modeling all about yes we can
do that and then you have a harmony
right yeah here you have the higher odds
of getting married so what you can
predict is basically if there are two
people who liked each other what is the
probability that they might get married
also right or what is the probability
that they might get separated so you can
provide this additional information to
your customers and say that okay you two
profiles seems like you know if you to
go along well for another two or three
years you get married kind of it based
on your historical leader and so on and
so forth but who is for yours venience
Italians and French so let us look into
a case study of match.com so features
what are the features of this freedom of
expression we use singles the
opportunity to express themselves
through various free writing sections
and you can have close to 26 photos as
well as selected preferences regarding
the person you're searching so the
moment you provide these details your
preferences is going to quickly do
analysis of the entire database and help
you come up with the top two or three
profiles and how strong is your
statistical algorithm that you have
written to come up with these kind of
selections depends on how many people
are
selecting one of those three profiles
which you throw to them which you
predict right because there are millions
of profiles they cannot go to each and
every profile and select on my own i do
not have so much of time for example the
model that you're going to build a
predictive model will actually scan
through the entire database and it's
going to quickly come up with analysis
and tell you that okay based on your
preferences based on your images that
you posted these are the top three
matches and if you select one of two
that means your algorithm is robust and
then privacy issues all communications
between members happen to an anonymous
email network so no one can hack that
that is a resumption right but yeah sake
it's secure but again hackers are even
more what eco becoming even more thick
skin and they're also trying to hack
most of the sophisticated systems so the
names and contact information of all our
members of all the members right
match.com are kept confidential until
the member personally decides to share
the information with a potential match
now what if a person convinces you to be
a gentleman and tries to get the details
your personal eating and what if he then
Christ circulated among his friends
group and things like that it will be
very disturbing right so how do I get
rid of that here is where your fraud
detection techniques come into picture
fraud detection is a niche area bc right
who are the previous people who have
done this kind of fraud do i have a
similar kind of pattern with this person
here based on his age gender sex a
vertical location so on and so forth
right every profile and photo is
screened by the customers for the
appropriateness but here also if you
have some kind of historical data you
can use techniques such as decision tree
you can use techniques such as
random forest you can use techniques
such as you real network in all that
print data mining Super Why sticks
basically you do that categorization on
whether a person is fraud or not in
various categories and if you don't find
someone special within six months you'll
be given additional six months for free
those are all the way disadvantage you
said yeah and as I've told you earlier
match com uses chemistry.com to do
personalized service and get detailed
preferences data once you have the
preference data again it's going to
search with a historical data of people
who have already matched so if person a
and person B matches the profile and
they go along for a long-term
relationship or whatever be right so
this is a potential hit for me so in
this way there will be a lot of hit or
lot of success stories you look into all
the success stories as your historical
data and based on that whenever new
people search you're going to look into
that information compare it with the
existing database and proceed with our
further analysis on whether those two
people are going to match or not marry
or not and things like that so here is
an example person is a potential match
person B but with higher probability
that person B is also interested in was
it right it's not something like for
person i am going to show matches not
just that i also need to show person a
matches I just mean I will show in
person one person to person three in
such a way that there is an equal
probability that person p also likes a
person to also person three also likes e
in that way I'm going to save a lot of
effort right otherwise what happens if
i'm going to show the profiles to person
a and what if person he likes % b but
pleasant be doesn't like a it's a waste
of time so how do I pin those kind of
models right
of course there are a lot of challenges
when you analyze the data validity of
the data right people have the tendency
to lie how do we take that students of
the data that means if you're handsome
or if you are very beautiful you might
get a lot of invitations right and this
is also analyzed if there are a lot of
hundred inbox messages then what happens
that particular person is high in demand
so that person's photograph is dropped
right dropped in the search biscuit then
you have misbehaving users right so what
happens if you you are a person was
using abusive language or if you're
trying to you know come up with some
obscene comments and things like that
you'll automatically be removed your
account would be deceived your IP
address and all that is strike then they
see movies and your algorithm is
frequently enhanced as and how the
amount of data gets generated do you
know this that Facebook in look at its
users posting patterns and moods in
ought to predict the future romantic
relationships here is this case study
there this is what facebook thats if
you're not aware of until now if in your
profile you say that you're you do you
are not into any relationship right then
if a person joins there's a trend that
they have noticed 100 days before you
meet someone before you come in physical
touch contact that will be the rate at
which you'll post full days before
you're about to commit to a person right
will this before your number of posts
increase and days you when you're
committed it so much you are extremely
happy after that obviously it's going to
come down facebook knows before you do
when you are going to become a couple
Facebook knows you much better
it certainly knows long before you
announce it on your relationship status
right even before you change your status
to married or committed or things like
that Facebook knows then so that those
are the kind of possibilities of using
analytics in your dating website so the
here are references which have been
referred to before coming up with this
presentation now open to your questions
and one more thing after your questions
or if you want to drop off now please do
take this away it's going to help us
enhance the future webinars so after the
questions just what has this question
statistically does distribution matters
in predictive analytics and no
absolutely suspect whether your data
follows normal distribution or Poisson
distribution or log normal distribution
or exponential distribution or weibull
distribution whatever distribution we
try it matters in your analysis for sure
Shah has this question around behavioral
statistics yet it's behavioral
statistics show Sam we are doing this
webinar to ensure that we spread the
awareness of analytics to people right
on how analytics is shaping the world
now and you can register for n number of
courses which is a Eureka has on
advanced analytics and things like that
which will help you switch your careers
or enhance your careers so shantha has
this question what are the models are
algorithms we should focus on to
specialize in predictive modeling now
thanks so you know it's difficult to
just shot this to 10 or 15 and tell you
that a these 10 or 15 you active but
I'll put it in a different way you need
to know statistical analysis you need to
know for
staying you need to know data mining
what supervised and unsupervised and you
need to know data visualization to some
extent those are the things you need to
focus upon some time ya shas what thank
you for that Josh what says it was a
nice presentation and he says I wish it
could be a bit longer in duration so Sam
has this question I am falling bliss in
a totally different job can you switch
careers at this time data analytics is
at the peak of it what do you call it
add the pitch now need analytics as a
profession but Sam you need not switch
your careers right in any profession in
any industry in any sector or in any
domain analytics is prevalent it's only
about learning and implementing in your
own workspace you need not switch your
careers I mean there is nothing called
switching careers if it comes to data
analytics some tips and hints for
interviews as a data scientist / most
focus on statistical analysis
forecasting and data mining techniques
along with your data visualization Thank
You Santa Santa says it was very
informative and different from the usual
sessions but which way has this question
what is the difference between data
analyst and data scientist I would not
see any difference those are just the
different names it data analyst and data
scientist there is no lot of different
there there this terminology stance is a
analytics can be utilized in chemical
industry is it there absolutely what
kind of chemicals should you combine to
get a better product for example nitish
in using them you do help us with a help
us find a role in data analysis
through your online program you need to
Sam drop an email to support that at
Eureka or at the end of the session when
you take this survey right you can just
mention this because I'm a trainer I
might not be knowing that but I know
that the program is very good which I do
Rica provides but for this kind of
additional information you need to drop
in an email to support a tea drinker
alright nitish thank you so much thank
you for my furry yeah so Sam you can
drop in an email to sales @ u recorder
coupe alright thank you so much friends
do not forget to take this away and all
the best for your curry is if at all you
are planning for data and antics
otherwise also all the best take care
