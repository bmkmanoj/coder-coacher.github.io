the webinar on our training
my name is Gotham Verma and I'll be
taking you through you know the webinar
today and giving you the complete dopes
on how our has become an essential
component of the data of world today all
right drilling ok so without any further
ado let's get started right so the
agenda of the webinar today is to
understand as to why do we need
analytics what is this all news around
analytics data everything right so I'll
be giving you a detail on why do we need
analytics all right
then post that we will be looking at
what exactly is business analytics and
how does it fit into the whole scheme of
things right essentially analytics can
have multiple applications multitude of
applications as you all would know data
is only present right
wherever data is present we can actually
incorporate analytics a belayer right
and essentially how does business
analytics play an integral part of this
whole ecosystem right so we'll be
looking at that and then post that I'll
be telling you as to why does our form
such an essential part in the whole
ecosystem right what is the position
that our enjoys in the whole scheme of
things and what exactly are is right so
we'll be looking at you know the details
on why it should we learn our why our is
such a widely accepted tool in the data
science world out there right now and
post that we'll be looking at who
exactly uses are who are the actual
consumers of art right I'll be taking
you through information around that post
that we'll look at you know the
variables different data types
it's at read cetera some of the you know
the basics of our post past will look at
the data operators data types etc etc
right so
the agenda is clearly to introduce you
to the analytics world and then post
that see where those are fit in this
grand scheme right okay really so with
that let me give you an introduction to
why do we need analytics right so to
give you perspective somewhere around
2005 the majority of the data that
companies were capturing was
predominantly our DBMS the structured
data source right essentially you know
you would know the SAPD Oracle's the my
sequels of the world right
those were the major data sources that
the companies used to capture somewhere
around 2005 what happened is there was a
sudden explosion in the kind of data and
the type of data or I should say the
variety of data that we all started
generating right till then it will only
structured data that was getting
captured somewhere around that time you
know there was an explosion in both semi
structured and unstructured data and
some of you might you know be able to
guess why exactly that happened right
that was the time when web 2.0 took over
right that was the time when we actually
started using or rather expressing
ourselves online way more we actually
started you know expressing ourselves
commenting about companies our
experiences sentiments etcetera etcetera
on multitude of tools or applications
such as Facebook LinkedIn whatsapp
etcetera etcetera right
so all these forums they started
generating petabytes and terabytes of
data right now that essentially led to
an exponential increase in the type of
data companies were generating right so
as I mentioned earlier it was
predominantly structured data when this
explosion happened structured data
over the next few years and decade
structured data saw a very very minimal
increase or growth rate with respect to
captures however semi structured and
unstructured data saw exponential growth
rates right that is essentially you know
why we need analytics essentially the
kind of data and the type of data
started increasing phenomenally and
companies started appreciating the
importance of this data right they
started acknowledging and they started
moving away there was a huge paradigm
shift in the way businesses function
right they started moving away more and
more from the gut driven decisions right
they stopped going by their dad to data
driven more informed decision-making
right there was a paradigm shift between
Kuch driven decisions and data driven
decisions right that essentially was
enabled by analytics right back
essentially is the power of for data
analytics or business analytics as we
say right so with that let me you know
quickly give you some sort of
introduction on different domains where
we have and we are leveraging analytics
and the business analytics in particular
right so like I was mentioning the data
capture rates have increased
phenomenally right and you know the
customers have more and more started
discussing about companies online with
the introduction of Internet of Things
the kind of data and the sensor data
that we have been capturing that's also
increasing right so multitude of sources
of data have come into existence right
similarly for banking world we are
seeing that there is a large amount of
customer data that gets generated every
day right and while dealing with these
millions of customers on regular basis
it's very tricky for a company to
actually keep a track of for their
market is their loan rates you know
their credit histories it's a track to
track right so
that is essentially one of the major
applications of analytics and to give
you a perspective there was a band
without naming the bank they actually
tell somewhere around 2010 they actually
used to archive
90% of the data that they used to
generate or capture and store only 10%
of the data somewhere around the end of
for the decade they actually realized
how valuable or you know what a treasure
trove that data is right the remaining
90% so that is when they actually
implemented a big data application or
big data distribution to actually
capture the remaining 90% as well and do
analytics on top of that big data
distribution to actually make very very
informed and insights driven decisions
right now they are actually currently
they capture 100% of the data and then
they do predictive modeling on top of
that 100% data to actually come up with
intelligent data-driven insights so that
is one of the examples of for the
banking domain
similarly for insurance domain I mean we
all appreciate and acknowledge how much
severe or how important the credit
histories and the fraud detection
algorithms are with respect to the
insurance was right day in day out we
keep hearing you know XYZ frauds
happening around the world right so that
is the offense for the insurance domain
essentially insurance domain extensively
depends on forecasting and predicting
the customer turns or predicting the
impending frauds that might happen
etcetera etcetera right so by
understanding the risk involved based on
the credit report it becomes very easier
for the company to actually decide which
policy to be accepted or rejected right
like I mentioned instead of taking
decisions from the gut they've actually
started making more informed and
data-driven decisions right okay moving
on to healthcare as well
as we all know there are millions of
people who get admitted in the hospitals
right and these numbers are only going
to go up right the population across the
world is increasing the infrastructures
are improving the world is getting more
connected it's a try cetera right so the
data source that we are or the
industries or the healthcare industry in
this particular case are capturing its
increasing tremendously right and
currently if we talk about this domain
they are actually capturing millions of
records for individuals who get admitted
around the year right which essentially
translates into billions of dollars
spent annually just in the admission
processes right now you can you can
yourself understand how severe that
information is how these domains have
actually been solving these problems
starting with the banking domain banks
essentially have built custom our model
that maintains the loans provided to
these individuals which helps them in
actually deciding the amount to be paid
by the customer over time right
essentially it's way more methodical way
more organized and sequential right you
can always query your data to us we come
up with the very very specific OLAP
information or analytics information
that is the value that our brings to the
table talking about the insurance domain
by using this historical data of the
customers or the credit history data you
know the domains or the institution they
are actually creating models based on
our that will not only assess the risk
appetite of these customers but also
make a predictive forecast for them
right so when I say predictive forecasts
and see what it culminates into is
whether a particular person who has come
for an insurance whether he is in the
process of committing a fraud or not
right or whether he is a long term
valuable customer or not right all these
things are what
you end up doing in art right so there
is a question by I see what exactly is a
model in our shirai ocean so when I say
a model in our what I mean is basically
you capture it's a process right so a
model in our is a process it starts with
capturing all of the data that we are
talking about in the perspective of
insurance domain now what that means is
the historical pattern or the historical
data around the credit of the customers
it could be variables such as whether a
particular person has defaulted in the
past or not yes or a no right whether a
particular what is the EMI or the
premium that the customer has been
paying
month-on-month right what is the total
insurance value that the person has
opted for or what is the age of the
person what is the gender of the person
etcetera etcetera now when I have all
this information all this rich
historical data essentially what I do is
I actually use all these variables to
come up with a model or come up with an
algorithm to put it in a simplistic way
to come up with an algorithm that tells
me if the age of the person is a P and
you know the person is a pensioner and
the person is male it's likely that the
person is going to commit a fraud or you
know whatever something like that right
that is essentially this whole workflow
starting with historical data to the
prediction is called a model I hope that
answers your question I she brilliant
super you're welcome I see okay right so
moving over to the healthcare domain now
given this patient history the rich
patient history throughout year millions
of record a predictive model can be
built to identify who is at the risk for
hospitalization and to what extent the
medical equipment should be scaled now
using my predictive model just
reiterating based on the historical data
that I am capturing I can
we create an algorithm which helps me in
building an outcome variable or a
prediction that tells me it out of these
hundred people who have been
hospitalized essentially all these 100
people who live in a particular town for
instance these 50 people are prone to
hospitalizations right if I am a
hospital I can make month-on-month
prediction as to what will be the count
of people that will get hospitalized in
my hospital in a given month right that
way I can easily scale up or scale down
my medical equipment depending on the
demand that I am forecasting so that is
the power that statistics and that is
the power that analytics brings to the
table so we have already discussed some
of these aspects but to further
reiterate why do we need analytics
essentially you know there are new
horizons or there are new spheres of
opportunities or ways of improving the
bottom line and top line that have come
up because of data analytics right I've
actually started if I am a business
owner I've actually started thinking of
many other ways of improving or reducing
my costs or better optimizing my
products or you know marketing analysis
to further making better and more
informed decision-making and to better
visualization of my organization
operations and let me tell you guys
these are just the very few horizons of
opportunities that have come up there
are very more use cases and scenarios
that you can actually come up with where
you can actually implement data
analytics or data analysis right now
this is very specific to certain
industries if I am a heavy engineering
industry essentially I could end up
building predictive models that help me
in forecasting
or predicting as to you know if I have
ten million dollar equipments out there
in the field say for instance I am
caterpillar right now I might have
hundreds of million dollar equipments
operating at a particular site using
this rich historical data that I am
capturing I can actually build algorithm
to predict that out of these hundred
equipments these ten equipments specific
ten equipments will actually fail over
next ten days right that means I can
actually mobilize my maintenance team
maintenance engineers to actually
address to those ten high severity
equipments right essentially if I'm
caterpillar than any single day of
downtime would cost me tremendous amount
of dollar value so back ways I can
actually bring in way more efficiency
into my operations using the power of
theta and these are all practical use
cases guys I'm talking from my
experience these are the examples that
I'm giving some of my clients and this
is information from the live practical
scenarios right so that is what's
happening in the practical world now
coming over to what is Business
Analytics essentially Business Analytics
is a subunit or a subcategory of data
analytics that comes up with business
driven decision making using the power
of data essentially the idea is to
examine large and different types of
data to uncover these hidden patterns or
correlations or insight that you know
were never visible to a business owner
right and since you know the impact of
this information or these decisions is
so huge on the operations of a business
essentially it falls under the category
of business analytics right I can
actually have multitude of types of
analytics for instance as I am talking
about you know the operations of a
company it's
essentially I'm talking about HR
analytics for instance or log analytics
for instance right so there can be
multitude of applications that data
analytics has okay moving on right so
these are some of the competencies that
we can categorize under the category of
business analytics or data analytics the
idea is to actually start with some sort
of a background basic analysis or
preliminary analysis now this is where I
start making sense of the data this is
where statistical analysis or
exploratory data analysis as I can call
under the second category are the major
categories where I actually start
understanding the type of data that I am
capturing whether the data is clean or
not whether there are any missing values
or outliers etc right the idea is that
there is structured as well as
unstructured and semi-structured data
that we capture now I can actually make
sense of all of this data only if I have
data in a structured format so for that
it's essential or paramount for me to
actually convert my semi structured and
unstructured data into a structured
format that is exactly what we do under
these two categories so these two
categories help me in doing that now
once I have my structured data I need to
make sense of it whether you know I
successfully converted it and whether
there are any missing values or outliers
whether the data have any hidden
patterns such as correlations etcetera
etcetera right and I would visualize the
data to see whether there are any useful
insights that I can get out of the data
right so call it preliminary analysis
that's what we do in the first two
phases
then comes the all critical data mining
phase right now in data mining phase I
essentially start building model or
tried digging B
into the data using my predictive
algorithms my predictive algorithms
essentially are nothing but you know the
training sets that I build using the
training data that I am capturing
training data is nothing but the
historical data that I have been
capturing so from that stems the data
mining or I should say the machine
learning side of the things now as we
move on come be part of predictive
modeling where I actually run the
iteration of my model to actually do
live predictions on real data till the
above point I was actually creating or
rather building my model in this phase I
actually end up taking it to the next
level where I actually do testing as
well on unseen data right the power of
data analytics or the power of business
analytics using R is nothing but the
power of predicting something that is
supposed to happen in the future with a
very high accuracy rate right that is
exactly what prediction means right so
that is exactly what we do in this case
we actually you know feed unseen data to
be model and ask it to predict something
that is going to happen in the future
right so say for instance if I am
retailers and I have built a model that
predict whether a particular customer
entering into my store is going to buy
or not I actually do the model building
first once the model is built I actually
do prediction on it and when I say
prediction what I mean is I give it new
data such as the time a particular
customer enters the store the appearance
etc the age of the person the gender of
the person and let my model predict that
based on the information that I have
received
I predict that this particular visitor
will be a prospective purchaser in my
store
that is exactly what happens in this
space and the next phase is the
visualization phase
now when I talk about visualization
essentially what I am doing is I am
building
very interactive dashboards which have
information based on my requirement if I
am generating an alert or something it
would have you know the live feed from
the model output which makes it way more
business-friendly or user interactive
right since if I want to present my
results to the CXOs I don't want to show
them the code or the complete algorithm
of my model right they wouldn't be
interested in that what they would be
interested in seeing is what exactly is
happening on the ground essentially only
the business relevant information and
that is what you do in the visualization
save you actually leave out all the
jargon you leave out all the peripheral
information and you only show the
relevant information that a particular
business folk will be interested in see
it's nothing but the BI layer on top of
our predictive model alright any
questions comments on this like guys
awesome alright thank you so much Aisha
all right super so moving on guys to the
next slide now you might ask why do we
need our alright so there is a question
by samhita can we use other
visualizations look the tools like
tableau in our analytic absolutely
Selena absolutely the power of analytics
is such that you actually can
incorporate any of the visualization
tools that you are comfortable with
it's tewi agnostic to answer your
question right so you can actually work
with tableau you can work with Microsoft
power bi you can work with QlikView
etcetera etcetera right it totally
depends on your comfort level and your
backgrounds right so to answer your
question yes you can all right super
right so moving on guys you're welcome
to me huh right so moving on guys so you
might ask this question why do we need
our right where does our fit in this
whole scenario right now I is the lingua
franca
or data analysis or for data science it
is the language that is most widely
accepted by the statisticians analyst
quant spokes data scientists etcetera
etcetera right and the major reason for
that is that our is open source right
you can actually use it for absolutely
zero rupee value right you don't have to
spend anything to actually start using
arche however lot of other competitors
that are out there in the market such as
SAS or SPSS etcetera they all are only
paid right and that is where our wins
over all the rest of them you can
actually see that there are more than
20,000 libraries out there in the market
for our and it's only increasing right
the count of saudis library is only
increasing from where it is right now
the reason for that is since it's open
source people from around the world are
contributing to the development of this
tool or evolution of this tool and that
is exactly why you know there is a
phenomenal increase in the consumers or
phenomenal increase in the users of our
language right anyone and everyone can
use it and there is nothing that you
cannot do in our it's like the holy
grail of the data analysis world ok
right so this is how our studio looks
like once you have it installed on your
machine essentially this is how it will
look like there is the top left pane
which is the code window this is where
all your coding and source information
and scripting part comes the one at the
bottom is the console where you actually
see the results of your code runs you
can actually run or execute your code
from here and the result appears over
here so this is the console which as you
can see over here are the results of the
execution the top side is a combination
of
two windows that is the workspace and
the history right the history is nothing
but the tab where our stores all the
commands and all the statements that you
have executed in the past in case you
want to refer back to them and workspace
is the window where you have the
environment of art right this is where
you see the list of variables or
packages or libraries or functions that
have been created or the datasets that
have been imported into the our
environment right so you see every inch
of that information in this particular
window and the bottom right is around
multiple things right and the most
important one is plots you can actually
see a list of packages that are there
you can actually see the list of files
that are present in your environment
and you can always refer to the help
window right but the most important one
is the plot you can do a bunch of
operations on it you can actually export
these plots you can actually clear them
you can actually save them in multiple
formats etcetera etcetera
right a bunch of things that can be done
over here and you know I would like to
reiterate that everything that any
visualization do we can do essentially
all can do it way way better right it's
a one-stop shop for all your data
analysis requirements all right any
questions comments on this like guys or
are we good all right brilliant thank
you thank you are you she right so
moving on this is another window where
we are actually seeing you know the
snapshots of how I can actually execute
my code right so like I mentioned our is
nothing but a lingua franca for data
analysis it is the programming languages
and it's something very easy to learn
one can actually get conversant at are
very quickly depending on you know how
much comfortable you are looking at the
code over here right the idea is that
one does data analysis
in our by writing the scripts as I
showed earlier and functions in the
programming language and executing them
and once it is executed we export the
code and release it into our production
environment so that is what we do when
we actually relieve our production model
or release our final code into the
production environment right
we export the code from here okay moving
on this is another slide that gives you
an overview of what R is R is
essentially available in the form of
functions or packages etc and you can
literally do any sort of data
manipulation you can actually build the
statistical model like I was talking
about the wine bath with respect to my
predictive modeling all I can do plain
simple visualization or chart plots
depending on my di requirement right so
all of this can be done in our with very
few script lines right that is it yeah
and like we saw earlier the bottom right
is where we see the plots appearing and
that is exactly what we are seeing over
here as I mentioned is open source it's
completely free for anyone and everyone
to download the website that you have to
go on is cran dot all project.org
depending on the operating system that
you're using you can download a specific
version of it and start getting your
hands dirty on it right it is as
straightforward as that you don't need
any fancy or hardware requirements you
don't have any sort of challenges from
the RAM standpoint since it's single
threaded and it's an extremely small
application you can actually go ahead
and install it and start using it
without a hitch so not only does this
mean that you can download and use R for
free but the source code is also open
for in
affection and modification to anyone who
wants to see how the methods and
algorithms work under the covers right
so like I mentioned the anyone and
everyone can write the codes and release
it for other people who use it and you
can actually use any of the data
scientists work from New Zealand for
instance who have done a work on it
right and use it for your own personal
projects and not only that you can
actually go ahead and even inspect the
source code to see whether it needs any
modifications or whether it's working
absolutely fine right
so all that you can actually do in our
which is a capability not openly
available in many other cases now who
uses our in my opinion everyone uses our
everyone and anyone who actually starts
or who actually is in a situation or
position where they are exposed to data
of any format they should actually use
are and these are some of the domains
that actually utilize our this is by no
means exhaustive there are a ton of
other domains as well which are actually
using the power of our currency right so
starting with Pharma then banking retail
telecom education all of them and like I
was giving you the example for retail I
can actually use our to build my
predictive model to classify a
particular visitor as a hot lead or a
non hot heat similarly for banking I can
actually detect frauds
impending frauds that might happen in
the future by using our in farmer space
you know companies use of analytics and
are specifically to actually do genome
mapping and many other research
activities in the education space as
well there is a lot of research that
happens in universities etc and is a
very research friendly tool right so if
you would go out there you'll actually
see that you know are is adopted white
amongst the research fraternity as well
right moving on to the telecom
essentially it's very important for me
if I am a telecom operator it's very
important for me to predict but how many
customers of mine will turn in the next
few months right and when I say turn
what I mean is how many of my existing
customers will actually lead my services
and move on to a different vendor
right so all this I can actually predict
using our and building a predictive
model through kit so these are some of
the domains that actually use our and
beyond that giving you specific examples
of companies etc that you are so there
is CFPB or Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau that uses our for data analysis I
was giving you an example of for
Caterpillar John Deere is a company very
similar to them they manufacture heavy
engineering products etc so
statisticians at John Deere use our for
time series modeling and geospatial
analysis in a reliable and reproducible
way right talking about the banking Bank
of America uses for its reporting
requirements right for square of you
know very famous recommendation engine
has rf4 to its technology stack they
have a very very advanced recommendation
engine which they have built using rich
historical data and that has been built
using R as one of the key tools for the
whole India were Mozilla the foundation
responsible for Firefox uses our to
visualize web activity essentially there
are multiple data capture points when
you actually use Firefox as a browser
right so the Mozilla captures all of
that information from all these capture
points to actually do a very very rich
and visually appealing analytics or
visualizations right Google essentially
is one of the key companies that
actually use data analytics and are in
specific as its core component right it
uses the R for multiple use cases but
one of the use cases being to actually
predict the economic activity or you
know the behavior of the customers or
behavior of the visitors on its
different website that's something that
Google uses are four mg MGB fourth
largest bank of Australia uses I for
credit risk analysis right so these are
some of the major companies that
actually use R or have R as a key
component to their technology stack
right and like I mentioned it's
extremely straightforward to install you
can actually go on cran our project go
RG web site right and you simply need to
download the version depending on the
operating system you use
and essentially the latest version of R
is available over there for user so you
can go ahead download the latest version
and just like you install any other
application you can actually go ahead
and install our as well so these are the
steps our studio is the IDE that you
would need to download once you have
installed the open source R version
right so essentially you know this is
our studio is an interface which makes
working with our way more easier and way
more simpler right so the visualization
that we saw a while back let me show you
once again right so this is our studio
right so the first part is you actually
go on cran dot our project.org website
and download the latest version of open
source R once you are done with it you
need to go on our studio comm and
download the latest version of our
studio on it right ok so that's about it
let me quickly show you a demo on the
our studio right and postback will open
the floor
and in the meantime if you have any
questions comments for me please do keep
them coming
IRA more than happy to take any of those
questions right alright so this is what
I meant when I mentioned our studio so
what I have done over here is I lastly
fired up our studio and like I mentioned
this is where I do all my scripting
right this is where all the results
appear in case I don't understand
anything I can actually go ahead and do
a question mark and the way I advocate a
particular command is by doing ctrl +
Enter that is the shortcut that I have
for executing a particular command the
general way is to click on this button
once I am ready to select or ready to
run a particular command right so what I
did over here I actually there is a data
set present within our environment I
actually want to know what that data set
is all about so what I did I did a
question mark US personal expenditure
right and it's a very very easy to use
to realize in case you are stuck at any
point of time you can literally just do
question marks and you know you can
write in that particular function name
or library name that you want to
understand and R will open up the
complete response on that right so I did
a question mark on one of the data sets
that are present in our and it gives me
a very detailed response that this is a
data set that consists of United States
personal expenditure in the categories
of food and tobacco household operation
medical and health personal care and
private education for the given years
right so that is a penalty of the data
set all about so this is the way I write
comments I write a hash command and then
writing whatever I want to in order to
refer back to my data set that is one of
the basic norms of coding in our and
then I can actually import data sets
into the our environment using
read dot CSV command and I can do
visualizations as well right so right
now the data set is not imported into it
which is why it's not showing but this
is how I actually import data set using
the command read dot CSV and then using
that I can actually do a historical
histogram of the given data set right
on/off the given data so that is it from
my end guide right so I usually has a
question can I import data set from any
source right so there are multiple ways
of importing information or data from
different sources so for instance is the
data resides in your local machine you
can actually do read dot CSV directly
first you need to set your working
directory to the folder where the data
is present right so let me quickly take
you there right so essentially what we
are saying is its present in this folder
over here in module zero right so this
is where I am referring to right now in
case my data set is present in a
different folder I can actually point it
to that particular folder there we go so
I can actually put this as my working
directory over here let me quickly show
you the power of our alright
all right super right so I'm changing my
working directory to this specific
folder and let me show you this data set
in Excel for your reference all right so
this is the data set that I am trying to
import right so what I'll do now is I'll
essentially key in
there we go
have a question how different is our
when compared to each language so Samina
our is essentially an evolution of earth
language it's H is an archaic version R
is the more advanced version of it so
yes it's actually you know in a way the
more advanced version of this yeah I
hope that answers your question
okay right so essentially this is how I
have imported my dataset let me quickly
show you how does it look like so like I
mentioned all my data sets and all my
functions etc appear over here I can
actually click on this to actually see
there we go right so this is the data
set that we had in Excel it's come up
exactly the same way over here as well
right now I can actually do plotting of
it okay so if I want to understand
say for instance relation between gender
and balance what I can actually do is I
can actually plot a histogram between
gender and balance alright let's try to
do that
gender and the other one is balance
yep okay right so it's throwing another
all right okay that's because the data
set values are not matching up right so
this is essentially a binary dichotomous
and this is a continuous variable but
let me quickly plot just one variable to
give you a perspective right
there you go so I've plotted a boxplot
of my data set and what this tells me is
that the maximum value that I'm seeing
in my data set is somewhere around six
thousand with the mean value close to
somewhere around zero right which makes
sense right essentially it gives the
median value which essentially makes
sense right
so as we can see over here the maximum
value is somewhere around six thousand
right so that way I can actually do
multiple plots on my data set that is
just one of the examples of how I can
actually visualize the data I can
actually do a scatter plot I can
actually do a histogram right and
similarly I can do you know comparison
between two different variables you know
a bunch of things can be done right and
similarly I can actually save all of
these information or all these plots as
either a made or PDF or I can actually
clear it as well and depending on my
requirement I actually have to make use
of some of the given libraries ever
right so for instance as you can see
over here there are a bunch of packages
or libraries that are already existing
like I was mentioning awhile back and
these libraries are nothing but an
encapsulation of a bunch of functions or
a bunch of operations that I can perform
right I can actually invoke if you are
familiar with the you know the the
coding language you can actually invoke
all these packages and use the codes or
use the function that exists already
into these packages okay so to answer
your question if it resides on the local
machine you can actually read the data
like this or in case you want to connect
to some conventional databases or our
DBMS sources you can actually use an
ODBC connection or in case if it's
written on Java you can actually use
JDBC connections right and
that helps you in connecting the
database directly to our and utilize you
know basically pull the data directly
from those sources into your working
environment and not just this if you
have data on your draw HDFS or Hadoop
distribution the Big Data distribution
you can actually even connect this to
the Hadoop distribution by using some of
the Hadoop API is and essentially build
analytics or do data analytics on top of
that information does that answer your
question are you she super alright folks
so that's it from my end do you have any
other questions or are we good to close
the session a quick yes or no please
guys we're learning all right so I
usually has a question we're learning
I'll make it easy to move into an
analyst trouble that's absolutely true
ie she I mean R is the tool that we know
that every other company and if you do a
simple Google search to see you know
what are the company requiring or what
has become him expecting these days
essentially this is what you know the
requirement is you should be conversant
at one or the other technology and R is
one of the major one that companies have
a requirement of these days right so to
answer your question yes it will
definitely boost your chances of moving
into an analyst role your vector machine
alright guys so I think we are good -
yep so that's good right so thank you
very much guys thank you for tuning in I
hope you know the session was useful for
you guys to get a better understanding
of what R is and how it relates to the
data analytics world right I wish you
all a very good luck in your future
endeavors
and that's me Gothel Wilmer signing off
