your instructor for today on behalf of
Eddie Rekha
I welcome you all to this webinar on
enough screening and in this session we
will talk about there are nuts
administration concepts ok so if you
people are going to be nuts
administrators in the future then what
the topic that you guys got to know
right so I'll first talk about different
job roles and the different job
description that an administrator would
have to perform and I'll talk about some
of the most common of those and I'll go
to detail and show you some of the
demonstrations of those topics alright
guys so before I get started let me just
take a confirmation from you people can
you all see my screen or hear my voice
if it's all clear then we can go ahead
ok otherwise I might have to restart
again do acknowledge it guys you can say
yes or no in the chat box
all right and if you have any questions
during your session this feel free to
put that question in the chat box and
I'll answer them right away all right
guys
ok so it seems like I'm getting couple
of acknowledgments I've got a dark
knowledge meant from around four or five
people's your can hear my voice on my
screen so without which you must stand
let me just get started ok so the first
topic that I'm going to talk about is
why choose the nuts okay now we'll
haven't shown you the agenda right now
because before we talk with your gender
right I'm going to talk about two
important topics and the first of those
topics is why should you choose linux'
and the second of that is the different
job descriptions and the different job
rules okay
now when I'm done with these two topics
then we can get started with the
different tasks that an administrator
would actually do alright so ok let me
just start with the first light then
it's as you can see it's why choose
linux' now I'm going through this topic
because if you people are going to be
administrators alright if you're getting
trained then these are things that
you're supposed to know these are like
the general knowledge and the common
sense okay so the Knux is first of all
it's freely available and it's open
source all right when we say it's open
source that means anybody can download
Linux and you can modify the source code
and program the Knux to work the way you
wanted to okay you can upgrade any
software you can add software you cannot
change them you can do whatever you want
to okay and you're not going to have any
problems but whereas with operating
systems like Windows or with Macintosh
you might not be able to do it
or in fact any other thing that's on
open-source right even when it comes to
software's or smaller programs you
cannot edit things which are not open
source because you have certain
restrictions and you have to comply to
the SLA right so it's level agreement so
that's the thing but with nuts you don't
have that problem
and basically the Knox became popular
because of that reason because it
allowed developers to access the source
code modify the source code make changes
improve the software and upload the
changes and share it with the rest of
the world so that's how alex has evolved
that's all UNIX is so good because there
are multiple people collaborating
together working and improving the nuts
right they do it and then they share it
with the rest of the world and that's
how alex has grown so much so that's the
main power behind or let's say the main
reason why it's the narcissus are so
popular now right and so good okay now
this is the reason why you people should
choose Linux if you are still going to
have doubts at the inner session then
this is something you guys need to note
all right and the other two points are
that of very secured and why it's free
now these two things are little related
your let me say it's Wireless free then
I'm definitely the fact that you don't
need to install any antivirus in your
system right it's completely quiet proof
there is no requirement but whereas in
case of Windows or Macintosh you need
antivirus all right because they can get
your raw systems can get affected and
anything can happen right your document
order files or folders they can all be
exposed and people can get access to it
you know remotely now that's the problem
they can be a lot of breaches and all
these things can happen but within the
next that's not going to happen right
you don't need an anti-virus at all and
when it comes to even smaller bugs and
viruses you know nurse can stand up to
them and they're not going to get
affected all right so that's the virus
free aspect and it's very secure because
of this reason so when you don't have to
worry about cybersecurity or any viruses
then you're of course going to be very
secure right you don't have to worry
about setting up the various security
checks and all these things you can just
really get down to setting up your Linux
VM and start working with whatever you
want all these things so that's the
aspect here and then the next thing is
the Linux is very easy to learn and use
now when I say this a lot of people you
might be surprised that you know you
might be thinking that it's very
difficult and you know if you get use
the
Kommandant interface and the way the
terminal works and all these things but
yeah I actually have a question already
there's Rahul is already saying that
yeah it's not actually easy seems
complicated but see the whole lot we
just showed that it's just because it's
you're new to it all right
the first end when you tried using
Windows you might have had the same
problem okay you might not have known
that the start button is what that does
how can I say the different files and
directories right so maybe that would
have happened when you are really young
but over time you've grown right you've
got new to it so the same things going
to happen here Linux is actually very
very easy and it's you just need to
spend time there figuring things out by
learning how the different you know
commands work in the CLI and well even
if you don't need to use the Fila
everywhere also okay you know if you're
not comfortable that you can still use
nuts because you have a fantastic GUI
that I would say is as with is the
windows right but the advantage that the
next has over Windows is that it also
has a CLI so you have a command prompt
in Windows but here you have a CLI and
the fiela in Linux is the much more
advanced it's much more easier to use
when compared to Windows because most of
the people are not very familiar with
the Windows command prompt well that's
because Windows has a very good GUI and
people prefer the GUI aspect in Windows
but with enough it's going to be very
simpler so you're not going to have any
problem and you can just get started
right away very simply so that's the
thing with Linux yeah absolutely route
so yeah you just need to world on the
commands and it's not going to be too
much of a task yeah I mean I would say
maximum is go it's going to take you
like one week of practice that's tops
right when you do that you will be
completely aware of all nuts what are
the different commands how to perform
different actions and operations all
these things and the advantage here is
that you know with a CLI you can perform
multiple operations at the same time you
know by just specifying one command you
can do a number of things but to perform
the same operation in Windows you might
by using the GUI right you have to go
through a lot of steps let's take the
example of creating a user account okay
you're the admin straight up beat
Windows or running us if you're going to
have to do it through Windows then
you'll have to go through the system you
know control panel system tools and user
administration and all these things okay
by the GUI well even in the notes if
you're going through the GUI aspect you
will
the same procedure right here I like for
five steps or maybe even ten steps at
the same time you last put
authentication and all these things but
if you're going to use the Linux CLI
right the terminal is going to be very
simple it is going to be one command
where you would say use a rat and then
you specify the name of the user and
that's it you're done and if you want to
set the password then the command is
going to be simple again it's going to
be PG s SW d okay after that you're
going to give the username and when you
give the username then it will prompt
you for the for setting up the new
password right so it's like that it's so
simple by just two commands and you're
going to what type like five six buttons
on your keyboard that's how simple it is
so that's the terminal part alright and
then we have the concept of multiple
distributions okay now when we say
multiple distributions then it means the
different flavor that MUX comes in okay
now especially beginners right many of
them are you know confused and they are
wrongly you have the wrongly taken that
unit is actually an operating system
okay the Knux is technically not an
operating system okay
the next is just a kernel and that can
power any operating system and get you
one something that's really running
that's really fast and you know nuts
together with something else gives you
the operating system and the first time
unless was formed it was again just a
kernel and that powered another
operating system cause the GNU okay so
now with something similar so you have
multiple other operating systems which
get powered by the nuts kernel and then
you have an operating system and those
operating systems there are many number
right now
that is what we call as distributions so
we have one two we have our Center s we
have Fedora
we have great at enterprises official
Enterprise Edition and then of course
the free version of that is sent to s
right and then we have suze so we have a
number of for distribution here we have
almost hundreds of distributions right
you can you have something called as
Knox mint the linux mint is something
that's very similar to Windows right you
can play songs and you can see videos on
that so you also have that kind of
flexibility that you know if you're not
comfortable with one particular
distribution then you can switch to a
different distribution and you don't
want to have any transition phase there
because they're all very similar right
it's just the way things look and it's
just that you want to become more
comfortable with that without any extra
effort Putin
- that's be your distribution aspect and
then of course you all know that
lanessa is fast and effective right so
it's effective the kids highly reliable
its performance is you know dependable
and it's very stable ok it's highly
highly stable and that is one of the
reasons why all the servers and all the
mainframes they are all Linux based
right you don't have any servers running
on any other operating system
that's because Linux is really stable
and there's also another fact that you
don't need to reboot a Linux system for
almost a primer right so just restarting
the system once in your is enough so
that's the advantage with Linux so
that's how good it is and that's why
it's effective and of course it's fast
you guys should know why it's fast right
it's you know pretty much faster than
Windows so that's the thing there's no
reason why should the choosing us but
there again you can't compare the speed
of Windows and the nuts and Mac because
they're all almost same there is - minor
differences but the whole point is that
you know enough is fast and it's as good
as any other operating system you know
it's as well as Windows or Mac so that's
what you gotta know and yeah so these
are some of the reasons why anybody
should learn Knox ok and if you want to
become an administrator then very good
you've made a good decision and
hopefully you can do well right so now
that you know this much about our Linux
let me go to the next slide and let me
talk about the different job roles here
ok now the most common job roles
available in the industry are those of
units administrator and support engineer
system engineer and network engineer ok
so we have the nuts admin right so the
next administrator or senior notes
administrators these are the most common
ones ok and then you have the other
roles like support engineer system
engineer and network engineer now what
we see impacts all these four roles they
are very similar
you know bar a little bit of differences
ok so if you look at the union of all
these people and if you look at the
description then you get what's written
here all right so all of these people
would basically be performing these
things and a lot of their tasks get
overlapped
right so a lot of tasks that a support
engineer and system engineer would do
would be overlapped so it's very similar
in that way but for some reasons we have
different descriptions and of course
they're going to
differences in what they do but it's
again going to be very minor and if you
want to do well and if you actually want
to be a good in a sadness trader you can
actually learn all these things and you
can be probably eligible for all of
these roles right so the description
wise is that of insulation and up
gradation and when we say insulation and
amputation it is that of the system that
is the software and the hardware okay so
at times when you know when if some has
run its course okay I mean it's memory
wise it's full and even the software
version wise if it's are getting
outdated then you've got to be in a
position to upgrade the software right
you should be able to work allocate the
appropriate hardware resource and do the
right things you know you know measure
what is the kind of performance your raw
system needs what kind of how much
upgrade it needs to be done what is the
you know DRAM that you need to purchase
all these things and then install the
appropriate software on that hardware
basically installation and uh predation
and setting up and configuring the whole
network right that's going to be one
important job of any units as
illustrator okay and that's something
that happens very frequently right and
then you have something for less
patching so patching is something you
know related to the software again the
software the security aspect and the bug
fixes so when we say passing it's
basically improving the existing
software that you already have so we
have something called as the next
repositories right so for the radar
based systems you can you know do
downloads you can run a command called
yum install and then the softening that
you wanna install okay and similarly for
the Debian based you have both things
like apt-get install and then package me
so you have all those things but if you
not install any software from that way
and if you've done something through the
CLI by actually downloading the package
and installing then patching is
something that you would have to and
especially if you are going for
something that's very you know that is
not open source okay if you are
installing that kind of software then
that time passing is something that's
what you go to do right so when we say
patching it means that you already have
an existing version of the software and
then over time that software has been
improved and that's been released so you
have to basically update the changes
right and patching is a little
complicated in that way because we have
to first track the differences yeah
to generate a difference file and then
based on that file you have to generate
the batch file that will just have the
upgrades the extra additional components
and that will have to be then finally
integrated with your actual
working software okay another question
from graduation he asked me why would we
need to do patching radish it's pretty
simple right
we need passing because every software
is going to be improved so there's no
software in the world that has been
developed in the best possible way at
the first go right you have a software
you will develop it and you will
definitely find bugs and you definitely
have ways to improve it right and that's
how I first make you know the companies
making the software big money they
constantly improve the software get a
better version of that and they release
it so that's what you also have to make
use of and especially with the security
aspect even though Linux has a very good
security it doesn't mean that you're
completely safe right you again have
security or fixes we have lot of power
you will have security problems but
those are not something that you know
you got to worry too much about because
the security features are something
that's going to take care of the any any
theft or any malware or any cyber
security right it's going to enable that
so that's why you need to do patching
you got to improve the security of your
system you go to work basically upgrade
your existing software and yeah those
things and that's why you need to do
patching all right Rajesh okay so then
yeah we have application support right
so it's not like every software is going
to right away be supported on your
system so there are certain things that
you gotta do you know certain of course
which need to be enabled certain kind of
you know tweaks that need to be done in
your network and all these things so you
have to be able to make sure that your
application is running all the time you
want to make sure that you troubleshoot
the version of any application so that's
one important job description that an
administrator would have to do and then
we have our storage migrations so
storage migrations is again a very
common thing because every now and then
or let's say not now and then it's
probably once in a while you'll have to
make your upgrades right so we'll have
to keep a backup of your data and the
benefit of you know witness is that the
storage backup right it's very good and
it's very effective so evident is not
played out every time there is something
that's going to happen you can do the
backup and you can have track of
everything
and yeah that's one important job rule
that the adversary would have to do
right and then of course improve
stability and performance yeah stories
monitor the ER performance and make sure
the system performs better than what it
was doing previously so these are all a
little more technical and a little more
scenario oriented okay yeah so it's a
little more scenario oriented so
improving the system in the performance
based on so many other aspects which you
will probably gain with experience so I
cannot you know tell you right now what
exactly although all those things are
but yeah the other thing you will get
the hang of it as in when you when you
have as you gain experience so that is
there and then usual administration so
user and efficient is very important
it's very common thing okay where you
have new people coming into your office
you have to set up the access for those
people you have to give them access to
the different files and folders or
directories that they would want to and
it's very important that you give them
only what they are supposed to get right
so you can't give them access to just
anything and everything so that's one
thing with the administration aspect and
this is a very common task and this is
probably the most you know regularly
you've worked up on description of any
Linux administrator or system analyst
traitor in your company in any company
in fact so that is that and then yes
installing and controlling servers and
services this is I would say this is
among the most important you know tasks
along with patching right because we all
know that all these servers and
maintains are all run on Linux right
another operating system or a
distribution of Linux is what powers
these servers now these things are
basically the backbone of your business
okay and these business need to be taken
care of right so whether you're storing
data on your server or whether it's you
know you make an upgrade to your server
all these things need to be done on a
regular basis you know some kind of file
transfer it happens you need to be able
to access the machine and it's okay it
not necessarily be just servers it can
also be any remote machine right you
should be able to configure them set up
set them up and access them and all
these things so this comes down to the
networking aspect and it's really
important that you do this right you
will understand why it's so important as
when the session goes on but for now or
you know is the networking aspect is
really really
okay so then we have backup and restore
yes so it meant something crashes which
is very deadly right it's not something
that's going to happen very often it
will happen very rarely but when it
happens what do you do what measures you
take how will you backup and restore so
that's one thing and like I said earlier
monitoring server monitoring is really
important in fact even network
monitoring is really important to avoid
any threats and hackers and server of
course needs to be constantly monitored
and checked for performance otherwise
you are going to have a big dip in
business so that's there and then
troubleshooting is probably it's the
combination of just everything you
should be able to just make sure
everything works right you can't have
any error you can't have an application
that cannot be installed you cannot have
an application that is you know suddenly
working off balance so all these things
will be taken care of and these are
probably the most common job
descriptions of for any no sadness rater
right and in fact support engineer
system engineer network engineer and
nuts admin right all these four artists
anonymous clear almost the same almost
80% to 85% of that job tasks is no
they're all the same and it's going to
be a small change right and even that is
going to be related to only one
particular concept now let's say if it
won't be a network engineer then it's
going to be you're heavily involved with
the networking aspect right so system is
you know someone that's going to be
involved with the entire troubleshooting
upgradation patching and all these
things right support engineer someone
that is a little more conservative role
you will be taking care of the tickets
whatever problems other people face the
user administration aspect and all these
things so yeah those the different job
roles and the different job descriptions
of these people right so these are the
two slide that I want to give you a
reduction to before I actually start
training you on these concepts right so
I've done this now next up I have the
agenda slide and here in the agenda
slide I'll talk about some of these
topics that I will cover great right
from here I have a couple of important
topics that are chosen and those are
probably the baby steps that you need to
learn to get yourself advanced and next
administration so those topics are those
of file permissions right access control
lists
shell scripting patching and networking
right networking again is really really
important you have three different
protocols the SSH that stands for a
secure shell SFTP that is the secure
File Transfer Protocol and then you have
SCP right secure copy protocol we have
these three protocols so I'll give you a
demonstration and all these things and
then of course we have the files
functions is what I will start off with
so I'm not sure if any of you are in my
previous session but in my previous
session that was enough sartorial I
spoke about how file permissions are set
back for directories and for files I
showed you all those things and even if
this session I recovered that because we
have to talk about ACS write access
control lists and access control list is
something of an extension or to file
permissions so if you guys need to learn
what is the ACL then you need to learn
five pounds and so that's why I'm going
to cover this and then the next topic
that we have is shell scripting so you
know like I told you so many times you
know countless number of times I have
told you that you know executing
commands is the most important thing as
a person that's working on the nuts
right but how many times will you
execute the command you will have
separate of tasks supposing you're
anonymous straight of doing the same
thing again and again right you will get
bored and you become inefficient and all
these things so that's where our
scripting comes in we have one file in
which you can feed in all the commands
that are going to execute right one
after the other you just specify all
those commands in that file you just
save it and then you can just instead of
giving all the commands separately you
just need to execute that one particular
file and when you execute one file then
all the tasks that you wanted right
which we present in the files give it
all be executed one after the other so
that something that's going to make your
job very simple and if you are going to
be an under straighter then you'll have
lot of such things which you will have
to be doing on a day to day basis right
multiple times you have to do the same
things right and shell scripting is
something is going to help you there
right it's going to eliminate any
repetitive tasks or tedious tasks so
that's thing and patching is something I
discussed earlier and a totally
important that is patching is ready to
enabling or improving the system
security and upgrading the Year software
and all these days so that's it
networking again I spoke about so from
it out wasting any more time I didn't
want to quickly get started and the
first topic that we have is the managing
file permissions
so file function is something that's
really important because if you're not
under straight on you want to give
access to something specific some
particular file or directory then these
are we route right
you assign it to a particular users and
how you do it is you will first get to
know what are the different permissions
that users have right and you can do
that by running this command called LS -
L competition you remember what this
command is and it basically you know
first of all LS lists down all the year
contents in that directory be it folders
or be it files okay it's going to listen
everything and when you give it along
with the - L right this is not one all
right this is L this water at Stanford
right it's small L so when we give LS -
L then what happens is you get the list
of juice contents along with something
like this okay you get all these details
so this is called long format and that's
what even DL stands for
so the long format to get other details
like what can profile is it and what are
the different functions right so this
basically is a 10 character block right
the first block is one character the
second is 3 the third is again three and
the fourth is also three right so the
first block here represents the the file
type it can be either D or it can be L
it can be in Omaha - like this or it can
be see or can be P and T here is
something that represents a directory
okay and if it's a - then it means that
the particular file that is been listed
that is the that's a normal file okay if
it is C then it means it's a character
special file if it's B it's a binary
special file and if it's L right if you
have Nellie or it means it's a symbolic
link file
right so you will have the file name
here and along with that you will have
all these videos of that particular file
so you have the you know after you will
be satisfied what is the type of the
file and after you'll be here specified
what are the user permissions okay so
this is with respect to the person
that's logged on to that system okay so
when we say users basically the owner
and what kind of permissions as we have
so by default the owner will have read
write and execute because if I create a
document or any file in my system then I
should have complete access right so by
default allow the readwrite access and
then the group that I have longed for
supposing I am a user that you know
added to my system right and then
there'll be a network up for users like
me like in my team I might have five
other people so we together will have a
group so
it's not just me that'll get access to
my documents even my group right my
extended coworkers
they will also get access to my files on
my directories but the level of access
that they get is again something that's
that can be controlled by using these
file functions okay and then similarly
there are other random people who are
not part of your project those are the
others category right other permissions
so what kind of fascist will they get
and when we go to details I will I can
tell you that we have our W X for each
of these three different blocks okay
so user permissions there is a read
write and execute okay X stands for
execute W is our right and our s read so
this means that I can read and I can
write and execute any file that's been
created in my system because I am the
owner and I can do all these things okay
but if somebody else from my group right
is accessing that particular occupation
afformations do they have if there's a
are W X Y which transfer you to a read
write and execute then even they have
complete omission right it's an open
security for them also but the other
people here okay so the people who are
not part of my group and yeah of course
if it's not me and nobody from my group
then what can a pastor do they have what
it shows here is read - and X this means
that the others have only read and
execute function they don't have write
function okay and supposing if you don't
want to give any if you want to remove
access from someone or if you don't want
to set particular access to anyone then
you can just put a - instead of putting
the character okay if you put a hyphen
here then it means the write X write
function will not be there okay but if
you put a hyphen in the last character
the third character then it means that
the execute will not be there for that
particular person or if we put our -
here then it means that person can't
read it right so that's what the - means
the - means that person doesn't have
that particular feature so in this case
it's the right feature if the - or it
means that even have the execute feature
so those the different are users right
so we have the owner and the user
denoted by you the groups will be
denoted by ug others by oh okay and if
you want a combination of all these
people then it's a all right so that's
what this part of the command stands for
and then we have symbolic links
so symbolic link is something that a
shortcut or a link to another file or
directory supposing I've created a file
right and if I want to create another
copy of it then that will basically be a
symbolic link right so I can access it
from good different locations from a
different directory or a different path
but they'll be referencing the same
route right so that is what symbolic
link means you're just having different
shortcuts and different access to the
same particular file so that's it
and then then you'd be displayed the
owner name of that particular file or
directory and then you'll have the group
name right that person belongs to or the
group name the file belongs to and then
you have the e-file types so whatever
the size of your file is it's actually
in kilobytes so that'll be displayed
here and then followed by the time at
which the file was created right so you
have that detail over here so this has
actually gone a little more theoretical
so what I do is as per some of the
request from the audience let me just
quickly go to my terminal and show you
how exactly this looks like right so one
thing is that I will be working on the
Center West distribution all right so
I'll be using the Centaurs distribution
of Linux and I'll be running it on a VM
right so this is my VirtualBox and I
have a couple of Williams you're above
window VM I have a centralized VM I have
three other CentOS beams all right and
currently I'm using 32-bit send to s
virtual machine but if you have an
operating system well and good you can
just use that either but yeah for my
purpose I'm having Windows and have
launched VirtualBox on top of that and
in the VirtualBox I'm using my sent OS
so in my previous class I give you one
reduction to the entire GUI right so the
same I don't wanna spend time teaching
you that but rather let me get the
things that's really important so let me
just open my terminal and show you this
right I'm just want to make it really
big right this is good enough so this is
my terminal this is my command line
alright now if I want to check which is
the particularly I'm currently and then
I can just give a command PWD write
print to working directory that's what
it means and it says I'm currently in
this directory slash home slash it reca
where this first slash here refers to
the root directory then under root I'm
inside the home folder inside the root
and then inside home there is a
call a trigger so that's what I am so
that's what is the PWT right now and I
can assume the different files and
directories in this sort by just giving
the command LS like a torii earlier so I
go valise then all the different files
and directories and the folders will be
available right there they available so
documents downloads desktop pictures
videos these are the different folders
and then you see a new CV dot Java
turbid or table this is the different
files that we have right now if I want
an extended format of this like what I
saw in my slide the long form and then I
can just give the command LS - L okay
when I do this I have the wrong format
of that particular you know content
right so we have what is the name of the
file
when was it created we have the
timestamp here the size over here then
the name of the group the name of the
owner right the symbolic link and then
the file permissions I spoke about each
of these things earlier so if any of you
guys are Sinatra please do let me know
right so to give you an example let's
take the example of this desktop right
so this one here the first character
refers to the fact that it's a directory
it's on a file ok and these three
characters here they represent the user
permissions okay or the owner
permissions this represents the group
permissions and DC characters represent
the other permissions the other users
were not the owner and neither are they
a part of the group so what kind of
permissions do they have so those people
here they don't have the right access
they can only read that particular
directory and execute rights the same
thing can be said for even groups and
it's really your owner and the user or
that particular user was complete access
so that's what it is so this all the l
s- l command looks like and a beautiful
version of this is what i showed you in
my slides right so this is it okay and
let me go on to the next slide and here
let's talk about setting file
permissions so right now the file
permissions are what you saw on my
screen right on my terminal
what are those formations but what does
I want to change permissions what will I
do
how will I execute that how would I do
that so that is done with the help of
chmod command ok so change models beige
is going to change the
access functions right our files and
directories so that's what chmod is
going to do and if you want to change
the owner of a particular file or
directory then you can use these CH own
okay sound is called so it means change
ownership right and if you want to
change the group ownership of that
particular file or directory then you
can use a CH group right the transfer
order change group so these are three
important ways that you can set
permissions to files and directories
right and how they do it what arguments
Allah gives that is what is this right
in this table I have that an example for
that
okay so supposing you want to change the
group ownership of a particular file
then you can just specify chmod you can
say G plus and then the permissions here
okay the pluses you know the operator
here is basically something that's you
know it's like a relation between
whether it's a user or a group or or
rather spread between that and the pump
shion's so this is like the operator or
the one that actually compares or
contrasts needs the functions and the
person in question right and then
followed by that we have the file in so
what this would do is so when we say G
plus WX then what it means is the file
the group belongs to right now that
group is going to additionally get the
right access and the execute access okay
so this particular file the group this
file belongs to that group is going to
get additional write access and execute
access so that's what this command means
now let's go to the next command okay
now here it says chmod U is equal to r
WX now when we say art of UX it means
that the user or the owner of that
particular file or directory that person
you are setting these functions as a
read write execute you're giving them
country functions full permissions
you're giving them okay that's what
equal to does okay if it's plus then
it's going to additionally give these
two permissions but if it's equal to
then it's going to set the pumps ins
it's going to override water was there
previously and it's going to replace it
with this all right
and here we saw adding functions but if
you want to remove permissions from
someone right then you can just use the
minus here and then - followed by
permissions so what this does is the
other people right neither the owner not
the people part of the group so the
other people those people you are
removing the right axis and the xq taxes
from those people so that's what Oh - WX
nice
and then you equals a WX is what I told
you right so you have the file name so
that's how we wrote and similarly if you
want to change the ownership of a
particular file then you can just use CH
on the username and for buy that will
come the file name so then when you hit
enter after that that particular file or
directory will have a new user right
you'll have a new owner and if you want
to also give them a new group you know
along with the username you wanna send
em to a secondary group then you can do
it by giving user name : group name
followed by the file name right and if
you want to change only the group name
then you can log in use the syntax where
you can say change group followed by
group name and then the file name the
file is in question so that's what it is
so let me just quickly run a
demonstration of that so here we are
back in my terminal and this is going to
clear this screen so and let me run the
LS command again so right now we have
the desktop folder right we have
download this is another folder now what
I'll do is I'll try to change
permissions for one of these folders so
let me say su row and I'm saying sudo
because these permissions they cannot be
just changed by any user so right now
I've logged in as a tracker okay and
being logged in as a director I cannot
assign myself extra privileges so only
the root user or the super user can do
it right and if I want to execute a
particular command as a super user as a
root user then I can I have to use this
pseudo right when I do sudo then it
means I'm running a command as a super
user and it will of course ask me a
password the administration or the
administrator password and I hit that
and then the command will be your
accepted okay so basically if I want to
change the permissions of the desktop
never before I do sudo let me just do an
LS - L and see what are the permissions
currently so if you look at desktop
right now the accesses
read write execute and then the group
has read does not have write access but
has x2 axis and the others they again
have read and execute okay now let me
change the ownership of desktop and let
me give the right access also to the
group of the file belongs to so if I
want to do that then I can run the
command chmod and I want to give
to the group right so I'm going to say
AG and I will use you operator plus and
then I'm going to say W okay and forward
by this will be the filename or
directoryname so in my case it's going
to be desktop right so when I do this
then the power permission would have
changed okay so I would have change the
permissions for the group where I'm
giving the group right access to this
particular directory so now if I again
do an LS - L then you will see that
there's a W over here okay so let me
just hit enter and as you can see we
have desktop over here and this time
even the group has read write and
execute functions all right only the
others only their function does not
change so that's how simple it is so
similarly you can also change the
ownership so right now desktop belongs
to Ed Rekha right what I can do is I can
create another folder or directory let's
say I want to create another folder
called ABCD okay so this is a new folder
am creating ABCD and make directory that
you see here this is what is the command
that is used to create a new directory
and when I hit enter then the new
directory is created now again if I - LS
- L so in this list you will see the new
folder called ABCD okay now this is what
is the user name this is the group name
all right now if I want to change the
user name for this particular folder
then I can just use the command okay
before that let me clear the screen okay
that means it's on the command again yes
and now to change the ownership I'm
going to run the command CH on now we
can specify the only in that I want to
change it to let's say I want to change
the ownership to root ok root is the
super user so I'm going to say root and
then followed by that I'll I can say the
file name right so I can say ABCD is
what I want to change so I hit enter
okay it says ownership I cannot change
the ownership because I am executing
this command as a Drakkar so for that
purpose let me execute the same command
as root success okay sudo and when I hit
end up it asks my password
okay so the pass was wrong but now which
work yes so now it has changed and let
me just run the LS - I'll come on again
and if you can see now the ownership has
students so similarly the same way the
user ownership and the group ownership
can also be changed using the same
command right which I discussed earlier
so that's about the file ownership right
so now getting back to my slides this is
something that's very simple file
permissions I even spoke about this
earlier so that's about five pounds okay
so the next topic is something that's
really important and that is something
thats related to file functions okay
that's called ECL right access control
list but before that let me give you a
scenario here okay I'll tell you how and
I are doing when we want to use easier
compared to file functions so we have a
person here that's saying how will I
give extra permission to only the
manager and the team lead right so you
have a team of say 10 people and if you
want to give extra permissions or access
to one other folder and directory hurry
to a manager or it will be the boss then
how would I do it I can of course do it
using file permissions but is that
feasible right so I have to do it every
time and if there are multiple teams and
have to do it for every single manager
and afterward every single time for a
different team lead right so now this is
something that is very repetitive this
task is going to get repetitive right so
as to change the Attic rate and you
won't have to create a new user right
give them that access by using the CH
own right but is there any alternative
yes of course there is right so now we
know that there's something called as
easy and so using ACL you can give
special privileges so in this case even
though this particular team lead and
manager will be part of the same group
okay so even though they'll be part of
the same group only these two people
will have extra permissions so in this
way you will not have you don't have to
create a new group for especially for
these two people now because the problem
here is at a later point of time when
the person ceases to exist from in that
team okay now let's say that I am
currently in a marketing team okay and
at this point of time I I want access to
this project or access with this
particular directory okay and I am
getting access to it but at the later
point of time when I'm leaving that 13
we're differently let's say I move into
operation see then at that point of time
the answer should make sure that I don't
have access to the marketing folder
right so I've taken away out of that
accident I'm given different access so
that is something the understated would
have to do and to an extent he could do
that by using file functions where you
create a different row panel ascending
that group but every time a different
person comes in Kennywood and getting of
special privileges every time you know
he can't not using file permissions but
using AC else you can okay and ACL here
it basically extends the functionalities
of files and directories and Asya
Stanford access control list okay and as
the definition says ratios all of you
received functions for any user or group
to any directory or file or disk
resource that basically means anything
that is there on your raw system right
anything that's accessible from the root
that it can be given extra functions can
be given to those from by using access
control lists okay and but before using
it right before we start executing ACL
there is one thing we need to enable
them okay we can enable a seal by
defining it in the root ET c FS tab file
okay so there's a file under this
directory and I'll open that file and
show you okay and so basically you have
to enable ACL by adding the ACL details
so this is the FS tab initially when
you've not enabled ACL the first time
when you're using it or by default it
would end over here so you'll have ext
for this busy defines the extension that
your system is running on and then
you'll have defaults okay followed by
that you'll have one one right so there
will be a big space here now if you want
to enable a till then you have to just
give a comma ACL right here okay when
you do that then your raw ACL is
basically enabled and then this snippet
as you can see I've got this access the
FS tab from the chat command okay I've
used a cat command to display whatever
is there in the FS tab okay
so yes and then you have the next line
that says in the option list under route
we need to add ACL after default
yeah so the thing which is important is
you can't is added everywhere and these
lines look pretty similar but where'd
you go to notice there is something
referring to route right so this means
that
these changes will be applied to the
root folder so anything that comes under
root to all those of files and folders
you can you know enable ACL okay so it's
important that you execute it on this
line slash dev slash Napa so this is
something that's common across all
distributions okay so some degrees here
would be different in different
distributions but the common thing is
you'll have to wear in the line which is
referring to root so in that line you
have to say comma ACL after default okay
and then once you're done with setting
the ACL it's you know it's not game over
okay cells not just going to be here
there what you go to do is you've got to
mount that particular directory okay
supposing in our case it is the root
directory which we are modifying right
there even a bit easier so in our case
we will be mounting our root directory
again so this basically means you are
you know rebooting the filesystem so
instead of having to restart your
computer all together you are just
remounting your files and file
permissions ok and when you've done that
then the change will be updated and then
when you run mount command then you will
have the rest of options where you can
see that ACL is enabled so let me just
do that by going to my terminal let me
just show you a practical demonstration
of that ok so right now we are in the
slash home slash into Rekha so the file
that we are talking about the SS tab
that is present under EDC in root so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
save VI root UT c FS tab ok that's hit
enter ok so this is the file that I
showed you in the BPD but the thing is
it's read-only right now that's because
I've logged in as ed Rekha right so let
me just run a sudo in front of it this
means that I am measuring this command
as a root user and now I will have the
access to modify this document right
so let me just hit end insert and as you
can see here we this was the line that I
was talking about right slash dev where
we are talking about the root directory
so here we have something called exe for
which defines the extension that we are
running and then we have defaults so
this is what after change so let me just
stop quickly come down and next to
defaults and it's going to say comma ACL
right and now let me just say : + WQ
stands for CM and exit so when I do this
basically my file is now updated ok
Myesha is enabled but after mount this
so how would I mount it by using the
command that I showed you earlier so
that is pseudo mount - OH remount all
right and forward by the directories are
you referring to in our case its root so
I'm going to save this and hit end up
all right so my mount is also successful
now if I run the mount command then you
can see that it is enabled over here
because otherwise if I would have ran
the mount command before updating it
then it would have just said RW and then
the black would have closed you okay but
now the extension has been increased to
rear its read/write and easier now right
so that's my function that I have now
and that's how the fields work all right
guys
any doubt here okay so I have a question
here from Rajesh and Rajesh is asking I
still don't get the actual need for ACL
okay also Rajesh Shawn let me help you
out there okay let me just use the
highlighter and explain this thing so
okay so before anything let me just
clear this screen off alright and now
let me highlight things here so the
thing is we have certain files and
directories right so let's call it file
one or let me just display this okay so
that it is file one this is file two
and this is five three okay and
currently there are a lot of for teens
okay let's say there are like 20 teams
right we have small small teams we have
the marketing team the operations team
the production team the deployment team
the development team reps numerous teams
support team and stuff but you want only
some people to access it supposing I
want only this team to access this file
or this folder okay I can not set file
dominance for that okay if I want only
the scene to access this file folder I
can do that using file permissions the
same thing can be done over here also
now comes the complicated part okay so
you can even you know ignore these two
people let me just take the example of
these three people okay
now these three teams this complete team
you get access to this this complete
team will get access to this okay this
complete team you get access to what is
here but what if you want the your
manager of this team or the team leader
of this team to also access what is
there over here in this folder
ah and similarly what if you want the
manager of this team or the head of the
same or the team lead to get access to
this particular folder or one folder
inside this folder right maybe just the
summary result so maybe they can get
access to how good the rival team is
performing okay so that kind of a file
might be present somewhere in this
directory okay so what if I want people
from here or here to just access that
one particular thing in spite of them
being in a different team so I don't
want to assign these people this
particular folder right it's a
complicated thing if I assign them this
then they'll get access to the entire
team's projects and that's not something
that I want okay that's how you know
that's ill-advised thing so at that
point of time I can use ACL so ACL is
the solution at that time where I can
just you know probably choose the
particular file that I want to use I can
reference that and I can assign it to
them specifically now what another I've
told you how the ACL is assigned now let
me go and run a command and show you how
the file permission is actually set
right okay so rajesh are you clear can I
erase the dry our diagram here yeah okay
so you're good so I'm just going to
raise this and okay all right so here we
are
and let me first create a file and show
you how the permissions are and how you
are enabling or extending the file
permissions so right now we are here
right so I think is going to navigate to
my documents folder alright so there's
nothing here either I'm going to do what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
new file called file one dot txt ok and
when I do this I'm inside your let me
hit enter and this right hand text hi
this is a warden and let me say welcome
to Linux training tutorial all right
and let me just exit so this is going to
be the contents so let me just verify
stuff here and I do this yes this is
what I typed and this what is there ok
now if I run an LS - L command right so
there's this one particular file that
I'm talking about it was greater this
time and this currently the owner here
has read write and execute access the
group has read write and execute but the
other people they don't have anything
other than read they cannot write or
execute ok now let me use the AC else to
update the commands over here ok to
update the functions but before I do
that let me just talk about the command
by going to the slides right so far
we've only enabled a CL so we're fully
enables the use of a CL ok
by doing the sudo remount and by showing
these options so the actual you know
assigning the permission is done by this
to come ask for it set facl and get a
facial okay so the syntax for setting is
set official - M and then you have the
user the particular user you're talking
about the that particular person's
username and the permissions and the
file name
ok the file in question similarly if you
want to view the existing functions then
you say get a facial and the file name
right and when you excute this commands
it'll look something like this alright
so here you are setting the Thompsons
and when you view the updated functions
and not this is what it looks like so it
would say the default file group and
owner okay
the users
it will usually say only user group and
mask and others okay but if you've
attended to somewhat specified then you
would have another line no referent only
that particular user so in this command
we use we set user 1 and giving them
readwrite access and that's what we've
done here so this particular user user 1
is getting read reading is cute
permissions all right so okay I have
another question from Gokul vocalist
asking what does management stand for
vocal - M here can M flag and the M flag
is basically used to refer to the fact
that we are assigning permissions to
files in directories right so this is
something that has to be given so you
don't control this thing this is part of
the command and this is not an option
this is something you have to give right
ok so let me just go back my terminal
quickly now I can use the command yet ok
but before I show you the yet facl and
the yet or before I use the Isetta
facial before that let me create more
users in my system ok what do you think
I want to do that because right now
there are there are just two users one s
be a root which is by default which is
the mother user the super user and then
there is a trigger so let me first
create another user by running the
command sudo user ad and let's say I
want to create a user for myself Vardhan
ok I do this I had end up password is
this ok so it says user one already
exists so let me just verify things by
going to administration users and groups
ok this is the password
okay so we have different users here
okay so we have a tracker there's a user
I'm using right now
Vardhan and ABC okay so this is a
different user so what I'll do is since
version is already present I will I will
assign that particular file to myself
okay right so let me just minimize this
for now I'm going to run our LS - L
command and basically button is not part
of the group okay that's because ed
rekha the parameter up is reka okay so
even here the group that the file
belongs to one minute here the file this
one belongs the file one belongs to a
trake okay group a to Rekha and the
username at Rekha so right now
since Vardhan is not part of that thing
I wouldn't have access to this file if I
was executing as vaartha okay since I'm
experience a trick I have access to it
so yep this is my group so what I'm
going to do is I also show you that I
can edit this file okay so I'm going to
say VI 500 txt and I'm going to say
insert
so here on K I can execute it as
user at raker all right so I'm saving it
now let me see it get facl and the file
name now as you can see the user that is
a myself so I can read write and execute
okay - mi self I am referring to the
fact that it said Rekha
okay the group I belong to can read
write the file and the other people can
only read so the use of bourbon comes
under the category of others okay so
let's say I want to execute one command
as button so for that I'm just going to
say su button so I'm going to take screw
commander's button okay you can see the
user name has changed what then now if I
try your you know Prague's you're
accessing this file I might be able to
do it so let me say CD or let's this
down so we have 500 txt here I'm going
to view this file VI file 1 dot txt okay
so this is the file that we created but
it says it's read-only okay and I cannot
enter anything here so it says warning
20-odd read-only files right so let me
just exit this as you can see I can't do
anything around helpless so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to quickly exit
get back as a Drakkar and let me clear
the screen and what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna set facl okay and I'm going to
do that as after execute that command as
root so I'm going to say sudo set facl -
M and the user that I am referring to
okay
the user is button okay and the pumps in
that I want him to gain and that is that
of read write and execute okay and the
file we are talking about is 500 txt so
when I hit enter
I've got the access by now so now let me
again switch user to bargain password is
this right now we have 500 XE and let me
view do VI and C now it doesn't say
warning order I know that I can only
read this file but now I can even
execute this file so big event or say
writing this file as
user
right so great quit Nonya there we go so
that's what we can do with the help of
four set official okay now let me just
check get a facial by you're running
this command now if you see earlier
there was only user and yeah the
readwrite access okay and then you add
that these details you didn't have this
so since I enabled the the facl right
since I enabled that by using this
command have forgotten initial function
for myself for report on user that's
read write execute and yeah the others
are pretty much the same so that's about
this topic so let me just clear the
screen and yeah I'm going to exit as
this user and back as Eureka now let me
go back my slides and go to the next
topic right so I hope it's all here
everyone I'm pretty sure that is the
case so moving on the next topic Cameron
talked about is that of fourchette
scripting so guys are shed scripting I
told you right earlier shell scripting
is really really important because this
is something that's the fundamental work
or task of our Linux administrator right
so as an administrator I can you know
specify four commands in my terminal so
you saw my terminal you know how it look
like you saw how wire you type commands
suppose I want to change one directory
then I can do a CD once or I want to go
to a particular path I do CD and then I
put the path and then I get to access
that file by doing VI and all these
things right but what if I could you
know run commands like that like
hundreds and thousands of those commands
you know in just one go and I don't have
to do that every single day right how
would I do it I can just write a script
right I can just write all those
commands in one file and execute that
particular file every single time so
what happens is when you execute that
particular file every single day then
those set of commands or operation will
be performed every single day without
you actually putting the same effort
right so you are saving on your effort
and your time by adding these kind of
shell scripts so let me just get started
with that and give you an introduction
to this right so as the definition says
a shell script or a shell program there
is a file containing a group of commands
that need to be executed
at the advantages one file containing
all the commands can be executed and the
thing to notice shell scripts are
interpreted and not compiled okay I'll
get back to this line okay and the first
end of every shell script is you have
hash tag exclamation mark space slash
bin slash bash okay now there's a reason
why we have these two important lines
okay now first of all does anybody here
you know and they have any doubts what
the shell is guys now I need out of
course ok so everyone's seems like
unanimously everyone who has said yeah
we're not sure about shell okay so yeah
Rajesh puja and medius guy is a team
so basically shell is the complan that's
gonna interact with your kernel okay so
we have our command line here okay
you have your command your command
interface or your terminal which where
you would be specifying the commands
right and how is this cannot be executed
how does the command the kernel or the
operating system execute that command
that's because of the shell so the shell
will basically take the commands and
that will in turn give it or forwarded
to the OS or the kernel okay it is in
fact over to the kernel the content will
do the rest so that's the role of for
shell so that's why we say it's called a
shell scripting where we write commands
for the shell and the shell will
interpret those commands for us and get
the job done by Arthi kernel okay I have
another question here and that is what
is bash from the image okay yeah that's
a very good question and that was
something that I want to answer right so
bash your refers to bone again shell
okay so the shell scripting is something
that is the need of the UNIX right so
back in the seventies man UNIX was
formed or found that was you know that
is all about a shell but however now
things have progressed and grown right
so now we have more than just one shell
we have a bash we have ash and all these
things so bash or refers to bourne-again
shell or bourne-again shell and boring
and shell is something that's used in
Linux okay so nuts is basically the
childhood for UNIX and we have the
basher and bashes like really better
than energy shell okay so if you want to
access the shell programs with just SH
but bash refers to the fact that you are
executing this script as a bone
again shell okay and yeah this is
basically the path where shell is
present so we have a number of four
shells so like a note you have - we have
- and all these things and we can also
find out what are the different commands
there so let me just work my terminal
and show you that okay instead of just
talking let me actually do some hands on
your to display the different our shell
type that your operating system supports
you can just run the command you know
chat /et c / shells now that's because
there is this file called shells okay so
file shell is a file and this has list
of all the different shells that your OS
supports so in my case my sandwich
supports the ones that are present over
here so I'm running a cat command which
will display the contents of this file
so when I hit enter I have all these
details so my system bitsy supports
shell bourne-again shell no login - tcsh
and CSS okay so all these things and if
you guys want to know where the shell is
present then you can just you know the
right Rick where it's present then you
can just say which okay which and then
the file if I say SH then it means that
it's present in this directory okay so
you also have the name of the directory
that's present here but you know the
technical way to find out the directory
well that's present is by saying which
and bash so my bash file is present in
this directory okay now what this
essentially means is if everyone is
acute any file or any shell script as
bash then I have to include this in the
first line of my file okay so that is
why you know there was a note that said
that this should be the first end in the
file right after ashtag and exclamation
so this is the reason because we are
different the directory that where the
shell is part of okay and similarly if I
say which and no login then it will show
the path where that is present so yeah
so that is the thing so let me just stop
here the screen
so guys let me just quickly go to my
slides again okay and get continued here
so I told me that every failure will
start like this and then you'll have the
file contents so let's take the example
of this hello world here so the file
contents is such that the first sign is
this and the second line is an echo
command and which says hello world and
if you execute that file okay this is
what the output is this is what I
suppose get and that's what you get and
you execute the your shell file - bash
for it by the name if it's a shell file
just as such then you can just give a
set space hello dot whatever the file
name is right and okay I have another
question here and he's asking why is the
file name Co - dot SH okay now that's
again a very good question
okay so Mohnish has asked me that
question Maurice Shaw so when we say dot
SS right it it's basically just the
extension of the file okay so it can be
anything we don't necessarily need to
give God a set so you can just say hello
okay but the thing is there are many
Visual Studio editors right we have the
visual studio editor and we have many
other editors for the in Lux write bed
you can do the coding or you can do the
typing so basically when you say SH
those editors recognize that this is a
patch file and they will do the graphics
and you know they will you know make the
file contents look good they'll make the
code look good otherwise you don't give
SH then there's no problem so
technically you're not gonna have any
problem but the thing is it's it says
that it's gonna be a normal file and you
know it's not going to be easy for you
to start coding there so that's the only
difference right so yeah so let me first
of all go to the shell create the first
file okay the first file for us so let
me go to my terminal and right now we
have file 1 dot txt now what I'm going
to say is let me create another file
called VI bash file dot Sh I'm going to
save it as dot SH because the editor
understand that it's a batch file and it
makes sure that it looks good right so I
just hit enter and yo ER and the first
line should be this okay and slash bin
slash bash is where my bags are create
so that's why I am using that line now
I'm just going to say
echo hello world right so let me just
save an exit and if I run this file okay
be a patch file or a search then I get a
hello world so that's it so that's as
simple as it is for executing a bash
file okay but I mean it's so simple but
I don't want to just end there I don't
want to disappoint you all because
there's something really good in store
right so I'm going to give you a little
more in depth details of shell scripting
okay now that is what I have in this
slide so in all UNIX shell scripting I'm
going to tell you what are the other
things that we can do right how will you
use variables and comments how you write
comments in your file okay I will talk
about how do you read inputs and then
how will you pass arguments to your file
you know from the command line when you
execute the patch file you can pass
arguments right so how will you do that
so different between reading inputs and
passing arguments is that reading inputs
would be you know when you're when
you've already run your command right
when you've executed your bash file then
it would prompt you for an input okay
now how will you give an input during
run time so that's what this is and
that's passing arguments in as the
difference between the two and then
finally the programming aspect how will
you use the for loop if loop if there is
and if LF okay so if Elif bitchy is a if
as if so that's what this stands for
okay so we're going to do all these
things in the shell scripting tutorial
so let me go back to my terminal I'll
clear the screen right now first and
foremost adding variables and comments
so let me first of all add comments and
show you how that is okay so I'm going
to edit this file again let's say insert
in any of our Eclipse IDE or in any C
programs it would basically be one
forward slash and asterisk right or just
two forward slashes and then that's a
comment so here it's even simpler just
give one hashtag and if you are write
anything as here then that basically
becomes a comment so it become a comment
and that line will not be executed this
is a comment and
this line will not be executed right so
let me just say this and when I execute
this batch file it again says hello
world that line was ignored completely
but let me show you the alternative okay
now in case I remove the a spectrum
you're then in this basically is
considered as a command right so it
would basically there's no syntax error
it doesn't make sense so it should you
know throw an error so let's see if that
happens and as you can see hello world
the first command is displayed but after
that it says as a you know error your
mind for this command not found because
it's not able to understand this it's on
a keyboard or anything so that's why so
that's about how we add commands right
so I'm going to say this so yeah that's
how you add command and net next comes
the concept of variables I'm pretty sure
you all know what variables are okay
because I'm mark and I'm guessing you
all are from programming background is
that the kid guy is everyone can I get a
yes from everyone otherwise I've got a
whole lot of things to do with this
session okay that's good you seems like
most of you are from there and you know
what variables are so what I'm going to
do is to the same file I'm going to add
a new variable and execute that variable
okay
so let's create a new variable called
and name okay and I'm going to say but
then I'm going to just type in my name
and shirokino duck commander that it
will call the variable here I'll say my
name is okay and here by using the
dollar symbol followed by the available
name I can just call the variable so
whatever stored it in here will be
displayed here okay so I'm just going to
exit this by saving it right and when I
execute this okay so again yeah there's
a error here that's because I have not
used echo right so how silly of me so we
need to use echo so that's the sound
output otherwise I'm going to happen so
yeah it's a very very silly mistake from
my start and yeah so my name is Donnie
right so now we'll execute this so as
you can see hello
my name is Vardhan you know it will be
clear even I got executed so similarly
what I can also do is I can add the any
number of variables right so let me add
another variable let me add like numbers
I can define X to be equal to 100 okay I
can do this okay no there won't be full
stop so I can say Y is equal to five
right and I can just save this or in
fact before saving it what you got to do
is ready what call it right so let's say
echo and dollar x then next line let's
say echo dollar Y but maybe for our
reference some to do something at all
let me add it here okay echoed dollar
why okay so first you I should be
displayed and then this should be
displayed so let me just save this and
bash it again so yeah first y got
executed Y available in Y is five was
the value sort and the variable X has
100 so I first called this and then I
call this so that's how it is died so
settled right so that's about variables
and comments okay
just clear the screen and next thing I
wanna show you here is uh how do you
execute power rather little how do you
pass arguments alright so you have your
shell and how will you pass arguments
your shell so for that let me just go
back to my batch file right now passing
your argument is basically you during
executing the command while you are
saying bash and exuding the files that
time you're specifying an argument so
what I can do is I can just hit enter
and I can write a command here okay
let's say echo the argument you entered
is and it's dollar one okay
now there's a reason why is dollar one
because up there is a numbering
convention okay so every time you add
arguments so they'll be numbered as 1 2
3 by default right so in this case we're
just naming the variables and we are
calling these variables by using the
dollar symbol but if you use a dollar
symbol followed by numbers then the
argument corresponding to that number
will be executed so now let me just hit
enter here and let me just save this ok
now what's going to happen is if I
execute this bash file along with an
argument now let's say hi and if I hit
enter then hi will be written in that
ends of that particular argument so
right instead of Scala 1 we have high
here so that's how it is and if I want
to spare you know send multiple
arguments here okay then I can do that
also I can do that by simply giving
dollar two dollar three and dollar four
because that'd be the convention that
I'll be going in right so I can just
follow what is that in this $1 $2 $3 for
and I can say the arguments you entered
our and then these okay so now I'm just
going to save and quit and if I execute
this along with a couple of you know
arguments so let's say hi my name is so
I'm a bit cleaner for arguments your end
each argument with a space in between
right blank space so when I'd end up I
have the argument or entered so hi my
name is so that's how you enter details
in so that is a awesome right that's
really cool right so that's the argument
spot okay so yeah but one thing which
you guys need to know is they start from
dollar one dollar two dollar three and
dollar 4 okay but we have something
called as dollar zero here and dollar
zero refers to the first argument and in
fact they are on the first arguments and
your first argument is your file name so
bash file dot SH is my first argument hi
is my second argument this is third this
is fourth and this is it so that's how
it is right so let me show you another
example of that I mean insert and say
the first argument is and if I give
taller and zero and when I say even quit
okay I have forgotten to put insert
there right like earlier so echo right
so now if I say I mean quit and if I
patch this then as you can see these are
available but along with that we have
the first argument that is Bashford so
this is the so this is what I meant is
the first argument these are the second
third and fourth arguments that we have
in our in our command
okay so that's about scripting here and
the next up is that of reading inputs so
how would you read inputs so to read
inputs there's an under a keyboard
called read so you've got to use that
inside your file right your bass Kirk so
let me just go in there and edit this
bash script itself so I'm going to say
insert and in the next line what I'm
going to do is I'm going to type in a
command such that I'm going to say echo
followed by the text that is the names
or the arguments you entered are okay
and after that I'm going to use a read
command over here and I'm going to say
read and I'm going to specify the
variables here I'm going to say name one
name to and name three so this basically
means it's going to capture three
different variables so these will be
counted as variables and I can use a
dollar symbol later to get back the
value stored in these variables right so
I can do that now to do that let me go
to the next next line and hit a echo
command again echo the names you entered
R and let me give dollar name one dollar
name two and dollar name three okay but
let me also comment these lines okay so
which I don't want them to be executed
so I wrote this alright so let me just
see I'm an accident when I exit it will
prompt me for you know three different
names after the thing is executed so
that time I have two entities are
details okay so I'm going to pass again
so here it's asking me for input write
the arguments you entered R so here if I
just say Gandhi and FDR and then let's
say Obama and if I hit enter I'm having
the other half the line the names you
entered are right the arguments are you
enter so that's what this is so this is
an underline the Eliminator dot
so let me just check what that line is
so yeah so that is this line in fact I
can even remove all these things I can
just make things even more easier for us
so you know I can just put this in
comments right I can just save this and
if I go back and just run this command
so this time I've removed the argument
so if I had to end out
Danya it says hello world my name is
Watson and then the two variables now
the it asked me for input right so now
why can this type and input like or say
the same let me again say Gandhi groups
so again let me now give FDR and then
let's say Obama okay now if I hit enter
then it says the names you enter are
right so I can even modify to make it
more sensible so instead of saying right
ends up saying echo and you know the
arguments are I should rather be
something like this it would be
something like please enter three names
right so now if I save it now it would
make more sense to you people correct it
says enter three names and now whatever
I type whether your type Gandhi and FDR
and Obama and yeah so that those so the
busy whatever I entered that word
capture and that got displayed over your
so this is more meaningful example right
so that's how we read inputs in shell
right you're in the shell scripts so
that's the end of this and then yeah so
now next is D F if then if else if I
left and the for loops right so for that
let's again try modifying that file okay
I'm just going to comment all these
things right so I'm gonna hit enter and
put a hashtag in front of everything
so that they don't get executed right
okay so I'll keep hold of for this right
so I can even hashtag this and this and
I'll enter my details here so I write my
f loop here so similar to any
programming language we have if
condition right so we have it in this
form we have the youth statement
followed by that we have the condition
if it's true or not then we'll have one
set of condition if not it will be false
so basically I'm going to use the same
variable name here okay so since it's
already there I'm just going to type in
the if command here if okay and I'm
gonna call the variable your if name
okay I can either give equal to or
bharden or instead I can also give - EQ
so I can do one of these things so I'll
give - EQ so this basically means it
refers to the equal flag okay so it
basically check if three deals here and
if the details over here are the same
okay now let me just close this bracket
and go to the next line if this one then
so this is important to write then okay
so we followed this format in - flipping
ok I'm going to say echo command is true
all right and every single if loop that
you open that ends with fi okay you need
to remember this yeah so the only thing
is that you know you can use either
equal to or rock just the equal to
symbol okay but the thing is if you're
using the equal flag it means you're
going to talk about in teachers in
specific okay but instead if you just
rather use equal to then it will verify
anything whether it's integer over the
string and in our case the string right
so we're going to use equal to okay or
if not we don't want to embed for this
condition then we can also use a not
equal to but in our case it's this so
let me just save this okay and let me
attend all right so now that we are here
let me execute the batch file and as you
can see the command row is verified okay
you know this worked out well and it's
true so yeah so that's how you excluded
command but let's take the condition of
if-else right so
case we've set it to be not equal to
what then okay so here we are giving
then this command to be executed so if
this is true then this will be execute
but if not what are we going to need
what are we going to execute to it for
that instant we go to insert another
command and that would be the else part
okay so the else part would be echo
command is false right so now I'm just
going to save this and exit and let's
execute this command and as you can see
now this time since we changed it to not
equal to right and the condition here
actually fails so that's why it says the
command is false so that's the thing and
yeah it's as simple as this guys but in
case you want to add another comment
here then you can do that too right so
let me just clear the screen and go back
and try executing and showing you
something okay so let me just say enter
so before an else part we can have an
Elif light so here
Elif
and then here I can have the command the
actual validation or I can say dollar is
name equal to and let's say we're done
right I'm going to close this and I'm
going to say then run the command echo
the same it should be command is true
right and else it should be the command
is false and then we end the file with
NFI right don't we so yep that's it so
if you guys are all here then I can just
strike during this this is the case guys
and it's waiting for your approval
because so the l if that you see here
right so the LF is basically just you
know how x2 dunder else of command so if
this is the case or else if this is the
case or else if this is the case so we
have three different connections here so
that's it so these are the if and else
important case you won't have another
validation here then you can just have
and hell if basically exists else and if
together so that's it so you should have
any problem here so ya see this time it
says the command is true because the
else was didn't get executed but the l
have got executed here correct so that's
the thing and yeah that's about the if
conditions and then that is before
condition that I want to talk about okay
the four loops how will you execute four
loops so let me just go back to the
batch file insert and I just want to
make all these as comments or rather let
me just do one thing let me create
another file okay let me say bash file
two dot Sh
okay I'm going to create another one and
I'm going to say this okay the /root
slash bin slash bash right and so now
I'm gonna enter the desert so the for
loop is going to be something like this
okay the syntax is something like this
so we have the for loop and then we have
the variable here supposing I want to
say in our gauge reads for I is equal to
this range of that range right so the
variables I so here also we can have the
same variable like but instead a simpler
syntax is for I in and after in I can
just say the inside flow of bracket I
going to the sequence let's see if I
want the numbers 110 to be executed then
I can just say one I have to dot over
there and then I can say
right so this sequence would basically
be executed so this is the variable
which would execute between this
sequence where I would assume the values
between this range right so that's what
I do and then after this when I assumes
this range what do you want to do you
can say it do and then we want to say
echo dollar right so basically for every
time I will assume a value we are
printing that value right and then we
can just give done and yeah so let me
just save and exit and let me say bash
and the file name file to write so if I
enter so the sequence is printed right
guys so awesome right now similarly if
you want to print from specified list
then you can do that also by instead of
you know giving flower brackets here you
can just specify the numbers that you
want so by which page though that's the
thing you need to note so three four and
five right so when I do this then I will
assume these different numbers and then
it will print whatever is written here
so this is going to save this and yeah
when I it backs this again so it
executed one of these right so yeah
that's what I want to show when that's
it about the for loop aspect also right
so let me just go back to my slides and
yeah so this is the four things that I
wanted to talk about with respect to
shell scripting the next topic that I'm
going to talk about is that of patch
files okay
so pass file is again a really really
important topic like it or you'll it's
about all these software updates and the
upgrades how you do it you know what is
the procedure you go to follow and all
these things right so basically whenever
there's a security effects or software
update available we can apply those
changes by using the patch file so the
patch file is the text file which
contains the differences between the two
versions of the same file so we'll have
the original version of the file right
the first executable which you have used
to install the software right and then
based on that you will have a reason one
you will have a newly updated software
so you'll have that executable so we
will have the latest version and the one
which you installed so using these two
you generate a difference file okay so
you use the difference once you've
generated the difference then you create
a patch file okay so that's what it says
your patch file is created by using the
reference command
yeah basically use the difference
command to generate this pacifier
because you'll have two different files
here you will have the original file
which you installed right which the
software which were installed with then
you have the reason updated the version
of that particular software and then you
have that version so basically to find
out the differences between the two we
use a difference command and when you
use the difference command the newly
updated changes or only the additional
ones will be noted down and using that
you can create the patch file okay so
without wasting much time let me just
quickly try and go ahead and show you
how a hello world is executed okay so
yeah but before that let me just talk
about the creation of a password so
first of all you create the difference
file then you have the two files okay so
these are the two files the - hello
files right one is the basic one the
other one has a little bit of a
difference right when you have these you
use the difference command to generate
this kind of a file alright so you will
generate the hello dot patch using the
difference command and then you patch
this particular command and then you can
just execute the command so you compile
the program here and you run the program
here so this is going to be a dot C
program right so I'm going to write
hello world in nasty language so it's
saved as a dot C but yeah I'll do a is
the executions all done by Linux right
so let me just start quickly go to my
terminal and create - hello walls okay
so here I'm going to say VI hello dot C
right and what I'm going to have inside
here is I'm just going to have hash
include yesterday IO dot H I'm going to
close this main all right here without
any return type and is going to say
printf
hello world right
and I'm just going to close this okay
it's going to end right here so I'm
going to save man exit so this is going
to be my first hello world program and
I'm going to say hello new dot see okay
now here I'm just going to use the same
things but with a little bit of a
difference so I'm just going to copy
what I wrote here okay and inside the
hello new I'm going to print I'm going
to paste this and additionally I want to
add something here so hash include
stdio.h and the difference is going to
be that so I'm going to say void and
inside this I can add underline saying
printf okay and I'm going to say it
patched file right and yes I'm going to
say new line and yeah and in fact I just
want required course is going to be the
last line okay so yeah there we go okay
we need to close this right fine so my
program is ready so this is the new past
file okay and this is here - hello new
so I'm just going to save an exit so I
have basically hello new and hello dot C
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create the value in the difference
command and the command is diff
- you and then the the first installed
fight okay the intro to alpha that's the
first file followed by the new file the
here is going to be hello - new okay so
this is going to be the first one the
install package and there's going to be
the new package right so now I can just
say patch okay to generate the patch
file now okay so there's a spelling
mistake there right so yeah let me just
remove that and hit enter yeah my patch
file is created now I can just view my
patch by single cat hello dot patch yeah
so no file because yeah the the name of
the password that I've created is that
of patch so I'm gonna say cat patch
because the difference has been created
and it's saved as patch so I had put a
hello dot patch and that's wrong right
so I mean is going to say cat and patch
someone executed and so the new file
that the difference command right what
it does is it generated the patch file
with such idiots where it's saying that
this was the commander was already there
this was the user was that was already
there something that is adding getting
added new and all these things so this
is not something need to worry about
but since the patch file is generated
the next thing that we need to do is we
need to run the patch command okay so
what we got to do is we go to work
say patch right and we got to use this
operator and called the five patch in
our case so it's patch this one okay and
if I hit enter it says patching file
hello dot C so by using this file your
patch file we've generated the hello dot
C words because the hello is the name of
the original file right so we've updated
the details in the original file right
we whatever difference was there that
was stored in the patch we use the patch
command to operate on the generated
patch file and we use that patch file to
update the existing hello dot C file so
now if you see the cat hello dot C right
when we do this then you would have the
updated or the newer code
correct so we have this bad fire command
right we have this patch file line right
this one and the int main void the
return type all these things that are in
our hello new dot C file not here so
that's how this got generated so that's
about patching files
right so it's a very simple example that
I show you of that of hello world but if
it's any big go software or program that
you are doing it then it's going to be
in a similar fashion it is that you need
to you know just follow the same
operations okay but to go a step further
let me just also dis compile the program
and show you right that's something that
I miss out on so first let me clear the
screen and yeah so the command is CC
hello dot C the O flat followed by that
and then say hello
so let's use dot slash hello so this is
what I've compiled it to combines with
your and I'm going to use this command
to run it okay so the compiled files
when I ran it to then it said hello
world so that's it guys so that's how
simple it is right so yeah we have a
hello world and then we have a patch
file right so that shows we are executed
the updated patch file right so our
software will get updated in a similar
fashion so we just follow the same
procedure we will update our software or
any package or anything right so this is
going to clear the screen and get back
my slides okay so we have one small
topic left to finish let me just quickly
go there and get completed with that so
networking in the next okay so that the
next topic and here we'll talk about SH
SFTP and SCP right so first of all SSH
SSH is used for accessing remote
machines right so guys whoever attended
my previous session you would remember
this so as that is a communication
protocol used for accessing remotely
located machines right and once
connected the commands can be executed
on remote machines so I even show you
that last time so I'll show you the
similar demonstration the same also okay
and if you want to enable SSH then you
go to use the update you know off the
inner download from the repository from
the next repository okay so the command
for that would be yum install OpenSSH
server right but by default most of the
distributions have the SSH connection so
in case you guys have promoted by you
know if you have removed on your own or
if it's not available then you can use
the open asset server command right so
you can use the yum install the OpenSSH
server and you can install it such but
however specific audience all then it is
well and good you can just start the SSH
service by running I don't check
conflict sshd on okay and then you got a
safe service sshd start and then you are
as that service will be up and running
okay you can just run it from root if
you're not going to run from root then
you can just say sudo which will execute
that command or from root alright it's
that simple and if you want to connect
to that particular remote machine so
these are the commands to start your
register
but if you want to connect to it then
you got to use this format so you got to
just say as I set forward by the
username at the rate the remote host
okay so this basically is the remote
user name would be the username that is
logged on to on that machine okay
supposing in my case I have logon with a
tracker as the username right so f2 our
if I'm accessing my machine from some
other remote machines an outside SH ed
Rekha at the rate the IP address okay so
the IP address of my particular machine
but in case if it's not a remote if it's
not a remote host so when we say the
motors it means that if basically both
the machines are in the same domain then
we don't need to give a Dre domain notes
because it would have the same IP
address right so drum an email address
and a pair so within this give as such
at username so that would be enough
correct so that's for basically
connecting to the remote machine and
when you hit this command you would be
inside the remote machines server so let
me just so let me just quickly go to the
next slide right so here we have other
details so in my demonstration I'll be
showing you one with that of virtual
machines okay so I will not be using so
since I don't have any physical machine
with me so I will be executing the
command on my virtual machine right I'll
be referring the other virtual machine
in my ghost box so I have two virtual
machines one called the master the other
called the slave so let me just go to my
versa talks so this is the master Bram
running I showed you a demo on this so
let me just go back to my VirtualBox and
start the slave machine okay so this
would take a couple of minutes to start
but in the meanwhile let me set up the
network okay so I'm just going to
connect to the internet so I'm just
going to click on this so so the thing
is that guys you want to make sure that
both your network ports are working okay
in my case I have at 1 and at 0 ok but
this is because I am using a wheel and I
have I'm connecting to another virtual
machine from my virtual box ok so that's
the reason I have got two of these but
in your case you would have only at 0
correct because you will be just
connected to the network and you will be
accessing the remote machine ok but in
case even if you are using a VM then you
will have 2 of these kind of connections
so one would be the network entity right
so in my case I have
one word h0 to be an ad where this would
help me connect to the internet and the
s-1 would help me connect to the other
version machine in my network correct in
my in my case it's in my own system in
my own virtual box the other much
virtual machine in my virtual box so it
would be at 1 and at 0 is basically the
one that connects me to the internet so
if in your case if you don't have if I
zero is down right then you want to be
connected to the Internet so that's a
thing right so I'll just help you out
there but before that let me just log in
here ok I hit enter now this is the
slave machine but in the meanwhile let
me just quickly go back to my host
machine and would have come to my home
directory and what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to check my IP SATA so I'm
going to run the command if conflict ok
now when I run this command what you can
see is my at 0 which is nothing but my
energy address which connects me to the
internet that has the IP address of 410
dot 0 dot
2.15 ok and alongside that my local
address that is my VM address is 192 dot
168 or 56.2 ok and similarly so the l1
is something you don't need to worry
about it comes by default but what you
need to be worried about is at 0 if your
access remote machine but if you are
accessing another way and then it's
going to be at 1 okay - so you will have
basically two network connections one
connecting to the internet one
connecting you to the other machines in
your network ok the other machine or the
other host so in here this is the IP
address so let me go to my same machine
and run the same command so I'm going to
say if conflict but before that let me
just make it a little bigger so I'm just
going to run the command if config ok to
check the IP status and ok so now it's
not showing any IP address here okay so
that's because my net is down probably
yep it is so I'm just going to connect
to my na T but however my local
addresses are shown so configure this to
101 6:02 36.2 ok so now let me just
clear the screen and run the command
again now yes I'm kinda to the internet
also and
this is my address locally okay this is
my network address so the kachoris both
my slave and my you know my master has
been connected to now what I got to do
is I got to change the IP address of one
of these machines okay so basically
since this is my network address so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to drop
this IP okay so to drop that IP I need
to use the command sudo IP add or delete
and specify the IP that you want to drop
it's a copy paste okay and give space
and after that say which F that's one
okay so now this basically you will drop
this IP address so when I hit enter okay
it asks for a password and yeah so my
IPS drop so now if I do an F conflict
then you would find that my 8th one
doesn't show any IP that's because I
dropped it so now let me add the new
address so the only change this n is
going to be the IP that I want to change
it to I'm going to say 3/24 and I'm
gonna insert delete it's going to be add
ok so this time I'm going to add this as
the IP address okay so I'm going to end
up so if I run if config now as you can
see my IP address has been updated to
this so basically my IP address for
slave asset and for my master is also
set ok so the master has this has the IP
so let me just clear the screen and what
I'm going to do is I need to go to my ET
c / hosts file okay so I'm gonna say VI
/ v DC / hosts
okay now the thing is that I've already
set the IP address of the master to one
or two and one or three over here okay
now I got to change this now since my
master has a IP address value of 56.2
I'm going to change it to two here and
since leave as three that's what I've
set in my slave machine right so I'm
going to change it to these okay I'm
going to save this and okay so seems
like I've not logged in as Orion only
because this is something that can be
only appeared by the root so I'm going
to execute the same command as pseudo
and this is the password and yeah now
let me change these things okay so this
is the IP of the master this is the IP
of the slave okay and save and quit so
yeah my host file has been changed here
and similarly I have to go here I'm
going to clear the screen I need a
change to PDC slash posts okay it's not
change directory it's VI and it will be
executed as pseudo so okay so here it's
already set to be one ninety two dot one
sixty eight dot 56.2 so again the master
that was the previous machine that is -
and this is my slave machine this is set
to three so I don't need to make any
changes here when I quit so if you guys
want to understand again so what I did
is I have my master machine as up giving
it one IP address and the same machine
I've given it the other IP address okay
so in my case what I've done right now
is I've given them 56.2 and 56.3 okay
now now that I've done this I can just
straightaway run the command node to
access the machine
now since the IP address for the master
has been set 2.2 in my master and 2.3 in
my slave I can access the slave from
this IP address right I can now use this
IP address from my master machine so
this is currently am in the master
machine so what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna you know do a CH to this
particular IP address and I don't need
to in fact give the IP address because I
have save it with the name of slave
nodes like a variable so if I just put a
CH and
but I'd say then we connect me here so
but indirectly I can even not type in
the IP address so that's completely my
way so I can do anything so if I just
say SSH and if I just say slaves then I
would connect to that particular IP
address that is a physics door 3 okay
that's fine
that's just a warning and yes so I've
connected now so right now I'm so you
notice that regard low close it's
actually referring to the fact that I'm
logged in into the slave ok so last time
I logged in was on this day so to verify
if I'm connected to the slave of the
master what I can do is I can check the
documents right so present working
directory I'm right now in a Drakkar
folder so let me just CD to documents ok
LS so there are no commands here ok and
let me verify that by going to the
slaves this is my slave machine I'm
going to attract a home and one
documents and you can see that there is
no documents here right so there are
absolutely no documents here so that's
the thing so that's the connection that
means that my my masters connected to
sleep and to prove it further what I can
do is I can show you this the Masters
Documents folder ok the documents folder
of master has all these files it has the
ones which I created earlier ok but had
it been referring to the master then it
would have displayed everything right
100 LS that didn't happen so this means
that add to the slaves so that's the
thing and similarly if you want to just
exit from the connection then you can
just type in the command exit ok but
however you can just connect your master
on this way and smelly even the slave
they I can connect to the master by just
saying
SSH master right so now I'll show you
how that is done so I'll just go here
and I'm going to say SSH master that's
because the EGC host file has the IP
address stored here the master dot -
right so it should connect your let's
ask the password is the password here
you go and the login and yes so now if I
change directory to
documents and if I do LS I'll find the
view of the files I created earlier so
this is what I'm doing from the slave
machine so this is out as that is done
and in our case I've just accessing
another you know VM in my own system but
however if in real case not here you can
do the same thing using the same
commands you can do you can access any
machine that's located you know in the
different continent or in a different
place altogether right so that is how
SSH works so it's pretty simple it's
pretty fun to work and I'm pretty sure
you're you guys are having fun and you
guys having fun yeah I'm hoping for a
couple of yes from you people okay so
anyways in the meanwhile I'll just go on
to the next topic have shown you what s
is a transfer and now comes SFTP okay so
SFTP something that stands for secure
File Transfer Protocol okay and this is
for transferring files now the thing
with SS is that we use the SS to connect
to the remote machine right we connected
there and we can execute commands over
there but problem is we cannot transfer
files okay it cannot be used for
downloading or uploading files from the
remote machine so that's the limitation
with SSH
but in this of this we have something
called as the secure File Transfer
Protocol
okay and we can use the SFTP for
transferring these files right it's not
see menu will mistake it to be an
extension of for FTP
okay so FTPS is an extension to ftp but
SFTP has nothing to do with ftp okay so
this is another protocol that's on its
own which is something graded to essa -
okay so this stands for secure File
Transfer Protocol and we can transfer
files using this protocol so again to
run this protocol you can just use it by
giving this command SFTP and the IP
address okay so the again it's going to
be the same format this is the user name
at the rate hostname okay but in my case
I'm this in the same domain so I don't
need to give the entire thing I can just
give the IP address and in place of the
IP address I can just give master
because in my EDC slash host file a bus
saved the slaves and the master IP
address over there so from the master
can just give SFTP
slaves and then I'll connect to the same
machine and from the same if I do the
other way I will just come that so
I hit enter I will get this kind of
command and I can execute commands that
right so I can just show you that so I'm
just want to go back to my terminal it's
a man my master right now right so I'm
just going to give the command SFTP and
I say slave because I am right now with
the master and yeah connecting to slaves
and the password is this there you go
and now event or SFTP okay now when I do
LS am again okay so again now I'm in my
slave machine okay
and currently I'm seems like I'm inside
the home slash at a record directory so
my slave of course let me just open my
slave and show you that so this is my
home so I should record directly where I
have all these files and folders so this
is what I'm able to see right now
supposing I want to see what is the
present working directory Nariman I can
also do that by running PWD okay so it
says the remote working directory right
I am currently in the home slash ed
Rekha correct so similarly the other
thing is if you want to also see the
present working directory of your own
machine okay so this is the remote
machines directory so if you want to see
the working directory of your machine of
the host itself not the remote host but
the horse which are then you can do that
by appending L before the command so we
ran PWD that time this time let's run
our PWD and if I go enter it says local
working directory okay so even now I'm
here so yeah so if I just say L and CD
documents okay
I'll enter the Documents folder so if I
again say L and LS I'll have a list of
all the files that I created earlier so
this is what the demo I showed you
because I created all these from my
local machine but if I just run LS I'm
referring to the fact that I am talking
about the sleigh via the remote host
and if I say Siri ends up saying L C D
Phi G say Siri and documents
okay so there's wrong spelling there
right so
documents so yes I mean the documents
folder of of my hosts or if I just run
LS you can see that there are no files
over there so that is what I want to
show right LCD and similarly for every
single command you just need to append
the L before the actual command okay
whether it's a change directory or
present print working directory or
anything for that matter of fact and
here comes the important part the whole
topic of using SFTP right no reason
anybody would use SFTP is because of the
fact that we can download files correct
of course we cannot download directories
here we can download files and for
downloading a file it's a simple command
just say get the file name and the path
name right so when you say get you're
just referring the the path of the file
in your remote host okay you are saying
get this file from this path okay
basically you're also mentioning where
you want to store it right so this is
the destination is the source and this
is the destination and similarly if you
want to upload files to the remote host
then you can say put file name and path
name so that's how it is right so yeah
so let me just execute this command and
show you once right so currently this is
my slave and doesn't seem like I have
any other file other than this so Derby
dot log is the one file that I have in
my ed Rekha folder right so I'm going to
go here and I'm going to say print
present working directory it says this
I'm gonna come back and say LS so I have
Derby Autolog so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to pull this command okay so
I'm going to clear the screen and run
that command again and yes I'm going to
pull this file right so I'm going to say
get the B dot log and we're gonna store
it in my okay so that the Derby dot log
here also so in fact what I can do is I
can
stored on my desktop here right so
there's no double your log over here so
I can just say desktop because I'm
currently ok now before that I need to
verify where I am so in my local
directory so I'm gonna say local PWD so
our cam and document so that's good I
did that so when I go back I'm now in my
okay so I made a mistake there so what I
should have done is I just have done L
CD cocaine so l pw would bring me back
to home ed Rekha and I need to CD space
okay okay so this means now we're all in
fine okay so I'm in my home directory
now what I'm going to do is I'm news
going against quickly clear the screen
do an LS we have Darby dot log so I'm
going to say get Darby dot log and I'm
gonna store it in my desktop right
fetching and yes it's complete 100% so
by that I can just minimize this and
check and see the wot log file is
downloaded from slave from the save I
downloaded to the master so the same way
you can just use the put command right
but it's a pretty simple things what I
want to waste your time we are running
short of time already so I'm just want
to exit this okay and I'm going to talk
about SCP okay now when I talk about
that let me show you the let me talk
about the limitations there so I'm just
gonna yes so we're already out here so
I'm gonna clear the screen let me go
back to my slides so this is where we
were we've run the get command and the
put command so similarly for the put
command also used to specify the
filename and the path name right so put
whatever the wherever the file is in
your system local system you choose the
file name with the path and then the
destination so that's it so you'll be
fine when you run the command and now
coming to the next topic that is SCP so
the previous one was SFTP where I should
have data for transferring files but SCP
is for transferring folders and
directories SFTP cannot be used for
transferring folders in directories
right and SCP the protocol used for this
purpose
whether it's directories or folders so
similarly the syntax that you go to note
here is that the source comes first and
the second comes destination okay and
the command put on a CD is this SCP -
our remote host : path name and you know
basically the path name for wherever you
want to download a directory from right
so the remote host basically refers to
the fact that it is the IP address so if
you have the remote address if you have
the IP address : path name then it means
you're pulling the directory you're
first going to this directory okay okay
you're downloading something and then
you're downloading it to this path in
your host okay but if you have the path
name first and then if you have the
remote host : path name so that is
nothing but IP address : path name this
means that you are using the SCP to
upload a file from your path to the
remote host correct so it all depends on
where the remote hoses so that's why the
syntax is important over here because
ever comes first right the syntax
according to syntax if the IPS comes
first that means you're downloading it
and if the syntax comes or a second that
the second argument then it means you're
uploading a directory so let me again
this quickly quickly go to the terminal
okay and let me just run a PWD okay so
let me change record documents and we
have all these things here right fine
now I'm going to run the command FCB - R
and I'm gonna refer slave ok slave and
enslaved which is the directory that I
want to go to that means what do I want
download from the slave first for let me
figure that out supposing I want to
download the okay so that is basically
nothing much here so what I'm going to
do is let me just start download the
this music folder itself okay so I'm
just going to create a random failure
create document empty file okay I'm
going to name it this dot txt okay so
basically it's empty
okay so there's going to be nothing here
gonna close this but there's going to be
a file inside my music folder so what
I'm going to do is I'll go to my master
I'll say slave and the path is slash
home slash at rekha slash music okay so
do the path and
wherever I want to earn my host I wanna
just stored and desktop okay so I don't
want to do this so let's hit enter it
asks for a password
great so this is the file and folder
this is the file that I downloaded so
that's hundred-person completed now let
me just go back to my master
okay so I seemed like that an issue here
right so
I doesn't seem to have downward so I
think the mistake I did was I didn't
specify the entire path so that's what I
should have done so what I'm going to do
that I'm just going to enter the entire
path anyways slash home slash ed wake up
slash desktop okay who did some spelling
mistake here okay now if I hit enter
and if I go back now you can see that
the music folder is created correct so
music and the files inside that has also
been downloaded so that's what the SCP
command does guys so I had made a
mistake that I had not specified the
path so guys yeah remember you will need
to specify the entire path if you wanted
to be downloaded right so that's the
thing and again so let me show you how
to put it right if I want to upload it
to the to the remote host
then again the command is pretty similar
it is that you will have it the other
way around so I'm just going to copy
this or let me just write it all over
again right so just to omit any
confusion so the command is a CT - art
and then to put your first specify the
path the source of that file okay and
the source is in your directory right in
your host so what do I want on transfer
let's go to Erica home and to something
ABCD is an empty folder so document is
there okay so in document have quite a
few files and folders so what I'll do is
I will transfer documents this folder
itself to my remote host so I'm going to
save slash home slash a Drakkar slash
documents right so I'm going to transfer
this do my slave and my this D basically
this will capture the IP address of my
slave and the path I want stored in is a
slash
hoom /a Drakkar / let's say i want to
store it and I want to certain downloads
folder okay so let me go back to my
master machine and say D s okay so when
I tend to a task to the password there
you go and yes all the files associated
with that all the files inside that
Documents folder has also been
downloaded right so let's verify that by
going here and yes so this was the
Documents folder downloads folder and we
have that whole entire set of you know
document that I created right so
everything's area so that's how it is
guys so that's how ICP works right so
these are simple examples of how things
are done okay so when you're working in
read an environment you'll have a lot of
such work you love you'll be working on
these things continuously so yeah let me
just get back to the slides because I've
come to an end with that aspect so there
is that the end of the session then
right so I'd shown you all these things
during my session I show you how file
permissions and ACLs work right I show
you how to set file permissions and then
how ACL extend the file permissions and
then I thought about a shell scripting
I'd show you some of the shell scripting
techniques here I show you how to use
variables in comments how to use the for
loop a flow the if-else or the if Elif
loops and then I show you that with
those things and then I spoke about
passing in the nuts so patching I took a
very simple example of hello world and
if at any offer that you want to work on
this you've got to assume nothing right
so that's patching and then finally we
have the SSH SFTP and the SCP right so
yeah these are the three different no
networking protocols that we have we
follow which is highly preferable in
Linux and I showed you that access for
accessing the remote host SFTP for
downloading and uploading files and SCP
for downloading directories and folders
so yeah seems like all of you are happy
I've actually got a couple of comments
saying thanks a lot over then so yes
guys thank you because it was pretty
good that you know starting of the
webinar it was pretty active we were
asking questions you are attentive I
really liked it and even during the
later half of the webinar I hope that
you people understood everything
you wonder networking techniques the
patching and stuff for that right so
yeah I think probably a little again
during some other time maybe
the next Linux webinar we'll meet each
other another then just take care guys
all right so yeah bye-bye thank you
thank you for being in session all the
best
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
and you can comment any of your doubts
and queries and we will reply to them at
the earliest to look out for more videos
