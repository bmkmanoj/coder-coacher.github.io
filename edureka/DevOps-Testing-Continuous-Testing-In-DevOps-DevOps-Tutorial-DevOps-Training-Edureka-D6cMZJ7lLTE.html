name is Barden and on behalf of an Rekha
I welcome you all to this webinar on
continuous testing in divorce so I'm
aware that every one of you are already
aware of what divorces am known to beat
around the bush and I'm gonna
straightaway get to our main topic that
is continuous testing right I'm going to
talk about what exactly is continuous
testing okay so that will be the source
topic and then I'll get on on the topic
that is what are the ways testing types
in DevOps and then the third topic I
will talk about are the wheelies tools
which we use for continuous testing okay
and then finally I will be using these
four tools and showing you how to
integrate them together to actually
achieve continuous testing okay guys so
do you all have any doubts on this
agenda slide if you have any queries
please put them but I'm gonna anyways
move forward okay so this is our first
topic that is continuous testing in
DevOps okay now a lot of people have
this basic confusion that is what is the
difference between continuous testing
and automation testing right let's start
with automation testing so automation
testing is basically automating the
execution of test cases right so you
have a lot of test cases and basically
automating the execution of these test
cases is what a scoreless automation
testing and continuous testing is
basically the continuous automation of
these tasks or of these test cases so
you have a lot of test cases not only
are they being automated continuously
but even this automation is scheduled or
is actually continuously automated right
and constantly there will be tools which
will be monitoring the source code and
whenever any problem comes up that will
be thrown to the developer as a bug
so guys any doubt here between the DOE
30 simple right
and if you guys have any doubts please
ask me I'll figure it out again okay so
seems like all are clear and going ahead
as you people know this is the DevOps
lifecycle and continuous testing falls
under the build test and the release
phases of our lifecycle okay these are
the three different stages where this
continuous testing revolves around okay
now let me go to the next slide okay so
now that you know the different stages
now let's see what are the different
tools which are used now the different
tools which are used over these
different stages are nothing but maven
selenium tests Angie and Jenkins okay
now before I explain this slide and I
tell you what each of these tools do let
me go to another topic which is nothing
but different testing types okay I'll
finish this topic and then I'll get back
to those different tools so first of all
Pete DevOps or be it agile or scrum the
different testing types are going to be
the same okay but in DevOps
these are just some of the few common
testing types of course there are a lot
of other testing types but these are the
most common and these are what is mostly
used in the box so starting off with
functional testing so functional testing
is basically to ensure that your
applications entire functionality is
delivered as per the requirement given
by the customer or the client right the
entire feature set is tested over here
and the next topic is unit testing the
unit testing is basically breaking your
entire your entire code into smaller
units or components and then testing
them separately individually you test
each and every single components or
units and that's why it's called a unit
testing okay the third is load testing
load testing is basically done to figure
out how much load your system can take
with optimal performance okay so your
code or whatever wherever it's being run
on what is the maximum load it can take
while performing optimal performance
right without becoming slow or becoming
unresponsive if your website can not
be able to take any more load so those
are the different things that you think
about and stress testing is another very
important testing type and the
difference between stress testing and
load testing is very subtle but
important and the difference between the
two is that stress testing is basically
done to figure out what exactly is the
threshold and it's basically to ensure
that okay beyond this you cannot or your
systems cannot take this load so you
will have to come up with alternate
measures right so that is what is stress
testing and then you have integration
testing
now integration testing is basically to
get these smaller units or components
integrated with each other and then
checking how is the output of the
product or the software application
together they are integrated and then
checked so it's usually done with unit
testing and then finally you have a
regression testing now regression
testing is basically to ensure that your
application is running perfectly and
there is no bug in your code even when
there's a small feature set that has
been added so even if you have added a
few or few features and a few lines of
code and you're testing the entire
application to make sure that this is
not affecting anything else okay so
these are the different testing types
and the most common ones which are used
in DevOps
so moving ahead let me go back to that
side which I promised you I would
explain okay so these are the four most
commonly used tools there are a few more
tools in the market but however these
are the most popular and they are the
most useful starting with maven right so
maven is used for building your project
selenium is used for actually testing
your webpage we have web application
test Angie helps selenium in a lot of
ways and especially for report
management and test case management by
creating tests annotations okay and
Jenkins is actually the one that's
holding the entire DevOps structure
where in what output comes from using of
these tools that an action could be
taken over on that so Jenkins can choose
whether to deploy the application or the
code to production or to staging server
or wherever needed okay if the test case
fails then it might
not even deployed so things like that is
what Jenkins can do so let me go into
detail and talk about each of these
tools first let's start off with maven
okay so maven is a brilliant tool to
handle your entire project structure so
you will have a maven XML file in which
you can specify what are the different
Java classes which you want to execute
and in which package or directory they
are stored you can mention those things
in that XML file along with what
dependencies are needed for executing
that code let's take my own example here
my code is going to be a selenium code
with test entry then I can specify in my
palm dot XML file of maven that I want
these dependencies downloaded and
installed okay and then from the
repository automatically will get
downloaded and installed that's it so
you don't have any worry and that way
you have a lot of flexibility because
you'll have a lot of jar files for
selenium you'll have a lot of jar files
for tests and G and you don't have to
manually down on any of them you can
just specify what you want to download
in the dependencies part in your maven
form not XML file and Jenkins will
basically execute this pom dot XML file
right so that's what maven does okay now
let me go to the next side and talk
about selenium and more detail I'm
pretty sure you all know this but just
FYI that selenium webdriver is the most
important tool in testing basically
because this does the actual web testing
right it goes to their pages and it
looks for certain web elements and
checks if they are operating and
functioning the right way so that's what
selenium does but it has a few drawbacks
so even though it can do the most
important aspect there are a few
shortcomings of it and they are test
case management and report deliberation
okay now to overcome these two problems
we are using test energy along with
selenium so in the industry you will
always find a selenium being used with
either a unit or yen unit or tests
energy or something else
right because alone selenium is not that
powerful so even though it is the Hulk
it needs other tools and that's what
tests Angie does so let's go ahead and
now see what exactly is test energy
kind of Lamentations and overcomes tess
energy overcomes selenium test case
management limitation by involving
something called as test annotations so
with test annotations your entire code
can be broken down into smaller pieces
of code each being alerted with a test
case so that way you will be executing
smaller test cases and you will get to
know which test case has a bug so you'll
accurately know okay this is the small
part or the small functionality where
there is a bug and you can fix it and
you can keep unit testing and regression
testing after that and besides this test
Angie also lets you generate good report
so that's the thing with our test injury
and whites use with selenium okay now
going forward we have the final tool
which is nothing but Jenkins so in your
entire day ops lifecycle the tool or the
part which holds the entire structure is
the continuous integration tool or CI
tool as we call it often so the CI told
rich VI using is Jenkins okay and
Jenkins is easily the best tool in the
market you have a couple of others you
have Hudson you have bamboo and we have
a few more but however nothing comes as
close to gen Ed's and Jenkins is also my
personal favorite DevOps tool but the
drawback with Jenkins is that there's
not enough documentation there are
probably so many plugins right plug-ins
for almost everything but the problem is
documentation it's not well done but
otherwise Jenkins is the best tool and
that's why it's my favorite okay so I
think I'm spoken enough let's get to the
next topic and let's get started with
our demonstration ok what I'm going to
do is I'm going to use these four tools
to achieve continuous testing and what I
will be doing is I will be using maven
to create one XML file and in that XML
file I will invoke my dependencies I
will invoke selenium and I will invoke
court s energy and I will get then to
test a webpage for me
okay and when that is a pass or a fail
Jenkins will take care and deploy it
wherever it wants to okay so about the
post build steps I am now going to talk
about in this session
I'm going to only talk about what a
Jenkins does when a test case passes or
fails when it passes it can do something
else or when it rains it can report the
news back to the developer or anyone
else okay so that's going to be my
demonstration and for that let me get
started and first of all I want to open
my Eclipse IDE okay so guys this is
eclipse so this is where I script my
code I can write my selenium code I can
write it with test energy so that I can
also get executed through maven okay
and once I can execute it through me and
then I know that my code is gonna run
and when I do it here it's basically
automation testing and when I do it with
Jenkins it becomes continuous testing
okay so now that you people know that
these four tools and what role they play
so if you're new and you don't have any
of these software's then you can
download them from the internet straight
away because all are open source and
free so you can just go to your browser
and you can download all of these so you
can just save download maven okay and
when you say that the first thing that
comes up me Mendota patch it out all so
you can just go in here and download the
meme and package that you want okay so
my internet seems to be a little slow
today so yeah so this is the site and if
you want to download Apache maven for
Windows then you can download it from
here okay the zip file if you're on
deluxe or UNIX then you can probably
download the tar file okay so that is
how you easily download maven the next
dependency which you have to download is
selenium right so let's say selenium
download when you type it again the
first link selenium HQ dot org just go
in here and you will get the link to
download selenium the roll latest
versions three point eight point one but
if possible try using selenium three
point three point three right because
that's the latest stable version and
that's what even I am using personally
and once you have downloaded selenium
the next one that you have to use is
test energy right so you don't need to
download it through the internet like
this
browser you can just specify the
different dependencies and the libraries
where its present in selenium itself and
through that you will get it downloaded
okay no worries
so saw tool wise the next should be
after who download is Jenkins so again
let's just say download Jenkins okay and
when you were to enter the first our
link again download Jenkins so from here
you can download Jenkins also meant you
have downloaded all these things you
have to ensure that you set your Java
path okay but before that if you don't
have job on your system so just type in
download Java
and you can you can download it easily
okay so just go to our actors official
website Java SE runtime environment and
from here you can download the latest
Java version ok so the version is nine
point zero point four however I have
used Java 8 so it's fine if you're using
one point nine or one point eight and
once you've done with downloading Java
you have a simple task of setting the
class path and the animate variables
okay you have to do this for mimin you
have to do it for java itself and you
have to also do it for Jenkins okay so
how do we do it it's again simple just
go to my computer right click properties
you get advanced system settings right
so click on this and from here go to
environment variables okay and over here
you have to specify the path for Java
whoo and Mayman home so this is the path
where my Java is present okay and
similarly if you download Mayman then
you have to specify the path of maven
right the root directory of me so that's
what I have a specified here and when
you've done that you have to come down
here to system variables and system
variables you will find path so over
here you have to again set that same
path slash bin ok as you can see here
slash bin folder inside the apache maven
root directory is where you have to
specify over here and now you have to do
the same for java also so my java path
is set over here correct so these are
the things which you have to do to
ensure they are working but however if
you have done it well and good so I
don't want to waste any time let me
continue with my session and go back to
eclipse okay so from eclipse let's get
started
ok so the first thing I have to do is
create a maven project because my Java
code or my selenium code will be inside
that project right so the structure if
we want to maintain then we have to
first go to file so go to project under
our new project and over here from the
options choose name and project ok under
the main will drop down click on next
and here let's just say I want to create
a simple project I'm checking on that
box
next so here we gotta enter two details
one is group ID and the others artifact
ID so let's just say selenium dot maven
dot test injury okay and again artifact
are you willing to give something
similar so let's say maven dot selenium
dot test and read OTT Jenkins okay so
let this be our artifact ID and what
these two are I will explain later
and then let's give a name to this and
let's say my project name is in rake our
demo and I'm going to say finish and as
you can see over here there's a new
project directory that's created right
maven dot selenium dot test and Z dot
Jenkins so if I click on this drop down
you can see that I already have a number
of items already over here one of them
is the form dot XML file okay so this
XML file is the file I was talking about
and we have a few other packages over
here we have SRC main job we have SRC
million resources we have SRC tests Java
and SRC test resources so these are
project directories again and over here
I can create multiple packages and
multiple Java classes inside those
packages okay I can do that so first of
all let's write our selenium code okay
and figure out what we want to actually
test
so let me write a small code for that
purpose so for that let's just go to SRC
main Java and I'm gonna click on new and
say class to create a new class I'm
going to give the name
okay let's say little Rekha demo okay
and I'm gonna say finish so first of all
let's get started with writing our
selenium code and figure out what we
want to actually test and not to do that
we have to go to SRC test Java folder
and over here let's create a new Java
program okay I'm going to say new and
I'm going to say class let me give the
name red record demo and then let's say
finish okay so you have a simple program
that's created now what we have to do
here is so here let me write a method
let's say public void and let me give
the name test okay so this is going to
have the add the rate annotation okay
and when I give the add rate test
annotation I'm basically making this a
test and retest okay by saying add test
as you library I make it a test as we
test okay gonna import test injury okay
perfect so over here in my public void
test let's again keep it simple let's
say system dot out dot println and here
let's say hi this is Walden from a
Eureka and after this let me go and go
to some web browser and perform some
tests now if I want to perform some
operation then I have to first of all
set my browser driver correct so let me
do that let me say system dot set
property yes it's right here system dot
set property and I'm going to say what
is it which is the browser driver I am
going to use so it's going to be the
driver dot chrome dot driver correct so
this we need to of course give it a
double quotes and where is my
chromedriver present the path after
specified so my chrome driver is present
in my downloads folder okay so I'm gonna
say so this is my documents when we were
down you know is I'm gonna copy this and
I'm gonna paste it over here
just that you have to note to give to
slashes everywhere
so users downloads and
chromedriver dot exe because this is the
name of Mike browser driver okay now
after this the next thing that we have
to do is I have to invoke an object from
my browser driver right so let's say web
driver driver is equal to new
driver all right okay so at this point
of time it's throwing an error because
the selenium dependencies and my test
engine dependencies are not already
present inside this project correct so
this will be fixed when I write the Palm
D'Or XML file okay so over here I'll
specify the dependencies but till then
remember that we can go forward and
write our entire code so here I have to
say which website I want to test right
so let me go over here and show you
which the upset on which I want to do
the testing so there's this page called
new tools dot demo or calm okay so this
is a good page to test so I'm going to
copy this URL and I'm going to paste it
here inside Dravid what get okay
I'm gonna place this and here let's say
I want to verify the page title so what
can I do I have the assert function for
that right so I can use assert dot a set
equals okay but or dot test NV dot
assert and you'd have to say what is the
expected title correct so how will I get
the page title from here I can add
another line there saying driver dot get
title okay so this gets the page title
of the current web page which the
browser drivers are on but this has to
be stored in a variable right so let's
say string title is equal to gravity a
title so this variable will get this
value stored and over here in actual
let's feed this title this variable okay
so this variable should have this value
exactly over here and what is the actual
the page title it's welcome :
mercury tools right so that's what I
have to type in here inside double
quotes so
mercury tools okay and once I've added
the selenium and the Destiny
dependencies then I would not have this
problem anymore okay so all these
packages will get downloaded so without
wasting much time let me go back to the
Palm D'Or XML file and over here let me
say what is it that I want to actually
test but before I say what I want to
test after first of all set my maven
plugins right so I have to add those
details inside this XML file so I have a
notepad where I have first word all
those dependencies and all these plugins
details okay which is in this format so
the plugins which I would basically need
is the maven compiler plugin and the
maven surefire plugin okay so these are
two different plugins we have enclosed
them in separate plugin tags and these
two plugin tags are inside another tag
which is plugins correct and this
plugins tag is again inside this bill in
the tag so that is ending here and one
thing we have to remember is inside the
configuration tab I have said there is
suit XML file so this suit XML file
specified in configuration is nothing
but the actual tests and he wrote XML
file which your random execute okay so
let me not complicate this further and
certainly just copy this and paste it in
my palm or XML file
okay this is my Palm D'Or XML file and
here I'm gonna paste this build part
okay whatever is then inside my belt tag
now besides this like I told you earlier
we need the dependencies right so the
two dependencies for selenium and tests
and you need to be copied and this is
the code so for tests Angie this is the
dependency that you specify in maven and
for a selenium this is the dependency
that we specified okay so I'm going to
copy this and again I'm gonna paste it
over here okay but one thing you have to
remember is since these are two separate
dependency tags after specify them
inside the tag called dependencies okay
so let me close this dependency tag over
here brilliant
now there is just one thing that is left
I have to create a property stag and
by the part of my destiny XML file okay
so this is the XML file I'm gonna copy
this and I'm gonna paste it here okay so
what you see here right Desson 0 XML
file so the XML file which I create has
to be placed in this place so when I
execute this Palm D'Or XML file then I
will be executing this destiny XML file
which has been specified inside this
plugin over here and say the short file
plugin under configurations I've
specified it has to be executed so
that's how this XML file would be
executed along with all these
dependencies download it by maven ok so
you don't have to download any of these
on your own maven will do that for you
with the help of eclipse and internet
connection
ok now to actually build and download
these dependencies all you have to do is
control S which would save it so when
you press ctrl + S then that would be
built over here and the dependencies
would be downloaded for you ok so now
that the dependencies are downloaded
what I can do is I can straight away go
to my class file over here and update
all these so now if you will see my
webdriver package is available right
since I download the selenium
dependencies through maven because of
that I can do it now I want to improve
this webdriver package and I'm gonna
import the chrome driver package also
and yes I think now we're all good right
so now there are no errors now if I
straightaway execute this test then
let's see if this test case passes or
fails ok it has to open up a new Chrome
browser and then go to this site and
verify the title and give us a result so
this is the new chrome browser I am on
to demo tools ok so by now the title
would have been fetched and what is the
result of my test case it's passed okay
my desk is husband's past and you can
see that you and my system dot out dot
println message has been displayed hi
this is button from Ed your Rekha okay
perfect now I've always been telling you
that in your palm dat XML file we
specify the Destiny XML file which has
to be executed correctly so to convert
this Java class into a test and read or
XML file
you simply go here click on this Java
file and say test energy so over here
you can say convert to test energy so
when you do that it automatically
converts to a test in G dot XML file
okay that's the default name let it be
click on next and click on finish ok so
now you can see there's a new fire
created called the tests NC dot XML file
so if you double click on this it s
entry door XML file
it basically is executing this Java
program
Petric our demo Java program inside this
maven selenium test Andy Jenkins folder
correct if you open it this is the
package where it's present and this is
the class so that's what an XML file
does it simply and easily it says which
class or which class to execute and in
which package that class is present
correct so that's why destiny or XML is
such a brilliant tough file so now that
my Palm D'Or XML file and my destiny dot
XML files are ready I came straight to
execute them and check if my test is
running or not running okay now before I
straightaway go to my Jenkins and start
showing you how to build them let me
open up and execute this maven project
and see if my problem dot XML file is
working ok I've just built it here so
let me open up the terminal first and
over here I need to go to this project
structure and execute this Palmer XML
file right so currently this Palm D'Or
XML file where is it present your
properties it's present over here
correct so let's first travel to this
particular path ok
so here we have the Palm D'Or XML file
correct
so inside the movement project let's
first run the command MV n clean so this
is just to make sure that any of your
previous errors or bugs are just being
cleared off
okay so ambient clean as good practice
to run this command so it says that the
build is success then so it successfully
cleaned up to the project so now what we
should do is we should run the command
MV n install ok
so this will install whatever your palm
your XML file says and whatever other
things that are needed so it's
downloading the plugins my compiler and
the Swart fire plugin and all the others
okay perfect even my test is being
secured now
so this is macchiatos so what does it
say okay well it is a success
so total tests that were run by one and
there were zero failures okay perfect
even my println command is executed so
now now that my install worked so let's
just give the command ambien test okay
so by running the ambient test command I
am basically executing the test
okay I'm executing this program as a
test and this means that my mainland
spawner XML file is perfectly working
fine for me and the next thing that have
to do to conclude this demo is to
execute this Palm D'Or XML file through
gentles right so that's what I got to do
and to do that let me first of all start
off by going to the Jenkins dashboard
okay so john keats is posted on port
number 80 80 so if you go here you will
find Jenkins and - first of all execute
the pom or XML file we have to create a
new job okay
so I can create a new job from over here
new item but before that for those of
you who are using Jenkins for the first
time remember that you have to download
the maven plug-in for Jenny kids and you
can download that from man Jenkins okay
so if you come down you have something
called as global tool configuration
right so go here and search for your
maven plugins so you will have your
maven plug-in here and you will have to
just specify the path where your mabel
is present your name and home okay you
have to specify that over here and once
you're done with that you have to just
make sure that even your JDK is also
mentioned the Java home of your GED kid
this is also mentioned so when these two
are mentioned you can straight away
start creating your job and start
executing that job so let's get to that
there let's click on new item for
creating a new Jenkins job and this is
going to be a maven project right so
this ml chose me man project and the
name is gonna be me melt Jenkins
let's put selenium and test ng there in
the mix okay
that's gonna be the name of my job and
let me click on okay
so over here we have the general tools
we have the description under that so
all these can be avoided so let's first
fall straight go to the build part okay
so under build we have to specify which
is the Palm D'Or XML file that we have
to execute so this value specify the
path okay if you remember my Palmer XML
file which I have to execute it was
present under this path right so let me
just copy that path under this path so
I'm gonna copy this completely you want
to say okay go back to my Jenkins
dashboard and I'm gonna feel it over
here okay and here in goals and options
we have to specify the commands which
you want to execute so I showed you
through the command from that I executed
two important commands clean and install
so that is the same thing that I need to
specify over here so before I install it
I want to clean it I want to fill it
with whatever previous history of the
project was there I eliminate that and
I'm installing a new one so the second
command that it will do is install okay
so that's what golden option does for
you you specify what commands to run and
once I'm done with this I am pretty good
okay I can now let me just minimize this
for a minute
I can just say apply and I can save this
and straightaway execute this particular
job
maven selenium test Andrew Jenkins okay
so the option to do that is present
right here on build now so if you click
on build now the bill will get scheduled
and let's see if the test case passes or
fails we can also view what's happening
by going to the console output okay so
this is the console output and here so
this is the status
it's building the Enrico demo the
snapshot so it's really similar to what
you were seeing
in the command prompt right so whatever
gets displayed there that since it's
executed through Jenkins it's displayed
here on Jenkins okay so even the
system.out.println command as displayed
and now the Chrome browser driver should
open up and go to new tools and perform
the assertion okay perfect it's done
tests run one and zero failures
okay perfect so let me just close these
browser instances which are opened up by
my tests so as you can see right now we
have achieved automation testing so to
achieve continuous testing which is all
about scheduling bills or having them
run continuously for achieving that we
have to configure a few more settings
okay so let's go to configure options
for that and it says the configure
option if you scroll down you will find
this option of belt triggers right so
under build triggers you have further
options like build periodically and we
have github the hook trigger and then
you have pol sem so you can use any of
these to build triggers so if you click
on build periodically I can specify in
cron format at what time of the day at
what time of the week on which month and
in which your I want to execute that
test so I can specify that I also if I
want to run the test every half an hour
or every one or or twice every day I can
specify all those timings over here okay
so that is one way of achieving
continuous testing okay but besides this
there's one more interesting option
which I was talking about there is
something called email notification so
if your test case passes then there is
no need to worry okay but if your desk
is fails then as developers you might
want to know immediately right so that
time you can set the recipients the
email address of the people that should
get this email that the test case has
failed so we can enter those email ids
over here with a comma okay guys so
that's it from my end that's how we use
maven selenium tests energy and Jenkins
for achieving continuous testing okay so
these are the most popular tools and
that's how they are used
but of course depending on company to
company the use cases will differ and of
the tools that they will use will differ
along with how they are using the truth
so this is the most common way and the
general way or the general industry
practice if you can call it so that's
how that was and I would like to thank
you all guys for being the webinar and
being ever so patient till the very end
