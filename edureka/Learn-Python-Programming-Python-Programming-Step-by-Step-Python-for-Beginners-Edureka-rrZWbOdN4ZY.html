this session we'll be learning about
Python so here I will introduce you to
this exciting and popular Python
programming language and then we'll
explore the power that comes along with
it now let me tell you what are we going
to cover in this session so I start the
session by first telling you the reasons
as to why you should go for this
language or why people of Python as a
primary language after that I introduce
you to Python and various features also
I'll help you guys are installing
Jupiter and how it works with Python
language after that we directly jump to
the hands-on part where we will first
implement the various fundamentals of
programming and later on we'll be going
to the most popular libraries of Python
such as numpy pandas matplotlib and
Seabourn so let's get started now python
is easy to read easy to learn and still
a very powerful language but what makes
it so so here I have listed down a lot
of features as to why people go for this
language so the very first feature is
scripting so python as in scripting
language means automation you can simply
automate it or in simple word scripts
are basically the programs which are
written for special runtime environment
that automate your execution so for
example when a program starts to execute
line by line execution is done as per
your script next we have s think so you
can perform testing with selenium which
is an automation testing tool so with
selenium you can test any web
application then it comes GOI so GUI
basically stands for graphical user
interface where you can build next up
application so we have various modules
for that as well now in Python the most
commonly used module is tkinter we also
have a lot of modules you can just go
ahead and explore them next we have web
development so we have tune-up in plays
a major role here you can basically
build web application websites using
Python we have different Python
frameworks available such as Django we
have flowers and many more you can also
perform web scraping by just writing few
lines of code and you can scrape data
from anywhere Python plays a major role
in data analysis so let's say you have a
lot of data say terabytes or petabytes
of data which you can analyze and
visualize with Python isn't that great
guys you have a huge amount of data and
you just need to analyze in
iliza so python helps in that as well
now for analyzing and visualization we
have libraries such as numpy pandas
matplotlib networks for data analyzing
and visualization so we will be going
through each one of them later in this
session but now let's not deviate from
here lets us see what else we can
achieve with Python then we have machine
learning and image processing so here
you can just train a machine and the
tasks will be done automatically for you
apart from image recognition or you can
say face recognition you have a lot of
things you have character recognition
handwriting recognition and everything
is available in Python next we have
robotics so hill robots are all
programmed in Python so the program
robot it is important that you have a
basic understanding of Python next is
your game development here you can
basically write the logic of game using
Python so in this we have a module which
is PI again so these PI game
applications can run on Android devices
as well and the last we have artificial
intelligence now we all know how AI has
rapidly grown and how it has brought a
change in everyone's life so Python
plays a major role in AI as well so to
conclude possibilities are endless you
can achieve a lot more if you just learn
Python so these are the few reasons that
I've listed down as to why you should go
for Python but believe me guys did a lot
more if you explore them next let me
introduce you to Python programming so
python is a fairly old language created
by gudo vandalism so the design begin in
the late 1980s and for suppose release
in February 1991 and also it wasn't
named after a dangerous snake
mr. Rossum was a fan of comedy series
from late seventies and hence the name
Python was adopted from there Python
also supports procedure oriented
programming as well as object oriented
programming
so with OOP or you can say
object-oriented programming you're able
to divide the complex problems into
smaller sets by just creating objects
next python is an interpreted language
so you don't need to compile you can
directly run the program that is the
runtime compilation and if any error
comes you can directly see it during the
runtime now unlike Java it first
converts into bytecode which creates a
class file and then you're able to see
the output but with Python you can
simply come
the code and run it you will be able to
see the so here a lot of tasks has been
reduced in Python moving forward guide
let me tell you the different features
that contribute to the success of Python
so the very first feature is high level
a Python is a high level language so
this means you can write your code
directly in English and Python will in
turn convert this into low-level machine
language or you can say that assembly
language we check in the form of zeros
and ones so here one does not need to
bother about the low-level details like
memory allocation and all those things
so you can simply write a Python script
without keeping all these things in mind
next is the portability of Python so
Python is supported by many platforms
like Linux operating system it is
supported by Windows operating system it
could be Macintosh as well as your
PlayStation so Python supports all of
these platforms next it is easy free and
open source so python is quite simple
and it is very easy to learn and easy to
read and write python is also an example
of floss philosophy which means one can
freely distribute the copies of the
software it can read the source file
modify it and many more then python is
extensible which means you can integrate
your Java and.net components here you
can also invoke C and C++ libraries so
therefore you can perform cross language
operations as well next moving forward
let me tell you who are using Python in
the industry so there are a lot of big
players who are using Python in
different domain here is Google who is
using python for web searches then we
have YouTube which is largely written in
Python and many other companies like
Dropbox Mozilla Firefox Raspberry Pi
Facebook Netflix NASA and IBM so I have
just listed few companies guys which
uses Python but trust me there are a lot
of companies that uses Python as a
programming language next let us move on
to the hands-on part where I'll tell you
how to install Jupiter and how you can
work with it so as you can see the
screenshot at the right this is my
Jupiter dot org so as you can see here
this is the link we just have to go and
just click on these buttons so you can
just show you this practically so you go
ahead and open
cruel and I will simply type in here w w
Jupiter awk
so this is the official document page
for Jupiter notebook it is an open
source and it is a scientific computing
platform that can work with across 40
programming languages and not just
Python so it's a great web app that not
only include your life code equations
visualizations and narrative text
therefore it's a really great tool for
teaching data science and Python
libraries now if you scroll a bit here
you will see we have two options we have
tried repeater and then we have
installed the notebook so in this try
cheater it's an posted online version of
Jupiter so let me just click on this so
there is sometimes no vacancy so maybe
someone is using Python right now so for
that what you can do you can simply
install the notebook so this will
basically install Jupiter locally if you
go one and click on install the notebook
you land up to this page the
prerequisite is that you just need to
have Python now if you're having Python
it is very easy if you can simply go to
a command prompt and type in pip install
Jupiter and you'll be done with Jupiter
but what jupiter recommends is you
should install jupiter using anaconda so
as you can see here we have a link which
says to download anaconda with the
latest python 3 version i just click on
this anaconda link so there as you can
see here we have an opponent
distribution for three platforms we have
four windows operating system we have
four Mac operating system and then we
have four Linux operating system so for
Mac you can see here we have command
line installer as well as graphical
installer all you have to do you just
need to double click on this button and
your dot peak is a file will be
downloaded rest you can just follow the
on-screen instructions for Linux users
you just need to type in the bash
command and you can download the anakata
for the same since I am on Windows
operating system so I'll go to Windows
and simply go ahead and click on python
3.6 version and download now this will
take a few minutes mickey's as you can
see here it's 515 megabytes so we will
take few minutes to download and then
for installing this will also we have a
mini package anaconda that you can use
but again i would recommend you to
download the full package environment so
this is a bit a large size because all
these package
that we're going to discuss in the video
will be present inside this era bond
only so once your anaconda has been
downloaded and installed what you can do
you can simply go to command prompt and
just type in Jupiter notebook so I'll go
to my command prompt I'll say anaconda
command you can go to your simple
command prompt as well so I'll type in
here Jupiter notebook
so I need a spelling mistake just give
me a minute
so as you can see here it will directly
jumps on to the browser and will open my
Jupiter hood book in the default browser
that is for me it's opera so it's
opening in Opera now my chapter is
running so we have an anaconda 3 we have
all the projects and we have pi chum
projects you can also write a py file
and you can import that to Jupiter as
well so these notebooks has an extension
of IP by n B so P by S stands for Python
and n B stands for notebook now if you
scroll a bit you'll see a new option
over here so if you click on that just
go to Python 3 so here my Jupiter
notebook has been opened so let me print
the name so I will take the input let's
say input into your name
and then I'll simply print it Alsip
print hello and the name so to run this
sale you can simply go ahead and click
on this land sale button so once you go
and click on this pattern so as you can
see if ask me for my name so let me type
in here ru she and once I click on enter
a premie back hello ayushi so this is
how you can perform so now if you don't
want to press this Run button again and
again it's a simple shortcut which says
which is Shift + Enter so you can just
go ahead just press Shift + enter and it
will again ask the input now also one
more thing if you notice here that we
are having an asterisk over here so this
basically means that this cell is
running if you write anything in the
next cell let's say I want to print
hello
and if I run the sale this will not work
because the previous cell is already in
the running mode so what you can do you
can just simply right here anything and
then you can see that this sale is
automatically executed so here basically
the asterisk means it is in running
stage and once you get a number
it isn't executed next if you want to
save this file you can simply go ahead
and press ctrl s to save this also you
can see we have an autosave feature over
here so it automatically saves your
program also if you can go here and
simply save save and checkpoint now to
insert a new cell you can simply go
ahead over here you can click on insert
cell above or you can insert cell below
also there is a shortcut for this so you
can type in Alton enter so when you
press alt and enter a new column will be
created since I've pressed alt enter
this column has been created over here
so if you go again and file you can see
that we have an option called as
download so you can download this in the
notebook format which I already told you
that is IP by n B then if you wanted in
Python so you can simply download the
file in the py extension so if you
wanted in HTML notes you can just click
here and it will export to a basic HTML
file that any browser can show also
there are a bunch of options here to
download so you can just check this out
something else I wanted you to know is
if you're ever having an infinite loop
or you can say a while loop is running
forever so somehow your system is
crashing or sometimes it is not able to
give you the output so what you can do
you can simply go to kernel and you can
just restart it so what basically
happens that this notebook is connected
to global where a kernel is an instance
of Python running now something wrong
happens or let's say pythons crashing he
did always go ahead and restart it
you can also interrupt it if you want to
interrupt specific code cell also if you
need help in addition to what I told you
you can always click on help and it will
tell you about a notebook itself you can
see there are different Python libraries
also and if you click here or notebook
help it will go to a next page so this
know who helped it will basically tell
you about the notebook itself so they
notebooks are called ipython notebooks
but since Jupiter can run on other
programming languages such as Julia R so
these are known as Jupiter notebooks now
now one more thing I wanted to mention
is there are a lot of keyboard shortcuts
apart from what I just told you so what
you can do you can go to help and just
click on keyboard shortcuts so here a
list is been displayed with the
respective shortcut so these are the
shortcuts that are available for you so
these are all the basics of known boots
and pretty much all you need to know as
far as you go through this session now
if you are having any further questions
related to anything that I've just
mentioned please feel free to ask them
in the comment box and I will be happy
to reply this at the earliest also I
want to tell you one more thing that
help we have something to write notes
let's say if I want to write something
it's a notes so in spite of going to
code and just ran it what you can do you
can keep the drop-down and select
markdown so here if you see if I run
this the number is not there so
basically you can type here anything you
can type in any note for the same and
then you can perform execution over here
let's say if you want to learn about
variables topic oh let's say you want to
practice some of the data types so I can
write here data types and then I can go
over here I can say a is equals to 1 and
just print me a and I will just go ahead
and press shift ENTER to see the output
print a and I just go ahead and so this
will not implement ant ALS I had go
ahead and write something so I'll try it
over here and then you can see this is
already printed so this will
automatically runs so now let me go back
to my presentation and let's see what's
the next of it I you need to cover so
now let me talk about the operators in
Python programming so as you can see
here operators in python are mutually
classified into seven types the very
first is arithmetic then comes
comparison bitwise membership assignment
logical an identity so let me go ahead
and open my Jupiter and let us implement
all these operators one by one
so I again go to my opera which is my
default browser and let us first talk
about arithmetic operators so again if I
am typing arithmetic operator
write this in markdown tab so this will
basically make a note that below these I
will be writing the arithmetic operators
so arithmetic operators majorly includes
your addition subtraction multiplication
division and all these methods so now
let me take an example let's say I'll
name a variable as a is equals to 5 and
B is equals to 2 now I want to perform
operations on it let's say a plus B so
this should give me 7 let me just run it
and yes 7 has been printed now similarly
I can perform any other function it says
subtraction has been given this then we
have multiplication so 5-minute to is 10
and then we have division so these are
the basic arithmetic operators now we
have a lot more than but these are the
most commonly used ones so if we go back
to the presentation and let's see what
is the second operator the second is my
comparison operator so if this
comparison operator what you can do we
can basically compare two variables so
for example you have greater than equal
to sign you have less than sign you have
equal to equal to and you have not equal
to so let me go back to Jupiter and
let's see how we can implement these so
now we'll be talking about comparison so
let me just write it down and I'll just
change it to markdown so what you will
be doing here you can compare two
variables and then you'll be getting
back a boolean value for example we'll
be getting a true or false so let me say
a is greater than B if I run this it
says true because a is pipe and B is
true and yes it is right so it will give
me true now if I go ahead and if I do
this in less than let me just run this
and say is false similarly you can
compare these variables now if I say a
equal to equal to B what will the answer
guy is 5 is 5 equal to equal to 2 it
says no so let me just run this and it
says false now if I just rewrite 2 here
I'll say B is again equal to 5 and if I
just run this column now it says is goes
to me and sister e similarly I can say a
is not equal to B it says false because
5 &amp;amp; 5 are equal right so this was all
about the comparison operators so now
let me go back to the presentation
see what respect third operator so third
is my bitwise operators so in these kind
of operators it basically converts into
binary so every execution is done
bitwise bit so here we have an operator
or operator not operator X or operator
and these things so let me just
implement the few common ones and go
back to my Jupiter and it's a bitwise
operator I'll mark down just to make a
note so here as I was telling you if
basically converts into binary so as you
can see here a or B the output we're
getting is seven now how we are getting
this seven as an output now what happens
is seven is been converted to its binary
form and then the five is converted to
binary form and then individually on
those numbers
the operation is will perform so let me
tell you how it is done seven has a
binary value of one one one
and five has a value of one zero one
so what happens in an or operator if it
find a single one or a single zero in
the same thing it will give me a result
as one so if you see you have one and a
one so we have a single one so it will
give me an output as a 1 then we have 1
and 0 so what happens with our operator
do we have a single value which is 1
which is present over here so we'll have
the result as 1 and in same case 1 and 1
will get an output as 1 so this is
basically equal to 7 and hence the
output we got 7 is right now let me
perform some other operation let's save
an and operation
so what happens let me just run this
here we are getting the output as 5 so
what happens with and operation
it basically checks whether the two
numbers are same or not and only if the
numbers are same will get the output so
here for 1 and 1 is same so here we get
an output of 1 then we see 1 and 0 are
not same so we will get an value of 0
and then we see 1 and 1 are same so
we'll get an output of 1 so 1 0 1 is
again 5 and hence we getting the output
as 5 so I hope you guys are clear with
an and or operators so now let me tell
you the third operator which is the XOR
operator so XOR operator is represented
by this sign and if I just run this if
we give me an output of 2 now how it is
giving me let me show it to you again
so my 7 was 1 1 1 my 5 was 1 0 1 and if
I do the XOR operation on it I'll be
getting the value as 2 and how we are
getting the value as 2 so what happens
if you're having an odd number of 1 then
only it will give me a result as 1
otherwise it will give me a 0 so here we
are having 2 ones since we will be
getting a 0 then we are having just one
and then we have 1 0 so this will
basically gives me a 1 and again we have
an even number of 1 so this will again
give me a 0 and this 0 1 0 is equals to
2 and hence we are given the output as 2
so this was all about the bitwise
operator we also have some more bitwise
operations that you can do on various
numbers but these are what the commonly
used
so let me go back to a presentation and
let's see what are the next set of
operators
so I'll just first clear this up alright
so then the fourth operator is
membership operator so membership
operator basically deals with your list
you have two types of membership
variables which are in and not in so let
me go back to my Jupiter and let us
implement this as well so now I'll talk
about membership operators
so I have just zoomed my scream a bit I
just go to mark town I'll just run this
so membership operators also returns a
boolean value which is in the form of
true or false so let me create a list
over here first so I will say X contains
values such as 2 3 4 and now I have to
use a membership operator so I'll simply
writing over here 3 in X so what does it
basically say whether the number 3
belongs to X or not so if I just run
this program it gives me output as true
now if I write something else let's say
right over here and if I run the program
it will give me false so to basically
ensure that whether this number is a
member of the list or not the next
member of it is that we have is not in
now we have 7 is not in X we know that 7
is not an X 1 let me just run this and
it will give me the output as true so
this is all about in and not in
operators now the fifth operator is my
assignment operator so assignment is
very easy you just need to assign a
value to a variable so here you can also
perform some of the assignment
operations let's say it's equal to it is
plus equal to it is minus equal to and
things like that so let me just go back
to again men Jupiter and let's see how
it can implement that so I'll be doing
assignment operator so I'll just write
it down
I haven't changed the code have to
change it to mom down so now it's time
so now I can perform it over here so
let's say I have a is equals to 2 B is
equals to 5 I want to perform some
assignment operators so what happens I
want another variable that is C I want
to add these number so one way of adding
is a plus B if I click on shift and
enter it will give me the result as I
have not printed C so if you give me the
result as 7 now what if I don't want to
write C is equals to a plus B and if I
have gained one to type in the value
such as C and then again I have to add
another value let's say a D and which
calculates your C and B and then I need
another variable as e which will
calculate your D and C so all this
things will become very tedious so to
reduce the number of lines we have
assignment operators so what you can do
with assignment operators you can simply
write over here C is equals to plus plus
equal to a so what happens here it will
basically converts it to C is equals to
C plus a so now if I run this and if I
want to print C it will gives me C is
equal to C plus a so C was my 7 and if I
again run it we give me the output as 13
and if a game shift enter I will get an
output as 15 and if L again click on run
it will give me 17 so similarly these
values will keep on changing if you're
not here with this let me take an
another example to make it more clear
guys so let's say I'll take a number
let's say 2 I'll take another number
let's shape 3 and I want a sum with the
two numbers num1 plus num2 so here this
was just another example guys if in case
you are confused with previous one
because in this one we have done a lot
of iteration so in this I will do a
single iteration and I hope it will be
clear to you so here I have done the sum
now what I have to do I have to say sum
plus equal to number
I'll print the sum
so there as you can see my son is num1
plus num2 which is two plus three is
equal to five and in the next statement
what I have done I have simply added
number one with the son so here I was
getting five as sum so this will
basically becomes sum is equals to some
plus number which is five plus 2 which
is 7 so this is how it works guys I hope
this is clear now now you can also
perform some more other functions such
as subtraction so her I want to do that
it will become some - now 1 which is 5
minus 2 which should be three twelfths
remove this comment and and hence will
get the result as 3 similarly you can
also multiply it here the number of
lines are reducing now if I write
multiplication and if I run this it will
give you the sum of a so this is how it
works guys now let me go back to a
presentation and let's see what's the
next in that set so done with the
assignment operator next what we have we
have a logical operator so logical
operators are the operators which has
two values let's same we have an x and y
now it will return X if only X is false
I will return by otherwise so in logical
operators there we have three operators
such as an operator or operator and not
operator let me go back to my Jupiter
and let's see how you can implement this
so now we are on the logical operator
and just write it down I change the
markdown now run this so now let me take
two variables let's say x and y let's
say X I have taken as true why I have
taken that as false
now here true and false at the reserved
keyword so PI reserved keyword what I
mean that it has been deserved with the
value so true this one deserved with the
value of one and false is reserved to
the value of zero so whenever you
perform any operation just keep these in
mind that true and false are all
reserved keywords so now let me perform
some operations with it so let's say I
want to upper for x and y so here as you
can see I have an x and y and is giving
me the result as false
so as I've already told you since X
holds the value of true it is returning
me the Y value which is false same
if I go for all it will be the opposite
case now if I getting the value as falls
here in the or operator I will be
keeping s true so let me just run this
and as you can see I am giving the value
of true so now if I have to write a not
operator I can simply write not X if you
give me the output as false so let me
just print this and yes I got the output
as false so this was all about the
logical operators now let me go back to
the presentation and let's see what is
the lash operator that we need to cover
so the last operator is the identity
operator try entity operators are of two
times it is of is and is not so let me
just implement that as well so now we
will be doing about identity operators
so identity operators are very simple so
what it basically do it fetches the
identity whether the variable is present
or not so if we take an example here
let's say X is equals to 5 and I know
that we have two identical Peters which
is and is not so I have X is equals to 5
and if I print X is 5 it should return
me the value as true so here it will
return me the boolean value which is
true or false so here I have 5 so if I
go ahead and run this it will give me a
value of true even if I write here 6 it
will give me a value of 4 similarly we
have is not so here if I say is not and
if I run this it will give me a value of
true because X is not 6 it is actually 5
so this was all about the identity
operators so here we have covered all
the 7 operators that are commonly used
in Python so discussed about arithmetic
comparison bitwise membership assignment
logical and identity and we have
implemented them in Jupiter as well
so now let us move on to data types
which are present in Python programming
so as you can see here we have two types
of data types we have immutable data
types and we have mutable data types so
immutable data types as the name says
value cannot be changed so whatever
value being assigned to a data type it
cannot be changed whereas a mutable data
type the values can be changed later as
well so in immutable data types it is
further classified into numbers strings
and tuples whereas immutable data type
it is classified into list
dictionary and sits so let us implement
these as well first let us talk about
immutability types so let me go to my
Jupiter a let us implement this so here
we have discussed all the operators over
here I'll just zoom in a bit and I'll
talk about data types now data types in
Python
I just run this so the very first
immutable data type is numeric or you
can say the numbers so in numeric data
type what happens it contains the number
so now let us discuss all the data types
are kept just lower so first let us talk
about the immutable data types and in
immutable we were having three data
types which when you marek strings and
tuples so let me just talk about the
very first data type that is numeric or
you can say numbers so numbers are
broadly classified into three types
which is integer float and complex so
integers are those number where you can
put in the whole numbers whereas float
in to you decimal values and the complex
are in their own format select me in all
of these so let me first go through
numeric let's say I have a was 2 1 e is
equal to 2 and C is equals to a plus B
so if I go ahead and run this program
I have to print C as well just to see
the output so yes I am giving 3 as an
output so this was all about integer
data type now let me take a float value
which is a decimal value now if I bring
the same I will be keeping a float value
so this is my pure value that is 3.0
next let us talk about the complex
numbers so for complex number what you
can do can write something like a is
equals to 3 plus 4 J plus 1 plus 1 J
now if I go ahead and drink this a so it
will basically perform this operation so
the real value will be added 3 + 1 is
equal to 4 and the imaginary part will
be added separately therefore 4 + 5 J is
the output so this was all about the
numeric data types so now let me go back
to a presentation and let's see what is
the next set of operator that we need to
discuss so now we are having string so
string are basically the sequence of one
character or you can say the collection
of words so keep in mind guy is a string
can being closed in a single quotes as
well as multi codes so if I go again to
my Jupiter let me implement string is
way so IBM drinking strings and you mark
down this so let me print a string let's
say I'll print STR 1 is equals to hello
I'll take another shrink and say how are
you and I have to perform an operation
on it so I'll take another string and
I'll say string 1 plus ring 2 and if I
run this force I need to print the
string so as a string 3 and I'll just
print it
so here the concatenation operation has
been performed so apart from this there
are many other operations that you can
do which ring so for example and say
string 3 multiplied by 2 so this string
will be duplicate it twice so if you see
here my hello how are you
is been printed twice you will also say
4 or 5 depending upon your requirement
there are some more operations such as
string 3 dot upper this will basically
converts all your string in uppercase so
my string is in uppercase I can also do
it in lowercase I just need to type in
the keyword that is low
shirring three data slower and here's
the string has been printed in lowercase
so all these operations you can perform
so next let me go back to my
presentation and let's see what is the
third set of data types so next we have
tuples so couples are basically sequence
of objects that cannot be changed so as
you can see all these data types are
immutable cannot be changed
so in tuples we can have different data
types for example we can have a string
datatype we have a numeric data type we
can have a float and all these things
but unlike array and see where we just
use similar data types
so therefore tuples are very important
and one more thing about tuples is that
tuples uses curved brackets so let me go
back to my Jupiter and it has implement
some of the examples of tuples as well
now we'll be doing some more tuples so
I'll write Tuffle so I will simply run
this so let me now first create a topper
let's say I create a tuple same couple
and shot a kirby breasts and then I can
write a string value let's say and in
Eureka then I can say a numeric value
then I can save those float value as
well and if I bring the stop will let us
see this works or not so here I got
thoughtful
now also tuples you have a lot of
operation for example you can also add
the elements later on so what you can do
you can say might happen plus let's say
I want to add a shrink volume it's say
ABC then I want to add numeric value
that's it and if you run this your
string has been added so this was all
about tuples so now let me go back to my
presentation and let us see what else is
left so we are done with immutable data
types now let us see what are mutable
data types so in mutable data types the
value assigned to a data type it can be
changed so in this we have list we have
dictionaries and we have sets so
starting from the list so lists are
basically the sequence of objects only
such as float shrink and numerix but the
only difference between a list and a
tuple is that list can be modified
whereas tuples cannot be modified
also we have some more differences like
for tuples we use just the curly
brackets whereas for lists we will be
using square brackets also tuples are
fast whereas your lists are a bit slow
so let us go to a Jupiter and let us
implement list so I will first create a
list let's say my list and I create a
square bracket and inside that I can
keep the same string as well where I
have an earache are to upload number and
if I bring the string let us see with
them I get the output or not so here I
got the out now just like Doc why we
have added or you can say a pain one
more character in list what you can do
you can simply use some of the specific
functions like for example if you want
to add any value to the existing string
what you can do you can use a method
which is append then you also have a pop
so this will basically list down your
last element so let me just put in this
one so my list dot pop and if I just run
this since I've clicked it twice it has
moved to two and if I'll again run this
it will go to Lu Rekha so first output
was 3.0 I have just clicked it twice so
that's why it was showing two and PI
again planet it shows me in Eureka so
this is how my list works now I have
talked about list
next is the dictionary so next time he
basically stores your data in Cavey
pairs so Cavey basically stands for key
value pairs so here we have a key which
basically denotes the value of it so let
me go back to Jupiter and let us in
peace dictionary as well texturing I
just mark down I just run it let's say I
want to create a dictionary by naming it
my dick also guys keeping line
dictionary opens with a parentheses
which are the curly brackets so here I
want to say a name I'll specify the
value let's say I you she then I warned
tricks steaming and I want to print my
dictionary so this is giving an error
which is basically my string value and
this is not enclosed in codes so let me
just add that
and now if I run it I output a display
so this is not dependent on the string
you can also have a numeric value over
so let's say if I want one I have to
remove the codes and in spite of sex I
want a numeric value which is two and if
I again printed I will get the output so
you can also have multiple values with
respect to a single key so for example
here I have two which is female so I can
write over here sex come in former
female and if I run it again I have no
iron two codes
and now if I run it
I am giving this multiple values for the
same key which is two so that is how you
can perform different operations on your
dictionary so now let me go back to our
presentation and let us see the third
day data which are sets so sets are
basically unordered collection of item
now in the sets you don't have duplicate
elements so all the elements are unique
over here so let me go back to my
Jupiter a legis implement sets as well
so answer sets now run this so let me
create a set let's say my set and I can
put in various numbers like 1 2 3 4 5
and let's say I am giving a duplicated
value let's say 3 and if I trained
myself let's see what output it gives me
back so if I run it it gives me 1 2 3 4
5 now as you can notice here 3 has been
repeated twice but it will only give me
single 3 so that is the beauty of sip so
it will not basically repeat the
elements now you can also perform
various operations with sets so for
example I have a set let's say s1 1 2
and I have a string or you can say a
character let's say a then I have
another set which is one character let's
say B and 3 now I have to perform some
operations such as union or intersection
so s1 s2 pipeline will return me all the
elements which are present in these two
sets
so basically Union means all your
elements so if I run this I will be
giving one two three a and B since one
is repeating it will only give me one
time and others are order unique so it
will print me that now if I want to
perform intersection on these two sets
so for intersection it will basically
prints me the common element so now if I
print s1 intersection for intersection
we have a symbol of and s1 intersection
s - and if I run it I am only getting
one since one is the common between
these two sets now I hope you're getting
the functionality of sets so guys I will
not say that you should practice this
more and more so that you can become
expert and then you not commit a single
mistake so let me go back to my
presentation let's see what else is left
so we are done with the data types which
are immutable and mutable and we've also
seen how these data types are used so
now let us go ahead and look at some of
the libraries in Python
so here we may be discussing about numpy
pandas mad bird lip and Seabourn
snickers go to a first library which is
numpy so numpy is a Python package which
stands for your numerical Python so it
is a colle library for scientific
computing which contains a powerful n
dimensional array it also provide tools
for interviewing C C++ etc it is also
being used for a linear zebra random
number capability and many more so numpy
is a very important library as it is
also used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container for your
generate data so as you can see here you
can go ahead and install num pipe by
going to an anaconda and simply right
condi install vampire if you are not
having anakata or if you're using any
other ID you can simply write on the
command prompt pip install numpy i enum
PI will be installed so let me go back
to my Jupiter and let's see how numpy
works so I'll type in here numpy now
numpy are somewhat similar to a list so
there are certain number of reason as to
why you pray for numpy over your list so
i believing all of that so let me just
first create a list so let's say i will
be creating a list of my list and i have
three elements and if i print this list
let's save my list if i go ahead it is
giving me this list now i'll import
numpy so import numpy as NP
so this has been done and then if I cast
the list as an ad here so I'll say NP
dot array and inside this I'll type in
my list so as you can see here I have an
umpire array which includes the list so
here you get an Arabic as the container
of the list object so this is the
container of my list object so hence you
can simply cause a normal Python list
into an array
next you have dump I in two forms you
have in vector and you have in
mattresses so vector basically are the
1d errors that you have and then you
have matrices matrices is basically your
two-dimensional array so this is a
one-dimensional so now let me talk about
the two dimension array so for two
dimension array we can cast lifts off
list so let's say I have another list my
list I can I can write over here only I
have one two three then I have four five
six I have seven eight nine and I'll
close my list and if I'll print here I
am getting this list now if I want numpy
as a 2d array I'll just go ahead I'll
just run this and as you can see I am
getting this array in two dimension that
is in the form of rows and columns now
we have also various functions you can
perform with numpy for example I have a
function named as a range so this is
quite similar to the built-in range
function that we have in Python so here
I can type in n P dot arrange and I can
say give me the numbers between zero to
ten so I'll just run this so here it
starts from zero and gives me the number
till nine
so now remember guy is your indexing
always starts from zero and it will goes
up to ten but it will not include ten
now here I even also add steps to your
array let's say I want numbers from zero
to 11 and I want a step size of two so
what this will do it will basically
print over your even numbers so if I go
ahead and click here so it will give me
0 2 4 6 8 and basically the step size or
the difference of 2 between the numbers
0 to 11 so again as you can see here 11
is not been included over here we also
have many other functions let's say I
want array of all zeros so I will say
now
by zeroes and how many zeros I want
let's say I want to one dimension so I
just run this so here I'm getting array
0 point 0 and we have 4 zeros now
similarly if I want multi-dimensional
arrays so I can type in over here 4
comma 4 and if I run this I need to add
one extra place and now if I run this I
am getting a 2d array of all the zeros
present we also have some more functions
for let's say not only zeros I want ones
as well so I can type in 3 or you can
say 4 only I want four ones
and if I run this it gives me a single
dimension array and if I need a multi
dimension I can type in 4 comma 4 close
the bracket if I run this I will be
getting all the ones
so this basically defines your row and
this defines your number of columns so
we have 4 rows and 4 columns now we have
seen lists as well as numpy so what are
the factors on which we prefer numpy
over list so there are majorly three
reasons for it the very first reason is
less memory so named by occupies less
memory as compared to list so therefore
it is pretty fast in terms of execution
and at the same time it is very
convenient to work with numpy then the
second reason is that it is very fast
now if you use a function let's say a
range or if you use the same function
over the list definitely our numpy array
will win and thirdly it is very
convenient so here if you perform a
basic function let's say a1 + a2 or you
just have to add two variables number is
very easy and very convenient when you
compare it with the list so here we have
discussed why numpy is actually
preferred over a list and also I perform
some of the functions that number comes
with there are many more functions guys
you can go ahead and explore in the
official site of numpy and then if you
are having any doubt you can come back
and comment on this video and I'll be
happy to help you with the same sniff
let me go back to my presentation and
let's see what is the next library that
we have to lower next we have pandas so
pandas is an open source library which
is built on top of numpy so it is very
much used for fast analysis and data
cleaning and the preparation of data so
Panda is well suited for different kinds
of data it also
has built in data visualization features
so if you go ahead you can simply go to
Conda command profit and you can type in
Conda install pandas or otherwise you
cannot in Jupiter you can go to your
command prompt and type in pip install
pandas
so let me implement some of the
operations of this library so I will go
ahead I write in pandas now panda has a
lot of operations such as it can build
CDs it can build data frames and I will
be talking about some of the operations
as well so now let me create a CDs so
before creating a serious let me first
import pandas so import pandas as PD so
saying that the pandas is not found so I
go to command prompt
and type in condom install pandas
so it will take some time and your
pandas will be installed on your system
now if you notice I have not done this
folio numpy library this is because your
Jupiter already supports numpy or you
can say it has a built-in library which
is numpy now if you're facing any of the
issues you can go back to a command
prompt and just type in Conda install
num pies and then you will be updated
with the package so here it will ask me
to proceed why I or no so I'll say yes
so here it will take few seconds to load
so to prepare verify your transaction
and then clicks cube so please be
patient a bit okay so this is done now
I'll go back to my Jupiter notebook and
now let me just run this command again
- now I'll type in import pandas and
speedy I need to restart my kernel so
let me restart it once so now if I say
import pandas a speedy so here my pandas
is working fine now so what I can do I
can perform various functions on pandas
such as you can create a series over
that you can create a data frame you can
perform merging joining concatenation
and various other operations now let us
first create a series so for creating a
series let me first tell you guys that
pandas is a very good library to take
care of different data objects so let me
first create a list let's say I'll have
a list called as labels and I'll pass in
the values such as a
now let me create one more list in this
let's say my data and let me enter some
of the deme values to it
creating in numpy array so for number I
I need to first import numpy so I say
import numpy as NP
after that I will be importing pandas as
well so I'll write in import pandas as
PD so now I don't want to run it right
now so let me just yeah so here I'm
creating an umpire array let's say in a
variable which is add and I'll say NP
dot array and I'll pass on my list is my
data and next I will take another data
object that is dick story diction is
opened by the curly braces so I will
write some of the key value pairs it's a
which has a value of 5 then I'll take B
which has a value of 10 and 1 more now
let me see whether this works or not so
I will print my array so here my array
is working then I'll print my dictionary
diction is also fine I print labels
that's my list and I'll have to print my
data that is again a list so amazing is
printing with now what I need to do I
have to create a series so for series
what you can do you can use pandas so
pandas is referred by PB so I will say
PD toward CDs and inside this series
I'll pass on the data which is let's say
another lace that is my data
now if I run this so this somewhat looks
like numpy array now the only difference
between a numpy array and this Panda
series is that they are the index to the
left of the series so this 0 1 2 is my
index value and the data which is on the
right hand side is my data which have
just picked it from here so I passed the
list that is my data so my data is
coming here and index is coming over
here now you can also specify our index
if say for example I can type in index
and I can pass on any data object let's
say I can pass another list artists
labels so I can type in over here labels
okay this is P naught comma swells so as
you can see my index which was a
numerical value before it has now
converted to my string value which is
labels that it lists and has a value of
ABC so as you can see my index value has
been changed to ABC and the data value
are the same now if you don't want to
specify this index also you can just
remove this you can also remove this
data and if you run this program it will
give me the same result so as you can
see here the data has been displayed
this way also now you can also pass an
umpire array to ponder series so for
that let me implement that as well
speedy dot series and inside that I can
pass on the array and if I run over here
you can see the array which has a value
of my data that is 5 10 and 15 is being
displayed over here and the same index
is been displayed that is 0-1 P now
again you can specify whether you want a
different index so for example I need
labels as my index so I will again run
this and that 0 1 2 has been replaced by
ABC now in spite of passing and numpy
array you can also pass a dictionary so
if I write me d dot cds and inside that
if I pass my dictionary and if I run
this you can see the key value pairs
have been displayed so if you see my
dictionary where the keys are a B and C
and the values are 5 10 and 15 so here
if you notice my index value has been
replaced by the key values so in spite
of having 0 and 2 I have my key value
and the data has the values which is
assigned to the same key so that is how
key value has been displayed in the
Panda series therefore panda hold a
variety of object types now we can also
have some of the built-in functions in
pandas so for that let me type in Panda
or you can say PD and inside that I can
pass on the data let's say I want
built-in function as some print and Li
and now if I print this you will see it
hold references to the built-in
functions as your data points in a Panda
series so this is mean that this is a
building function which is sum then I
have another building function that is
print and then this length so that
basically shows the flexibility of Panda
series to hold different data objects
all right so now let us perform some of
the operations on
series so I will do I will be grabbing
some of the data from a CD so let me
first create a series let's say s1
equals to period or CDs and inside that
I can have multiple values let's say 1 &amp;amp;
2 and here I have some string value
let's say in the name of the countries
so if I now print my CDs so this is my
series now I want one more series let's
say s2 and I'll implement the same and I
put in some again dummy values to it
and if I print this s - this is nice -
looks likes now I have to perform an
operation on these two CDs so what I can
do I can simply print in s1 plus s2 so
if you see here I have one - India and
USA and in second series I have one -
India and UK now if I add these two
series my India will be counted as two
whereas my USA and UK are not common
therefore if in print any end with
respect to UK and USA so as you can see
here
India has been castrated 22.0 then UK
doesn't find any match and same in the
case of USA so if you see here closely
pandas automatically convert the integer
value to a float value now if you see
India is been appearing as twice so in
spite of writing - it has been converted
to float now this conversion is because
it retains all the information that is
possible now next let us move on to data
frames so in panda what our data frame
so data frame is nothing but it is
Aparna series which basically shares the
indexes so let me just implement the
same for you so I will talk about data
frames I'll again import numpy as NP
and from lamp I am importing random so
what is land of I'll just tell you so
form numpy a random import int M and
then I'll be doing NP dot random seed
and 1 Sigma so see it basically ensures
that we get some random numbers and
therefore we have imported this random
now we need to create a data frame so
let me just create a data frames SDF is
equals to PD dot data frame and here I
will be passing on this random inside
this I want three rows by three columns
so let me just print it now now I have
to specify these three rows and three
columns as well so for three rows I'll
say I want a then B and then C and then
I have to specify the columns as well so
I will type in let's say D E and F oh so
this is my mistake this is done now if I
print my data frame let me see how does
it look so as you can see here this is
being presented in a very good manner so
it looks somewhat like Excel so here if
you see these are my rows that is ABC
and these are my columns that is d EF
and inside that I have a series which is
2.7 than 0.5 and minus u2 country so
this is a series for D and this is a
series for E and these are the series
for F so all these series are having
random numbers now if you want to grab a
single CD let's say I want a CD of it's
8 D column so I simply write in over
here D and if I print this I am getting
the series of D column similarly if I
want to know the type of D that is a
data frame so let me write it in type DF
and then let's say I want to know the
type of D so we know that D has the
series so let me just print this so
inside this it is telling me that it is
a panda and this is a series similarly
if you want to know the data frame so
let me just type in over here type if I
say DF if I run this so it tells me that
it is of pandas dataframe now you can
perform various functions on data frames
as well so what you can do take me you
paint in some functions for you let's
say I want the head of this
and I want just the two rows now if you
print this so head basically gives me
the two rows so two rows which were a
and B so these two rows are being
printed over here now let's say I want L
as well so KL basically gives me the
last row and I need just one so if I
print this this is my last row and let's
say if I want to drop a rope let's say I
have three rows and I want to drop a row
which is named as C so what I'll do I
just go over here and I will type in D F
dot drop and I'm specifically a row
which I need to be dropped or you can
simply delete it so as you can see here
my whole later frame has been printed
but I don't have the C row all right now
there can be a lot of functions which
can be performed with data frames but
now let us go on to my next library so
let me go back to my presentation and
let us see what else we have left with
swear down the pandas so pandas is
basically for analyzing purpose and for
installing pandas you just have to go to
anaconda prompt and type in these
commands so now let us move on to a next
library that is matplotlib now Mac
Ludlum is a wonderful library which is
used for 2d graphics in Python so it can
be used in Python scripts it can be used
in shells it can be a web application
servers it can be used in other GUI
toolkits as well so there are several
toolkits which are available and extend
the Python mac or lip functionalities so
if you see over here these are the most
common graphs that are achieved through
Mac pockets such as bar graph my
histograms katha plot area plot and pie
plot so let me go go to my Jupiter and
let us implement a basic plot in Jupiter
and then we'll be learning what these
rafts as well so let me go back to my
Jupiter now I'm learning about
matplotlib library so for importing the
matplotlib library you again have to
follow the same steps you can go to an
anaconda prompt and you can type in
there Conda installed matplotlib if you
are not using Jupiter you are using any
other IDE or you just have Python you
can simply put your command from and
type in pip install matplotlib now here
once our import is done can type in
import matplotlib dot pi plot SP 18
now after writing this what you need to
do you have to type in one more command
that is percentage matplotlib and in
line
so this basically will help you plot a
graph inside a jupiter notebook so let
me plot a basic graph so for that let me
import numpy as well so that we can use
numpy functionality and this will be a
revision as well i have inputted that
and after that I can type in X is equal
to let's say I use a function which is
in space so here I will ask numpy to
give me numbers between 0 to 5
I want 11 divisions to it and then I
want another variable that is why I just
say X multiplied by 2 so if I run this I
have to let's say I want to print this
so I will say why
oh my X is mistake first let me print X
so this is my X which gives me a value
between 0 to 5 and I have 11 divisions
to it then I want my Y as well so I'll
print my Y as well so this is my Y which
is basically duplicated now what I need
to do I need to simply plot a graph so
plotting a graph I can write in PLT dot
plot and I pass on these variables that
is X comma Y now if I run this you can
see a graph somewhat like this so here
you can add colors to your line you can
add labels you can add titles as well so
let me add a color first of all you can
add color and line spacing and anything
so let me add color and line spacing and
if I now run this this blue line will be
converted to red line
now I want a label to this dot as well
so what I will do I will type in PHP dot
X label I want a label on the x-axis
let's say it is X label only for now and
I wanted for the y-axis as well now once
this is done I need a title which gives
me a summarization of this graph so for
writing a title is a BLT Tour title and
inside that I'll write title so now if
you see I have a Y level over here X
label on the x-axis and I have a title
to it now this isn't the Jupiter ID but
let's say if you want to show it in any
other ID let's say in Python so what you
need to do you need to write in one more
command that is PL d dot show so this
will basically help to pop up your graph
but in
Jupiter we don't require this just this
come on PLT dotplot will work for us
next let me create some multi plots to
it so this is just single plot now for
multi plots what we can do we can create
a subplot so let me type in my pl T dot
subplot and I'll specify the number of
rows let's say I have only one row then
I'll specify the number of columns let's
say I have two columns and then a plot
number let's say this is my first
subplot so I'll type in first so I'll
type in one after that I will say PLT
dot plot and I will be passing in X
comma Y and I want the color as red
similarly I need one more subplot let's
say PLT dot subplot and here I need one
row then I want two columns and then
this is my second plot so I'll say two
and again I plot it this time I will be
reversing the order I want Y first then
I will be needing X and now I want the
color as blue so if I run this you will
see two plots so this is how I have
created multiple plots on the same
canvas now there is a wonderful
documentation for matplotlib so let me
go to my Google and I can type in
matplotlib dot o-r-g so this is my
official documentation of matplotlib so
if you go down you'll see a lot of tools
now if you see here it is a document
which contains the tool kits it pays for
the third-party packages and some more
information is there so what you can do
you can go to examples and if you see
here there are a lot of examples let's
say I want to create a bar chart or you
can hit any of them now if I go and
click on bar chart so it will basically
tell me what a bar chart is and then the
code for the same so forth bar chart you
need numpy you have imported mat plot
and this is the code for it so basically
then go to this matplotlib official
document and you can try on different
examples now coming back to my PPT I
have talked about bar graph then there
is histogram scatter plot area plot and
pie plot so let me briefly tell you what
all these graph me
so basically bar graph is well-suited
when you want to measure the changes
over a period of time now a bar graph
uses bust to compare day
among different categories therefore it
is well suited when you want to measure
the changes over a period of time
now this Biograph it can be represented
horizontally or you can represent it
vertically as well also one more
important thing in bar chart is that you
need to keep in mind the longer the bar
is greater is its value moving on we
have histogram so histograms I used to
show a distribution where as a bar chart
is used to compare different entities
now histograms are useful when you have
arrays or you have a very long list next
we have scatter plot so we need scatter
plots in order to compare variables
let's say for example how much one
variable is affected by another variable
this is done just to build a
relationship out of it so the data which
is displayed as a collection of points
each will be having a value or one
variable that determines the position on
the horizontal axis and the value of
other variable determine the position on
the vertical axis and therefore you can
build a relationship out of it next we
have area plot so area plots are pretty
much similar to a line plot so area
plots are also known as stat plots so
these plots are used to track changes
over time or you can say 2 or more
related groups that makes a one-hole
category so this is the role of a DA
chart and lastly have a PI plot so pie
chart refers to a circular graph which
is broken down into segments data also
called as slices of a pie so it is
basically used to show the percentage or
a proportional data where each slice of
pie represents a category so here in
this case I have a pie of 25% similarly
these gaps are the quite popular graphs
that be used in day-to-day life now you
can also refer to my blog so let me go
to Google and I will show you my blog
that all these graphs are implemented so
here you just need to go on google and
type in WWE record co and in the
blogging section I have a blog which is
named as Python matplotlib tutorial now
inside that I have spoken about
matplotlib what are the functionalities
of it then I have talked about various
graphs so here I've implemented them in
fire Chomp you can use any other IDE I
have also told how to use it in Jupiter
you just don't need to write in PLT dot
show because PLT dot plot will work in
Jupiter now if you are using any other
IDE or if you are not using Jupiter you
can type in PLT Roger so here I've given
a random numbers I've plotted that now
if you need labels and titles you can
rep over here and then I have talked
about the various graph that we have
just discussed so this is my bar graph
so here is the code and this is what a
graph looks like
similarly I have done it for histogram
scatter plots area plots and the pie
plot as well you can also refer to the
numpy tutorial now in this numpy
tutorial I have listed some of the
examples of numpy and some of the
operations as well
I've also compared numpy with the list
and what are the advantages of it so you
can also hear fur to this blog in
section now let me go back to my
presentation and let's see what is my
next library so we have covered
matplotlib now if you are facing any of
the problems in any of the graphs that
have just explained you just comment
down or just let me know I will reply to
you and the earliest so let us move on
to the next life way that is my c bond
library so Seymour library it is a
static code plotting library it is
actually built on top of matplotlib so
it has beautiful default styles it also
works well with pandas dataframe objects
so in C bar library you have variety of
visualization some of them I will be
discussing in this session and some of
them I will discussing in the next
session so in this session I will be
talking about this plot that is the
distribution plot then I will talk about
the joint plot then the pair and the ROC
plot so let me go back to Jupiter let us
implement few of them so here is my
Jupiter
so for c1 as well you first need to
import that so you can go to anaconda
and you can simply type in Conda install
Seaborn if you're not using Jupiter you
can simply type in pip install C pod and
your installation will be done since
I've already imported C pond so I'll not
be showing you the whole process but I
have told you how you can do that now if
you are facing any problems you can just
let me know I can help you with the same
now to import c1 first what I will do I
will type in input C born as SNS and
after that I will be again writing
percentage matplotlib in line so written
this line to see the visualization
inside when Jupiter notebook so I'll run
this so now I will be importing a
dataset so that let me create a data
frame let's say tip
the SNS dot load data set and I am be
importing a leadership bitches tips
and then I need to view the tips as well
so let me type in tips shot head after a
tip taught head and as you can see here
I have seven columns listed over here so
this is in the form of data frame so as
you can see here this is my index value
then I have a column of total bill so
basically in this data set tells me how
many people come in and what is the
total bill and how much tip they gave
then add one more column which says sex
then whether the person is smoker or not
and what time they came then whether
they came for dinner and then the size
of the people who came so this is my
data set now I don't want to read this
data I want to simple visualize it so
I'll be doing I will be creating the
first node that is the disk block or you
can say distribution plot so for that I
can say SN s dot dist plot and inside
this I'm having tip and here I will be
writing a single column of a data frame
let's say I want a distribution graph
for total bill so I will type in the
first column that is total bill and if I
run this I see a graph somewhat like
this now this is the line which is
called as kbe so this is my kernel
density estimation you can also remove
this line so if I type in over here KDE
is equals to false so as you can see
here the line has gone if you want to
change the bin size you can also do that
you can just type in over here bin and
let's say I want the bin which is equal
to let's say 20 so here if you notice so
here if you notice I have a bin size of
20 so this was all about distribution
plot where you can enter just one
variable so here I have added total bill
you can add any other column as well so
this distribution is for only one
variable next let us move on to a second
plot that is my joint plot so if McGinn
go back to Jupiter and let us increment
join plot as well so in join port what I
can do I can simply join or you can say
mode to column and then I can compare
them so this will basically match up my
distribution plot by very data objects
so here it will combine two different
columns this is my joint plot so I will
type in join plot now inside this I need
two variables
let's say I want X which contains one
column let's say total bill and then I
need one more variable which contains
another column let's say let's say the
tip column so I'll type in tip and the
data that we are using is of tips so
I'll type in over here so this is my
data set and now let me just run it so
as you can see here I got a scatter plot
now inside this we have a distribution
plot as well and a scatter plot as with
so as you can see on the y axis we have
tip and on the x axis we have the total
bill now one thing that you can compute
from you is that it is directly
proportional higher is the bill value
higher is the pip now apart from that if
you don't like this scatter plug you can
also change this scatter plot let's say
I don't want the scatter plot and in
spite that I want a hexagonal shape so
what I can do I can type in kind and
inside that I can say X and if I now run
this you can see a hexagonal shape so
you can simply change the argument as X
or you can say hexagonal and the scatter
plot will be converted to hexagons so
here you will be having a p-value so
this graph is quite difficult to
understand whereas in a scatter which is
a default curve is quite easy to
understand
next you can also change this kind to
let's say I need a regression line
so basically regression comes with
linear regression which is also a part
of machine learning so this machine
learning topic we'll be covering later
in my further sessions so we also have a
library in Python which is known as
scikit-learn from where you can
implement machine learning and you can
implement various algorithms such as
linear iteration you can implement
logistic regression and those
functionalities can be obtained in the
now the library that is scikit-learn
so in this case let's say I want a
regression so I will say rec
I need a regression line so if I run
this so you'll see I have a line over
here so this is on the top of scatter
plot because data is the easiest plot
through which the data can be inferred
you can also mention up the kind as KDE
so let me just type in KDE and if I run
this
so this basically shows me the density
where these plots match up the most so
here as you can see this is the most
tendency or you can say the highest
point where it matches up next let us go
to another plot that is a pair plot so
let me go back again to Jupiter I let us
talk about pea plot so I'll type in pea
plot so paper basically draws a
relationship among different data frames
pairwise so I just implement the one for
you and you will be able to understand
this more easily so I say SNS dot pea
plot
and inside that I can write it so if I
click on enter so as you can see here we
got some nine different kind of plots so
here it will basically pair up with all
the columns we have so here if you see
let me just zoom this out so that it
will be more clear so here if you see I
have a size column and a have a total
bill then we have another graph that
compares size with tip then we have
another graph which is a bar graph that
compares size with the size similarly it
compares tip versus total bill then tip
versus tip and then versus size so it
will basically pairs up with all the
columns and it will draws the
relationship between them so using this
pea plot you are able to see different
visualizations of data as it combines
with different possibilities so here in
pea plot we also have one more argument
which is hue so let me just type in so
hue inside that I can add a categorical
variable so categorical means a variable
or you can say the column name which
should be having categories it should
not be a miracle so finally go above and
look at my data say my total bill has
entirely numerical values then I have
sex so sex basically has two categories
which a female and a male so I can
basically use this so this basically
becomes my categorical variable now
going head I can type in hue as sex and
if I click on enter now here as you can
see I have got different colors with
respect to the sex
so here my male is colored blue and
female is colored orange so
compares the same it compares size
versus total bill size versus tip and
all those things on the basis of a
categorical variable that is 6 now you
can also add one more argument that is a
pallet now let's say if you don't like
these colors so what you can do you can
choose any of the pallets from a plot
lip so let's say I have a pallet let's
say coal warm now if I run this I am
having a different color so there are a
lot of pallets so you can choose
according to your own wish now let us
move on to a fourth plot that is my rug
plot so this is my last plot that is
rock plot so rock pot is quite a very
important plot now rock pot is somewhat
similar to your dis prop where you can
only pass a single column so let me just
implement that so SNS dot Rock plot
inside that a liberating tip and I will
be passing just one variable that is
total bill or you can pass on any other
variable as well now if I run this you
will see a graph like this so let me
just zoom this up a bit so this will
basically draw a - mark for every single
point that is along the dist line or you
can see the distribution so this
basically tells me the dashes within a
bin so just like we have a distribution
plot it is quite similar to that because
it only passes a single column or you
can say a single variable so in spite of
having total bills we can have any other
column as well let's say for example I
want tip so I will be writing in here
tips if I just run this I think it is
tip oh yeah I did a mistake by adding
the s let me just go ahead and remove my
s so you see the the ROC plot for the
same has been printed so this was all
about the plots that were used in C Mon
now we have discussed various libraries
such as numpy pandas matplotlib and c
bond so I hope you got a basic
understanding of these libraries just go
ahead guys and implement more examples
of these libraries and you will become
an expert in this I'll also walk you
through the official document of
Seabourn so just go to google and type
in github SIBO and python
so just click on the very first link and
because Seaborn is an open source
library it has been hosted on github so
if you go down you can see different
codes you can read these codes as well
since it is an open source and if you go
a bit down you can see the official
document over here so just click on this
official doc now as you can see here I
have the SIBO and visualizations as I've
shown you in matplotlib we also have
something like gallery over here now
these are some of the graphs that you
can go ahead and implement so let's say
I want to say join plot so this is what
a joint Pro close right so it tells me
the code is well then I have boiling
plot then I have a box plot so this is
my boiling plot I have a code as well
and this is how it looks then I have a
group box plot so these are the
different kinds of plot you can go ahead
and you can just run this so I have
discussed this plot I have discussed
this plot where I've just changed the
kind to hexagonal and all these things
so you can go ahead you can implement
all these plots and can become an expert
in visualizing your data so that's all
with the Seabourn library next let me
just sum it up as to what I have covered
in this session so first I told you the
various reasons as to why you should go
for Python and to an extent we have
implemented that as well we took a look
about analyzing and creating
visualizations we also talked a bit
about machine learning concepts and then
I have introduced you to Python language
and its various features after that I've
shown the installation of Jupiter and
how you can work with Jupiter then we
have discussed the various operators and
data types in Python and finally we
discuss some of the popular libraries in
python such as numpy pandas matt cutlet
and Seabourn so I hope you enjoyed this
session and I was able to contribute
some of my knowledge here so do let me
