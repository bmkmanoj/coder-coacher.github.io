like to show you an application that I
made on Android well it is a game
actually it is a simple game named as
blackjack and some of you might know the
rules and the conditions of the game but
for those who don't know how to play the
game they can read this documentation
that I have created okay
the game is very simple you have to
remember just two things first of all
your score should not exceed 21 and your
score should also be greater than the
computers is called so I am going to
play a simple move here's a slider that
I used for betting and here's your money
which you can bet I place bet and as you
can hear I have included some sound
effects in this game so for scoring the
face value of the card is counted as its
core like for in this case the derailer
score is 4 now in my case there are two
guards and the value is a 10-4 that
makes the score 12 now for the next card
I can click hit the next card is 10 so
my score becomes 22 which is greater
than 21
so I lose instantly so again I am going
to play it and my score is 6 plus a jack
Jack King and Queen these three cards
are counted for 10 points so my score
becomes 16 and the ace is counted for 11
or 1 point which is preferable to you so
again I'm going to click hit and again
my square becomes 21 so I lose other
than that I have also provided some
functionalities like you can change
background and here it is I have seen
the background also you can change
settings like you can turn off the sound
things like that and for the people who
don't know about Android I can tell them
a little so that they can know here is
here is a software called Eclipse in
which Android applications are built so
it's it looks like quite messy in here
but trust me it will get easier when you
start learning so here it is so if there
are four activities which are used in
this game and there are three layouts
that I used and this is the main layout
of my game looks quite familiar except
the cards are not there so gods will
load when game starts and this is the
help layout which I used in the game so
when you will start learning it it will
get easier to understand hello guys this
is my ex and I and I would like to show
you my Android application which I
developed for ed Eureka which starts
with an flash activity which stays on
screen for two seconds and then they
store inventory is displayed which
contains computers monitors and
accessories so that we can add any item
2d card or just CB card as if I click on
C card it says you have nothing in this
card so I have to add elements to it
so to get to any particular product we
just have to traverse from back to next
so if I click on back it says this is
the first model so I have to click on
next so if I choose to buy from welcome
Trumble 175 computers with this price
and need four units of it I just click
on four units and add that to card also
I given it our experts rating bar which
can be helpful for the salesperson to
say
their product by the ratings of the
various models the same can be done for
monitors and accessories if I want to
buy Trimble 17-inch monitor I just click
on Add card and if I finalize the all
the purchase I just click on see cart so
all my purchased products are shown in
the cart with 6.50% sales tax with this
amount and the grand total as there can
be slight change in the sales rate I had
also given it a change button so that
they can change the rate accordingly
let's say it's ten point five and change
the rate and my sales tax amount with
the grand total is adjusted accordingly
with the ten point five percent sales
tax and also now this ten point five
percent rate is fixed from now on for
any purchase for the words so that we
don't have to change eight to ten point
five again and again also if I want to
delete any item I just have to long
click on it it will ask to delete the
item from the cart if I click on delete
the item is deleted and deal so it's the
dealing page where I have to fill all
these entries to go further to finalize
the purchase which I have to fill the
buyers name a valid email ID which I I
haven't given it a valid ID and select a
sales person and if I click on finalize
the purchase it says enter the valid
email ID so I have to enter a valid
email id containing ad rate with the dot
and also the processing date will be get
through the system and click on finalize
the purchase so the order number number
of units grand total with the name of
the customer and the salesperson with
email is shown in the summary
and they purchase details also the order
number will increment for every time
whenever there is a purchase to make so
when I click on pay I will be redirected
to the store inventory page and also I
get a notification which says the order
number and the name of the buyer with
the purchase amount so that it can be
easily accessible for the salesperson to
know which order number was for which
buyer also I had given it a menu
features such as see all transactions
where all the transactions can be seen
and the total sale amount can be seen
also I can delete all these transactions
or just go back if I click on delete all
it will delete all the all these
transactions and redirect me today store
inventory page also if I click on about
us it tells all the information about
the rumble computers with its main
branch and the phone numbers fax numbers
so that salesperson can tell anybody
about anything about for the rumble
computer so if I click on close the app
it will close my application and that's
my Android application so I would like
to thanks a draaga for teaching me how
to develop Android applications by
providing me with online trainings and
various videos related to Android at
aggregate Orton it's very helpful for me
to develop the Android applications
so I heartfully thanks to them thank you
hello friends I'm making this video to
give you all a brief introduction about
my Android app which I have titled as
PNR status now let's go to the app this
is the official Google Play page of my
app the basic motive I had in mind while
developing this was to ease the checking
of the PNR status that most of us do a
lot of time in our usual days for those
among you who aren't very familiar about
what a PNR number is let me tell you P n
R stands for passenger name record
basically it can be treated as a unique
reference number for our railway ticket
and on the basis of which we can fetch
the current status of our railway
reservation at any time now usually most
of us either go to the official website
which is very painful especially for the
mobile browsers or try to send the SMS
in emergencies and in the end we usually
forget what to send and on what number
to send etc guys disappear is the
solution to all of those problems now
let's go through the app once and figure
out how does it actually work now for
the development purpose we will be
switching to the IBM Eclipse environment
which is generally used for the Android
development purposes now as you can see
the name of the project is PNR in query
and we will be launching it on an
android emulator of the target version
4.0.3 that is also known as the Ice
Cream Sandwich now I'm running it you
can see the name of the virtual devices
eyes and the target is 4.0.3 now double
clicking it we will be launching it on
the Android emulator and the main
activity screen will be brought to front
on the main screen here as you can see
this is the icon of the app that is also
set as the background and this here is
the text box which is showing the hint
that you have to enter your 10-digit PNR
number here the first radio button is
for choosing the internet more and the
second mode is the SMS mode the internet
mode is recommended as it is generally
fast in free for those who have the data
connection and this is the button which
you have to press to get the status now
we will try to fetch the current status
of a PNR number first we will enter the
number here
as you see if the number is not ten
digits long it shows you the warning and
prompts you to enter again
now if we try to use the SMS service it
shows us the warning message are you
sure to use SMS mode the standard
charges may apply usual rate by
Government of India is 3 rupees but it
totally depends on your network operator
we will cancel this and he was the
recommended mode that is the internet
mode as we click on the check PNR status
button it shows us fetching PNR status
and ask us to wait as you can see on the
resultant screen our lovely indian
railway mascot titi Balu comes with our
pian our status it shows the train
number the train name boarding date from
2 reserved up to boarding point class
that is slipper it also shows the status
of all the passengers individually which
in this case there is only one passenger
then it shows the charting status that
the chart is prepared or not and in in
the end it shows the warning that the
current status may upgrade or downgrade
at a later stage it basically shows all
the information that is required by a
PNR number now we go back to our main
screen next time you want to check the
status you don't have to remember the
number the app does it for you
when you enter just the first digit of
your number it shows you the traditions
that match you can select from them and
check the status
as you see I select from the suggested
numbers and press done now you can check
the spinner status here it also has a
special screen layout for the landscape
mode as you can see when we switch to
the landscape mode everything adjusts
itself automatically and it all looks
nice and beautiful now let's have a
little code walk through and familiarize
ourselves with the basic project
structure as you can see the project
basically has two activities and three
other Java classes among them the PNR
inquiry activity is the activity that
handles the main screen and the show
status activity handles the results
screen the operator class displays a
request to user to rate the app after a
certain term of use and the other two
classes the my SQLite helper and PNR
datasource help in performing the
database operations the project
basically has two xml layout the main
layout for the main screen and the
statist layout representing the results
screen as you can see in the android
manifest file it supports all SDK
versions from 3 to 16 that is Android
version 1.5 to 4.1 the jelly beans the
current version it requires only 2
permission from the user first
permission is the internet permission
for the internet mode and second is the
send SMS permission from the SMS mode it
also supports all type of screen density
and every type of small and big screens
now I'm going to show you some ways to
quickly find my app first you should
open the Google Play and in the search
box type Wartburg dot p and r dot
inquiry that's the package name of our
project and click search you will
quickly find a link to our app that is
PNR status by word book another way to
find the app is to go to the categories
tab and go into the transportation

the fourth number this is our app PNR

application icon it will take you to the
official page of the app as you can see
you can have a quick view about the
progress of the app as it is evident the
app has crossed the 10,000 download Mart
in less than 25 days and the reviews are
also good the rating out of five is four
