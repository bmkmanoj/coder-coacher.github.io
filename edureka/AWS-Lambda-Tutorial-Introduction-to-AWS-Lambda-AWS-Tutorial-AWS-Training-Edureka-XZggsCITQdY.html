today's session is going to be all about
AWS lambda so without making any further
ado let's move on to today's agenda to
understand what all will be covered
today so we'll start up today's session
by discussing the main services in the
AWS compute domain after that we're
going to see why AWS lambda is as a
separate service we're going to discuss
what AWS lambda actually is and then
we'll move on to the part where we'll
see how you can use a double s lambda
using the AWS as the case once we're
done with that I'll teach you guys how
you can integrate your SDK with the
Eclipse IDE and in the end we'll be
doing a demo so let me quickly show you
guys how we will be using AWS lambda in
today's demonstration
so again this is a website that I
created which is hosted on the localhost
now what does Deb site does is it
uploads a file on the dh3 file system
now once the file is uploaded it sends
me a mail regarding that now that mean
is generated by aw saga now let me
quickly show you how that mail actually
looks like so let me upload a file over
here so let file be this I click on open
and the for uploading image I will show
you my Inbox
so as us now I don't have any emails as
you can see right so what I'll do is I
click on upload image now it says s3
upload complete now what this website
does is it will upload my file it will
rename the file according to the system
time so that there is no conflict in the
name of the object right so whatever
file that I've uploaded right now will
be uploaded on in this bucket so if i
refresh this you can see that this file
over here right so this file has now
been renamed right and I also have an
email over here it says EWS ACS test
right so if I click on this email I can
see that I have called a mail from this
address saying that an object has been
uploaded the name of the object is this
the size of the object is this the
bucket name is this and it will flash
modified on 12/31 UPC right so let me
quickly compare whether this file name
is the same so it's 7 for 8 and it's a
send for it here as well awesome
now the next cool thing that you can do
over here is you can move this file to
some other folder so all you have to do
is you will reply to this mail by saying
move you click on send now when I send
move to this email address that I've
configured in my code what it does is it
will basically move this file from this
bucket to some other bucket so let me
quickly refresh it and see whether my
file has been moved
so as you can see my bucket is now empty
now let me go back so basically my file
was there in Lu Rekha demo now it will
be there in quarantine demo bucket so as
you can see 748 file has now we'll move
to the quarantine demo by simply writing
a mail over here it says move so we'll
be creating this demo today right so
guys this is our agenda for today
are we clear with it alright so Dustin
says yes others
Kevin is clear as well Michelle the big
are you see alright guys so since most
of you are clear let's move on to the
first topic of today's discussion that
is the AWS compute domain so the main
services are under this domain are easy
to elastic Beanstalk and AWS lambda now
among these three the most important
service is easy to so easy to is
basically just like a raw server it is
like a personal computer that you're
working on remotely right so it can
install any kind of operating system of
your choice which is supported by the
AWS infrastructure and then you can use
it in any manner as you want you can
configure it to become a web server you
can configure it to become a workout
your environment anything a next service
is elastic Beanstalk which is an
automated version of ec2 so with the
elastic Beanstalk you don't get the
excess to the operating system but you
still have a control over the
configuration of your system so you can
choose what kind of instance you wanna
launch right so elastic Beanstalk is
used to deploy an application so
basically you just upload your code and
then application is deployed on the AWS
infrastructure right so this is what a
lasting Beanstalk is all about then we
have the AWS lambda service so the
lambda service is again an automated
version of ec2 wherein you don't get the
access to the operating system with the
universe lambda you don't even have the
choice to choose what kind of
configuration you want with your server
type so bowdabra lambda you just have to
upload your code and it executes it's
that simple
but then why do we have any
ws lamda service when we have elastic
beam strong so let us understand that so
II W is lambda like I told you guys it
is an automated version of PC to just
like elastic beanstalk but then with AWS
lambda you can only execute background
tasks that you cannot deploy an
application so a SS lambda is not used
to deploy an application it is used to
execute background tasks other than that
like I told you guys you don't have to
choose the configuration in a lab lace
lambda you don't have to choose what
kind of service you want depending on
your workload the kind of configuration
the server configuration is assigned to
you right so this is why we use AWS
lambda but then let's go on to the
definition part and see what AWS lambda
actually is so according to its
definition it's a surveillance compute
service because you're not choosing the
servers right you're not choosing what
kind of configuration you want in your
server
it's a serverless compute service you
just a product code and a code is
executed it's that simple right and also
like it's mentioned in the definition
and I told you guys again again it is
used to execute background tasks it does
not use deploy in African guys this is
the main difference between elastic
beanstalk and AWS chakra so as an
architect you should know what the use
case is and this service will suit it
better so moving on now if you have
understood what AWS lamda actually is
and why do we use it right so let's move
ahead to see how you can use this
service so you can use this service
using the software development kits
which are provided by AWS so before
moving ahead and understanding how you
can use the skills let us understand
what these kits are all about so the
software development kits are basically
api's which are used by developers to
connect to the desired service at the
wall so it makes the life of the
developer easy because he can now
concentrate on the logical part of his
application rather than wasting time on
understanding how he can connect his
code to the
the service which is there on AWS right
the other part is that these SDKs I'll
use with IDs right so currently we have
only two IDs which are supported that is
Eclipse and visual studio so today in
this session I'm going to teach you guys
how you can connect your SDKs with the
Eclipse IDE so let's do that
so before that we are going to configure
are we going to code our a SS and of
function and Java right and that is the
reason we are using Eclipse now first of
all you have to install eclipse on a
system once you do that this is the
Eclipse screen guys this is how your
Eclipse dashboard will look like so for
installing AWS SDK on your Eclipse you
have to click on help and then you will
go to install new software once you have
Reese here you'll enter the website name
that is aws.amazon.com slash Eclipse
once you have entered that just hit
enter and it'll list you guys all the
SDKs which are available all the tools
which are available select all the tools
and click on finish and then it will
take some time to download the SDK but
then it will integrate everything into
your Eclipse and then you'll have a
button like this over here right so with
this button you can actually deploy a
new server which is configured according
to AWS so guys this is how you install
SDKs with IDE alright guys so it's time
for the demo now enough of theory so
what we'll be doing is our aim is to
create an application which will be
uploading our files onto the s3
filesystem and what a lambda function
here it will be doing is so like I told
you guys lambda function basically
execute your background task right so
that we don't want to burden server on
which the website is hosted with this
task we want some other server to
execute this task what is this task we
basically want to get an email with all
the details of the file which has just
been uploaded on the s3 file system so
that email will be sent by the lambda
server now once you get that email if
you reply to that email that
file has to be moved lambda will pick up
that email it will read that email and
you perform the necessary operation so
if we specify move what will basically
do is it will pick that file move it to
some other bucket and store it over
there so this is the project that we'll
be doing right now sounds simple right
but let me show you the architecture let
me explain you what the architecture
tells you so basically this is our
website so whatever site we'll be doing
is it will be uploading a file onto the
SD filesystem at the same time it will
also be making an entry into the sqs
which is nothing but a simple queue so
switch queues your data right so as soon
as your file is uploaded onto s 3 s 3 s
bucket is configured in a way to invoke
the lambda function now as soon as the
lambda function is invoked now lambda
functions are stateless they don't know
anything about what file you have
uploaded or what we have done you have
to feed them information and that is the
reason we have updated the entry in su s
or the file which has recently been
uploaded right so what AWS lambda will
do is it will read this queue and we'll
get the file name and we'll actually
retrieve all the properties from that
file name from s3 now once it has
retrieved all the file names all the
properties of that file it will actually
mail me using the SES service in AWS the
details of that file now once I did
receive the details of that file I have
an option to reply to that email right
now how will I reply to this email is
like this so I will open the email
client on my computer and I will reply
to that email that email will actually
go to that address which is actually
pointed to my DNS server and that DNS
server will actually redirect that email
to ACS now ses on receiving that email
has been configured to invoke the lambda
function that lambda function will be
invoked again the file will read from
the sqs that file will be moved to a new
bucket and in the end that message will
be deleted by SQL now my su s has been
configured like this
that in case I don't reply to that email
within two or three minutes that message
will automatically be deleted from the
queue and in that case if you try to
move that file you will not be allowed
to do so because that file is no longer
available in the cube hence you cannot
move it right so this is what our
project is going to be all about now I
have already showed you how the project
works so let me quickly delete the
project and again show you how it can be
configured from scratch right so give me
a moment
all right so everything is set now the
first thing that I'll be doing is I'll
be configuring my a3 to interact with my
lambda function right so what I'm not
done is I'm not deleted the lambda
function because there is no point you
just have to click Next and your
function will be created what matters is
the code so I have uploaded the code in
your LMS with the proper documentation
if you have any doubts you can actually
email me regarding that doubt and I'll
clear it for you so as an architect your
job will be to architect this
architecture not coding the coding part
it has to be done by the AWS developer
but it is a good to know knowledge right
so that is the reason I have uploaded
the code for the web site on AWS and out
to your LMS so if you have any doubts
you can always ping me and I will be
happy to answer your queries ok so like
I said I have to configure my s3 so that
it can interact with AWS number now my
website's code is like this that it will
upload the file to a bucket and s3
called eddy rake our demo right so what
we'll be doing is we'll be going to the
le rake our demo bucket
which is here I click on the ID Academy
bucket I'll click on properties' I'll
click on events and let me delete this
event right now right so I will be
adding a notification now now let me
call this notification as AWS - lambda'
right now what I want it to do is
whenever the event is a put event that
is an app load event I want it to send a
notification to my lambda function so I
have to select the lambda function so my
function should be this one and I'll
click on save let me check if everything
has been filled
it has so let's click on save alright so
I have one active notifications now now
you might get an error over here saying
that you don't have sufficient
permissions so if you get that error on
the right hand side we will have a
button called add permission just click
on that button and everything will open
happen automatically basically those
permissions are for your lambda function
your lambda function may not have
permissions to get notification from se
but once you click on that button you
will get the proper notifications
automatically right so this is how you
will configure your s3 bucket now let's
go back to a slide to see what other
things we have to do so we have
configured our s3 to invoke a lambda
function once a file is uploaded to a3
now our lambda has already been
configured to interact with ACS through
the code which is - so through the code
we'll be calling the ACS service and
we'll be living in a meal now the next
function or the next thing is to
configure SES or before that let's
configure our sqs right so our sqs is
basically a simple queue service so we
have to create a queue in sqs in which
our website will be uploading of files
right so let's do that let us go back to
our dashboard so this is our dashboard
guys and we will go to the sqs service
we'll click on create new Q C for Q and
that Q has to be named as hello - lambda
it's a FIFO queue you have to give the
extension as dot FIFO all is done let's
click on quick create queue
okay so my cue has now been created and
now I have to configure this cue so that
whenever the message comes in it gets
automatically deleted after two minutes
right so let us configure it so we'll
click on configure cue and we set this
to two minutes all right all it's done
let's click on Save Changes all right so
my cue has also been configured let me
go back to my slide all right so my SQS
has been configured now so let me
configure my SES now now this might be a
little tricky so hang on with me we'll
go back to the dashboard we'll go to the
ACS service
now first of all in the ACS so is you
actually have to add the email addresses
now how will you are the email addresses
you will actually have to verify a new
an email address now you have to verify
the GCP end as well so since I want to
receive the email from the SES service I
will have to type in my email address
which is Haman at the rate of the rate
derecho and we will have to verify this
email address
now I'll receive a verification email on
him and after a daily recorder cause let
me quickly go back click on inbox now
I've got a very recreation request right
so I'll click on this verification link
okay so my email address has now been
configured has now been verified so this
is congratulations awesome so let me go
back to my SES say spending verification
let me quickly refresh it all right so
it says verified now now let's go back
to a slide alright so guys we have
configured the recipient of SES but what
about the sender right so we have to
configure the sender as well because and
why do we have to configure the sender
and the sender has to be a domain name
that you own right because you have to
own that domain name so that you can
send emails via that domain name now
what I mean by that is you may say that
okay why not use the recipient address
on the why not use him another 8080
record or go for sending the email but
our application also receives emails if
you would have noticed right so for
receiving the emails through SES you
have to actually own the domain name now
since I'm an employee I don't own any
record code right
so what I've done is I have actually
created a domain name I can get a free
domain name from this website which is
my dot dot dot TK you can go on this
website and create a domain for yourself
for free so basically you will be
getting this domain name free for three
months all right
I am almost from the expanded so I might
have to renew it okay but since this is
a lemon let me quickly show you alright
so I have actually created this domain
name and I can use this domain name to
send or receive emails now what I'll
have to do how we will configure this in
my CSS like this so you will go to your
SES you see this tab which says email
even right so I'll click on rule sets
and you'll have to create a new rule set
before that you have to actually verify
a domain you basically have to verify
that the domain is actually owned by you
now how you will do that you'll click on
verify a new domain and you will give
your domain name here which is any
record or TK click on verify this domain
and you will get these two records over
here now where will you enter these two
records is actually in the DNS server so
the domain name Eddie record or TK has
to point to a DNS server right and in
that DNS server you will be putting in
these two records now how will you point
any record or TK to a DNS server so DNS
server is basically route 53 right so
we'll be configuring loud 53 with a
delay karate yell that means for you
quickly how you can do that let me open
my router PC service so this is my
router 50 service I don't have any
hosted drone that is mom so let's click
on get started now click on create
hosted zone so my domain name is any
record or decayed right click on create
all right so I have created a hosted
zone now in my route 53 now what I'll
have to do is I'll have to connect this
domain to my route 53 now how would you
do that you will click on manage domain
and you will click on management tools
and you click on name servers right
so these name servers have to be updated
with the name servers provided you over
here right so let me quickly show you so
you will copy this paste it here
remember guys don't include the dot in
the end otherwise it will give you an
error
so without the dot copy the name server
right so I'll first save too and see if
it's working click on change name server
all right phase changes saved
successfully all right so it's saving
the server's now so let me copy the last
two as well
all right so I've copied my name Phyllis
I click on change name servers and
fingers crossed
ok so it says changes saved successfully
all right so my domain name is now
pointing to route 53 awesome so now in
route 53 I have to include these records
now how will I do that let me quickly
show you so you go to the out 53 and you
will click on create record set now you
don't have to type anything here just in
the type click on MX and in the value so
as you can see there's a value for M X
over here just copy this value and paste
it here
alright this is it guys nothing has to
be done here click on create awesome so
I have a MX record now now lets you have
to create one more record set
and that name has to be like this right
so I'll copy this part paste it here as
you can see now the name is underscore
Amazon ACS dot Eddie record or TK and as
you can see the name over here is to
sing right so this name has to be the
same and the type of value is txt we'll
select ext from here and then you have
to enter the value so the value is this
enter this value over here and click on
create
awesome so my route 53 is now configured
to act least two actors receive the
emails from the ad Erica Tek doum good
so we'll go back to an SES now close it
it says pending verification refresh it
alright so as you can see my domain name
is now verified alright so let us go to
the rule sets now so email receiving we
have to configure so I click on View
active rule set there is no rule set so
I create a rule now I have to specify a
recipient so let me specify hello at the
rate Eddy record or TK right I'll click
on add recipient so my verification
status is verified because my domain
name is verified now we'll click on next
step now what action do you want it to
do right so if you receive email on this
email ID what do you want to do so what
we want to do is we want to invoke a
lambda function
now what lambda function do you want to
invoke I want to invoke my function -
and we'll click on next step so
everything seems fine we'll click on
next step again so it is ask me the rule
name let me give the rule name as lambda
- demo click on next step and click on
create rule
okay so my rule set has now been enabled
awesome so I have configured my SES as
well so let me go back to my slide
all right so I've configured my ICS I
have configured Matt out 53 I've
configured my AWS lambda I have
configured my sqs I have configured my
s3 and my website is also configured
right so weekly utilize qsq so we may
have to change the URL in our code let's
quickly do that I will go back here go
to the dashboard click on SQS
all right so this is our queue and this
is our URL so basically I have named the
queue same so if you do that sometimes
the URL don't change so let me see if I
have to upload the code or not
so I go to my lambda function handler go
to the part where my queue is saved all
right let me anyways basic you were here
I think it is the same yes it is the
same and it is let us save it
this is my function 1 so let me upload
the call now
so it's my function
and click on finish
right so it is uploading the function
right now so meanwhile let me go to my
function - and configure in the queue
address which is this
paste it here controllers save it and
once this process is complete I will
upload this code as well so while this
is uploading let me change the address
in my index file as well this is my
website index file
so I'll go to the queue URL which is
this I will change it save it and close
it all right so my website address has
also been done all right so my code is
uploaded for this function let me upload
the code for function two as well
because they may change upload function
to AWS so it is my function - that is my
function - in lambda click on next and
click on finish alright so my code is
being uploaded let's wait a while so
that my code gets uploaded and then we
can proceed with our demonstration
all right so my code has now been
uploaded to both my lambda functions now
what I do is I will go to my local host
website click on refresh
I will upload a file so let me go back
and see what is there in my bucket right
now so that it becomes easier for us to
verify there our file has an uploader so
as of now my bucket is empty I there's
nothing in my head or a car demo bucket
and my other bucket is quarantine demo
this is a place where my other file will
go it let me empty this as well so that
we are clear that some object has been
added all right so this bucket has also
been clear
so we'll go to our localhost we'll
choose a file so let's upload some image
so let it be this match right I click on
open and click on Apple image all right
so it says s3 upload complete all right
so let me check if a file has been added
in my lyric a demo bucket I seek only
fresh
awesome so one file has been added and
it's called one four nine two five four
six zero nine seven let me check in my
email so let me check if I got an email
so yes I've got an email let me click on
it alright so this is the name of the
file that I got which is the same right
so let me see if there is something in
my quarantine demo bucket so there's
nothing there I'll come back now I'll
reply to this email as move
so this basically means move my files or
some other bucket and I'm replying it to
hello at the rate add your a card or TK
right so now we've hit on send so my
message has been sent to route 53 which
will be sent to ACS which will invoke
the lambda function this will move my
file to the other bucket so let us check
if that is done so first let us check if
I ready rekha demo bucket has been
emptied so we'll click on refresh
alright
so my idea rekha bucket has now been
emptied let's go back and check us
anything has been add in my quarantine
demo bucket alright guys so my file has
successfully moved to this bucket let us
verify the name so this is one four nine
two five four six zero nine seven let us
check that in the email so the email
that we applied to have the object name
as one four nine two five four six zero
nine seven so this is the same file guys
alright so we have completed our
demonstration successfully any doubts
guys in any other part that you executed
today any doubt and I will create it
again so please go ahead of the question
all right so Mariana is saying thank you
you're welcome Mariana Dare is saying
