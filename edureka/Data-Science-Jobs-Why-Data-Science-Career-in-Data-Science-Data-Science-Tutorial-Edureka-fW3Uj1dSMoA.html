what data Sciences how it is being used
to in today's world what are the
opportunities job opportunities you have
in this and we also would take an
example of clustering and use the
digital oh how data science helps in
predicting a lot of things that we let's
start with more data sciences and let's
start with some applications that are
today use popularly in a designs the
first application you see is a wine
recommendation system this is a
application where you would be going in
and reading different kinds of wines and
based on the ratings you provided for
other types of wines it is going to come
back and recommend you finds that you
might like and so what it is trying to
do here is that it is collecting data
about you
what kind of wines you like what ratings
you give for the different our wine
brands out there it also collects the
same kind of data for other users of the
same system so what it does is uses this
information to try matches or ha he
tries to match with similar kind of
people with similar kind of tastes and
then try to see what the other people
like and then recommend those brands for
you this is a part of supervised machine
learning a second example that you see
instead of Pisa had a piece I had as you
know it has a number of locations in a
given City and then they do a lot of
dough delivery as you know that they
have offers time then would deliver you
but yeah
able to offer something like within 30
minutes or 30 minutes or 60 minutes so
many Louisa hurt they have a number of
locations and a given City and then they
have to deliver the pizza to their
various people who are ordering by phone
and they want to minimize the amount of
travel that that pasar delivery guys
have to do so what they try to do is
they try to locate their hot locations
in such a way that the travel time is
minimized so whenever they want to start
a new branch allocation the city they
use machine learning to find out the
most optimal location that would
minimize the amount of travel that there
is hot guys have to do the route
application you would see is used by
Netflix Netflix is has been one of the
most leading and pioneering users of
data signs in Netflix what happens is
people log in to magnetics they view a
lot of movies the view and they read a
lot of movies and that fix tries to find
what the preference of their movie
fevers are based on what kinds of
channel their watch like is it comedy or
tragedy or or action movies and it looks
at what actors the users prefer
actresses directors length of the movie
and then based on that it tries to find
a profile of you which says that this
particular person likes movies like this
and when the next movie of the same kind
of profile comes out it comes and offers
you saying that ok here is a movie that
you might like it's the same kind of
algorithm that you will see being used
by Amazon also because what Amazon does
is whenever you log in to Amazon based
on your purchase history as well as your
viewing history it tries to make
recommendations on what kind of things
you might like
a fourth application is what Google does
in when you're doing any kind of Google
search whether you are doing a Google
search you will try to you see that
based on the Google search text event it
tries to give a list of links for the
news or images or videos what it does is
it tries to group together similar news
items and similar images and similar
videos by using clustering algorithms
wherein it fight looks at the words that
are being used in the news cast to see
which news articles are related to one
another and which are not specified when
you enter a search condition it comes
back and tells you which are the similar
ones that are being used so there is of
course data science is getting used in
even sports also if some of you have
seen a movie called Moneyball Moneyball
uses data science in order to win
baseball matches so it is also being
used in sports heavily - and this is a
comic of you know that people are using
dinner aside today as we get our
insights so try doing something totally
different to kind of put them off
balance so what is common in all these
applications so in all these
applications the first thing you see is
there is a lot amount of data and large
amount of unstructured data that needs
to be stored that pays to be organized
and integrated and processed and once
you have this data in a in a good
forehead then you have to sit and
analyze this data a large volume of data
to gain insights and knowledge from it
and based on this inside some knowledge
you try to predict the future based on
this data so when you look at machine
learning the main main application of
machine learning in is what we call
predictive analytics but just use the
past data to predict the future if you
look at Wikipedia Wikipedia has a
definition of data science of course
there's a lot of definitions floating
around on what data Sciences in general
it is the ability for you to extract
meaning out of data and use that in your
situation so what are the kind of tools
that we use in machine learning storage
of data of course is done using Hadoop
and you also use tools such as AR and ma
who as a part of processing analyzing
and extracting the data so this
particular webinar is a precursor to the
data science course offered by ADA Rekha
and in this course you'll be learning
about these machine learning techniques
and how you use R and to use machine
learning in order to extract
so there is a large demand and supply
gap with respect to demand for data
scientists and this is a survey that is
done by Gartner which says that there
are four point four million IT jobs
locally to support Big Data by 2015 and
only one-third of the requirements are
today being made by the people available
so obviously in the world you will see a
lot of programs coming up in order to
develop science skills and data
scientists are not something that you
would learn in your bachelor's degree
because they are a little more complex
than what you would learn in at that
particular level we need to have some
amount of business knowledge and that
there has to be a lot of logical
application that is required in order to
use a data science so of course the
child is not a challenge there is to
find a people who know this and know how
to use this machine learning algorithms
there are a lot of jobs within the data
science field itself like we read as
scientists transformation algorithm the
visualizer who produces graphics out of
the data the research analyst who looks
at the results of the machine learning
to come up with some insights the
engineer who's basically is involved in
taking raw data and converting them into
processed data there are architects who
sit and architect this this architect
the solution and the big data analysis
like the researchers again looking at
data for insights
moving on to the next slide this is a
job trend list that has come from
indeed.com and what you see here is that
there is an exponential growth in in the
job or in the pool today when I say
exponential you will see that there's a
huge up in demand and why is that a
lobster and a huge up in this demand
machine learning techniques have been
there in this world for 50 60 years
but so far they have been only used in
pretty advanced fields like like
national security was one play one field
has used stock markets places where that
is because machine learning techniques
to implement them it needs a lot of CPU
power a lot of memory a lot of disk
space and those kind of technologies
were not available for comment until now
so the advent of Hadoop where you are
able to store and process large amount
of unstructured data is kind of a
kickstart for this particular usage and
then of course you have machine power
today available memory available and
there are new types of databases no SQL
databases that are coming out that can
use unstructured data and be capable to
give you meaningful information so what
has happened as a part of the because of
this as regular businesses enterprises
who sell products to customers now all
of a sudden want to use machine data in
order to understand that potential
customers and past customers and current
customers and be able to offer more
services and be able to sell more goods
and they already have a lot of data that
they are capturing the databases and in
the backups and stuff like that all of a
sudden the amount of mind that data get
more information and want to see how
they can use the information they have
to be able to
generate more amount of insights
