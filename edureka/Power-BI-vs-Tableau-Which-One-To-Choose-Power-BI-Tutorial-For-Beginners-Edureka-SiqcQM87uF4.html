and i welcome you all to today's session
today we are going to discuss two of the
most talked-about tools in the business
intelligence and data visualization
market
yes I'm referring to power bi and
tableau but before we get into the
details of these two tools let's quickly
take a look at today's agenda like we
always do in all of my sessions when I
would be discussing these two tools
based on these parameters that is
visualization cost of ownership
integration data management and finally
functional comparison now for functional
comparison I've again jotted down few
parameters and we would be discussing
these two tools based on those
parameters as well so let's not waste
any time and get started with this
discussion lab visualization well it
completely boils down to your preference
so let us take a look at these two tools
one-by-one first we have power bi now if
you're looking for something called as
custom vigils then power bi is a clear
winner why because it has opened up its
SDK for visualization and that has given
you more custom visuals plus it has
great drag and drop features it has good
data import capabilities that is why if
you're looking for custom visuals any
days Bobbie has a winner here as far
established concerned it gives you pure
visualization if you have somebody who
likes the curated approach or more
cleanly kind of an approach you can
always go for tableau why is that
because it would give you create drill
down features it would give you amazing
visualizations so as far as
visualization is concerned yes if you
ask me for my opinion I would say
tableau is a clear winner next we have
cost so when you take a look at cost we
have to consider something called as the
initial cost now if you ask about
initial costs power bi wins why because
it is way cheaper compared to tableau if
you compare its next of user cost if you
compare its web user cost server node
power bi is a winner here but then this
is not the only cost you should take
into consideration when you talk about
business intelligence you have to
consider other costs costs that can be
considered on the longer-run so are
there any other parameters which we can
consider for the longer and cost yes
definitely and if you compare those
parameters like labor costs total cost
of delivery and all those things this is
where I feel tab
or has little more heads compared to
power bi why because on the longer and
many compare it's labor costs it's total
usage cost and all those things even
though your initial cost is more tableau
gives you more affordable kind of a
software when you look at from the
longer-run perspective are the total
cost of ownership perspective so if you
ask me from my opinion again I would be
using the longer an thing and for now
tableau is even earlier as well third on
this list we have integration now
intubation again it kind of boils down
to perspective like dividual as in
factored it this is because these two
serve completely different
functionalities if you take a look at
power bi it gives you great integration
capabilities how it acts more like a
Swiss Army knife that is it readily
integrates with various other tools now
it's a Microsoft product and there are
various other Microsoft products in the
market that various businesses use and
since power bi lets you integrate with
these two tools it kind of has an edge
over tableau because it can integrate
with various tools like you have
reporting services Excel SharePoint and
all those things so all in all when you
talk about integration capabilities yes
power bi gives you a lot more options
tableau and Dada and it takes in more of
a scalpel kind of an approach or a
surgeon like approach where if you are
dealing with a particular defined kind
of a problem or you need more curated
kind of an approach then you should go
for tableau which gives you sleek and
clean visualizations but if your main
aim is integration yes tableau is a
great tool but Fabia has to win here so
if you ask me for my work yes it would
go for power bi definitely next we have
something called as data management now
when you talk about data management you
have to talk about data shaping data
modeling data analytics and all those
things let's take a look at those one by
one data shaping power bi great tableau
it's good but power bi it's great why it
has something called as query editor
that uses M language and basically it
lets you do so many things with ease and
you do not have to worry about switching
into excel every now and then because
you
we are gonna take care of it there and
there so yes it does help you and if you
ask about tableau even the people who
used have load comprehension that this
too much to and fro between excel and
tableau if there was a solution for it
it would have been much better so when
you talk about data shaping power bi
wins data modeling again power bi stove
in your Y Dax
power pivot and that SQL framework
basically which it has definitely gives
it an edge when you talk about data
modelling analytics again power bi why
because pavia is very fast yes it does
not have a screen and curated approach
as tableau but overall data management
if he asked for my vote any day power bi
next on this list we have something
called as functional parameters so what
are those parameters when these are few
of the parameters which I have gone
ahead and jotted down we have the year
of establishment now tableau had a great
head start here because it started 10
years prior to power bi but bobbya is
kind of catching up but if you talk
about overall organizational approach
for a data visualization tool tableau
has more experience compared to power bi
but phobia is definitely catching up
applications now as I've already
mentioned custom visualizations or more
open source approach is what you are
looking for Fabia is your thing more
curated and clean approach tableau so if
you need something like custom visual
stay dashboards you can go for power bi
ad-hoc analysis and longer and
operations related to data visualization
tableau users well as far as my personal
experience is concerned tableau is
little difficult to learn when you
compare it with power bi power bi is
much easier to learn and it is for the
wider applications given the integration
capabilities it has but that is a
personal opinion I don't want you to
jump into that because people who have
used more table might find tableau
easier to use so that kind of boils down
to your preference really if you ask me
I like power bi model and you talk about
ease of use I have had varying opinions
for people as well so you are the
bestest and you are the one to decide on
those things support tab Levin said
clearly it has better support compared
to power yet scalability good power bi
is good but tableau is great if you talk
about applications on the longer and
better scaling tableau has to win yeah
infrastructure again both take a
completely different approach your power
bi gives you SaaS kind of an approach
which is software as a service
whereas tableau gives you more flexible
kind of an approach where you're free to
like or not flee but more flexible kind
of an approach BC T so these are the
parameters I felt that we should have
discussed there quite a few other
parameters where these two tools can be
compared and as I've already mentioned
that these two tools are very
neck-and-neck or very close to each
other these are two of the most talked
about those are the hottest tools when
you talk about business intelligence and
it would be unfair to say this is
actually a winner or that is a clear
winner it actually boils down to your
preference the best way for you to
decide is to go ahead and use both of
these two tools those are readily
available to you and very easy to learn
so you can pick those and they sell it
on your own which tool is good for you a
great for you and that would also depend
on the problem statements which you have
or which you need to solve as far as
this video is concerned I just wanted to
give you a picture as in how do these
two tools fare based on these parameters
I hope you all have liked this vide and
I hope to see you all again as far as
this video goes this is where we end
this session thank you bye bye
I hope you have enjoyed listening to
