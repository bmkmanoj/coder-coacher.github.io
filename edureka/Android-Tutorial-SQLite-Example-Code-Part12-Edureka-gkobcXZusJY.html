class which is a normal java class took
out a few constants life the database
name here i have named as names dot DB
the versioning since this is my very
first version of the database i have
were shouldn't it add 1 then the table
name what is the table name of the
database I have said it as TV underscore
names and I told you I have to have a
sequel I'd open helper so I have created
an inner class here which is the sequel
I'd open helper class and this extends
the sequel I'd open helper so whenever I
will be extending the sequel I'd open
helper what I will be getting is a
beginning and uncreate and I will be
getting in on upgrade so in the oncreate
what I'm doing is I'm executing a sequel
query here which says create table with
the table name and the table name is
named stodgy be alright TB underscore
name sorry then I'm doing it an
identifier I'm given an IV which is of
the type integer and this is the primary
key here and this primary key will be
Auto incrementing that has as many
nothing the number of items and will be
key keep on incrementing itself then I'm
doing doing a name of name field here
which is text and it should not be null
similarly numbers and it should not
mineral and here on the on on update I'm
actually dropping the table if it exists
exists not as it is already present and
I will just call the oncreate again
alright so this is what i'm doing here
then what i have done is i have created
various methods here here i have created
a secure ID open helper object here on
the top and i'm actually creating a new
secure ID open helper with the context
step so the context SQL s the contacts
that i am using it and I just open up
this context SQL that is the sequel I'd
open helper object for actually
performing some write operations on the
database alright i have created the
method here close which will be actually
closing of the database connection you
very much like opening and closing
elections and
creating here then I have few methods
here which is insert update delete and
the get string so let's talk about the
insert method M so in the insert method
what I am doing is I'm having the insert
method used on the sea polite open
helper object which will be inserting
something on to the database with the
help of the table name and the values
that I'm passing you know so i will just
talk about what all values and how i
will be passing values so i go on to the
main activity here into the main
activity when talk about i have taken
the references of these buttons and the
Edit boxes and i have again use the same
insert dot that is all the cliq
listeners on the ton of the items and
then i have placed methods we need them
alright so i'll just run the sub once
and then i will be actually using it up
in my application so that you can have
someone standing as to what is being
done here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
