and project management for around 15
years now working with data is my
passion I got interested with big data
started gathering some knowledge about
Big Data I know that is what I wanted to
do surfing the internet I was going to
the Google that is when I came across a
Eureka Eureka looked organized very well
organized so all the sessions are
interesting and the doubts were verified
then in there the same session the
instructor-led training was interesting
he had hands-on experience with big data
and I gathered lot of knowledge there is
a chat session so you can raise your
questions so the entire process was very
good so I've dated my skin a deer a path
words set of use cases for the beginners
so I'd say that it's a good platform to
start with the instructor-led training
whatever is recorded is always available
print focus and support but very
different
any technical problems in setting up the
software setting up the system so I do
you recall always there currently when I
have my project is in big data and it
helps mean understanding better since I
have updated my skill executing my work
related to big data very smoothly and
efficient yeah I always enjoyed working
with queries whenever I used to resolve
where we are used to resolve the issue
it was like an energy booster for me it
was always fun what I was looking for I
got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
