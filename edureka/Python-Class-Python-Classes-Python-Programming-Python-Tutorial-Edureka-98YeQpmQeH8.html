Rekha in today's session we'll be
learning about
pythonic classes so without any further
ado let us move forward and have a look
it is in duffel today first you'll see
what are classes and objects in general
and then we'll see what our classes in
Python will learn how to create a class
what is it syntax all those things then
we'll see what exactly the inheritance
and then finally I'll tell you what are
abstract classes so are we all clear
with the agenda kindly give me a quick
confirmation by writing down in the chat
box so that I can proceed John says
looks fine I you she says please move on
Ron says okay so does fatigue alright so
i've got confirmation from almost
everyone so now i'll move forward and
we'll see what our classes and objects
so before i explain you classes and
objects i'll tell you python is an
object-oriented language but it is not
completely object-oriented it has
certain procedural functions as well all
right we have a question from Jason he
is asking what is the difference between
procedural and object-oriented alright
Jason I'll tell you in procedural
language the entire code is written as
one long procedure even though it might
contain functions and subroutines it is
not manageable as both data and logic is
mixed together
but when we talk about object-oriented
language the program is split apart into
self-contained objects almost like
having several mini programs each object
is representing a different part of the
application and each of those objects
has its own data and logic and they
communicate between themselves as well
so basically an object can represent
employees students images bank accounts
etc whatever exists in your program will
be up object for example a website has
multiple objects like images videos etc
so I hope you are clear alright so Jason
says yes now let us understand what
exactly are classes and objects so what
are classes and objects basically
classes allow us to logically group our
data and function in a way that is easy
to reuse and way to build upon if need
to be
let me explain you this with an example
so we have a class here that is employed
and it has various attributes such as
name age and salary but what are objects
objects are nothing but the instance of
this particular class that is employed
I'm just giving an example so what are
objects objects are the instance of a
class and in our example the class is
employed so the objects will be instance
of the employee class for example this
is the first object that contains
variables such as SAR are the name 37 is
a age and this is a salary similarly we
have the second object of the second
instance where the name is mean when we
talk about his age it is 43 and this is
his salary and similarly we have one
more object
Jessica's age is 26 and this is her
salary so is there any questions
regarding classes you can write it down
in your chat box all right so we have a
question from Xian he is asking what is
an instance all right let me explain you
with an example now consider class as a
template and when you fill details in
the class
it becomes an instance so you can refer
the example that is there in front of
your screen so here is a template of
employees all right it has various
fields like name age and salary now when
you fill these details
it becomes an instance for example sada
that is the name age that is 37 and her
salary so I hope she on you have got yo
answer all right so the answer is
perfect so any other questions any other
doubts guys please write it down in your
chat box
all right so John says no questions so
does Jason are you she wrong pratik all
right thank you guys so we'll move
forward and we'll see how to actually
create a class in Python
so this slide actually tells you how to
create class in Python so I've given a
syntax over here in which you have to
first write class then given name and
then various variables and functions
that you are going to define in your
class now class in Python actually
consists of three key components there
is a class variable and this class very
is actually shared by all the instances
or the objects of the class now when we
talk about instance variables these
variables are unique to each and every
object or class finally when we talk
about method method is nothing but a
function that we define inside a class
so I hope we all are clear with one of
the components of a class alright so
we'll move forward and I'll tell you
practically how to create a class in
Python
so this is my pycharm guy so over here
I'm going to create a class so before I
go ahead and create classes let me tell
you the class is basically consists of
data and functions so I'm going to call
data as attributes and functions as
methods so I'll be using both of these
terms white often so don't get confused
then I talked about attributes it is
actually data and when I talk about
methods those are actually functions so
I'll go ahead and I'll create a class I
named it as student
and now I'm going to keep it as empty so
I'll just write the past statement so
now you can see that I've given no
attribute and no methods so what I'm
going to do now I am going to create two
objects of this class that a student so
in all do that I'll type the name of
those objects or the instance so I'll
type STD underscore one equal to and the
name of the class that is student and
parentheses now I'm going to declare one
more object and I am going to name it as
STD underscore two equal to again the
name of the class
and open and close parentheses so now
what we need to do is we need to define
the instance variables and I've told you
earlier as well what our instance
variables instance variables are nothing
but the variables that are unique for
each and every instance or an object so
let me show you how to do that I am
going to type for the name of the
instance that I've STD underscore one
suppose if I want the first name of the
student so as this type dot first equal
to give the name so I'll just type in
Neal now I'm going to define the second
instance variable for the same instance
of the same object but I'll I'll type
STD underscore one M now I want the last
name equal to you can say Burma now I
want to add one more instance variable
that is his email id
email equal to kneel at the rate
school.com and I'll finally I'm going to
write his percentage or the aggregate
marks that he scored so again student
underscore one dot much
equal to safety scores save 55 all right
let's keep at 55 so I have defined for
instance variables first is the first
name then comes the last name then I
talk about email and then finally marks
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use the second instance and I'm going
to define certain instance variable for
that instant that is STD underscore 2 so
let us go ahead with that s3 underscore
2 dot first equal to payment
now I'm going to define his last name so
for the other type STD underscore last
Surma and now his email address
payment a dread school.com and finally
his mark okay so let us make him
studious and give him good bucks
I'm going to give him around 90% and
yeah let us keep it this way
now what if I want to print the email
address of both of these students so for
that what I need to do is I need to type
in print
STD underscore one and I only want the
email address so I'll just type email
similarly I'm going to do it for the
second object or the second instance as
well so I'm going to type in print
student 2 dot email and now let's go
ahead and run this
you can see that's printed knee ladder
it's cool calm and Haman's at the rates
cool calm which are nothing but the
email ID for the two instances that are
created now similarly you can type in
the first name as well let me just show
you here also you type in first go ahead
execute this
alright so Neal and Heyman
now what if I don't want to manually set
these variables you can see that it is a
lot of code and also it is prone to
error now to make it automatic what I'll
use I use the init method or you can say
the init function I'm going to define it
inside my class so you can think of
initialize method or you can consider
this as constructors if you're coming
from another programming language
background like C++ or Java now when we
set a method inside a class they receive
instance automatically let us go ahead
and accept the first name and the last
name and marks so for that what I need
to do is I need to type in here let me
the first remove this pass statement and
now I'm going to write the initialize
method for that I'll type
I need cells now I'm going to write in
various attributes or you can say the
various instance variables that I want
so first I want the first name then I
want the last name then I want marks all
right looks fine so now basically what
is self itself is nothing but an
instance what I mean by that is that
whenever we write self dot first let me
just show you self dot first equal to
first alright
so whenever we write self dot first
equal to first the same as writing STD
underscore one dot first equals to Neal
or STD underscore to first is equals to
Ament so I hope you have understood why
I am doing this so except now doing it
manually it will be done automatically
you can actually change this name as f
name as well but I would like to keep it
this way alright so go ahead and type
the other variables as well self dot
last name
alright let me just give certain spaces
the last name let's just last and then
type in self dot March equal two marks
now for email address I'm going to type
in cells dot email and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to first write
the first name plus let us put a dot
between the first name and last name so
I'll just put in a dot and then add the
last name plus if I want now I'm going
to write in Adelaide school.com
all right looks fine and now what I'm
going to do is I am going to type in
here student and the first name of the
first student that is meal
now where is the last name keep it as
Verma now so March will be around 60 now
second student is pretty studious his
name is Haman surname is Irma and say
his average March you can say it as 90
I've never scored 90% in my entire life
alright so jokes apart so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to print the
first name of both of these students so
let us see if that happens run classes
and objects all right so you can see
that Neil and Haman is printed so now
what we have done we have created the
instances of student class and now we
are passing the value specified in the
init method so now our init method takes
the instance which we call self and the
first name last name and box as
arguments but when we have created the
student down here this instances are
passed automatically so we can leave
ourselves and we only need to provide
the first name last name and marks so
with this self what actually happens the
init method will run automatically so
STD underscore one will be passed as
self and then it will set all these
attributes that are first-name lastname
etc it will set self dot first equal to
first which we have passed as humans or
nil similarly last marks etc let me give
you one more example now this time we
are going to print the email for both of
the students go ahead and execute this
yup so meal dot war Madrid school calm
and Haman's dot Sharma at the red school
calm now suppose we want the ability to
perform some kind of action so to do
that I'll add some methods to this class
suppose I want the ability to display
the full name of the student so one way
of doing that is what I can do over here
I can print one more line and put in two
curly braces that is the two
placeholders I should say give
space between both of them dot format
and the first instance that is a CD
underscore one
dot first coma STD underscore one dot
last that's it go ahead and apprentice
so it says Neal Verma so we have
actually added so this is nothing but
the concatenation of two strings that
you can say the first name and the last
name but again I don't want to do this
for all of my instances so why not
create a method inside a class that
allows us to put this functionality in
one place how about that guys all right
oh we have got confirmation from
everyone to go ahead alright so I hope
you guys are enjoying I love playing
with Python guys so yeah let's just see
what we can do with it now I'm going to
find one more class full name now as
I've told you earlier as well each
method inside a class automatically take
the instance as the first argument for
example STD underscore one is an
instance STD underscore two is an
instance and we are going to always call
that self an instance is the only
argument that we need for full name
right we are first name we have last
name so we need just the instance self
alright give a colon now within this
method I am going to take the same logic
that is present here
I'm going to write here as return
now instead of STD underscore one dot
first and STD underscore one dot last
I'm going to use sense so that it works
for all the instances currently it will
work only for STD underscore one so
let's go ahead and type in self alright
looks cool so now let us just remove
this part
alright sorry for the typo guys let's
just keep ourselves alright so now let
us just remove this part
and over here what I'm going to type in
I'm going to type in STD underscore one
dot full name
notice that we need parentheses here
because this is a method instead of an
attribute if I don't put the parentheses
it will return the method instead of the
return value now let's print this for
the second student as well who is a
cream of the school
all right so let's just go ahead and run
it cool so we have got Neil warme as
well as Haman Sharma as the full name so
instead of typing this out for each full
name now I can use that method now let
us talk about class variables as we have
discussed in a slides as well we have
seen what our instance variables we have
seen methods now the thing that is left
is class variables now class variables
are variables that are shared among all
instances of a class our instance
variables can be unique for each
instance like names marks email ID etc
but class variables should be same for
each instance so in this example what
kind of data that we want to share
between our objects any idea guys in
this example that'll suit all right so
pratik says how about an annual rise in
their percentages all right so that
makes a bit of sense
nobody's physique I'll actually use the
same and I'm going to name it as percent
rise so for in order to declare a class
variable just below the class you need
to write the name of that variable I'll
write it as purse underscore rise and
equal to so suppose it increases by 5%
so yeah let us just type in as 1.05
although I know it is not general for
everyone there are certain students for
example Neil in this case we might not
study properly or you know so there are
different kind of students but I'm just
giving a general idea don't just go
inside the example too much just
understand the concepts here guys
all right the percentage rise is one
point zero five for each and every
student let us just think it that way
alright so what I've done here is I have
defined a class variable that is
percentage rise and that would be equals
to five percent so basically every
student is getting a five percent rise
in his or her march every here so I need
to write a method for that so what I'm
going to do is I am going to define one
more method and I'm going to name it as
apply underscore arrays
now again I'm going to type in ourselves
because each instance is passed out as
STD underscore one or STD underscore two
so we need that instance argument that
is nothing but since so I've repeated
that a quite a lot of time so I'm not
going to say that again so now over here
I'm going to type in the logic that is
self dot much equal to int that is the
data type cells dot marks multiplied by
1.05 all right so looks perfect to me
now so now what I'm going to do is I am
going to edit this print statement and
for this student underscore one I'm
going to write in here March and then
over here let me just now I'm going to
write one more print statement and I'm
going to type in here student on the
score 1 dot marks and then now I'm going
to write so now we have printed out
marks first and then apply the 4%
increase so in order to apply that 4% in
order to apply to B so this will print
the marks of the student 1 so now I want
to apply that the 5% increase in his
mark so for that what I need is I need
to write in student for that what I need
is now we have printed the now we have
printed the box of the first student now
I need to apply the 5% increase in this
master for that I'm going to type in
student underscore one that is nothing
but the instance and then dot the name
of the method that is apply underscore
raise
and the parentheses now go ahead and
print the final marks so for that again
I'm going to type one more print
statement the name dot marks let me just
comment the other two print statements
all right so let us go ahead and execute
this so early it needs percentage was
sixty percent but after five percent
increase in one year which is pretty bad
it has come to sixty three percent so
now let us do that with the student
underscore two as well so for that what
I need to do is I need to just type in
here student underscore two same student
underscore two and over here as well now
let us see what happens with the
studious student in our class so he
scored 90 percent earlier now with five
percent increase in one year he has come
up to 94 percent so yeah keep up the
good work payment now I'm going to show
you the dictionary of the second student
that is STD underscore two so for that
what I need to do is I need to decide
and print the name s three underscore
two dot dick all right so let us go
ahead and execute this and see what
happens so this will give me all the key
value pairs that I'm talking about so
first name this is the key this is the
value for that similarly last and this
is the value for that last key this is
the key again and this is the value
similarly when we talk about email
address one thing to notice here guys is
that nowhere it is written the first
underscore rice is equals to one point
zero five that is nothing to the class
variable you cannot see it in the whole
dictionary of that particular object
so basically when we access that first
underscore rice from our instances they
don't actually have that attribute they
are accessing the class's purse and the
score rice attribute so I hope you all
are clear with what I am trying to say
here is so in the name space of the
object you won't find that particular
class variable but it is actually taking
that attribute from the class similarly
if I print this dictionary for my class
that is nothing but student what I will
get is print student
dot dick and let us see what happens
when we run this yep
so it has payments Irma's March email ID
plus it has a per size that we are
talking about that is nothing with a
class variable so I hope you have
understood what our classes on how to
create an object for a class and we have
actually seen how to define method
inside the class we have seen what
exactly our class variables so all those
concepts I hope you all are clear with
if you have any doubt any queries please
write it down in your chat box and I'll
be happy to help you ok stay on pace
crystal clear jason says it's clear Ron
says no questions so does pratik same
goes for IU she and John all right so
I've got confirmation from almost
everyone so I'll move forward and
explain you what is in editing so what
is inheritance just like it sounds
inheritance allows us to inherit
attributes and methods from the base
class this is useful as we can create
subclasses and get all the functionality
from our parent class and then we can
override and add new functionalities
without affecting the parent class in
any way so let us take the example that
is there in front of your screen so we
have a vehicle that is nothing but a
superclass so there are multiple kinds
of vehicles we have trucks we have scars
we have bikes and among those types is
where we have subtypes for example in
bikes we have pedal bike we have
motorbikes when we talk about cars we
have pickup car super cool sports cars
convertibles and ones now in the same
goes for trucks as well we have medium
sized rocks and we have heavy sized
rocks now one thing to notice here is
when we talk about vehicles in Python we
can create a class named vehicles with
methods for action rate break etc now
that same method or the same
functionality can be actually inherited
by your base classes what are the base
classes base classes are caused by and
Trott because obviously all the three
week all the three types of vehicles
will have accelerated break and the some
of the common functionalities even weeds
and then you are in India you actually
need breaks more than accelerator so
yeah basically what I'm saying is
there are certain functionalities which
will be common for trucks cars and bikes
so instead of writing the code or the
method again for each of these classes
it can actually go on and inherit that
functionality from the superclass that
is nothing but vehicle so I hope you
have understood the concept of
inheritance so if you have any doubts or
any questions please write it down in
your chat box all right so we have no
doubts so what I'm going to do is I am
going to show you practically how to
inherit certain functionalities from
your base class so now if I want to
create some classes like type of
students so I want to create studio
students and I want to create a dumb
students now these could be good
examples for subclasses since both
studious and dumb students will have
name email address as well as marks and
these functionalities are there in the
student class already instead of copying
this code for our studious and dumb
subclasses we can just reuse the code by
inheriting from the class that is
nothing but student so let us go ahead
and execute this so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to come down here and yep
and now over here so I'll just go down
to here and now I'm going to create a
class for dumb students so I'm going to
name my class as dumb
and over here I'm going to write the
name of the class from which I'm going
to inherit certain functionalities which
in this case is student now give a colon
here and let me just pass it for right
now
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change the name of the class that a
student instead of that I'm going to
write and dump
so whatever functionalities were there
in the base class that a student will be
available in this dumb class so now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to print n
say STD underscore one dot email
so the dumb student that is mean his
email address will be printed let us go
ahead and execute this yep so the email
address of meal is Neal Varma at the
rate school calm so as you can see that
in my dumb class and not define any
method nor any attribute what it is
doing it is actually inheriting to the
base class that is student so the dumb
student need all of his details are
actually available in the class dump as
well so basically when we instantiate a
dump students it first looked at our
dump class for init method but it won't
find it in that class because it is
currently empty now let's look at other
places on the basis of a method
resolution order let me help you
visualize that I know a lot of tricky
terms a lot of technical terms so let me
help you visualize that so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to throw in one
more print statement and I'm going to
write in help and between I write in
dumb alright so let's go ahead and
execute this let me just move up a
little bit
yep so this is a method resolution order
that I was talking about now whenever I
instantiate my dumb students it will
first look at the dump class for the
init method that is here in the method
resolution order at the top after that
I'd look at the base class of this dump
class that a student even if it doesn't
find over there then it lastly look in
this object class so every class in
Python a rates from this object class
so I hope method resolution order is
clear to you let me just repeat it once
more so what happens when I actually
instantiate the dum students it will
first look at the dump class for the I
net method but it won't find it there so
first I get the dumb class that it look
at the student class that is nothing but
the base class for the dumb students or
the dump class and then finally it look
at the object class
now what if I want to change the pose
under school rice for the dumb student
to 10% he's working hard
say suppose mean has started working
hard and he's getting good marks so
basically his March are increasing at
10% say at the rate of 10% so let me
show you how you can do that now what
you need to do is in the class that we
have defined as dum just write the
poet's underscore rice equal to 10% let
me show you how to do that I just remove
this path I'm going to write here as
first underscore rice equal to 1 point 1
oh there is nothing but 10% all right so
now over here instead of email let me
just print his mark so that you'll get
to know how much he is improving and let
me just remove this trend statement so
now let me just print it for dal I'll
type print STD underscore one dot purse
underscore rice so let us go ahead and
execute this yep as you can see that it
has updated the percentage increase in
marks from 5% to 10%
good job Neal now let me show you if I
change this class name from dump to the
base class at a student over there and
in this class that host underscore rice
is still at 5% so let me show you go
ahead and run this yep so it is still
one point zero five so as you can see
that that particular functionality of
that particular class variable we have
changed it in the dump class only
alright so now what does this prove this
proves that whatever changes that we
have made in the dump class does not
actually affect the class variables that
was present in the base class that was
student
now if I want to add one more attribute
say a programming language in which the
student is master I'm going to do that
with the help of a net method but it
doesn't exist in a parent class so how
will I do that I can copy the entire
student logic and do that but it will
increase the code size and we want it to
be more manageable so let me show you
what I am going to do now now below this
class variable I'm going to define one
more init function and let me show you
how to do that in itself and obviously I
want the first name the last name mark
and plus I want programming language so
for that I'll just type prog underscore
Lang now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually inherit inet method
that was there in my base class so I'm
not going to write the entire logic for
first name last name and marks for that
I'm going to inherit for the base class
so I'm going to only write the logic for
my programming language so for that what
I need to do is I need to type in super
open close parenthesis dot
I knit first last and marks
now I'm going to define the programming
language epidural type cells dot frog
underscore Lang equal to frog underscore
Lang all right now over here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to add one more
attribute and let us say he's a master
in Python yep let's keep it as Python so
now what I'm going to do is into the
student class I'm going to type in the
dump class from which I'm and editing
the students functionalities now I'm
going to print this programming language
for that I'll type print STD underscore
one dot frog on the score line go ahead
and execute this so you can see python
is available here so basically with just
a little bit of code I have made those
changes how I did that I just inherited
whatever the functionalities were there
in my base class to my parent class that
was dumped and my base class was student
so any doubt still here guys we have
understood what exactly inheritance is
any doubts any questions please write it
down in your chart box any doubts guys
alright so there are no doubts so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to move
forward and I'm going to explain you
what are abstract classes now let us
understand what are abstract classes so
what I mean by abstract class is that
these classes cannot be instantiated or
you can say that you cannot create the
objects or instance for these classes
but it can only be used for inheriting
certain functionalities and you can call
it as a base class so you can call it as
base class you can inherit certain
functionalities but at the same time you
cannot create the instances or the
objects of this particular class that is
abstract class that is understand with
the diagram here in front of you so this
is the abstract class so when I try to
create an object of this abstract class
Python won't allow me to do that so when
I use this abstract class in order to
provide certain functionalities to a
base class or you can say to a child
class it can do that and with that class
you can create objects so you cannot
directly create objects but you need to
inherit the functionalities to a base
class and then you need to create
objects
I hope I'm clear with what our abstract
classes all right so let us go ahead and
see one example for abstract class now
in order to show you an example for this
abstract class what I'm going to do is
I'm going to first remove all this code
that we have written till now now I need
to import certain methods for data type
import ABC that is abstract base class
import ABC comma abstract method alright
so now I'm going to create a class and
let us name it as employee and over here
write abstract base class
now go down and write a great abstract
method so this abstract method is
nothing but a decoration so now after
this I am going to define one method
that I'm going to name it us calculate
salary
so it'd have self comma one more
attribute we can call it our salary or
Sal
now this profit
I'm going to create one more class and
I'm going to name it as developer I mean
this developer is actually going to
inherit certain functionalities from the
employee class so I'm going to write the
name of the base class that is employed
give a colon so now I'm going to define
a method that is calculate salary from
my base class that has attributes Sal
and over here I'm going to write the
final salary this is equal to
salary and plus this 10% hike in the
salary so as the site x 1.10 and now
return the final salary
so this is done now now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to type in here say
employ underscore one which is of the
type developer open and close
parenthesis now print the salary for
this employee underscore one so I'll
just write M underscore one calculate
salary and whatever base amount is so
I'll just cite us ten thousand and it is
going to increase it by ten percent
alright so go ahead and execute this
so yep it has become 11,000 that is 10%
increase in the salary now what I'm
trying to show you here is if you
actually go on and make an object of
this class employee it will show you an
error in sake cannot instantiate let me
just show you if I make it object for
this particular class what will happen
so let me just go and comment this print
statement and now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just type in say employ
underscore two which is equal to the
type employee now I'm going to define
the variable or the attribute for this
so I'm just going to type in employ and
the score to dot salary which is equal
to say 1000
and now I'm going to print it so for
that I'll type underscore two dots al
now let's go ahead and run this and see
what happens so it says can't
instantiate abstract class employee with
abstract method calculate salary so
basically what I'm saying is you cannot
instantiate or you cannot create the
instance of an abstract class you can
inherit certain functionalities from
that abstract class to appear it to a
base class or to a child last and then
from that child you can create object so
I hope I'm clear with this abstract
class concept let me just go ahead and
delete all this now over here there's
one more important thing that you need
to notice but I'm using an abstract
class an array or if I'm inheriting the
abstract class it is very important that
you first use this method that is
defined in that abstract class that is
calculated and the score salary so what
if I change this name and I keep it as
say salary or what if I change this name
and I keep it as Sal underscore one now
again if I run this class and say can't
instantiate abstract class developer
with abstract method calculate salary so
what I'm saying is you need to use that
particular method which has been defined
in the abstract class at least once
so now you can actually write whatever
methods you want to do but first you
need to make sure that you have actually
used that method or you have defined
that method in your base class or you
can say the child yeah I can give you an
example is where now if or if I define
one more method and I'm going to name it
as position underscore one and give an
attribute to it as position
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to type in cells dot position
to position and finally return this
position so return position now I can
actually print this position so for that
I'm going to type in print
employee underscore one dot position
underscore one open and close
parentheses and whatever position he has
maybe he the web developer
go ahead execute this and yep you can
see that web developer here so basically
what I'm saying is you can actually use
whatever methods you want in your base
class or in your type laws but you need
to first make sure that whatever method
that you are inheriting from your
abstract base class are using it first
like calculate underscore salary so any
doubts any questions still here guys
please write it down in your chat box I
will be happy to help you any question
guys so there are no questions so by
this we come to the end of today's
session let me just give you a brief
summary of what we have discussed till
now so first we saw it basically our
classes and objects and then we saw how
to create a class in Python we saw the
syntax we created a class that a student
and we created multiple objects as well
the stage CD underscore one STD
underscore two and then we saw
inheritance that how we can actually
inherit certain functionalities from the
base class to the child class then we
saw it exactly our abstract classes in
Python so if you have any questions any
doubts please write it down in your
chart box fiancee's great session so
does pratik I you see all right thank
you guys
I'm glad that you find it useful so this
video will be uploaded into the LMS you
