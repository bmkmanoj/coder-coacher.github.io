presently working with CGI software and
I have a background of mainstream
technologies like I have been working
for two years now in mainframe
technology isn't it hot I needed you
know the needed and a bit on the present
technologies which are in demand so I
thought of going what this mastering
environment mostly it was like career
change decision only but like I had
background of PHP and so I wanted he
something similar you know front-end to
be more easy like whiten I did before
joining this class I did you online
researches like what is this about and
how is the language and like is it
easier as it is it is an open source so
it will be easy for anyone to all the
other classroom training institutes they
were offering in that hadoo all it was
not merged with any other you know
front-end language if I am to if I have
to learn how to for any of the knowledge
add it's a mainly and data you know data
archiving or data analytics thing I
would need to know the front and also
how to use it how to you know connect
with it so I wanted more it's not that I
would only like to learn hard and then
not not know how to actually use it so
only like I could only find out you
Rekha we're giving us giving me this
Python so I had a friend who had already
done this post and I asked him for
feedback so he said he you can join it
so then I joined because initially when
making the first class it was I thought
it's resist going through the basics but
as the class proceeded I I felt kid it
has good content the content is really
good it's really simple and easy to none
that's what like
giving two three hours a day and if it's
not you know easy for acne me man it
would have been difficult but it was
really simple and easy to learn
initially when I have received a call
from a new relic how to access on how
cracks is the Olympus simple is very
straightforward people to your cause and
and have all the details under a single
tap so it was really very simple and
easy to use I have raised two three
tickets there are questions as well to
give both because I was not sure where
the class recordings were uploaded so as
soon as I posted the queries and it
where is all very very quickly my
instructor what is the Balarama the
wrong but I like things and like he was
very knowledgeable it was like we had a
few questions during the session like
what is the emphasis the thing and he
was like very responsive it was very you
know cooperative he was he knew the
first day he had he and Assemblyman who
are from actually we had booked
background and work like we have no idea
about what this thing is about and then
accordingly he has plan he if the
majority was they were already having
some background knowledge maybe this
session would have been a bit different
maybe he would have you know planned
accordingly but since the majority of
all scheme they were they have no idea
what - on her - is actionable so he had
cleaned in a very you know we managed
wait he everyone would understand go on
this actual thing is and how to install
everything from the basics to like to
the end it was very very helpful like he
was very responsive and cooperated the
instructor was showing us everything
online
everything was run time and he was
showing it if this is the case this will
be the output
he had also given us all the procedures
and steps to install pycharm and you
know here virtual environment how to
install it how for executor escape and
how
you write it everything I have I'm still
yet to finish the project which has been
assigned to us but like hopefully once
I'm through with that I'll be able to
you know incorporate these things in my
new work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
