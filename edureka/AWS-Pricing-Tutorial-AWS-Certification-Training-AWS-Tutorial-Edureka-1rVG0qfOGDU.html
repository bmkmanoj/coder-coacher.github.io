car and I welcome you all to this
session on ADA base pricing today I'm
going to give you various reasons as to
why IBS has the best pricing model when
you talk about various cloud service
providers but before we do that let's
quickly take a look at today's agenda
first firstly I would be talking about
how does one go ahead and choose a
proper service then I would talk about
different pricing fundamentals and
pricing models that a device has to
offer to you you'd also discuss
different edibles calculators and the
free tier of a DeBeers finally I would
finish things off with the cost
optimization part I hope this agenda is
clear to all of you so let's not waste
any time and get started then so how
does one choose a service well the quite
a few parameters which one needs to
consider as far as the best service
providers in the market is concerned
they consider these parameters customer
friendly it is very important that a
service provider is customer friendly
because different businesses have
different needs and if the customer
needs are met then the customer would be
happy and as far as the service provider
is concerned that is what they aim is if
you talk about Amazon it has the best
customer service and amazon proudly
claims that if you've ever used one of
their services you would know that we
are the best service providers in the
market next we have transparency now it
is very important that a service
provider is transparent now what do I
mean by this what happens is most of the
times people are forced to pay money
upfront and then they give an access to
the services this does not give them any
time or have any kind of demo with the
services that are provided by the
service provider this is where a device
is different what it does is it offers
you free tier now what this free tier
does is it lets you use all of its
services for free and that - for one
year so you have sufficient demo or
access to the services which aid of
yours has to offer to you and then you
can take a call whether you want to go
ahead and pay for these services or not
pocket-friendly ADA base is highly
pocket-friendly
why am I saying this say for example you
have to go ahead and buy a server now
AWS lets you have a server for one month
at a meager price of five dollars
and this is highly affordable so these
are few of the important points which
people need to consider when they go
ahead and pick a service and when you
talk about AWS it meets all of these
needs so let us move further and try to
understand the different pricing
fundamentals which aid of yours has now
ADA base considers these three
fundamentals that is compute storage and
data transfer if you talk about compute
what a device does is it charges you on
i'li basis that is you can use their
compute and their processing services at
a very less price and also you pay only
for those resources which you've used
and again when you talk about time
constraint if you are using the services
only for one you'd be paying only for
one our next we have storage what a
device does is it charges you per
gigabyte that is even if you use very
less space you'd be paying only for that
space and since it is almost as less as
1 GB that is you have to be only for 1
GB what this does is you don't have to
worry about scaling because if you are
using more resources you'd be paying
accordingly so yes when you talk about
storage this is a very important point
an ADA base has it covered next we have
data transfer now when you talk about
data transfer again edible charges you
per gigabyte and it tells you only for
the data that goes out so yes this again
is an important point and based on all
these points what a device has done is
it has gone ahead and it has built
various pricing models so let us move
further and take a look at those pricing
models one by one now ADA base has these
three pricing models that is pay less as
you get more pay as you go and save when
you reserve let's first talk about
pay-as-you-go as I've already mentioned
database has a very flexible pricing
model now what do I mean by this
interest charges you on a li basis plus
it charges you only for the compute
capacity and the resources which you are
using so if you need a particular
resource for one R and you need n number
of or n amount of compute capacity you'd
be paying only for that thing say for
example your requirement is 40 GB for
first month but what happens is you end
only using 10 GB now in this case your
30 GB of space is wasted and this is
when you pay a friend but if your ping
on Ally basis and only for the resources
which you are using you're actually
saving up all the cost with you would
otherwise pay secondly we have something
called as pay less as you get more yes
more the services you use as far as a
device is concerned it charges you
fairly less you have a chance of saving
up to 70% of your total cost and that is
a very nice feature to have you also
have something called as save when you
reserve now if you know how much
resources and the compute capacity that
you are going to use in your future what
you can do is you can go ahead and
reserve these services in advance and in
that case it abuse charges you fairly
less compared to the other models so let
us go ahead and take a look at these one
by one
firstly we have no upfront costs now
what this means is you can go ahead and
reserve your resources and your services
in advance but you are not paying
anything but what happens here is you
are paying an amount which is lesser
than the previous two mentioned models
that is pay-as-you-go and pay less as
you use more but this thing is still
costlier compared to the other subtypes
of this model that is partial affront
cost and full of front cost now going to
talk about partial up front cost you are
paying a partial lump sum amount which
is less than the total amount and you
are reserving all your instances and all
those things but this is comparatively
affordable when you compare it with no
upfront cost
it is however costlier than the last one
that is full of front payment or costs
in the last point that is full up front
costs what you do is you decide okay
these are the amount of resources which
I am going to use and this is the
compute capacity which I need and
accordingly you book all those resources
and you make an upfront payment now
since you are making an afront payment
this is the most affordable of all the
pricing models that are there but for
this you need to be assured that these
are the minimum resources which I am
going to use and if required I will have
to scale up but not scale down
this is about different pricing models
as far as a device is concerned so let
us move further and try to understand
the next point now how does one go ahead
and calculate the savings which one
makes well a device has provided you
with a nativist calculator now what does
this a device calculator do it lets you
calculate your monthly expenses that is
the services which you've used and all
those things hence you can keep a track
of all the money which you're supposed
to invest apart from that it also
provides you with various templates
which lets you appraise your complete
solution this one more variant as far as
the calculator is concerned it is called
as TCO that is total cost of ownership
now it is little different than the
normal ADA based calculator what it does
is it basically lets you calculate or
compare one services price with the
other service it also lets you compare
the infrastructure solution which a
device has to offer to you and this
might vary from business to business so
when you talk about the total cost of
ownership for which you might invest
this is the calculator which you should
go far now when you talk about the aid
of its calculator are the TCO calculator
I would be giving you a small demo R
once I walk you through the alw website
I would be telling yours in how do these
calculators work
I hope this point is clear to all of you
so let's move further and try to
understand the next point now a device
also has to offer you a free tier which
I mentioned in the past so let us move
ahead and try to understand what this is
exactly now as I've mentioned EDA base
has various services to provide to you
and those services will have the
subtypes as well so all these services
are available to you for free for one
year and this is the access which end of
this provides to you say for example you
have a service called as Amazon Elastic
cloud compute this is one of the most
popular services as far as aid abuse is
concerned and when you talk about its
axis what database does is it lets you
access 750 hours of this service on any
of your oasis whether it's your Linux
whether it's your Windows you can have
access to this thing and when it comes
to using this service 750 hours is
sufficient if you are trying to get
started with AWS
then you have other services like
elastic load balancer you have elastic
block storage you
Amazon Web Services and based on the
usage they have different capacities
which are made available to you for free
now a database won't charge you for any
of these things and when you need a demo
I feel these resources are more than
enough again once I switch into the
website I would be talking about the
free tier as well so let's do one thing
let's actually go ahead and first take a
look at these resources or these
services one by one that is let's try to
understand what free tier is and what
these calculators are with the help of
the ADA based website so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to go ahead and
switch into the ADA based website so
yeah what I've done is I've actually
gone ahead and I've opened AWS free tier
now this is what it looks like basically
these are all the resources which it has
to offer but before we do that what you
need to understand is you need to create
an account here to do that he'll have to
go ahead and enter your debit card or
credit card details now ADA base won't
charge you as long as you use all these
services in the limits which a Tobias
has mentioned and to be honest those are
fairly large limits so you won't be
exceeding that if you are just using or
having a demo of these services so how
does one do that one goes out and gives
in their credit card or debit card
details database will charge you one
dollar that is one USD for some
verification purpose and within 10
minutes that amount would be refunded
back into your account again so this is
only for the verification purpose and
after that if you overuse the resources
then it obvious would charge you so what
you have to do is you have to just go
ahead and create an account here now
these are the free tier services which a
device has to provide it has something
called as elastic cloud compute that is
ec2 and as I've mentioned it has 750
hours of it you have Amazon quick site
which is used for analytics basically
and it is available in 1gb of his spiced
capacity now I won't get into the
details of what spice capacity and all
those things are you have something
called as Amazon RDS which is for
storage and again it provides you with a
capacity of 750 hours per month which is
again very high you have Amazon s3 you
have Amazon lambda now these are fairly
popular services and as far as this
or the capacity which is mentioned here
it is more than enough or sufficient ADA
which also provides with various
tutorials that will help you get started
here so if this is a concern I would
suggest that you just go ahead and log
into a Tobias website have an account
there and you're good to go as far as
once you sign in how it looks I will
show you that as well you can just go
ahead and log in now I have an account
already on database for some reason my
internet is very slow today
they were takes eternity yes so once you
log in this is how it looks like you can
go ahead and you can actually create
your own instances and all those things
say for example you have something
called as ec2 you can go ahead and you
can specify all the details as in this
will show you how many instances are
running and all those things for now
there is nothing that is running here so
there's zero instances that are running
so you can actually go ahead and create
your instances and do all those things
you can launch our instances say for
example and you get to select as in what
OS and what all do you need to do for it
so yes but then this is not the
discussion for today so I'll just go
ahead and skip this part and I will
switch to something called as the
calculator as far as the free tier is
concerned these are all the services
that are available to you and you can
actually go ahead and use those now next
we have something called as a simple
monthly calculator or a debase
calculator now it gives you your monthly
estimate as in for all the services
which you've used all you have to do is
you have to go ahead and add the details
as in what is the description how many
instances are you using its usage and
the type of the instance now the t1 and
all those the micro instances and all
those these are the details that have
been covered in a session called as it
abuse tutorial by Eddie Rekha if you
want to have details about those you can
actually go ahead and view that video as
well now this is where you talk about
the billing option whether it's
on-demand and all those things you're
free to go ahead and choose a plan for
you as you can see it's visible here and
once you do that once you've filled in
all these details your storage your
compute capacity is your elastic IPS and
all those things you finally need to
come here and you just need to say that
there's an option here which actually
lets you submit all these values and
once you do that you'll have the final
result doesn't okay this is your user
still time and this is the period usage
and all those things then you have
something called as your TCO now this is
more global or more general kind of an
application now this is something that
deals with your interim expenses and all
those things this is for the overall
expenses as in the total cost of
ownership you can select the currency
here as in you have an option of paying
in different currencies since it's a
global leader you have options to pay in
different currencies as well say for
example you're somewhere in India you
would be paying in rupees and you can
select that option here as well
apart from that what is the environment
which you need to compare it against
because yes as I mentioned that you can
compare different architectures so you
can go ahead and select that as well you
have various other features say for
example you can go ahead and put in the
details for the server's whether those
are physical servers virtual servers and
all that your storage now there are
storage types here we'll say for example
you have San you have Nast you have
object you just need to fill in these
things and then you need to calculate
your TCO as well and you'll have the
total cost of ownership - so these are
different calculators and this is how
the feed here as far as a device is
concerned works so you are actually free
to go ahead and explore these things
because it is available to you freely
and you can just have access to this end
get the know-how as and how it obvious
works I hope this is clear to all of you
so let's move further and continue with
our discussion as far as the pricing
video is concerned now that we
understood what the ADA based free tier
is let us move further and consider this
final point of discussion that is cost
optimization now this is a very
important point as I've already
mentioned that money is very important
when you talk about businesses it is
also very important that you are able to
optimize all the money that you are
investing in various projects now this
is where it obvious is very good because
it helps you optimize your cost a lot
yes it has great pricing models but
apart from that it also lets you use
those wisely so you can optimize your
cost let us take a look at these points
one by one right size your services now
as I've mentioned it is easier to
upscale but it is not easy to downscale
so it is always wise to start with
lesser resources and lesser compute
capacity so this is where right sizing
becomes very important and it obvious
lets you do that since I mentioned that
it has highly flexible pricing model you
can actually go ahead and choose minimum
resources start with small and then
upscale according to your needs we also
have something called as a reservation
benefits which have again discussed in
the past you can go ahead and choose the
models widths actually meet your
requirements and you can actually go
ahead and these are a few of the
resources up front which you are very
sure about and yes you end up
les again elasticity benefits now what
aw does is it provides you with various
tools it also provides you with
something called as scheduler now these
time schedulers what they do is they'll
let you switch off and switch on your
various resources that might fluctuate
when you talk about their usages say for
example you have services like ec2 RDS
now these are instants based services
and when you talk about the usage that
might not be constant throughout the
various hours of the day so you can
decide to switch off and switch on these
resources so that they're used optimally
and you end up paying only for the ass
for which you've used those services so
this is where time schedulers do come
into picture and this is where a device
has great elasticity or great
flexibility
finally in this list we have something
called as track and managed services now
a device price with various tools and
software's that actually go ahead and
let you keep track of all the real-time
usage and measurements that you're
concerned with now what this does is
this actually helps you optimize your
usage how because there are tools that
let you build real-time dashboards and
all those things now since you have
those you can analyze all the traffic
all the data and all the resources which
you are using and thus you can cut down
on a lot of cost or you can just go
ahead and optimize a lot of money and
cost that you are investing in your
projects so these are the points that
are very important when you consider
cost optimization and this was probably
the last point when you talk about our
today's session that is a double spicing
so if you're concerned about going ahead
and picking a proper cloud service
provider I would say that choose aid
abuse and it would definitely ensure
that you sleep with a lot of cost
optimized I hope you had something new
to learn from this session as far as
this session goes this is the end of it
