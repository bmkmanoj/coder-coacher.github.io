Rekha and in today's session we'll be
focusing on Python django django is
nothing but a web development framework
so let us move forward and have a look
at the agenda for today first we look at
a whole web development process then we
look at various frameworks available for
web development then we'll understand
why we are using Django framework and
what exactly it is after that we'll
start a simple hello world application
with Django framework and finally I'll
tell you how to create a pose
application using jungle so I hope you
all are clear with the agenda kindly
give me a quick confirmation by writing
down in the chat box or add a says clear
soon as John Janus very shirisha neha
puja
jothee or a fine guys i've got
confirmation from almost everyone now
let us move forward and have a look at
the whole web development process so
this is the whole web development
process guys it starts with analysis now
what happens in this phase you actually
decide what is the idea behind your
website what are you building upon so
basically that whole thing comes an
analysis you gather customer
requirements you perform certain
analysis for example in e-commerce
website like Amazon so they are selling
products like phones furnitures all
those things so that analysis or you can
say what is the idea behind your website
comes under this phase or it's called
analysis after that you create a
requirement specification document and
that will contain all your requirements
for a website so if you're selling
mobile phones what kind of mobile phones
are you selling what will be your target
audience all those things will be there
present in your requirement
specification document after that when
you move forward comes the design and
develop phase now in this design and
develop phase you actually create a
blueprint for your website so you will
actually decide what are functionalities
will be there so if I click on a
particular button what will happen what
will be the size of that button what
will be my background image so you get a
basically a blueprint of your website as
to how your website should look like
after that comes the content writing
part now in this content writing part
will take the same ecommerce website
example and if we are selling say mobile
phones then my content should include
the name of the phone the specifications
cost all those things so that comes
under content writing path so
the end of this particular phase we know
how our website will look like and what
are we supposed to do all right so when
we move forward we start coding for it
and then once our website is ready we
build test cases to test various
functionalities of a website maybe the
authentication page maybe the search is
relevant or not I mean if I'm searching
mobile phones it should display mobile
phones and not furnitures all those
functionalities will be tested for that
you build test cases after that comes
promotion so basically you promote your
website through various medium that only
depends on you how you do that then you
need to maintain this website and at the
same time you need to update it so your
website is live now but you get a lot of
customer feedbacks so you need to
incorporate those feedbacks so you need
to update your website accordingly so
this is the whole web development
process I've given you a general
overview if you have any questions or
doubt you can ask me all right so we
have no doubts here so we'll move
forward and have a look at various
frameworks available for web development
so this particular slide contains
actually false frameworks for web
development although there are many more
present in the market so there is
angular JS then we have Ruby on Rails
ember.js and we have django as well so
in today's session we are going to focus
on django so let us move forward and
understand why we are focusing on Django
framework or why we are focusing on
frameworks for web development consider
the example that is there in front of
your screen so when you're building a
website you'll always need a some
similar set of components for example
our way to handle user authentication
the management panel forms and a way to
upload files this is just an example
guys so you need certain set of similar
components now with the help of
frameworks you can actually get that
with the help of frameworks you'll get
some redundant codes which are common
for all of these applications now let us
move forward and see there are other
importance of frameworks in web
development now with the help of
frameworks you can actually separate the
user interface and the underlying logic
as you can see that there is a girl who
is pretty much frustrated because she
don't have the time to implement a
proper system that can separate the user
interface and the underlying logic now
this is just an example for you guys so
this is the e'terica user interface this
is how it looks like
and this is the logic behind it so with
frameworks you can actually separate
both of these now let's move forward and
see another importance of framework now
basically Django framework gives a
ready-made components to use now not
only Django many of the frameworks do
that so basically web development
framework gives you ready-made
components to use for example it can be
libraries database access templates
session management code reuse all those
things so with the help of framework as
I've told you earlier as well there'll
be certain redundant codes that will be
common for all the applications so you
don't need to write that again and again
for different applications and you can
actually separate your applications in a
more structured way with the help of
frameworks so these are the reasons
that's why we use frameworks for web
development and Django is one of them so
if you have any questions or doubts you
can ask me all right so we have no
question I've got a confirmation from
almost everyone so let us move forward
and understand what exactly is Django so
what exactly is Django we have seen
earlier as well Django is nothing but a
web development framework which is
written in Python now let me tell you
how exactly it works this diagram shows
that now developers write models and
templates and views map set to a URL now
after that Django does the magic and
serves it to the user
so obviously this is just an overview of
how things work in Django or you can put
it in another way as well so when a
request come to a web server it's passed
to a Django which tries to figure out
what is actually requested then it takes
a web page address first and tries to
figure out what to do and this part is
done by Django's URL resolver we are
going to have a look at that later in
the session then it takes a list of
patterns and tries to match the URL
Django checks pattern from top to bottom
and if something is matched Django
passes the request to the Associated
function which is called view so we are
going to discuss all these functions and
all these files later in the session you
don't need to worry about them I'm just
giving you an overview of how things
work now in the View function all the
interesting things are done we can even
look at the database for some
information then the view generates our
response
and Django can send it to the users of
web browser and of course this
description is a bit simplified but you
don't need to know all the technical
things yet having a general idea is
enough so instead of diving too much
into details we will simply start
creating something with Django and we'll
learn all the important parts along the
way how does that sound guys
all right fine guys so I can see a lot
of people are interested in that so
we'll move forward and create a simple
hello world application using django and
then we are going to increase the
complexity and create a pose application
using sacrum
hello world application using Django so
for that what I'm going to do is I'm
going to start my virtual machine I have
an Ubuntu image with me so on that are
going to image I have already installed
Django with the help of Python setup
tools so let me open my over to virtual
machine first so guys this is my over to
box now over here I'm going to start a
project and I'm going to name it as demo
you can give whatever name that you want
so for that I'm going to use the Django
- Edmund dot py scripts so let me show
you how to do that you're going to type
in Django - Edmund start project and the
name of your project I am going to name
it as demo so now let me enter this demo
directory and I'll show you a bunch of
files that have been created so we have
a manage dot py as well as one more demo
directory
now this manage dot py file is a script
that helps with management of the site
with it
will be able to start a web server on
our computer without installing anything
else now let me go to this demo
directory again and I'm going to hit an
LS command and you can see that we have
added py settings URLs and WS here now
settings that py file contains the
configuration of your website now this
you are is what py file that is present
it actually dictates the URLs that lead
to the apps that we are going to start
in this project and then the apps
themselves have their own urs dot py
that dictate URLs from there now
obviously many of you might find this
concept pretty annoying because there
are two URLs or py but it actually makes
a whole lot of sense for example your
main project URLs or py would have a
pointer to a blog for the blog app then
your blog app would have its own
directories for say authors in its URL
dot v1 what is neat about this is on one
web site you might have many things and
a blog so maybe you are running a
business so you point your main project
to block and then the author's would be
your website comm slash blog slash
authors then using that exact same app
you could have now here you can see that
there is a file called URL dot p1 it
actually dictates the URLs that lead to
and then the apps themselves have their
own you lvy
that dictate you are is from there so
don't worry we are going to create an
app and inside that app we are going to
define one more URL start py5 now we are
going to create an app but before that
let me change my directory and go to
demo let me clear my terminal and now
I'm going to type in Python managed or
py start application and the name of
your application I'm going to name it as
hello now when I go to this hello
directory and I hit an LS command so you
can see that there are a bunch of files
present here now the app is indeed
treated as its own package with its own
in8 dot py along with other files for
now we concern ourselves with views dot
py and we are actually going to add
another file called URL py but first let
me modify this views dot py
so for that I'm going to type in G edit
view dot py and here we go
so as you can see that there are a
couple of modules that are imported
already so let me first remove this
comment and now I'm going to write my
own view so before I write my view I
need to import the HTTP response
function present in Django dot HTTP
module for that I'll type from Django
dot HTTP import HTTP response that's all
and now I'm going to define a method and
I'm going to name it as index
give a colon inside this method I'm
going to return an HTTP response
and what I wanted to turn I can write in
here hello world
close the parentheses that's all
go ahead and save this let me clear my
terminal once next up we create a new
file called a URLs dot py for that I'm
going to type in a G edit URLs dot py
and I've told you that there are two
URLs for each application there's one
you are now over here I need to import
certain modules for that I'll type in
from Django dot cons dot URLs import URL
and from period import views now this
from period import the period here means
we are importing from the current
package it is a relative input next we
have a URL pattern definition so let me
do that first so I will type in here URL
patterns
equal to square braces and then I'm
going to make use of regular expression
so we have discussed a regular
expression in the previous session so if
you have any doubts you can refer from
there so this carrot actually means part
of the string and this dollar means
ending of a string comma views dot index
function gamma give a name so I'm going
to name it as index close the
parentheses give a comma close the
square braces as well now these are
regular expression as I have told you
earlier as well these URL pattern
definitions that will take whatever the
user types in and try to find a match so
our expression here is Garrett and
dollar the caret match that it is a
start of a string and the dollar marks
the end thus this specific URL will be
the index there there will be nothing
else in the URL like a home page the
difference however is between the URS
file of my project and my app is that
this us dot py file is relative it is
actually local to the hello application
that we have so now our application has
URL handling but our main project does
not actually point to this hello
application at all so let's do that next
so now I'm going to edit demo slash you
are s dot py so for that let me go back
and save this first I will go back now
and I'm going to enter the demo
directory let me clear all of this now
here I will enter the demo directory
again there are two directories as I've
told you earlier as well when I hit an
El Escobar you can see that there is
euros or p1 so let us go ahead and edit
that Posadas IG edit URLs or py and here
we go
now we need to add an import here for
Django convert urs dot in queued and
insert and in queued in a URL path in
list so for that what I'm going to do is
I'm going to type in here include comma
URL now we are going to leave this admin
part here and talk about it later but
basically Django already has a built-in
admin control panel now what you are
going to do is we are going to add
another URL to link our application that
is hello so simply what we could do type
in here URL regular expression carrot
hello
mama include
hello thought URLs close the parentheses
give a comma oops we need to close a
quotation as well
yeah not perfect that's it guys
now go ahead and save this and quit now
let me clear my terminal next up we need
to include our application in our
installed applications so where you can
find that obviously in settings or py5
so maybe edit dot eg edit settings or py
and over here you can see we have
installed labs here so I'm going to add
in my name of my application which is
hello
that's it it is done now it is installed
probably the easiest way to install go
ahead tear your terminal go back to the
demo directory so now we have managed or
py file in this particular demo
directory so with the help of that I'm
going to run my server let me show you
how we can do that so I'm going to type
in here Python managed or py
and the command is runs over that's all
go ahead execute it and now it says that
you have some 13 unapplied migrations
you don't need to worry about that we
are going to discuss it later but first
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
open my browser and go to port 8000
slash hello that is the name of my
application localhost 8000
and we can see that HelloWorld is
present here so we have actually created
this HelloWorld application which is a
pretty basic application but a good
example to learn with now if you have
any doubt still here you can ask me I
told you how to exactly start your
project what all files will be there I
explain you what is managed or py what
is the function of URLs or py the
settings of py everything I explain you
in detail so if you have any questions
or any doubts you can ask and I even
told you the reason for choosing two
URLs or py alright so we have no
questions here so I go back to my slides
and let us see what it has to offer us
so we have created a hello world
application using Django framework now
let us increase the complexity a bit and
now we are going to create a poser
application using jug now let me tell
you what this application will do so now
what this poza application will have
allows actually certain set of questions
and for those questions they'll be
choices and people are going to vote for
any of those choices now at last two
parts one is an admin site that lets you
add and change the delete puts but for
that you need admin access at the same
time you have a public site that lets
people view polls and vote in them so
I've actually done all the coding part
but I'm going to give you a walkthrough
of Waddle code that I have written and
I'm going to explain that in detail so
you don't need to worry about that but
first let us move forward and have a
look at the directory structure so this
will be our main project directory that
is my site and it will have one manager
dot py file as well as this database
plus inside this my site directory we
have another my site as we have seen
that previously where we were having
that demo that actually inside the demo
we had one more demo so over here we
have iron it dot py settings or py urs
or py and WS d ID or keyword now inside
that my site directory I have defined an
application called polls and that polls
will have migrations templates
static and inside the templates pose
again we have these three files and
obviously we have added or py admin
models test urs views or fewer so I've
just given you an introduction of how
our dietary structure will look like now
what is this my site this my site can be
considered as a container for your
project and obviously you can change its
name it doesn't really matter then we
have a nine it dot py it is basically an
empty file and it is tell python that
this directory should be considered as a
python package now i have explained you
settings dot py file what it does then
you are at py we have seen that in hello
world application as well now comes
managed or py and we all know what
manages or py does if you have any
questions or any doubts with respect to
any of these files you can ask me
alright so let's move forward and see
now this directory structure will
actually host the four
application that I was talking about now
enough of the theoretical knowledge guys
now let us go ahead and execute this
practically now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to open my pie charm and I'm
going to show you what are these what
I'm going to show you how these files
looks like I'm going to explain the code
in detail so you don't need to worry
about that so this is the project that I
was talking about now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to first let me change
the view and enter the presentation mode
so that you will be able to see this
code better so what is a model you can
say a model is a single or a definitive
source of information about your data it
contains the essential fields and
behaviors of the data you are storing
generally each model maps to a single
database table and let me tell you guys
that each model is a Python class that
subclasses from Django DB models dot mod
and each attribute of the model
represents our database feed now over
here as you can see we have two classes
one is question and another is choice
and we have two fields here one is
question text and another is publication
date now each field is specified as a
class attribute and each attribute match
to our database column
so in this question model we have
question text and its maximum length
should be 200 and we have a publication
date that is models dot date/time field
and date published now we have one more
string method that is actually going to
return these question text up that we
have a method that actually gives us the
publication date now over here we are
calling this method and which is equal
to publication date then we are calling
it again and we are going to give a
short description that is whether it has
been published recently or not now we
have one more model for choices now over
here also we have question that is
equals to models dot foreign key now
note a relationship is defined using
foreign key that tells Django each
choice is related to a single question
Django supports all the common database
relationships many to one many to many
and one to one and we have our again one
more method that returns see a choice
text so this is how our models or py
looks like so if you have any questions
about you can ask me all right so we
have no questions so now what you need
to do is you need to run make migrations
that is you're telling Django that you
have made some changes to your models
I've actually done that already but I'll
show it to you again so for that I'll
open my terminal let me stop this and go
ahead
here my terminal and now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to show you how to
execute this make migration commands
without I'll type in Python managed or
py make my creations
no changes detected an app post because
I've already done that now after that
you need to run an SQL migrate command
that takes migration names under turn
their SQL now again I've already done
that so I don't need to do it and
finally what I need to do is I need to
run my grid again to create those mortal
tables in your database so if I go ahead
and do that
so for that I need to type in Python
managed or py migrate
so it has no migrations to apply because
again and again I'm telling I've already
done that alright so what is the next
thing that we need to do we need to tell
the admin that question objects have an
admin interface so to do that we need to
open the poll slash admin dot py file so
for that I'm going to open my PyCharm
and let me go back to the normal view
and we are going to open this 8-bit dot
py file let me open the presentation
view again
so this is our admin dot py file looks
like now over here we have a class
called choice in line in order to
display the choices so first it will
import the choice class that is there
present in the models of py file and
then it gives you three by default three
choices and I mean it will give you a
space for three choices to write those
three choices and you can add some extra
choices as well now in this question
edmond class there are certain fields it
and the starting of this couple is
actually nothing but the title you have
date information then you have certain
fees like question text plus publication
date and then we have choice in line
question text publication date and all
those things and finally what we need to
do is we need to register admin dot site
dot resister question comma question
admin that's all we have to do
so the question class was present inside
the models of py file and we have one
question
Edmund class that is present here so
this will actually add question as well
as choices object to our admin interface
so I hope you have understood this any
questions or any doubts you can ask me
so we've seen how our models oty fine
looks like next up we need to create
views for our application so yeah this
is how our views are py file looks like
now over here is the beginning first of
all I have imported a couple of modules
this is render response to HTTP response
redirect reverse syndrich and after that
from models or py file I've imported
choice and question so we are using to
generate views here one is list view as
you can see it I'm highlighting with my
cursor and another is detail view
respectively those two views abstract
the concept of display a list of objects
and display a detail page for a
particular type of object now each
gender Aquino what model it will be
acting upon so this is provided using
the model attribute basically each
generate view needs to know what model
it will be acting upon and this is
provided by using the models attribute
so you can notice that we have a model
attribute here in which we have a
question similarly in our result view as
well now the details view genre queue
expects the primary key value captured
from the URL to be called pk
so we have PK for the general views not
question ID so that is the reason if you
can notice here we have PK equals to
question ID now by default detailed view
generate views --is a template called
app name slash model name detail dot
HTML but in our case it would use the
template pose slash question detail dot
HTML the template name attribute is used
to tell Jango to use a specific template
name instead of the auto-generated
default template name and now that is
the reason we have defined a template
name that is pose detail dot HTML and
similarly even for our results view as
well we have a results or HTML so these
template files I'll be showing to you
later in the session you don't need to
worry about it now basically we have
like three files in our templates folder
one is index dot HTML detail or HTML and
results dot HTML which is only for the
reason which is pretty basic is to have
a different appearance for each of our
page one is our home page another gives
the details of the question and the
another one gives the result of your
question now similarly the ListView
genrich's you use
a default template called app name slash
modern name list dot HTML we use
template name to tell ListView to use
our existing post slash index dot HTML
like we have done it in a detail view as
well as result view that's why we have
here post slash index dot HTML so I hope
you all are clear with of how abuse or
fever file looks like so one thing that
I forgot to tell you guys if we have a
function that we have defined just for
votes as well so you can notice it here
I am actually highlighting it right now
so this is how our function looks like
so I hope you all have understood this
views or py file if you have any
questions or doubts you can ask me so we
have no questions the next up what we
need to do is we need to link this views
or py file to our applications URL for
that I am going to enter pool slash you
are absorbed ey and we'll see it over
there what are things we need to add
so this is my URLs of Deva file which is
present in the post directly that is
post directory that is my application so
first I have given my app name that is
poles after that I have defined a URL
patterns for my index view that is my
home page and for my detailed view that
is when I click a question what all
details should be there after that for
my results what all things should be
available and then of you for my votes
so these all URLs are actually for my
index view detailed view result view and
vote so I hope you have understood what
I am trying to say here so next step is
to add a URL in our my site /url dot py
file to link our application that is
poles so for that I need to open the URL
or py file for my site directory which
is present here so over here as you can
see that this particular URL pattern is
for my post application so this is how
you actually add a URL patterns if you
have any questions of doubts you can ask
me we have already done that in our
hello world application so I am pretty
sure it will be clear to you now if you
can remember that in a views or py file
we were referencing to certain templates
like index or HTML detail dot HTML and
result storage table so why we did that
this is because the page design was
hard-coded before in the views dot py
file so if I want to change the way the
page looks I'll have to edit this Python
code that is views of p1 so instead of
that I can use Django's template system
to separate the design from Python by
creating a template that the view can
use all right so first what I did I
created a directory called template
inside that directory I have again
created one more directory called poles
now in that pole directory I have three
files detail on HTML index dot HTML and
results dot HTML so let me show you that
one by one first I will open index or
HTML so this is the index or HTML file
which views or py file can actually use
so we have actually separated the design
from Python by creating a template and
views is actually using this template
index or HTML and here is results or
HTML similarly we have a detail dot HTML
as well
so this is pretty much it guys we have
actually defined our views or py file we
have defined a URL patterns as well for
our application then we have added that
URL pattern in our urs dot py file that
is there in my site directory after that
we also saw the admin interface how to
add certain fields or objects to that
admin interface and then we created a
super user so that no one can access our
admin page so any questions or any
doubts you can ask me and was our
explanation fine all right guys so let
me open my terminal and start this over
and see how our website looks like
let me clear my terminal and now are the
start by solar I'm going to make users
manager py script that I've done that
multiple times now the command is run
silver and here we go so let me open my
browser again and let me add some
questions here first so what questions
should I add any questions any
suggestions you have in order to add in
the question text you can write down so
my question is Chelsea the best football
club so we are choices yes so I'll give
certain words to it so I'd say 100 votes
then we can add one more choice text
that same maybe give it as 16 seven
votes then one more choice ticks that I
can add no so we'll have only one vote
for that now go ahead and save this so
we have pocket
all right fine guys so I need to add
this information data published as well
so today now now I can go ahead and save
this so this question has been added so
what I can do is I can directly go to my
polls index page and view that
so here's a question is Chelsea the best
football club we go there then we have
three options yes maybe or no so you can
vote here if I click one yes and take
the word and it's 801 votes because 100
votes I've defined in my admit interface
itself and 76 people says maybe an only
one person says no I can vote again as
well so if I click there I can choose
any of these options so if I click on
maybe so it'll include one vote add one
more to type maybe choices it alright
guys so this is it if you have any
questions or any doubts you can write it
down in our chat box
all right so we have few football fans
in the audience and one of them says
Manchester United is the best all right

let's not change the topic alright guys
any questions or any doubts you have
alright so we have no doubt so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go back to
my slides and I'm going to give you a
brief summary of what all things we have
discussed so first we saw the whole web
development process what are the various
phases in that web development process

frameworks and we focus on Django and we
understood why we use frameworks for web
development then we saw what exactly
