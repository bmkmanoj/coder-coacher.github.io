add value analysis
okay there is one particular topic
called add value analysis it is not
something which is regularly used or
seen to be used in most organizations
but it is one of the very good tool to
be used tools and technique to be used
in the project to ensure or to have a
better understanding of how the project
is progressing
there is a question do we need to
memorize all the process across the five
phases
from Jay Jay yes there is a need to
memorize but it is not a difficult task
once we go through the topics in detail
we will understand there is a natural
flow of activities so once we understand
the natural flow it is easier to
remember okay so in earned value what we
really do is we try to measure our
progress our based on
be value based on the money
both schedule and cost is calculated on
the basis of that we will take an
example to see that
so it's objective method to measure
project performance and I use to measure
project health and project performance
it is a quantitative technique for
assessing progress as the software
project team goes through to work tasks
are located common value scale for every
project task
ah so just give me a moment let me just
take an example and we will explain how
this is done
this is this is one area where you will
need to memorize the formulas
PMP there are few areas where we need to
memorize formulas this is the biggest of
the north and you can expect around five
questions coming from
this particular topic
now why is evey a needed there are
different measures of different types of
tasks this allows you to give one single
way of measuring everything it provides
an early warning signal for prompt
corrective action
so it says bad news does not age well it
means that if you keep holding to the
bad news it does not help we need to
attack that and take care of it
immediately as a project manager if we
know that the project is not going as
per schedule it will get delayed it is
we need to take care of the situation
and find out what is causing other delay
and what can be done to take care of it
while there is still time to recover
maybe you need additional funding may
need additional resource something or
the other need to roll up progress of
many tasks into overall project status
and you need to have a uniform unit of
measure for the progress Evy helps you
to pro give get all these things now
there are certain things called tank
where value earned value and actual cost
with the help of the example we will see
what it is
earlier the planned value used to be
called BC WS or budgeted cost of work
scheduled and value used to be called bc
w p which is budgeted cost of work
performed and actual cost of work
performed a CW p in case of PMP exam
they might use the PVV AC or b CW s v CW
p ra c WP any of these two terms but we
should know what each means and so if
they are saying b c WS we know that they
are talking about pv and they are saying
BC the loopy we are talking about VV and
if they are talking about AC WP it means
they are talking about actual cost
now these are the different form
that are there
we will not both
details in each of them but we will take
an example to understand how this works
so unvalued the process of measuring the
performance of the project against what
was planned to identify variants
opportunities to improve the project or
just check the project help so it's a
system of mathematical formula that
compares work perform against work
planned measure the actual cost of the
work the project has performed
now here the only complexity that
happens is the schedule is also
calculated based on dollars so we have
to understand that and then it is fine
so what is planned value now if you are
were suppose to work in a project and
the cost of the project is $400,000 and
it is planned to be finished in a year
the complete project
after six months what does that mean six
months means half of the year
so 50% of the burger so you are planned
a value act after six months is 50% of
the project cost which is fifty percent
of four hundred thousand which is two
hundred thousand or in value management
is always calculated at a particular
date at a particular date
so as of that date that is six months
from when it started we have done
we are supposed to do 200 thousand worth
of work
what is the Earned value it is the
physical work completed to date and the
authorized budget for that work now in
the same example if we say that at the
end of the six months we have done 45%
of the work so what is our iron value it
is 45% of 400,000 so we have done
that $185,000 worth of work how much
were we supposed to do $200,000 worth of
work so we are $15,000 worth of work
shot
which necessarily means as he says we
are behind schedule
we are going late</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
