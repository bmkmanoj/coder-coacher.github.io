divided into six two main areas and
three levels okay so I'll just quickly
talk about those six lumen the first
domain talks about the value driven
delivery so it talks so when we say it
talks about the value driven delivery it
says how you can add value to your
client how you can increase the ROI of
the client how you can show him the that
the money that he is invested is being
utilized properly the output or the
outcome for that for that investment
would be fair good enough so this domain
talks about the value driven delivery so
it will talk about how you how you as a
team and with the help of the product
owner can do the prioritization how you
should focus on a continuous incremental
development then how the word positive
well you should be added to your client
requirement how the second domain talks
about is the stakeholder engagement how
you understand what exactly your client
needs what what what is the expectation
what is the acceptance criteria or what
is the pro kind of a product that client
has in his mind okay rod is blah small
string team performances and practices
that do this domain specifically talks
about how you empower your team is how
you collaborate with them we have been
talking about collaboration
collaboration collaboration so this
talks about how you can help your teams
be empowered how you can build a fit a
trust in them that whatever they are
doing would be valued how they can raise
their voice and whatever concerns they
have are answered so this domain talks
about how you can do that okay the
fourth domain talks about the planning
there are three so we will talk about
planning in the later stage as well so
there so as biggest myth of agile is
there is no planning involved guys this
is absolutely junk there are three
levels of planning how you plan
and based on the outcomes of three
levels of planning how you adapt
yourself how you estimate the work and
how you you know understand what would
be the velocity or what would be the
work what can be your output or what is
that your team can produce in the given
time of timeframe okay then domain 5
talks about problem detection and
resolution it talks how you can manage
your risks how you can mitigate them and
how you find a solution to them and how
early you can what are the best ways of
identifying your risks as possible as
early as possible okay and 6 is the
continuous improvement where we will
also talk about the continuous
integration and continuous improvement
of the processes how how you can
retrospect with your team's what went
well what went bad what are the various
feedback ways that should be implemented
so that your teams are improving
continuously okiie doesn't say that once
the processes have been set up they
should be followed it says inspect and
adapt inspect your processes every now
and then and adapt from the learnings of
those processes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
