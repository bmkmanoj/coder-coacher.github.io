and today me and Ray spar will be
discussing what is artificial
intelligence so I'll be looking at
various applications of artificial
intelligence will also see how to
achieve artificial intelligence and
finally we'll be discussing about the
artificial intelligence course provided
by a director but first let us see is
artificial intelligence a threat to
human beings so speaking in that context
orab tell me what comes to your mind
when you think of a highly advanced
robot well race for the pizza that I
have in my mind it's a super high five
warrior robot fighting with advanced
machinery embedded in its own bone you
don't like a robot with a cannon arm and
another with a machine gunner like in
trance or movies ok but does it ever
come to your mind sort of that what if
such a powerful robot or that Autobot
points a gun at you instead of the
enemies because maybe it doesn't want to
be controlled by you anymore generation
and that will actually scare me think
about it if humans can create machines
that are more intelligent than us and
there is something to be worried about
DoDEA think so Reshma yes of course and
even when you see movies like these
where a robot turns savage the theory
seems quite plausible doesn't it I
completely agree with you Richmond and
let me tell you a very interesting story
about this robot by answered robotics
the name of this report is Sophia
so Sofia is pretty much similar to the
one in the movie X machine I believe you
have seen that movie yes I have alright
she is able to behave like an adult but
the learning of less than a year which
takes humans 20 years so have a question
for you raise ma'am how much time it
took for you to learn how to ride a
bicycle I guess I was about 12 when I
learned how to ride a bicycle what if I
tell you that Sophia can do it probably
in few weeks so if our learning power is
so robust I think she'll just need a
couple of years to outsmart humans and
she even said in an interview that she
wants to destroy humanity oh my
and even Elan musk I don't think so that
guy needs any introduction I will just
say that he's the most farsighted
businessman I've ever seen and he is
commented on to it know that artificial
intelligence is more dangerous than
North Korea ish MA I cannot imagine
something more dangerous than Kim Jong
well sorry we'll just say that I'm not
ready for a third world war
speaking the context of a I think it
becomes scary when a machine starts to
do something that it wasn't supposed to
do or it starts doing things unexpected
so take this for an example the Google
AI translation tool so as a part of its
training it was taught to translate from
English to Korean Korean to English than
English to Japanese and Japanese to
English but surprisingly after that it
was directly able to translate from
Japanese to Korean and Korean to
Japanese without using English as a
bridge and let me tell you sorrow that
it wasn't part of its training so it
basically developed its own intermediate
language to translate Japanese and
Korean on its own you see what machines
can do on their own and this is called
zero shot so that's pretty fascinating
to know Reshma but I don't think so we
should scare our audience further and I
think as long as we know how exactly it
works things will be in our control so
let us understand what is artificial
intelligence so Reshma I would like to
know your thoughts about what is
artificial intelligence because when I
go on internet on time artificial
intelligence I see multiple definitions
I see people have given their own
definitions about artificial
intelligence so what are your thoughts
about it I like to break down the term
and then understand the meaning of it so
you can see that the term artificial
intelligence is composed of two words
artificial and intelligence so
artificial means anything man-made and
it's just basic second standard
definition an intelligent refers to
intellect or thinking power which is an
abstract thing and most of the times we
think that things that we cannot see or
the abstract things is not something
that we can recreate but it is not the
case we have created a man-made thinking
power or intellect and that is what
artificial intelligence is according to
me but that completely makes sense man I
would also like to share my thoughts
about it so artificial intelligence is
basically creating intelligent softwares
making a machine that is smart a machine
that has the power to think analyse and
make decisions based on that for example
if I teach Reshma how to multiply two by
four I don't think so I need to teach
her how to run the platform by two so
that is nothing but intelligence so if
you can put that intelligence inside a
system that is all artificial
intelligence that's a very nice
definition
thank you race nah I'm glad you find it
useful
every artificial intelligence software
is based on a particular good and now
you guys must be wondering how do you
achieve artificial intelligence so there
are numerous ways of achieving
artificial intelligence and let us
discuss those approaches will be
discussing machine learning first let me
give you a proper definition of that
machine learning is a type of artificial
intelligence that provides computers
with the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed I know you didn't
get anything guys so Rach now why don't
you simplify for us so the best way of
learning something is by taking a look
at an example and there is an example in
front of your screen so here we train
our machine on various types of dog
images and then we feed in a dog image
on which the machine is already trained
on and then if we recognize the dog in
the image now let us discuss one more
scenario so here the image we feed in is
a fat dog which your machine is not
trained on and because of that a machine
won't be able to recognize that image so
what do you do now sorry sir a smart
answer to this talent lies inside your
brain so this challenge was overcome by
deep learning which is inspired from how
a human brain works you can even say
that it uses Neron networks so the
challenge that we saw the previous slide
how our brain has other problem rational
so when we see different types of dogs
our brain tends to create an abstract
image of the dog or you can say that we
recognize certain features which are
common to all the dots like a dog's nose
ears tail 4 etc so even if we have not
seen that particular type of dog we can
recognize that based on the general
features well that is nothing but deep
learning in a nutshell so the deep
learning we try to extract few features
which are a very general which are very
abstract that you will find in almost
all the dogs that exist in the world and
based on those features we can recognize
the picture that we are feeling it it
contains a dog right so let me just give
you a quick introduction to deep
learning so deep learning is a subfield
of machine learning concerned with
algorithms
inspired by the structure and function
of the brain all artificial neural
networks now rage now please simplify
this for us so here you see different
layers the first layer is called the
input layer then the two hidden layers
and finally the output
there so this layers of multiple
artificial neurons that is inspired by
brain cells called neurons and in every
layer some kind of function is performed
the output of the first layer becomes
the input to the next and we have
separate tutorial on deep learning and
neural networks so you can go through
that for detailed explanation of deep
learning
we'll leave the links of those videos in
the description box below so you can
check it out from there
now the question that I have in my mind
right now but I think a lot of people
must be thinking about it is artificial
intelligence well a is actually
perceived as a thing of a future or has
a very high technology thing that has
very recently become a buzzword but is
it actually new so let us take a look at
the history of artificial intelligence
for that so Sarah wanted to take us
through it
Dishman I'm pretty sure you'll be amazed
to know that artificial intelligence was
introduced by McCarthy in the year 1956
and around the 60s era when everyone
were involved in cultural and political
evolution somewhere up there people were
thinking about creating art now McCarthy
introduced this in his paper which was
presented in conference that was held
mainly on the subject of artificial
intelligence
even Alan Turing proposed a stearic test
in 1950s in a hearing test and
interrogator asked questions and if he
cannot distinguish whether the answer is
coming from a machine or human the
machine passes the Turing test or you
can say that machine is intelligent and
guys this was happening in the 50s so
Reshma when your family was sending
telegram and there was no internet
people were researching artificial
intelligence that's pretty fascinating
to me
it is pretty fascinating to me as well
sort of and now when I'm thinking about
this I think the concept of man-made
beings dates back to the medieval times
is it is of course because there were
mentions of mechanical men and
artificial beings in Greek myths such as
the golden robots of Hephaestus like
Talos and pygmalions gallaecia and there
were also rumors and stories where
people talked about placing a mind into
matter and this is exactly the main
concept behind artificial intelligence
making a brain and placing it into a
mechanical body so guys when people say
that artificial intelligence is new or
it's a thing of future you can hush them
up with the facts like these and it's
pretty fascinating you know I sometimes
wonder is my ancient people were really
to do that well I don't know about
ancient people sorry but we sure can do
it now and we are doing it now so let us
take a look at the applications of AI to
show you how much we have advanced in
the field of AI and how much dependent
are we on AI now so we are using a is in
different fields
there are several newest academy
institutions that are employing
artificial intelligence to tackle some
of the world's greatest economic and
social challenges there using AI to
determine the poverty struck areas in
the world and data mined ways to
overcome it similarly even aviation
industry Bhishma one such example will
be irrigation and another example that I
can think of is ticket price
determination and reach my I've heard
that robots are even teaching students
yes you heard it right sort of robots or
even teaching people now they're known
as intelligent tutoring system or I TS
and there is an IPS called Sherlock that
teaches airforce technicians to diagnose
electrical problems in aircrafts
all right viewers I have a question for
you what do you think Krishna is a robot
or she is out here you could be now I am
NOT well I don't even think that robots
speak like this anymore they're so
human-like today so we'll leave our
viewers wondering it's a comment if you
think I'm a robot or not so let us know
fine so let's go forward and talk about
health care
so in health care with the help of
artificial neural networks people are
trying to mourn human body parts then
even analyzing the health history of a
patient to predict what sort of diseases
he is more prone to suffer from in the
future
now Richmond will tell us about how it
can be used in heavy industries so this
is a field where we have to be dependent
on artificial intelligence like in
automobile manufacturing factories it
becomes hazardous for humans to lift all
those heavy machine parts in chemical
factories we humans cannot work in a
toxic environment and that is why we
need a machine to do that for us let me
tell you that in 2014 China Japan the
United States the Republic of Korea and
Germany together amounted to 70% of the
total sales volume of robots now I have
a question for you sort of do you think
the robots will take all our jobs in
future if they're advancing so much I'm
not really sure about that right now but
I'll give you a very good example so 100
years back when people were talking
about computer
the same assumption was made for
computers as well so they thought that
computers will take all of our jobs but
what is the scenario right now
computer has animated so many jobs so I
believe that's the same will be with
artificial intelligence as well now let
us talk about finance and gorllewin
trading involves the use of complex
artificial intelligent systems to make
trading decisions at speed several
orders of magnitude greater than any
human is capable of after making
millions of trades in a day without any
human intervention automated trading
systems are typically used by large
institutional investors so here also
artificial intelligence is making things
automatic now is the time to look at
very fascinating applications of
artificial intelligence that have been
developed recently now reached now what
if I tell you the article you see on the
right hand side is not written by any
human it is written by words and who is
wordsmith wordsmith is a natural
language generation engine that lets you
turn data into text at any scale and in
any format a language so all you have to
do this map is to enter new data to
create a very unique story now let's
look at you would applications of
artificial intelligence let's talk about
transport guides before that rich man
will share few starts with us so I have
a few depressing stats in front of me
so nearly 1.3 million people died in
road crashes each year on an average of
3287 deaths per day and an additional 20
to 50 million are injured or disabled
and more than half of all the road
traffic deaths occur among the young
adults aged from 15 years to 44 years
now you guys can imagine the base set of
human resource why do you think it
happens it happens because humans tend
to become negligible and careless at
times they might be drunk while they're
driving they might get tired they might
be feeling sleepy so because of all
these reasons these accidents are
actually increasing they are not
increasing at all so the more number of
cars we have the more number of reckless
drivers we have and the more number of
accidents happen every day now a
possible solution to this is if a car
can drive on its own now obviously a
machine won't drink and drive and a
machine will never get tired because of
all these reasons self-driving cars are
injuries these cars maker would save
than one in his right now now since we
are talking about self-driving cars let
me tell you that we even have cell
flying helicopters the k-max may be used
for firefighting but it can carry up to
six thousand pounds of cargo this
helicopter kit dropped nearly 2800
gallons of water on the fire now talking
about helicopters resna has a very
interesting application to share with us
yes I'm very excited to tell you about
this application so there is an
interesting example of artificial
intelligence technology that is created
for stopping hijackers so this machine
combines the function of a drone a
helicopter and trained snipers and this
helicopter is called the vigilante and I
personally not visit London so yeah
bring it on terrorists we have is
Atlantic do your worst
now race for the painting that you're
seeing is created by a very famous
painter called on have you heard of him
well I am NOT a very artistic person and
no I have not heard of Aaron but
paintings look really amazing I think
I'm a fan all right so you're a fan of
Adhan which is a computer program
written by artist Chanukah win so see
even machines are creative and
definitely a lot creative than you sir I
could sense that stress that you made
and definitely yes of course
and one more amazing creative
application of artificial intelligence
is that it can also compose music so
well Richmond let's played for our
viewers as well as for us
now in 2011 we even saw IBM Watson I
guess you guys have heard about IBM
Watson so once it is an IBM
supercomputer that uses artificial
intelligence and sophisticated
analytical software for optimal
performance as a question answering
machine
now Reshma has very interesting stats
about Watson to share with us yeah so
let me tell you a few interesting
details about Watson so the Watson
supercomputer processes at a rate of 80
teraflops that is trillion
floating-point operations per second and
to replicate a high functioning humans
ability to answer questions
Watson accesses 90 servers with a
combined datastore of over 200 million
pages of information which is processed
against six million logic rules and the
device and its data are self contained
in a space that could actually
accommodate ten refrigerators when you
add that kid will you tend to become
arrogant so because of that Watson
challenged two top-ranked players on
Jeopardy undefeated champions Ken
Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011 with
artificial intelligence google
deepmind's alphago defeated go champion
Lise at all which artificial
intelligence researcher thought was not
possible to achieve in next 20 years so
Rachel when I was talking about making
systems that are more intelligent than
us you can see that we have multiple
examples and this game is thought to
have originated at least 2,500 to 4,000
years ago and it is the oldest game that
is still played in this original form I
didn't know that you're welcome so now
you can see that we have come a long way
but trust me guys we have just erased
the curse of artificial intelligence
we still need to explore it scream and
guys if you have any good application of
artificial intelligence that you want to
share feel free to mention it in the
comment section
so now let's discuss about the
artificial intelligence and deep
learning with stencil flow course
provided by Ed Eureka
so this is how the structure of the
course is guys we'll begin by
understanding deep learning well
understand how it evolved what was the
reason for it for its introduction what
were we doing before that so all those
things will be covered in this
particular module then we'll understand
how neural networks work with stencil go
now tenza flow is nothing but a Python
library used for implementing deep
learning models the third body will also
deal with the same and by the end of
fourth body will be the master of deep
networks after that we'll be discussing
various types of networks first is
thermally versatile neural networks that
are used for image recognition then
recurrent neural networks IBM and
auto-encoders then the AIDS model will
deal with Kerris which is nothing but
one more library like things flow after
that we'll be discussing high level API
like PF flow and a tenth body will be
entirely dedicated to the project
now you guys must be wondering what are
the projects so let us look at those
projects one by one so the first project
that you will get will be real estate
price prediction now in real estate
price prediction you'll be given a data
set that will contain number of a lot of
features and you can say columns so
those columns will be like you know
crime rate what is the size of your
house and things like that and your last
column will be the label that is the
house right you need to drink a model of
that particular data set so whenever you
feed in those inputs
those features then it should predict
what is the value of that particular
house the next project is nevermind
detector so it is basically use in order
to figure out whether the obstacle is a
rock or is it an evil mind now Neville
mines a nothing but self contain
explosive devices placed in water to
damage submarines and surface ships so
the data set basically contains sonar
signals bounced off a metal cylinder as
well as sonar signals bounced off a rock
so you need to train your model on that
particular data set so that when you
feed in an input it should determine
whether it is a rock or is it a level
mind so the next project will be very
interesting guys it's about image
recognition system so here the data set
that will use will contain ten types of
images and multiple images of those time
classes you need to trade your model on
that particular dataset so that whenever
you feed in an image of which belongs to
those ten classes it should be able to
recognize that particular
it can be a boat can be airplane
automobile and similarly there are seven
other classes the next project is about
digital combination system so here we
have a dataset that contains handwritten
digits which has ten classes so
basically we have all the digits from 0
to 9 and you need to predict or you need
to train your model such that whenever
we feed in an image it should recognize
what desert it is similarly we have two
more projects we have one which is the
sentiment analysis system so you'll be
training your model on an IMDB data set
which will tell you whether you like a
particular movie or not based on your
earlier preferences and then the last
project is very interesting
this is a wine classifier project you'll
be classifying different kinds of wine
using a neural network well the voice of
ratio is very different when she was
explaining the six project I think she's
pretty excited about yes I am excited
this is a very cool project so by this
we have reached the end of our sessions
