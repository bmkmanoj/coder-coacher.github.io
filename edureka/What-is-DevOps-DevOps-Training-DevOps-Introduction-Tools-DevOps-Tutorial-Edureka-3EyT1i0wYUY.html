I'm going to tell you why divorce is an
absolute need in every organization it
is the latest buzzword in the IT
industry and it would remain that way
until every organization out there
adopts DevOps of one of its variations
for software development so let's see
the agenda for today we will start off
by talking about the evolution of
software development over the years we
will talk about how the methodologies
and strategies have changed with respect
to time and needs after that we will see
how Facebook is using DevOps and why
they stopped following the agile model
we will then talk about DevOps in detail
and the different stages in DevOps
lifecycle we will then finish off
today's session by discussing a few
DevOps tools so first off we have the
waterfall model in this model the
requirements need to be provided up
front and in full the software here is
developed with the idea that it is going
to be stable for many years to come the
development here consists of different
phases first the requirements gathering
phase then the architecture design phase
then comes the coding phase and after
that is the testing and the debugging
phase finally afterwards the software
can be delivered well over time people
found that this model was very slow on
the developers took a long time to
develop the software at times
development was so slow that by the time
the actual software was delivered new
comes of the customers changed and they
didn't want the software at all so this
gave birth to agile development the
difference with agile was that the
entire software would not be delivered
at one go but it would be broken out
into smaller chunks of features and
delivered and phigs intervals like every
week or once every two weeks with
multiple iterations so releasing these
features in multiple sprints not only
gave the end users or customers more
satisfaction with respect to progress
made but also give them the flexibility
to change the requirements Midway and
allow the developers to incorporate
feedback given by the customers thereby
saving lots of time and money for making
the changes well even though it reduce
development time drastically it lacked
agility in operations so that was when
DevOps came in well what is DevOps it is
the practice of bringing agility to both
development and operations all the major
companies have started adopting this
because they have realized that
development and operations go hand in
hand to build a foolproof software so
let's understand the necessity of DevOps
the classic use case of Facebook
well back in 2011 Facebook released
multiple features like timeline music
functionality and ticker suddenly
available to the entire user base this
global deployment got them in trouble
Facebook at that time had around 500
million users and a majority of them are
active users so as and when the users
realized that their favorite social
media website suddenly introduced new
functionality like Timeline and music
the brawl excited to explore the
features and they all started using
Facebook right away this led to high
website traffic which in turn led to
their server meltdown well for obvious
reasons this high server utilization had
a negative impact on their website and
it was so bad that it brought down the
site to its knees within minutes this
was a catastrophic situation for a
company as big as Facebook well this and
also that the newly released features
got mixed response from their users some
felt that the timeline and the music
functionalities were awesome and some
did not like it at all so they also had
a tough time figuring out the flaws and
incorporating feedback this is when they
realized that there should be a change
in the way the software is deployed
pause this they came up with something
called as the dark launching in fact
many companies now are using this dark
launching technique Facebook Google
Amazon and Netflix are just a few of
them now let's understand what this
doctor launching is it is a technique in
which the features are deployed to a
small user base this user base is
continuously monitored and their
feedback is taken and the features are
made better by continuous development
and testing once the features are stable
they are deployed to the rest of the
users over multiple releases now let's
learn dark launching in more detail by
understanding of Facebook would have
implemented it according to the dark
lodging technique the features are
already deployed to a small user base if
you can see from the diagram only one
delivery pipeline is currently active
there are many delivery pipelines
however they are all turned off at this
point
now what Facebook does is they
continuously monitor the specific user
based on which the features have been
deployed to identify the bugs and get
the user feedback these bugs are fixed
and the feedback is incorporated by
continuous development and continuous
testing now these updated features they
are then deployed back to the same user
base this process continues until the
features are stable and the users are
happy with the features so one the
stability is achieved then these
features are deployed to multiple user
bases by turning on different delivery
pipelines on the contrary if the users
do not like the features then Facebook
and this perform a rollback option and
remove the functionality altogether this
way Facebook has a controlled or stable
mechanism for developing new
functionality to its massive user base
this also helps Facebook to prepare
their servers for deployment as they can
predict the user activity on their
website and they can scale up their
servers accordingly
you'd have noticed that there are many
new terminologies mentioned in this
process like continuous development
continuous testing continuous
integration continuous deployment and
continuous monitoring these activities
cannot be performed using the agile
model
hence the methodology of DevOps was the
way forward it is not just Facebook even
Google Amazon and Netflix use this
process for releasing features Google
initially released gchat features only
to their own employees and based on
multiple iterations and feedback from
different teams they came up with a
flawless functionality Netflix did
something similar they came up with
something called as a simian army
it consisted of different monkeys like
chaos monkeys Latin sea monkeys and so
on chaos monkey was the first in the
series it was basically a code which one
deployed can shoot down a server
instance and cause outrage this tool was
more like a challenge with the
developers and Netflix because service
will be short down at random during
businesses and developers had to work in
real time to fix the issue during which
time the users will actually be on the
website and they should not have any
interruption while swimming that movie
or TV shows this helped Netflix folks
will learn their lessons about the
weakness of their system none build
automatic recovery mechanisms to deal
with them so next time an instance fails
at 3 a.m. on a Sunday they will never
need to worry
so what is DevOps DevOps is a software
development approach which involves
continuous development continuous
testing continuous integration
continuous deployment and continuous
monitoring of the software throughout
its development lifecycle this is
exactly the process adopted by all the
top companies to develop high quality
software and shorter development life
cycles resulting in greater customer
satisfaction isn't that what every
company wants definitely by now you have
understood the significance of the
different stages of devoxx let us now
see the tools which are used to automate
these stages for source code management
we have gate and SVN these tools help us
in maintaining the code throughout the
development lifecycle different
revisions of the code can be stored and
if we want to rollback on any changes
then we can just call that previous
version of the code and deploy to
production for building we have tools
like maven and in Gradle they help you
package your code into executable files
which can then be produced into the
testing environment then for continuous
testing we have tools like selenium and
j-unit so continuous integration we have
a very popular tool called Jenkins so if
you're a software developer you would
know what Jenkins is continuous
integration means that you can test
changes and then test that changes with
other changes the next stage is the
continuous deployment stage for this we
have tools like puppet chef salt stack
and ansible as and when the code is
tested and ready it is pushed to
production or the non developer machine
in this stage and finally for continuous
monitoring we have tools like New Relic
sensu and Nagios these tools help us to
monitor our servers closely and check
the health of the system anything can
happen you are served at any time right
so it's important they are monitored
proactively rather than reactively well
they also improve productivity and
increase the reliability of the systems
and quite possibly save lots of money
and IT support costs so folks that is
the end of the session thank you for
listening to the whole video and I hope
it helped you understand some important
concepts around DevOps you can come in
