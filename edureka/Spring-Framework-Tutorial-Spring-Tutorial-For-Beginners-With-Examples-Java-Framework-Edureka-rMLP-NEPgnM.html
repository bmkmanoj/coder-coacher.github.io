this is a Jean on behalf of Erica so we
did Java enter equations before and
we're gonna represent the spin framework
tutorial now so hope you will enjoy it
so let's see what all we have in our
Spring Framework tutorial today so
what's gonna be the agenda will
understand why we need the frameworks in
Java and what exactly a Java framework
is so thereafter we shall be proceeding
towards Spring Framework
now that's where we're going to focus on
we'll see what spring framework why we
need Spring Framework and various
modules available in the spring we shall
be focusing practically on inversion of
control
that's like IOC container which is the
core of the spring module we'll see what
our beans and we'll also see what is
meant by a dependency injection so why
Java frameworks so guys are there are
various problems associated with the
enterprise edition of Java right so when
you talk about the technology it becomes
complex and we are writing the
enterprise applications to name a few we
got a lookup problem so when you gonna
do lookup right so you're going to face
the problems and on the memory front
again the optimizations are not done
properly right so we got Hallie weight
components and they're gonna focus more
on memory part so we need to know Java
frameworks which are basically a
collection of a classes we say flexion
of API it's a predefined code which you
can use in your programs to solve some
specific problem right so how the things
going to work over here so we got large
bodies of predefined code available with
a sprite we can also call them API so
framework is nothing it's a set of API
so so if you talk on the code part so
it's nothing it's a bytecode write the
clap is available for us to be utilized
so what we need to do we need to add
this snippet or this predefined API in
our program right so that we can solve a
problem for a specific domain right so
that's how you going to come up with
your API usage now what can be the
advantages of
Java payment the first thing is
efficiency right so we want a security
we want less expenses and a support
right now all these features so they are
an expectation at the developer end
right so when you are writing the code
if you are using the framework if you
are using the predefined code so all
these features you need to relax now on
these all four fronts right so the port
which you are going to use it will be
efficient right it's gonna be secure so
you need not to update for it because
most of the Java frameworks they are
open-source right and you just need to
use then we just need to include it into
your program as a dependency and then
you finally use it right other than that
support in the form of documentation or
even you know in the form of various
Stack Overflow threads coming in so it's
it's going to be very easy for us to
manage any problem which we have so
there are various disadvantages evenly
associated with the Java framework right
so the number one is you got restriction
then the code is public and finally the
custom built features let's understand
that point now so we are restricted to
use an API the way it is so you can't
modify it now that's the whole scenario
if you want to use an 8a in your own
different way right you can't do that so
we are restricted to use the same API
let's say that one of the method it's
taking three inputs and you are supposed
to have a method which can do the same
task with only one input so you can't do
that now it's a limitation right so
there are restrictions the code is
public it means that if you are going to
use any of the API what's going to
happen the same AC is exposed to the
public let's say you are supposed to use
an open source API which is doing an
encryption and decryption for you right
so it's going to be very much you know
challenging for us to maintain that kind
of procedure T then the custom built
features so if you have API is you can
write your code but the thing is
whatever the API is written so what is
the language or the technology behind
the API so many times that will not be
exposed to the developer right so
specifically
k6o web service you might not know what
is the internals of that API so that's
what the encapsulation is all about
right and here you place a challenge
again so we got various Java frameworks
available now right there are a lot of
frameworks available so frameworks is
nothing it's a set of API so you got JSF
maven hibernate struts place spring
etcetera etcetera etcetera lot of Java
frameworks are available in the market
so specifically we are supposed to
discuss on Spring Framework right so
there is a big development team of some
XYZ company with this group of six
members and it's hired by the manager hi
right so he's the leader of the e so
Harry has got a call from the management
team with some urgent requirement none
right so he's having an urgent
requirement to be implemented and to be
delivered to the client somehow so II we
got one request from the client that we
need to write an application but the
challenge is that we have got very
little time frame to finish off this
product now this is one challenge which
as a developer or as a development
company we don't have basic portion so
clients whenever they're gonna come
they're going to come up with the first
thing as we have very less time right
when they have less time we need to
perform the n plus to the client so we
need to rely on the framework somehow so
if we go by the general way it's going
to take a lot of time in writing the
unnecessary code right it's going to
take lot of time so we need something
that's fast flexible and efficient so
it's not only that we going to use a
framework but we also need to consider
more of the parameters so that's like
you should have an efficient code which
you can integrate and you can write an
application with right so in case we
need to use any framework now RIA page
let's let's use the eddie framework over
here so alice's we can go for starts
then someone field we can go for
hibernates right these are all Java
frameworks more or less right so why
Lydia say that we can use Spring
Framework now why specifically Spring
Framework because it
shines the other frameworks in a way
that it's a framework of frameworks now
so it provides us the flexibility as
well as we got model-view-controller
architecture right so Spring Embassy is
basically a based on interfaces so the
way we got structure and hibernate so
they are not all the interfaces but you
need to use the objects and classes
whatever we have so in Spring Framework
specifically in the MVC
what we got we got interfaces so that we
can write our own implementation now
that's a benefit right so we our
interface we just use it we write the
way we want to create the implementation
of that interface so this way you want
to pick the client side even all right
so Scott says let's have a discussion on
Spring Framework so how it's going to
solve our problem right so so nice
spring framework increases the
efficiency of the application so it's
going to be optimized so the code is
optimized so it's going to reduce the
overall application development time
since it's a framework right we need to
use the API so it's gonna help us in our
development path so we can easily finish
our project in the given time frame now
that's where we try to put in the string
so that's why night let's proceed with
the spring length so guys let's see what
is Spring Framework right and what it is
all about so are there a lot of features
are if you can see now right so it's an
open source framework it's a lightweight
application framework it means that it's
a less on memory so the objects
constructed in the memory so they're
gonna take less space and it's efficient
it's optimized so overall code
complexity is also reduced over here and
we got various tools associated with the
Spring Framework which you can use we
call spring framework as framework off
frameworks so what we can do now over
here we can integrate the hibernate code
with the spring code and we can use in
our application way right so we got
various tools it's an array of resources
which is available to us and we can just
use and we can concentrate
only on writing our business logic
rather than focusing on writing some
unnecessary code so Spring Watts
relieved in the February 2003 right it's
available on SourceForge and the guy rod
Johnson is behind the Spring Framework
right so this guy did the Spring
Framework now spring saber has an
ecosystem if you see on to the Spring
Framework right so we got web layer the
common layer the service layer and the
data so we got various modules coming in
to our Spring Framework ecosystem so we
got spring i/o platform then we got a
spring boudin we got a spring XE so
that's why the foundation there right so
if you can see now so how from Bev layer
to the common layer to the service layer
to the data layer how we gonna access it
so everything we got it written up we
got from Springdale our spring cloud
right you got a lot of things up so
spring is a kind of a framework which is
basically ecosystem starting from mobile
apps to the web apps you can forget it
anywhere right so that's a pretty good
ecosystem which is available to the
developer so why we should be using
Spring Framework oh that was something
about spring framework so there is
something ducks you'll use it off the
spring framework over the other thing
but so it's a 40-person
as compared to the other frameworks if
you will see that so this is on top of
it right so this is industrially Spring
Framework is used very widely rather
than the other frameworks if you can see
this slab coming up right
so spring teamwork is maximum with 40%
now why so so that is number one
distinct division between Java being
models controllers and views so what I
am trying to say we're here is that
spring is basically an MVC architecture
so Model View and controller so all
these three are the different different
divisions right so we can say it's an
architectural design pattern which is
followed by the spring primer one of the
most popular design pattern right so
it's very flexible and this is very
flexible as it makes the use of
interfaces so here we use interfaces so
that we can write the implementation as
per our requirement so not
like you know restriction coming up over
here the spring MVC web tiers are
typically easier to take we also got
testing modules available in the spring
framework itself so gay unit and all is
available so we can use the testing
framework then well-defined interface
towards the business layers spring
controllers are configured via inversion
of control so guys there is something
known as IO C which is the core of the
spring favored we understand it
practically what exactly this term IOC
is other than that offered better
integration with view technologies other
than JSP so let's say I want to
integrate up you know J speed with the
JDBC I want to use JDBC code in my JSP
right so one way is typically the
developers are going to follow the basic
approach they're going to write all the
sequential steps and they're going to do
it other than that we're going to use a
design pattern for example of the Dow
and the DTO right you're going to use
the design patterns and through which
you will be able to accept the JDBC so
what spring framework will do Spring
Framework is already having the
integration API which follows the
perfect design patterns so that it
becomes scalable robust modularity of
your code qura an has right so all these
kind of integrations we got the 88
available within the spring framework
itself so you need not to worry again on
writing the core code right and you need
not worry even about the design pattern
so it is already based on the design
pattern somehow alright so let's try to
compare spring starts and hibernate even
though I were and deserve entirely
back-end framework where spring and
starts to do different jobs but let's
try to have a differentiation so the
first thing is that spring is an
application framework right it's
lightweight layered architecture and
loose coupling so when we say loose
coupling it means that less dependency
of one module on the other modules right
so just imagine that we are supposed to
you know reserve applied and we
to use a fight reservation system and if
that web service goes down due to any of
the modules failure so there will be a
very big loss to the ailing company so
coupling of one module over the other
module should be as least as possible so
you need to have loose coupling so
Spring Framework by default is designed
in a way that it has its facilitate
loose coupling more or less so there's
nothing like tag libel so it's basically
it's a application paper but it has no
tag library so it's all about interfaces
and the implementation of the interfaces
so very easily you can integrate the ORM
technology so you can integrate
hibernate back if anything you can
integrate with the spring famer very
easily other than that the client-side
technology integration is not that easy
when you talk of Spring Framework right
so so these are some of the key
differences when you have spring versus
of structure or the hibernate now let's
try to see what is the architecture of
the spring chamber so the spring
framework architecture has various
layers now it's a layered architecture
right so the base layer is the testing
layer on top of the testing layer we got
the core container so today we're gonna
discuss on the spring core container
right to understand what are being
what's the core of the spring framework
that's like inversion of control we're
going to focus on that part and we'll
also see what is dependent field action
so the core container over here will AB
being scored context and a string
expression language and on top of code
container we got a opie layer so that's
like aspect-oriented programming so i
aspect-oriented programming is quite
analogous to of the toriente programming
so here what's happening you're
aspect-oriented programming will focus
on how we can implement the
cross-cutting concerns how we can
implement the cross-cutting concerns
over here right so we want to understand
the AOP module in terms of how you can
have a cross-cutting concern which is a
fullface using something known as
aspects right so that's how we got a OT
moving on we got data access or
integration layer so here we gonna deal
with the or M or the
DCR all yours a back-end part right the
bed module will focus on how you can
write a web MVC application so for
example the servlets or the portlets or
the sockets or the web layer right so
that's how we got various news they
believe in the spring architecture all
right guys so what an all are the module
so we going to discuss the core module
over here so the core module or the core
container is having four offs of these
major key concepts the first is core so
that's like the fundamental part of the
spring framework then we got the beam
this is provided with the help of a beam
factory so it's like a container which
is going to generate the beam beam
example it's an object eyesight's it's
an object we got the context it's some
medium to exist any object defined and
configured then we got spring expression
language so spring expression language
is one of the powerful expression
language through which we can do lot of
stuff over here then we got a data axis
so data access deals with the backend
part the data base spot we got JDBC so
we got a JDBC abstraction layer which we
can use then we got our n so for M here
Spring Framework will give us an
integration layer so that you can have
object relational mapping API then OSL
is also there for any abstraction layer
we got lasting service so that we can
consume and produce the methodist then
the transaction management either it's
programmatic or it's declarative right
so it's also facilitated through Spring
Framework data access layer the bed
layer has bed sockets solid babe and
portlet so WebSocket is basically a
support right based on a two-way
communication between the client and the
server so solid is again the core part
of the Enterprise Edition so here it
contains the sprints MVC implementation
for the bail application and the VAP
oriented integration feature is also one
of the key feature over here in the web
part then portlets are nothing but they
are the standalone applications running
on the web application right so it
provides the embassy implementation
and also mirrored the functionality of a
web circuit model we also have some
miscellaneous modules where AOP that's
like aspect-oriented programming which
is fulfilled with the help of aspects
then we got instrumentation support and
how we can have class rotor
implementations then the messaging
support is available and the testing
support is also available if you want to
perform the testing right you can have
unit testing available with F of G unit
library right so right that was a bit of
theoretical introduction to the spring
framework right so what we are going to
do now is the first program in your
spring frame book right so let's see how
we can write the first program in the
spring framework so number one you need
to have an eclipse ID right so you need
to download the Eclipse ID and you need
to install it so once you do it you need
to do it from the eclipse.org
right so you download the Enterprise
Edition of Eclipse go to the help and go
to the Eclipse marketplace so you need
to select the marketplace option and
from there you just search for the
spring and here you will get the spring
ID so the versions might be different
right so whatever the latest one is if
we come automatically for you
so then you're gonna click on this
install button and spring ID within the
Eclipse ID will be plugged in right so
we need to first of all perform this
step so that you can make your Eclipse
to be ready to write any spring
application so for the further steps you
need to confirm and proxy right so once
you click on the install button you need
to finish the installation and then you
say confirm so once the installation is
finished it's all Next and finished
right so just restart that cause even
though it's gonna ask you automatically
but you if it is not so restart the
Eclipse and then you will be ready to
code now in order to code the
application we got five simple steps the
first one is you need to write a beam
class then we need to have an XML file
then there will be one main class that
have the main method right where you
going to write your core logic you need
to load the jar files required for your
spring code framework and finally you do
the run on your product right so that's
the you know sequential approach of
writing our program right so let's try
to focus on how we are going to perform
this operation so let's try to see that
if there is a class known as employee
let's say that there is a class employee
and for this class employee I got an e
ID that's like employee ID and you got
the employee name coming in let's try to
save the address off of the employee
right and we can also have what's the
gender of the employee lot of other
things you can write over here right so
what are these these are nothing but
these are the ethics okay so we got the
attributes coming in over here so that
than that we can have methods of our
choice now traditionally so or you can
see conventionally how you light the
object right so the object construction
so how you want to construct the object
in order to construct the object you
will say employee then the reference to
the employee and you create a new object
or pant leg right so this is how you
going to create the object op employed
so it's a very basic to understand that
traditionally if you want to write an
object of employees very easy in Java
you just write the class name reference
variable then a new object right so do
the call to the constructor somehow what
I can do now I can just say eat at PID
is 101 right then you say ear F dot E
name goes like John Watson then you can
say here F dot and drapes off employ it
goes like let's say redwood shows and
then finally you can have ear F dot
gender which goes like the me now this
is the traditional approach how you
write the object what spring will do so
spring
has a core module right which follows
inversion of control now what is meant
by this term inversion of control let us
try to understand this core concept
spring IOC so what spring IOC says that
you don't create objects right so you
don't create objects now objects shall
be configured
in an XML file so objects shall be
configured in an XML file by the
developer right so there is one module
known as sprint container right so
spring container will be responsible to
construct the Java objects by parsing
XML pipe so you don't create the objects
so objects will be constructed by the
spring container by parsing the XML file
so you need to mention the data which
these attributes will store in an XML
file right so that's what we call
inversion of control so having the
control over the object construction is
given to the spring container right so
what is the benefit of having such an
object the benefit of having such an
object is that your XML files they are
not a part of source code right so you
can configure you can anytime
manipulate the values and your object
will be constructed according me let's
see that how we can do it in our pod
right so my clip is already configured
guys I'm just going to write one new
Java project let's start an X see how we
can do that part so I'm going to write
one new Java project and let's uh name
it like spring code demo and let's say
next and let's do a finish on it and now
what I'm going to do I'm going to create
one bean class right so let's say a new
class so I'm going to write it within a
package known as co dot ed Rekha and let
the name of the class goes like m point
let's finish it off
so here we are now what I'm going to do
I'm going to write the same parameters
di D then you got Elain and let's have
one employee address I took I am gonna
take three of the attributes you can
take n number of attributes over here as
for your choice so we have these many
attributes now I'm going to write down
the method so methods typically are the
Constructors then the Gators and the
setters right so I'm going to write one
employee constructor which is a default
one right so it has nothing over there
then I'm going to write one parasitize
constructor so I'm going to do right
click source generate a constructor
using the fields over here if you can
see right and say okay
so here we are with the constructor
along with the attributes now you can
say a source and a generator of getters
and setters you say select all you say
ok and here we are with an extra set of
methods and finally I'm going to
generate a two step let's say generator
to swing and say ok so here we are with
the tution now such as class over here
if you can see is referred to as a beam
or model or poodle so food is like plain
old Java object right so plain old Java
object so basically here we don't have
anything other than the attributes and
the map third tool right and to read
into glad video so that's like a beam or
a more load of polio so it has no
business logic right so there is no
business logic over here now what I'm
going to do we're going to write one
more class and I'm going to write this
class as a client class with a main
method so here we got a main method
right and this is my client class with
the main method so let's see the object
construction so how we consume the
objects so we want to pay employee irit
is a new employee right so I can say
either F dot set of employ
named as on Watson then you can say EDF
dot set of employee-id
let's say 101 so that even though my
attributes are you know not private but
I am trying to just utilize the the set
of right so if they are private that
makes a more sense of using the setters
over here right so here F dot setup
employ address so let's say it's gonna
be like Redwood shows and now when I'm
going to do is C so on employee details
and then let's try to say EDF like so
when I am going to print EDF it's what's
called the two string method right so
when it's going to call the two string
method so you want to get these details
caveats and like right so let's run the
code let's run it as a java application
so here we can see over the console so
you got this output coming in quite so
employee details so II I it is 101 name
is John Watson and addresses red muchos
so who created the object not so object
construction was done by us right so
this was done by developer now what we
want we want to do it in a spring way so
what spring says right so spring week
we're gonna implement IOC that's like
inversion of control right so you wanna
say we need to use inversion of control
so in order to use inversion of control
over here we shall see how to write the
spring API and how to utilize them the
very first thing is you need to add jar
pipes so let's add jar files to add the
guard files do right-click and then I'm
going to say build path configure the
build path right so here we are with a
library and I need to do add external -
if you can see we've got a spring for
demo reel I did a right-click I went to
something known as build path configure
the build path then you see libraries
our external Josh which I'm going to add
this jar files and Here I am with the
spring cool jar file for here right I'm
going to say open and then I'm going to
say apply and okay so here I am
reference with my spring code framework
for here right so that's like my spring
crow framework now what's next over here
in order to use my spring code framework
I need an XML file so there are five
simple steps right if you can recall so
these are the five simple steps if you
can recall we got a beam class back
light employed
we got a demo class - like the client we
loaded the jar files and now we need an
XML file right so I'm going to copy my
XML file so just give me a moment
so we'll just copy the XML file so I
have this file known as employee being
dot XML file
I'm just gonna do a ctrl C and exactly
within my SRC over here if you can see
I'm going to do a paste of it so I just
copied and pasted one of the XML file
available over here right so nothing you
know very complex which I have done it's
very basic which we have done so far now
let's open this employee in dot XML file
so the very first thing over here if you
can see it's an XML file with a root tag
of DS and beans containing one bead over
here you want to say the ID of the beam
over here is something like EMP and the
class goes like Co dot ed Waker dot
employ right so I am going to give the
reference over here and this is the
class name so there will be some
properties now so the property goes like
e ID e name and E address so these are
the three properties available over here
right if you can see a ID e name and
then e address so these three properties
I have given over here tige limit eh so
for my Eid the value goes like 1 or 2
for the ename it goes like Jenny and my
address I'm gonna write it as let's say
some certain shows let's take some
defeated rest value here now you can
write more beams as of your choice right
so let's say this is M 1 this is M 2 and
here it goes like 1 or 3 let's say Jack
let's say Eastern right so these are you
can say it's a conservation resource for
my objects so I am just putting up the
key value pair over here so key is a
tribute lame and the value is the exact
value with the axe approach let's come
to the climb let's see how we can write
the
spring way how we can do the inversion
of control to do the inversion of
control will write an API known as
resourced so it's like from the spring
framework if you can take that interface
now right so the third one resource
resource is a new class path
resource and here I'm just gonna give
the name of employing dot X in it so if
you can see now so what we have done we
have given the name of this XML file
over here right and thereafter I'm going
to say being factory forgive we got an
interface known as ravine factory over
here so bean factory factory is a new
XML be factory from the research now
this is known as the spring core
container right so being factories
nothing it's what it's a spring
container which she'll read or which
she'll parse XML file and construct the
objects so we chosen construct the
objects now so if you can see so this
was the traditional way how we are
writing objects but this is something
the spring way right so now what I need
to do I need to say employee II one is
factory dot get the beam and you just
mention the reference that's like nth
one so I want to get the reference to
the nth one so I'm just writing this
endpoint and if you get it so you need
to do a typecast over here similarly you
can also try to get the second guy you
can say me2 is unemployed so rather than
saying it in this way I will use one
more syntax so I will see a get be here
elevation the m2 but the type goes here
right so this is one more way of getting
the reference to the object so objects
are constructed by the spring code
container and you are def obtaining the
reference to the object right it so you
do a Cecil and you say employee one
details plus e1 right so it's going to
call to spring for you similarly
employed to details it's gonna go be
deleted
let's run the code right so that is
right here you can see so Spring
Framework came into action so details
are
now coming from the spring course
container object so object was
constructed by the spring core container
you didn't create the object so this was
a traditional approach how we write the
object and this is a swinging approach
how we are getting the reference to the
objects right so the next CH once more
so what I'm going to do am gonna just
write a piece of statement in this I'm
gonna say employee object constructed
right so we know how many objects are
constructed so one is constructed by us
and two are constructed by the spring
container so when you run the code you
find that employ your objects
constructed and to employee of distance
the Phaedo here right so let's try to
comment this code over here so we
commented this code over here and we try
to run the code and now we can see one
difference so you didn't they were
requests to get the beam and the beam
factory didn't create the object for you
so you have configured your XML being
resource file but the objects are
getting constructed when you request for
them right so when you are requesting
for them and now when you run the code
over here you will see that your objects
are done something so object
construction is happening with the
spring framework and whatever the
objects are being constructed to the
spring framework they get constructed
when you request for them right so this
is what we call as in the spring
framework core layer there we got five
simple steps to do it right so these are
the five simple steps so you need to
write one beam class then you must have
an XML file right and in your program
you need to use that spring way of doing
it all right so now we got one more API
you can see over here application
context as a new class path XML
application context right so
try to understand one more spring
container over here the first spring
container is this table being packaged
the next spring container is known as
application context so application
context over here is also one of the
core container in the spring framework
which is used to do the inversion of
control and it's basically an
implementation of the bean package right
so you say a new class path XML
application context and you mention your
employee being dot XML over here so the
way you are saying path 3 dot get of B
right so here what we were doing was we
were doing fat-free dot get of B so
rather than saying fat-free I will say
context so that's one difference right
and now you run the code again you get
the same output right you get the same
output but there is one fundamental
difference over here let's try to
comment out these two guys let's not use
the beam pathway so the output is acid
strain right so either you've been
factory or you use application context
now try to comment out these
instructions and rerun your code right
what you find is that application
context will create the objects for you
even though you don't request but the
bean factory will create the objects
only when you are going to request for
it so string inversion of control says
that you don't create objects objects
will be constructed by the spring course
container so there are two API the first
one is the bean factory second one is
the application context application
context is built on top of beans pattern
so bean factory
constructs the objects when you request
for it by calling the get bin method
whereas application context will
construct the objects even now you don't
request for them
now that's one major difference between
your application context versus the bean
package so guys
I hope you got the key difference
between both the api's so once we are
done right so guys your files need to be
loaded and then you need to run your so
that right
so IOC container it has various features
now so construction of the objects
managing the entire lifecycle of the
objects is not the headache of the
developer now so it is again spring cool
layer so it just like the flow-rate
container you got the spring container
right so the way a public container
manages the lifecycle of a servlet in a
similar way spring container is going to
manage the lifecycle of your object then
wiring them together right so there
might be dependencies which we can link
up and configuration means the key value
pairs which you have already mentioned
right so you just need to configure your
object in the XML file so there are
various features of IOC container now
write the spring IOC container by using
a Java POJO class and the configuration
metadata produces a fully configured and
an executable system or an application
right so what we do we give the metadata
and the photo information to the spring
container right so if you can notice
over here so what we have given we have
given the XML file that's like metadata
and we are mentioning what is the type
right so the information is given to the
spring container and the final result
will be that will be having the objects
which you can use in your application
right so let's see once again so we got
two types of ioc containers one is the
bean factory other one is the
application context bean factory will
construct the object when you request
for them whereas application context
will construct the object even if you
will not request for them right so
that's the major difference other than
that being part three is the simplest
container so that we can provide basic
support for example dependency injection
whereas application context is built on
top of being factory and the container
will add more enterprise specific
functionality right so this is
something which is more relevant to use
rather than the bean package all right
so what is the bean now
so guys bean is nothing it's a Java
object more or less right so there are
no objects which form the backbone of
our application why we need object we
need objects to contain data and these
objects within the Spring Framework are
managed by the spring IOC container
itself right so that's the point of
relaxation for the spring IOC container
will be the one who will be responsible
to instantiate assemble or manage the
lifecycle of your entire beam object the
configuration metadata and the bean is
given to the spring container so that we
can get the constructed bean object
right so that's something which is in
line to your glean object so what is
happening over here
IOC containers gonna take the metadata
right and thereafter it's gonna give us
the D let understand the lifecycle of a
B so what happens the core container
will construct the object and that will
be responsible even to destroy the
object right so we don't describe
objects now so it is tan XI ation then
populating the properties for so for
constructing the object then setting the
data to the object so setting of the
data into the object is done by the
setter method so if you don't have the
setter method in your beam class this
IOC will not be possible so you need to
have setter methods right so once we are
done with that part so all the set of
methods are called
then your applications of you know
processing will happen the API the core
container right so that's going to come
into action so any post processing or
any properties which you need to set you
can do that so you can have your custom
in it and you can have your you know
kind of post processor available in your
B will see that and once the beam is
ready to use right so container is
finally shut down and your beam will be
destroyed so let's try to see one basic
light cycle implementation of this whole
process
so what I'm going to do over here in my
employee I am going to write two methods
right so let's see I want to say public
void my in it so I'm going to say is C
so object initialize and I'm going to
write one more method so this goes like
my destroyed so I'm going to say object
destroyed now in the employee beam over
here I'm just going to comment out this
second eye right so let's try to use
only one guy then when I say init method
that goes like my in it and a destroy
mastered which goes like my destroyed so
you can manage the lifecycle of the beam
right by writing your own innate and
destroy method so here what we have done
we have mentioned that mine it is the
initial method where the object
initialization can be done and
description method is Midas point so you
mention it over here coming to the
clients now
so let's undergo not comment out this
guy as well so call my application
context let's try to run the code and
now what you see is that once the
constructor is called thereafter you are
my init method is getting executed and
then you can use your employee object
other than that what we can do we can
close this application context so that
all the objects can be destroyed so to
do that what I'm going to do I'm just
gonna give it the reference to this guy
class path XML application context right
soon they're gonna see
let's downcast it so I'm gonna downcast
the context over here and there are I'm
gonna see CX T dot close
so I'm just gonna close the context
right so close the context so I'm just
going to say shut down dear
swing core containers so when the
container is gonna shut down its gonna
delete all the objects available right
so let's try to run the code now and now
what we can see is that of the base
destroy so your object destruction
happens when you are explicitly closing
the context so otherwise the object
destruction will totally be dependent on
your spring code container right so
right that's how you got the lifecycle
of your spring core content right so
let's now try to see some more demo on a
beans through a dependency injection
nice right so let's see what is meant by
the term dependency injection so before
we understand the term dependency
injection we need to understand the term
what is meant by coupling right so let's
keep that coupling very possible
consider that I got this class employed
right so we got a class employee over
here now and employee valving 1e ID then
employ had one limb but for the employee
address I'm gonna create another class
right so it's a multi-value thing so
I'll just have you know kind of what's
the city then what's the state what
exactly is the zip code right now this
is where I am going to create a has a
relationship and I'm going to say
employee has an address right so you got
this relationship available over here so
it's basically there we have gotta has a
relationship associated with the
employee and address so employee has an
address now
now how you are going to create the
employee object you will say employee is
a new employee so within the constructor
of this guy employee what I'm going to
do I'm gonna say a ID is 0e name
is again let's say some default value
like not a label and address can go like
a new address so here what we have done
we have done the object construction
right whenever I am doing an object
construction over here
so this is a high dependency dependency
what is happening over here so
construction of
a dread object
relies on construction of employee optic
now that's the scenario so what is
happening over here right so right what
is happening over here then you ride the
object of employee then the object of
address will be constructed it means
that there is a dependency of your
address object this is getting
constructed in the constructor of the
employee object it means that until and
unless you don't create the employee
object you can't confirm the address of
this such a code right such a statement
leads to high company we need to lower
down the coupling possible so we don't
do it in this way so what we do we
rather create one constructor which
takes a reference to the address as
input and thereafter what we can do we
can just assign this guy like this right
or what you can do you can create one
setter and you mention this address over
here and you say address is address so
over here you construct the employee
object and thereafter you can create an
address object separately now you are
constructing the address object
separately right so there is a
difference now and what I can do I can
say e dot set alpha you know this
address as in a or I can just truly
create one another employee object
and within the constructor of this
employee object I can pass this so in
this way your employer object is
constructed separately right and your
address object is constructed separately
so later on you can use them so you have
reduced the dependency and we have
achieved something on as loose coupling
so for such a concept when we have a
dependency so this is the dependency
right that employee has a dependency on
address dependency can be justified
through constructor or through setter
and correspondingly in the spring way
right because in the spring way what we
do we use an XML file right we use
inversion of control so we got something
known as dependency injection either
through constructor or cheddar right so
that's what the topic is so in the topic
dependency injection is basically
focusing on how we can reduce the
coupling and thereafter we can use this
key concept for our Spring Framework so
right it's a design pattern which will
remove the dependency from the
programming code that's going to make
the application easy to manage and a
dependency injection makes our
programming code loosely coupled which
means any change in the implementation
of one will not affect the other right
so that's what we need to achieve so in
the XML file and in the Java file right
so we got two of the things right so you
wanna use XML file to achieve dependency
injection right and you will be giving
it to the Java so it can be done by two
ways either by constructor or by the
setter method for the constructor we
need to use the constructor Arg
and for setter method we just use the
property itself right so guys let's see
how we can do it let's try to create
first of all a different class and link
it all together and let's see how we can
do it so what I'm going to
two more right one more class so here we
are with one more class and this class
goes like a dress
and now let's have three days one is the
city then I'm going to write one speak
and finally I'm going to mention one zip
code right so these are the attributes
for my address right so let's say that
these are the attributes and let's have
the methods so you can have one default
constructor you can have a parametrized
constructor you say so generate a
constructor using the fields so here we
are with a parameterised constructor
let's say suits generate of getters and
setters so these are required when you
are writing a spring IOC code right so
Glau get a set it's not possible right
you must do this part then finally you
generate one two things so that if you
want to display the data to the user now
coming back in my employee so rather
than having this guy address over here
right so I'm just going to take it like
address and address let's try to take it
in this way so what I'm going to do I'm
just going to write the methods again so
let's try to say source generate getters
and setters right and all right so here
we are I don't know why took so spacebot
let me just directed by the code guys
right so here we are with the
trendsetters and one thing which I'm
going to do is I'm just going to write
one employee constructed with the
address as an input
right so let's say this off address
assigned will address right we got the
same name so are you going to use it in
the same so this is like constructor
injection right and here you can see we
got a setter injection so how this
injection can be given right that we
need to figure out so we got employee
having an address right and address is a
separate class so come to your employee
bean so the very first thing which I'm
going to do over here is I'm going to
write my beam that's like address so
Godot Erica dot address right so you're
going to create one address so we got
City then state and finally you got a
zip code so let's say city goes like
bangaluru
then state goes like Karnataka and then
zip code goes like pipe to some zeros
and one right so let's let's say that
gives an address right so we have mapped
the address as in city state and zip
codes over here you got city state on is
it good now over here in my employee
right so what I'm going to do now I'm
going to use this guy Donetsk instructor
arc and I'm going to say refer ad RS so
whatever this address object is
available right area right so I'm going
to give the reference a DRS ol here and
in my employee the constructor injection
will take this right and let's come to
the client and now let's try to get this
guy m1 and let's try to say print of e1
so then I'm going to do even printing so
in my e1 so here if you can see let's
create one two Springs you do not have a
to sing over here so let me generate one
to say so this 2 string is gonna print
the address right right caught up in the
address the address to string will be
executed over here let's come back and
let's run the code so just give me a
moment I
some basic synthetical mistake yeah so
here we are right we just need to close
this let's run the code once again here
we on tax right
so object initialize and if you can see
now you got the employee one details
here we are the details with the
employee and here we are with the
details of the address object so this is
has a dependency injection through the
constructor so if you don't want to use
constructor injection what we can do we
can also give it as in so set-apart goes
like this
now this dependency injection is
happening on the sector part right when
you use the property it's gone I use the
set address method that makes setter
injection right output will be same
anyways but the concept of utilizing the
thing right it's changed now so output
is same so there are two major ways to
fulfill your dependency parts right
either you can achieve it through
constructor or you can achieve it
through setter so guys a demo is done
right so that's gonna be all from our
side and we hope that you have enjoyed
