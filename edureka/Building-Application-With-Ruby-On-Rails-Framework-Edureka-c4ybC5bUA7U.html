intro about me I've been I've been into
IT and you know programming in general
for about 16 years now I started in 1999
as a web developer and I have worked
with many different languages and
platforms including ASP PHP Java JSP
vb.net and before you know before I
started with Ruby on Rails so about five
six years back I started developing
using Ruby on Rails professionally or
you can say full-time basis right and so
today we are here to learn about Ruby on
Rails framework so I will be assuming
like like since this is a short session
right so typically I get I typically get
a bit of an intro about participants as
to what the experience level is or what
what you have done already but you know
for today's session I would assume a you
know a little bit about self development
already and you have some you know some
some programming experience or knowledge
alright so by the end of this today's
session you'll be able to you know
what's what's Ruby on Rails whatever you
know main features of Ruby on Rails
what is MVC framework and how to build a
very simple Ruby on Rails to their
application all right okay so let's
start with why we should learn Ruby or
Ruby on Rails and you know even before
starting with the a demon let's let's do
further or you know that's dissect the
name Ruby on Rails so Ruby on Rails
means two things Ruby which is the
programming language and Rails which is
the you know birth framework so when we
say Ruby on Rails we talked about two
different things
right so when we say Ruby Ruby is a
programming language developed by
Yukihiro Matsumoto also known as Matt's
who is a Japanese programmer right about
20 years back it was a programming which
was developed for making the programmers
happy right so you know when max started
doing programming the programming
language is that of that time you know C
C++ and all and similar languages he
kind of felt okay you know coding in in
general is not this what make the
programmer happy you look at your code
and you say oh but I'm missing something
there I'm missing something
there you know and I when you read your
own code you don't feel good about like
you say it's code is my own code is not
readable right so you write write some
code today and you you see the code one
month down the line you say oh my own
code is not readable so Matz Matz
mission was to create a language which
is readable and internal which makes the
programmers happy right so um so twenty
years down the line now we may live on
Ruby
certainly is very easy to learn right
and easy to write code in and the code
that we write comes up really you know
nice-looking readable and you know so it
so in a sense it says your time right so
if you can read the code well right you
you kind of you know it saves your time
right and it's it allows you to develop
code easily right it's free of course
all the open source most of the open
source stuff is anywhere free it's open
source so it can be customized it's
portable which means like it can be so
you can develop using Ruby on Lex and
Mac Windows Linux and even on some
mobile platforms and I guess the
important like fact is that learning
rupee you know gets your job easily or
you know me you can say you can grow in
your career
I again come back to that point when I
will speak about rails so just hold on
that point and you can make your own
tiny little domain-specific languages
right and the community you know the
main reason why my rupee is growing so
much is the community
so if men ever you have any questions
you search on Google you get the answers
immediately
plus there are a lot of you know the
community creates lots of gems or
profanities that you can use you know
easily so that that's how your you you
get to do your project quickly right
okay so as I was saying
twenty years back it was developed by UK
ro Matsumoto also known as Matz
ruby is influenced by many you know
great languages or old languages like
Perl small talk that will add a lisp and
some other Ruby is an object and
language it is interpreted so it's not
compiled right like it's not like Java
or C++ where you first need to compile
your code it's basically a an
interpreted language right it draws a
lot from the syntax from the small talk
which is basically was the original
object-oriented programming language
Perl which is basically a scripting
language and list which is a functional
language so ruby has all the features of
an object-oriented language a functional
language and a scripting language right
and you know during this class or this
this training session as we go on we'll
see saw those features right so in Ruby
everything is an object so when we say
you know an object-oriented language
right
so take the
Java Java is an object-oriented language
but even in Java there are primitive
objects there are things which are not
objects by example you can have ain't
can have care in Java but in Ruby
everything is literally everything is an
object you so anything any number
true/false nil right there's there's
nothing which is there's no value in
Ruby which is not an object so every
value that you'll see in Ruby is an
object okay the syntax of Ruby is very
English like which makes it you know
more readable as you can see and you
know the syntax is terse or you know
compact so which makes you write less
code so in my own personal experience
having used you know multiple languages
from ng from ASP to Java JSP and PHP you
know writing you know typically you know
in in if you writing some code in Ruby
and for a similar program that you've
written in Java or some other language
it would typically be one third so a
program written in Java if you write in
Ruby it will be one third of the number
of lines so less number of lines means
less less works probably right or maybe
less less less coding anyway right so it
saves you time and bugs right okay now
coming to Ruby on Rails so so far we
have been looking at Ruby which is a
programming language or a scripting
language so Ruby on Rails is the easy
framework or the web framework which is
used to develop websites other
applications right it uses you know a
framework a pattern which is called MVC
or Model View controller right it's an
open source framework again
just like ruby it's also an open-source
framework and it's free it's really
available to use Ruby on Rails is you
know popular for its simplicity in terms
of views right productivity it's a rapid
development framework you can do things
very fast as you will see shortly as I
will show you a short demo of developing
a very simple thing right right from the
configuration part like for example when
I used to do development in Java or PHP
early on you have to set up lot of
things like you'll be setting up lamp
write or talk or Tomcat we'll be
considering a lot of stuff and you know
that used to take you know close to a
day for setup setting things up and
sometimes more than that right in the
early days of development right but with
rails as you will see things are very
simple because all the things are
packaged with the rails thing so when we
will create a new rails application all
the things will be there with you the
server the database the configuration so
you don't need to do anything if you
want to use the default settings all
right
so speed of development is certainly one
of the you know key areas with rails and
the development that you do that we will
be doing using rails it's very reliable
right the rails include lot of state of
art features you know related to
security for example like to caching all
right and other things that we'll be
seeing later on on the sessions and
which makes your you know coding really
easy so your job becomes easy you don't
have to worry about security you don't
have to worry about caching stuff I
don't have to worry about a lot of stuff
which normal web developers in other
languages have to think about so all
those decisions are taken for us by
rails
so it's an opinionated so a piece of
software
but it's very popular and it's very much
in demand so coming back to the point of
you know jobs so right now so the job
market with rails with respect to rails
is very high right the demand is too
much and the availability of resources
less and that is one of the reasons that
it is one of the highly sought soft
after sought after skill in the market
right so it is like the demand of rails
at the movement is more than Java in a
sense right because you know the number
of resources are less so you know
learning both Ruby and rails will take
you to a path where you can get a job
easily all right okay so reason behind
the name as we discussed earlier ruby is
the programming language and rails is
the framework so combining both the
things is you get Ruby on Rails right
okay so you will be using Ruby 2 point 1
point X version in this course right so
current version is Ruby 2 point 2 there
is not much change between these two
versions so if you're using any of the
version like any either 2.1 or 2.0 that
should work all right you have already
seen some of the advantages so I will
just move on okay so what are they you
know like whenever you think about you
know switching the application or
framework or you know programming
language or where you are studying your
carrier with a new language you say
always ask okay who else are using them
so Ruby on Rails is used by github which
is you know the biggest code repository
at the moment online repository some
other you know applications that are
written in Ruby on Rails are is Twitter
yellow pages Shopify is a you know kind
of a solution using which you can create
your own shopping cart this SlideShare
then there is Groupon buy that lots of
them in fact the right now the market in
the market most of the startups prefer
to use Ruby on Rails right since it's a
rapid development framework you get to
develop things very quickly so for
example the earliest versions of Twitter
would develop within weeks right they
were able to change things very quickly
and they were able to come to the market
quickly right they can you can get to
the your end user quickly and that
really helps startup but not just
startups even big companies are using
Ruby on Rails I've been associated with
them you know so the companies like
Deloitte our systems Nokia you know even
Adobe they all are using Ruby on Rails
in certain capacity alright moving
forward so basic feature or basic
premise of Ruby on Rails is convention
over configuration so when we were used
to when we used to develop in Java or
you know earlier languages we used to
have to do lot of configuration okay
what is the name of the database which
folder the cachet will be which folder
the database will be or you know if you
are using firebase database which fold
where our model will be where our view
will be so you have to know set all
those things but in rails we don't have
to you just say okay just say this is my
application name and everything else is
taken care of for you but if you want to
change some of those things you can of
course but you don't have to right so
that's the basic principle or basic
golden rule you can say of rails which
is making it so popular another you know
guiding principle is dry don't repeat
yourself so every piece of information
should be
at a single place right so if it is a
business rule it should be in in a model
right so when you are developing an
application using Ruby on Rails always
keep this principle in mind that you
keep one single information at a single
place you don't you don't replicate that
information multiple places or else you
will have you know will be breaking this
principle actually and that will create
headaches for you later in the project
alright so any any questions till this
point before I you know start with a
demo where I will be creating a small
application ok cool beep you are saying
convention over can using COC once again
okay so can
aggression is a you know basic guiding
principle of Ruby on Rails so when like
if you have developed in any other you
know web framework or language before
you typically have to you know configure
you know certain set of things you have
to say for example what is the name of
the database that's a basic thing you'll
say to tell okay where my models will be
where my views will be you have to set
all those names and you know it goes on
till you know very basic things like
okay if my controller name is let's say
welcome what would be the name of my
view folder okay so even my new things
like these you have to configure or tell
in some ways in other frameworks where
is in rails all these things are taken
care of so there are sensible defaults
so you don't have to tell what's the
name of the model directory you don't
have to say what is the name of database
all that is taken care of for you right
so as you will see so again we will see
this a movement and then we'll get a new
rails application you don't have to
specify anything other than the name of
the application once you give it the
name of the application all other
settings are all the other configuration
will be you know based on some sensible
defaults as your experience with rails
grows like let's say you have got you
know three three four months five months
of experience working with rails you
slowly and slowly learn how to change
some of those defaults right you don't
have to but sometimes you know you might
have to change let's say name of
database okay that's easy it's not
difficult but you don't have to do it at
the start of the things right
any other questions is it clear cool
deep so I will coming back to all this
stuff in a moment let's say let's see
how to you know how to create an
application in rails again so typically
in a in a you know bigger session in a
full session I would be you know first
making sure that you all installed Ruby
on Rails and you have got all the
editors that we need but for this
session for this session I'll just go on
and you know assuming that we'll be
doing with that later stuff right so
I'll just start with you know the step
the first step or you know I say once
you have installed everything you'll be
starting how do I create a new rails
application right so that's easy so I'll
go to
my terminal window right come on prompt
and I'll see rails new and the name of
the application so whatever is the name
of a picket line let's say I want to
create a shopping that I'll say okay
really seen your shop or something like
that
for now let's say rails new app right or
let's call it shop I'm just providing
the name of the application nothing else
okay
this present and it will develop or
create all the different structure or
folders for me right
as you see lot of them and we'll be
looking at some of them today right of
course the full session will be looking
at everything alright
once that the process is done we go and
we say CD to the name of our folder ok
so again just to recap so step one rails
step1 rails new okay so this is rails is
the command new it means like new
application and the shop or whatever it
could be show up it could be app it
would be rad could be website it could
be Twitter whatever you want to develop
write the name of the application that
you're doing and then you say change
directory to its gene directly to that
folder right so I'm using Mac basically
but most of us these steps will work
exactly similar in Windows and Linux
right now hmm
here I'll just start the server I will
say rails server which will start the
Webley server which is the default
server that comes with Ruby on Rails
automatically alright and looking at the
message correctly it says okay that the
development you can start the
development here then just copy it so I
just wrote down here fails so in this
step or is open in a browser and I see
this
welcome aboard message so whenever we
are developing in rails and if we see
this message that that means our with
the installation and everything has
worked perfectly okay
you
all right going forward I'll open the
theater where you know I can see all my
files so typically you can use any
editor but Ritter which comes with some
sort of a you know sidebar or a drawer
kind of thing where you can see all the
folders and files on the left side or
right side somewhere it's helpful right
I I use Ruby mine but you can use any
any of the freely available editors like
sublime text and others which we'll be
discussing later today let's see how
development is alright I'll go to my
folder and see my folder here right so
open it up so any editor which comes
with some this sort of a tree structure
is going to be very helpful all right I
will ignore all these things for now
okay so this is my application structure
right all the different files that are
created by that simple command okay and
again so it has got an app folder which
basically stores all the code that you
are going to write including JavaScript
you know all the assets all the images
all the rails code or the
model-view-controller or helpers that we
are going to write everything is going
to be stored inside this F folder so
this is the most important folder then
there is a bin folder which basically
where you want to anything this
basically stores all the binary you know
your binary commands like rails bundle
break you know you will be using these
things but we won't be you know kind of
making new ones here at least not in the
start right then there is a config
folder which stores all the inner
configuration for you so all the
configuration is already done by done
for you but let's say you want to change
something
so it's here inside this folder country
folder even right then we have got the
DB folder which stores our database we
are using SQLite 3 right so it stores a
file based database here and you know
some other things that will you know
look at shortly then we've got a live
folder which is basically empty tears
but nothing actually where you can keep
your own code which is not rail selected
right which is library you know let's
say you want which is not related to
your domain you're doing some coding
which is more general generally you can
keep it here then we've got a log which
is a very important folder here you can
see your develop and log so whenever you
want to debug something you want to have
a look at okay what happened with you
know some of the things that that I
taped or you know what if what was the
SQL that was generated or something that
you can see look at it here and we have
got some other folders like public
folder where you can keep things like
you know 4:04 pages or anything any
static thing that you want to display
then we have got a test folder so we
will not be talking about much about
tests today but you know Ruby on Rails
comes with a full full /it test-driven
development framework right this is
called mini test and an alternative
which is called r-spec
which can be used with Ruby on Rails
fight from the go right from the start
so but it's a you know it's kind of a
you know different it's kind of
difficult for an beginner to learn two
things at at one time so typical
approach is to first learn Ruby and
rails and then you know learn test you
in development okay then we have got a
TMP folder where some of the caches and
you know the IDS are created stuff like
that session sockets again we won't be
using this much
is a vendor folder where anything that
you are using the third party stuff you
can keep it there so but for today we'll
be focusing on you know you know a
subset of things we can't be learning
everything today in you know in a
one-hour session right so we'll be
looking at a subset of things so the
subset will mostly rely like well it
will be on this app folder and this
config folder so the first thing that
would like to configure is you know you
want to show something better on this
homepage so right now it just says
welcome aboard okay which is some you
know magically created page by Rails
you don't want this what it means this
okay
so coming back to the MVC thing a bit
okay I'll just open a slide for it okay
all right so rails uses MVC framework
where you where you keep all the date
all the data or all the business logic
on the model side of things right and
all the display related thing now your
templates your HTML in the views and the
controller you know is the basic you
know maintain which maintains which view
to show go and know where where the data
comes from so it's it's kind of a
controller okay it's a it's a controller
which controls a views on the way on one
hand and you know gets the data from the
model
whenever the view needs all right so
this is how it looks like so our request
comes from the user so users browser
user type something in the browser is it
let's say www dot you know website name
calm let's say tutor.com or like Groupon
dot-com or whatever and that request
initially comes to the web server and
let's overpasses is to the you know
dispatcher and to a dispatcher that
request comes to the rails outer which
basically Maps the
request so whatever request comes the
rails router will map that request to a
file which is called routes dot RB right
and that file contains all the routes or
you can say all the possible
you know pages on the website in a
layman term right so let's say for
example in our case so if you look at
our case we are saying localhost 3000 so
this initial thing like localhost few
thousand you can you know replace it
with like twitter.com or something like
that
so that's the name of the website and
what we are actually requesting for is
the route route of the root page of the
homepage right so somehow somewhere we
have to define that homepage what is
going to be there all right so let's see
in our config folder there is a file
called routes total RV and in this file
we define all the routes or all the
paths or all the pages you can say in a
layman term that are going to be
possible in our website so if you look
at this file you know in detail you'll
see that there is a already route route
design but it is commented so all these
hash things in that you see here they're
comments
you
right so so the basic minimum what do
what we can do is we can just uncomment
this thing
okay so I've uncommented this route
route and I will just go and see in my
browser four times I'll just refresh and
it tells me okay I don't have a
controller by the name welcome
controller okay
let's experiment a bit more let's see I
want to change this to home
okay and now I refreshed now it's still
okay and I'm the initialized constant
home controller all right so this this
tells me that I need to create a
controller right but whatever the name
that is here okay
so in my app folder there's a
controllers folder I'll go and create a
file and is the convention so the
convention is the name of the file will
be name of the controller underscore
controller dot RB so this is convention
if you follow the convention everything
will be fine
okay I'll go inside this file and I will
create a Ruby class okay I know I
haven't taught you or told you how to
create a Reuben class as of now but it's
very simple actually so that the way to
create a class is 6 class the name of
the class which is home controller in
all cab like in in camel case just like
in Java and and it extends so all the
controllers that we are going to create
they're going to extend or you know they
are going to subclass the application
controller so we will say application
controller and we have an ant at the end
so if you come
this is Java thing you know so in Java
you take class home controller something
in this and you know you'll have a brace
yeah but this is how it will look like
in Java some sort but in Ruby we are
going to use class keyword and to end
the you know thing there's the end all
right now we have created a controller
you create a little pumpkin I'll just go
ahead and refresh my page again now it
says action index could not be found
okay let's again compare this thing with
mail-outs file so my route file says
home index so home was the controller so
that means index would be the action
right this is action index so in rails
any method that we create any public
method that we create in the controller
is known as an action so the way to
create a method in Ruby is will should
def and the name of the method and
that's it they're done so we have
created a method or an action in our
controller again I will refresh and now
it says template is missing so template
is overview okay and it is looking for
something called as home slash index
which means it is looking for a folder
named home and inside that a template
named in index right so what we'll do is
we'll go into our views let's say new
directory home right
you
you
and inside that home folder will have a
template okay and
the template will be index okay not HTML
dot we are we so all the view templates
in rails have an extension dot HTML dot
you'll be ok and ok and now I will
refresh and we get a blank screen
nothing to worry in fact if we if I
write something here anything and a
fresh lose reflected now we can create a
simple no application which basically is
able to reflect whatever I stream of you
putting in here ok and just say let's
say h1 okay this is home page right
so refresh members alright so this is a
basic very bare minimum web application
where you can at least now display HTML
but not just that you can also put some
Ruby inside here so er be and you say er
be it's an embedded Ruby so it allows
both HTML and Ruby it's similar to in a
JSP or PHP innocence ok so let's say for
example let's say I want to display
something you know repeatedly and here I
will will see how elegant Ruby is right
say ten dot times
okay and I want to let's say print
something in bold I'd say hello I'd say
I'd like to put a breakout in here so
again the language or the syntax is very
much English like so anyone can
understand okay this is going to do this
thing ten times right so any questions
you have for me let me know
so again I just note on the steps for
you that mean whatever we did just to
recap so edit config slash routes but RB
by to uncomment the route route and then
create home controller I'll just say
home controller and we created a action
to create action index then we did
create folder home or say
the inside have refused home you'll have
index not steal your be okay and then
add whatever you want like so add
content to the page so this is what we
did so far so we created a new rails
application from scratch we started the
server okay so as you've noticed we
changed things right but we never need
to restart the server okay that's one of
the I know basic features of rails
development where I don't have to change
or you know you don't have to restart
the server for basic changes that you
are doing okay so again any questions
you know if you have any questions any
sort of question so this is so let's go
back to the slides a bit so this is what
we have looked at the flow mostly this
side of things
we went looked at the model right okay
so user makes a request controller the
request is forward to the controller and
controller decides what view to display
okay again in the slides you have the
same steps that we have gone through
mostly right and our this
scription of some of the folders that
you looked at and how to run the server
so this is another way of creating the
controller so we did it by hand right so
we created the file and then put the
code there but you can also do it using
a helper or a command line functionality
provided by rails when you just say
please generate controller home and it
will create a controller home controller
empty home control controller for you or
you can say okay
tails generate controller home index and
it will create the home controller the
index dot HTML data ARB file right and
then you know the home folder everything
that we did manually
all right so so let me know if have any
questions so that this is the demo part
I guess and that's it that's it from my
end in terms of the content of the
today's training but so if you have any
questions let me know now No
okay I think okay I guard something
transform okay on which web server will
be Epsilon
so again when we are talking about Ruby
on Rails so it's a ruby is the
programming language which is a
scripting language just like Perl right
and you won't be developing a web
application solely on Ruby right so
rails is a framework and there are other
frameworks also like Sinatra is a per
frame work which is again based on Ruby
and there is also Padrino so all so we
will be using some sort of a framework
in rupee to develop an application Ruby
on Rails which is the topic for today
comes with a web server which is called
fabric for development so in your
development environment you are mostly
going to use the brick right there is
also another server alternative server
that some people use which is called
thin okay
and on a production server on the other
hand typical combination which is used
is either Apache Plus passenger or nginx
plus unicorn so people usually use nginx
+ unicorn that is the most popular
combination of the web server +
observable nowadays in Ruby world some
people also use Apache and passenger
Santhosh Babu
I didn't get your question so if you can
say tell me what you want to ask clearly
so as shown er let me know if that
answers your question
actually anyone having any other
questions do let me know anything
related to Ruby on Rails why should we
learn it people usually ask me and like
what's the job market like and will I
get a job or will there is there a is
there a carry option in this right and
some people have any questions like web
servers and how to do something in Ruby
on Rails so if any any such questions
please do let me know ok again I guess
this window is a bit okay yeah but
tricky okay
can Ruby be programmed in Windows OS
also yes a lot of people you know in
fact a lot of trainings that I do I
especially the corporate trainings in
India those companies use Windows
primarily and so a lot of development in
Ruby on Rails is done on Windows ok and
again like I guess we'll be sharing you
with you or you know the instruction
steps or you know it's very easy in fact
installing Ruby on Rails and Windows is
very easy you can just go online and say
you know Ruby instru be on Rails
installer dot-com then just search
trails installer on Google and you will
get a exe file you install it and you're
done you know installing a Mac on Linux
is a bit more involved then you know
that
all right Abhijeet okay okay so that's
that was the region
okay Butte says is there an
all-encompassing package okay that's
what I said so you can download and
install rails installer and you'll be
done in five five minutes so the only
the only problem with rails installer is
that I've seen is it so typically you
know a little behind the latest version
okay so sometimes you will feel that
okay this it's I'm I'm developing on a
little older version when you're using
rails installer right so the other ways
if you want to have the latest versions
of rails and Ruby you typically will
have to install a Ruby Ruby using Ruby
installer and then rails using very easy
step which is like gem install rails
which again we'll be taking up in the
future sessions right okay again so I
see most of the
are related to installation right so it
says a cultivation we have to install
Ruby and it separately install so okay
hmm
so just to give you a quick idea just a
quick step you can go to is a radius
installer just want to do it quickly you
can just search the Rays installer
you
and there is a racist order to RG you
can download a complete package
so they have windows so as you can see
they have got Ruby 2 point 1 point 5 and
rails 0.1 so for our session it works
perfectly okay but typically since the
latest version of Ruby is like two point
two point two at the moment
Andreas is four point two who typically
would like have more control on that
okay so if you want you can install will
be separately and then rails separately
that will give you more flexibility
again we'll see those steps later on
make the full session can we use
external databases like MySQL Oracle
that that is asked by a finish yes in
fact you know using MySQL is just like
I'll just give you a quick hint so when
we have so last time when we created the
application we said rails new shop if we
want to create a new application using
MySQL for example we will say a rails
new and say app - db4 did that means my
secure or Postgres cure or all the
supported ones so if you are on Windows
you can also say MSS here right again if
you want you can just say rails and it
will give you all the options that are
possible so the options that are
possible is MySQL Oracle PostgreSQL
sqlite3 front base IBM DB SQL Server
JDBC my square theory with sqlite3
getting busy Bosko SQL and JDBC so you
can use any of these any of these
drivers ok
Venus is asking does our support
cross-platform app building like angular
again like angular is something
different you know angular is more of a
front-end technology okay
and Ruby on Rails is a server-side
technology I am working on a project
currently which is a you know financial
application it uses both angular for
front-end and rails for the backend okay
as far as you know supporting 12
cross-platform so again let's say the
point is rails is a server-side thing it
which generates HTML right all the web
web related or all the server-side
technologies including PHP JSP they
basically generate HTML which the
browser can understand okay
so it's as cross-platform as any other
web framework but if you are talking
about you know cross-platform in terms
of what all servers are supported so it
is supported on all servers Windows
Linux Mac or any any servers out there
that are popular yes so
this course will teach you about Ruby
and rails port so we'll be touching
about all the stuff that is necessary to
learn Rails so all the Ruby syntax the
operators how do you write different
different kinds of loops and other
control structures right
blocks profs etc whatever is necessary
to learn rails and also the rails stuff
we will also be touching upon what is an
object what is a class you know how do
how do we create objects how do we
subclass things and all that stuff okay
Dinesh is asking again I guess I
answered already answered this question
but how can we use external databases
okay how much time it will take to
become an expert in Ruby that's our look
is asking that so at a minimum at a
minimum if you you know dedicate your
full time let's say four to five hours
every day you can you know start
developing an application in two to
three months right you know in if you
are if you don't know any other language
right assuming that you don't know much
about web development but on the other
hand if you are already experienced
developer you can become productive in a
no in less than one month also okay and
as far as becoming an expert you know to
become expert in any language it takes
years right especially if it is a if
your first language so to master your
first programming language it typically
takes four to five years but you know
don't you don't have to be an expert to
get a job it's the best thing right so
the day you start developing your
webpage right you know a database backed
thing a kind of you know admin panel
that you all you know go through in the
course right so once you can show that
to you know employer
okay see this is what I can create right
this is a job site that I've created
this is a you know a shopping cart that
I've created
as soon as you are you are able to show
that to an employer you can get a job
and now on the job you can get more and
more exposure and you can become become
an expert so become an expert it it's a
long-term journey long it takes years
not-not-not weeks or not move months so
Ruby on Rails is not related to Android
or iOS app development you know directly
but most of the you know you know many
of the Android and iOS apps our database
based or they they basically display you
know different data elements from let's
say you have a app for Yellow Pages so
it will be displaying data actually
right which is already in the database
rails becomes on Rails comes as very
handy for those projects because you
know the API or the web service part is
written in rails which is very quick now
you can you can very quickly write a web
service or or API in rails and then you
can use that API or web service from
your Android or I yourself so so answer
to your question is it's not directly
related to Android iOS app development
but if your application requires data
which comes to a web service or API and
yes you can develop that portion right
that web service or API portion using
rails
so if you're talking about
hybrid application or you know sort of
that so there are ruby based frameworks
right which allow you to develop Android
or iOS app this course does not you know
does not cover that all that stuff like
this is more of a web development
application course but that Ruby that
you learn in this course
it certainly help you in learning any of
those frameworks which you know allow
you to develop our iOS or iPhone
application iOS or Android application
using a hybrid framework so Abbott is
asking me that asking that can you tell
me about the job chances in our o'er
compared to Java so like I've been in
industry for 16 years I have vault in
Java PHP and other technologies before
you know moving to Ruby on Rails and I
can tell you straight away that you know
anyone anyone who is got ROI return on
his resume a will get a call immediately
right it's it's it's been an experience
so you just write are war in your resume
and you will get a call from some in
some employer and then you will know
what I'm talking about
okay just by writing our Oro Ruby on
Rails on your resume it will get a call
immediately from the employer so on the
other hand like on the talking from the
employer point point of view so I I do a
lot of recruitment also and when I
search for a Java resuming on a portal
like monster or nakri or something like
that
I get thousands of resumes like right if
I post today post a job for Java
developer I will get thousands of
resumes right if I post a job for RoR I
will get 1015 resumes so the demand and
supply of
the demand for Java is not more than
Ruby Ruby on Rails there is no doubt
Java is an old technology I notice
enterprise development happens in Java
but having said that the supply of Java
developers is more than the demand of
Java lovers whereas in the case of Ruby
on Rails the demand is more much more in
fact than the know the possible
candidates that are available in the
market so you see very high salaries you
see a lot of demand as you once once you
have you know covered your first six
months there were a lot of that there
will be a lot of job offers nice offers
coming your way of course you have to
keep focusing on your carrier and you
know keep developing as soon if you are
a good developer you know above average
you can work on problems you can have
certain communication skills you will
have no problems at all in finding a job
and in finding a good job I've seen
people who work in Java and remain a you
know entry-level or you know you can say
big nerd label programmer forum you know
for much more longer like four or five
years
whereas in Ruby on Rails you you move
fast you know you say six months is like
two years in Java in terms of salary
also similarly you know you once you are
two years old in experience you are just
like a five year old Java developer
because you know you have to understand
roof rails started or you know become
popular in 2007 around so it's only been
you know eight years you can't find
someone with you know 12 years of
experience in Ruby on Rails
that's not possible so what is possible
so if there is a job
for an experienced women developer to be
four five years ago five-year-old Ruby
on Rails develop right so where is in
Java you'll get guys who are having 15
years of experience so that's the
comparative market okay again lot of
people again asking that Android
application development so I guess I
answered that question I will our Ruby
is best at web app development tools and
Java C when when it comes to you know
comparing two languages so I would say I
won't say you know what is better or
best you know it's all relative terms if
you already know Java for many years
probably Java would be better for you
isn't it you know Java very well but
having said that Ruby the code written
in Ruby is much more readable right much
more maintainable that's one thing you
don't have to do any configuration stuff
that you need to do in Java right
and again if you include both both
distant together your development cycle
becomes shorter you are able to deploy
very quickly to the production and all
that makes you a happy programmer and
you makes your client a happy client or
your boss a happy clappy boss
so that how that's how it helps you in
developing
so I
if you're an experienced developer so
you certainly will learn Ruby on Rails
quickly than other people who don't have
any experience right
yes Dinesh there are a lot of fresher
jobs available so there are a lot of
startups which take up Ruby on Rails and
you can pretty much land on any of those
jobs again the key is to put your you
know two months time let's say
unlearning Ruby on Rails and then you
know get into the job market you know
you'll get a job so any other questions
I guess that was the last question by
Dinesh
if you feel that you know you need to
know more than what I have told you just
let me know so if you have no other
questions we can wrap up the session
right anything else guys let me know
okay um men will
of our own as you know I guess you can
get in touch with at Eureka
you know instructor like you know like
administrators I guess I'm you must be
in touch with someone from at Eureka and
they'll be telling you about the
schedule and everything so if you're
already registered for the course you
might have already received the email
with all the schedule and everything
right if not so I can probably request
people that I did record - you know mail
you with everything so I get that's the
question by Culdee all right so um I I
think that's all for today right and if
you have any questions before we part
just let me know all right
so it was nice meeting you all right and
I hope you enjoyed today's session and I
hope that I was able to increase your
curiosity about this framework called
Ruby on Rails and if you if you do join
the full session you will go through we
will go through the complete full Ruby
on Rails stuff and we'll be developing
full stack applications on that right so
I hope to see you soon bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
