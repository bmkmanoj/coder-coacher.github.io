AWS from ad rekha today's session is
going to be on order scaling and load
balancer so today I'm going to tell you
how you can order scale your resources
so that they become highly available and
this is what we are going to do today so
for those of you who are new to this
session guys I want to repeat again if
you have any doubts during the session
please comment it in the comment box my
team is here to help you out right they
will clear all your doubts all right so
with that guys let's start with today's
session with the agenda for today so
guys this is what we are going to do
today first we are going to see what our
snapshots and AM is so these are
basically the entities using this using
ratio will be or scaling your resources
so when once you know what a snapshots
in am eyes will move on to why do we
actually need auto scaling and what is
auto scaling exactly after that we are
going to see what is a load balancer and
towards the end we'll be doing a
hands-on which is going to be very
interesting because I don't think
there's a demo out there which can show
you the kind of demo that I'm going to
show you today all right and if you
think about it guys if you if you're
thinking about moving to the cloud
industry or the scaling ad load
balancing our the very important topics
in this in this in this domain right so
you should know about them so if you
have been so if you don't know about
them please pay attention today because
you're going and going to go and key in
a lot of knowledge today all right
moving on guys let's start with the
first topic which is snapshots and EMS
so let's let us see what are those so I
guess most of you are aware of what any
zero instances of all those those of you
who are not an ec2 instance is just like
our also it's a fresh piece of computer
that you have just bought it's just like
that alright so on that computer you can
choose any operating system that you
want so once you have the operating
system you can install any kind of
software on it alright so you have to
install every time you launch a new in
say an ec2 instance you have to install
all the required software's on it
alright but there's a workaround what if
you want a specific configuration of ec2
instance a-15 is it a servers which
exactly like like each other right so
one way of doing that would be to launch
a new instance every time install the
required packages every time and going
about it right the other way of doing it
would be to actually create an image of
once you will be configuring your ec2
instance and after that you'll be
creating an image of your ec2 instance
and then using that image you can
actually deploy for more easy to do
servers all right
so this image is basically what is an
ami am so ami which is an amazon machine
image is nothing but an executable image
of your already existing ec2 instance
right but before an ami can be created
there's a thing called snapshot now what
are snapshots snapshots are nothing but
the copy of the data the data the copy
of the data that you have on your
harddrive so basically if you have your
C Drive right and you want to copy your
C Drive you copy your C Drive onto some
external drive so that becomes a
snapshot but if you can boot from that
external drive so that as to your whole
operating system comes up on some other
machine then it becomes an ami so this
is basically the difference between the
two a snapshot is not a bootable copy
and ami is a bootable copy that you have
right so I hope you got the difference
between what is an ami and what is a
snapshot so I'll repeat it again and you
use an ami to basically replicate and
easy to wins easy to instance again so
that you don't have to do the
configurations all over again all right
so now you'll be wondering we were we
were to talk about what what is auto
scaling what is load balancing why do we
need EMS but be patient you'll be clear
with everything with the session all
right moving on guys let's now discuss
why do we need auto scaling now before
that right now the way I'll be going
through this session is I'll be
explaining you each topic and then I'll
show you it in the AWS console all right
so we just discussed what are snapshots
and what are ma am I so let me quickly
show you how you can configure or how
you can create an ami of an already
exist
instance in the AWS console so let me
give me a second
so give me a second I'll just go to my
browser and my AWS console so guys this
is my AWS console I hope it's visible to
you so the first thing that we'll be
doing is you'll be going on to your ec2
console alright so in your easy to
console you will have all your servers
that are running right now right so for
the for the sake of simplicity I have
deployed I have already deployed two
servers which are server one and server
two now I have configured them both with
Apache so that they can have your they
can host a website H so let me quickly
show you how the website actually looks
like so if I go to this particular IP
address of server one this is in part
one right so this is how the website
looks like
right similarly for my server two if I
go into my server 2 this is how much so
2 will look like here it is alright so
these are my two servers now what I want
is I will create an exact copy or the of
these servers so that they can be
replicated all right so when I say
replicated everything from software's to
this website will be copied onto an
image and that copy or that image when I
will deploy it it will be deployed
inside one more easy to server in which
I don't have to do anything this website
will be there I just have to go to the
IP address and I can see this website
alright so now what I will be doing is
I'll be creating in ami of Bodhi servers
so let's create an AMF for server one
first I'll select the server one I'll go
to actions I go to image I click on
create image and all I have to do do is
give an image name for it so let me give
the name as life's over
one right this is my image name I click
on create image and that is it it takes
in your request for creating an ami and
it does that alright please
now similarly I'll be doing it for so
two as well I'll select server - I'll go
to image I create an image and I'll aim
the image say life's over
- so once I've done that you can see the
images in your ami tab so if you look at
over here in the images section you can
look at ami is if you go to your mas you
can see there are two images which has
just been created which are in the
pending state as of now and they are
lies over one and life server - now
using these images you can create any
kind of server that you can create the
exact same server with just a click of a
button all right you don't have to
configure anything much all right so
this is how you create an MA pretty
straightforward guys let's move on and
discuss why do we need auto-scaling now
so you learnt how to create an air AMI
let's go ahead and understand
auto-scaling and see how they are
connected to a Mis
alright so say you have an application
you have a website and every machine now
this website is hosted on some server
guys right and servers are nothing but
machines now every machine has its
limitation right for example say there's
this machine is say around 8 GB and say
i5 processor so say it can host around
100 people right only 100 people can
come to this website and easily and I've
navigate inside the website but if more
than hundred people comes in this
computer or this server becomes slow
alright so say there are hundred people
as of now and they are trying to access
your website and they can easily access
it now your website becomes a hit
overnight alright and now a lot of
people are trying to access your website
which makes your server overburdened now
in this scenario you can do only one
thing that is deploy more servers and
distribute the traffic equally among
those servers so that the requests can
be handled all right
now this thing is a manual task and
manual is a big know in the IT world
guys so we invented
a service called auto-scaling and using
order scaling what happens is it sees it
actually analyzes the kind of load which
is coming in right and it deploys the
server's according to that so say around
300 people are coming in and it sees
there you need three servers to handle
those kind of requests it will do that
automatically alright and that is where
your ami comes in guys because the new
servers that you'll be launching those
new servers have to be taken out of some
template right so the first server has
to be the exact copy of the sorry the
second server has to be the exact copy
of server one the third server as well
has to be the exact copy of server one
right and that is where the ami comes in
so what it what basically happens is in
the or scaling service you basically
attach your ami which you created and
using that ami it deploys more servers
right this is why ami is significant or
this is how am I is related to auto
scaling and this is why do we need auto
scaling let's move ahead and just just
give us a definition that what auto
scaling exactly is so like I said
whenever you your load increases and you
have to scale automatically up and down
you use auto scaling so it's not only
about scaling up that is when your load
increases say three ophÃ¼ls servers
you're deployed and now when your load
decreases still for servers up there to
sitting idle right so that is not the
case with auto scaling you can also
scale down as per your needs you can
configure everything which you can
imagine about scaling up and scaling
down in the auto scaling properties all
right so this is why we need auto
scaling now one more thing that you need
with our scaling is if you would have
noticed I said the number of servers
that deploy gets deployed in the order
scaling say there are four servers which
get which get deployed during order
scaling right now the traffic has to be
distributed equally right
so this traffic which has to be
distributed has has nothing to do with
auto scaling it has to be done by a
separate entity and that is what we are
going to discuss in the neck
section but before that let me show you
how you can configure or how you can
configure the order scaling properties
and attach the related ami so that the
related servers are launched right so
let me go to my AWS console so here am i
and as you can see the EMAs have already
been created they are life server one
and life server two now what I'll be
doing is I'll be creating auto-scaling
groups or I'll be configuring the auto
scaling properties so that these servers
can be Auto scaled as and when required
right so before that I actually have to
create a launch configuration now what
is the launch configuration so if you
look at the ami guys you have only
specified what kind of data should be
there in your server what you have not
specified is what kind of machine
you should launch every time there is a
need all right so that is exactly what
you do in launch configuration so you
have the data but you don't have the the
information about the kind of machine
that you want to launch so you thought
that that kind of stuff you will be
specifying in the launch configuration
so what I'll be doing is I'll click on
create launch configuration and now it
will give me a visit as same as that of
any issue do so right in the ec2 server
I had to choose an operating system
right so same it will give me the wizard
but I don't have to go here I'll have to
go to a separate tab which is called my
Emma's right so I'll select my a - and
now I'll select the newly created am as
with the AMA which are just created
which is say we are creating a launch
configuration for a server one right now
so I'll select the lives over one click
on select and now it will ask me the
kind of the configuration that I want
for my server right so I need a t2 dot
micro because we are doing a demo today
right so we don't need much of of
computing power so we just have to we'll
select e 2 dot micro and we'll name our
launch configuration of things so let's
name it as live so one right and the I
am role is not required and I'll click
on next now it will ask me for adding
this
so 8gb is enough for a new bundle
machine quo to configure security groups
right and in these security groups I
just have to have the HTTP rule because
I have to connect to all the instances
that I'm launching right so I'll select
the HTTP rule from here right and I
click on review so that is it guys
nothing else has to be configured here
all right and it is asking me to check
everything that I've just configured
everything seems fine I click on create
launch configuration now it will ask me
for the key pair right so every server
which will be launched it will be
associated with the with a key pair
which will be specifying here right you
can create a new one if you don't have
already I already have a key pair so let
me choose my keeper so that is hemant
underscore - and I had acknowledged that
I have this keeper and I'll create the
launch configuration it just takes a
second or two to do that and we are done
all right so now we have created a
launch configuration we have specified
what kind of machine we want we
specified what kind of data should go
into that machine now we will be
creating the auto scaling group in which
will be specifying in which cases we
want to auto scale all right
so let's create an auto scaling group
now all right so it has automatically
picked up the launch configuration that
we have just created that is live server
one right let's name this group as lives
one group right and what is the initial
size that you want in your launch
configuration that is the minimum number
of servers that you want so let it be 1
and remember that this is the most
important part when you are creating a
launch configuration ensure that you are
doing it in your default VPC it to be on
the safe side because there are a lot of
settings that you have to do if you
create a V PC on your own and that
becomes a hassle alright so if you
accidentally delete your default V PC
which I did right so you have to contact
the AWS support team and they
be out with it they'll basically create
one for you you cannot create one on
your own all right so always ensure that
you are in your default VPC whenever you
are creating your auto scaling group all
right so now I will be specifying the
subnet so basically you have to select a
minimum number of two subnets right I'm
really not getting into water separates
because then it will be like a three
hour session will click on configure
scaling properties now over here you can
specify the properties that I was
talking about that when do you want your
server to scale right so over here you
can specify the average CPU utilization
now what do you mean by average PT CPU
utilization say there are four servers
running as of now right so it takes the
average of all the four servers all
right and if the average goes beyond
whatever number you specified here say I
specified 70 over here right so in that
case whenever the average PCP
utilization will go beyond 70 it will
launch one more server similarly if it
goes I can configure one more property
here which says if it goes below 20%
like scale down from one server alright
so if there are five servers and there
and seep utilization has gone less than
20% it will it will it will scale down
from one seven and come down to four
servers all right and you can also set
how many seconds should it wait say that
traffic is spiking down and up like too
frequently right so for that what you
can do is you can set a time so if the
20 person mark has been not crossed ill
say like five minutes then it will scale
down a server or if the 70 percent mark
of the CP utilization has been crossed
over five minutes it will thence only
scale up it will not scale up with at
only once for only one second it becomes
seventy one person all right so you can
specify all of that over here but since
I cannot load test my instance over here
I'll just keep it at its initial size
but just means that it will even if I
did
lead my instance that is I one instance
has to be there in any case if I delete
the instance it will automatically
launch it again all right so let's we'll
select the keep this group at and it at
its initial size and we'll go to
configure notifications so I don't want
to configure the notifications and
neither the tags I click on review and
I'll click on create auto scaling group
all right so I've successfully created
an auto scaling group for my life's over
one alright
similarly I'll do the same steps for my
server too as well I'll click on create
auto scaling group and I'll select a
launch configuration which was there for
my so to so not done that let's create a
launch configuration first for us over
to we'll go to am ice and we'll select
the server to party alright so I've
selected server to I'll do the same
steps that I did earlier right so let me
give it the name has lives over to group
I'll click on add storage configure
security group over here I'll add the
HTTP rule click on review and launch
configuration select the key pair
acknowledge it create launch
configuration I'm doing the same step
Skype I'm not doing any new thing here I
have created a launch configuration now
I will create the auto scaling group
which is lives over to group right and
then the V PC as I said should be
default subnet a minimum of two subnets
you should select I will click on
scaling properties I'll keep it at
initial size configure review and create
the auto scaling group alright
nothing much guys so same things that
are dead for my server one I have done
for my server two as well alright so
since I've created all an auto scaling
group if you go to your ec2 dashboard
you would notice that two more servers
are now being deployed alright so you
can actually identify them
over here see these two servers are
being initialized so Deva these have
just been created by your auto scaling
group because we've specified that a
minimum number of one server should be
there at all times right now if you try
to go to the IP address of this server
right you will see that it will have the
exact same settings for my easy Tucson
instance so this is my one right so as
you can see a new instance called
created but with the exact same settings
I didn't have to do anything
it automatically created an instance
with the same settings all right and
same is the case with server two as well
guys if I go to my server two and try to
access it I'll see the same things over
there as well
all right so my auto scaling group is
functioning fine so let us come back to
a slide now so we are done with auto
scaling now like I said you need to have
an entity which will equally divide the
traffic between the servers that you've
just deployed right so they say in I've
created two auto scaling group skies as
of now write the and via a create a
second order scaling group I will tell
you in a bit but for now understand that
there is an auto scaling group all right
and inside that auto scaling group say
there are five servers and if a person
is coming in order or a customer who has
logged on to your website is coming in
how would he
how would his traffic be referred how
would he know which server to go to
right so there comes in the third entity
which is called the load balancer so
what load balancer does is a load
balancer your your customer will
basically basically be coming to your
load balancer and the load balancer will
decide based on the usage of your
servers that which server is more free
and then will give the connection to
that server all right so this is
basically the role of a load balancer so
like I said a load balancer is a device
that acts as a proxy and distributes
networker application across a number of
servers now I've been saying it
repeatedly that your your servers are
actually also your traffic is actually
distributed equally among the servers
right but in a few moments I tell you
that there is one more one more way of
distributing your traffic right so
before that let me again stress on the
point that this was your auto scaling
group guys this is just the example that
I took in the beginning right so there
are like these set of users and they are
trying to access your website and they
are being routed to these servers so
this routing is actually done by a load
balancer all right now like I said the
traffic which is distributed it is
distributed in two types right the first
time would be to equally distribute them
among the number of servers let's say
there are five server so it will it will
distribute it among the five servers but
if there are say there are two kind of
servers now so your load balancer can
identify what kind of request is being
made by your user for example in your
website on in your application you have
you have a part wherein you can process
the image right and you have a part
where you can where you have the your
blogging section all right so if you
will process the image you want your
traffic to go to a different shadow
servers which are order scaled at their
own in their room or scaling group right
and if you have the blogging section you
have a different order scaling group
which is auto scaled at a different
weather different order scaling group
but you want everything to go from one
single link so the way to do that is
using an application load balancer so
let me just repeat what I just said so
say the this set of servers they host
your image processing part they do all
your image processing and these set of
servers that they host your blogs that
you have on your application all right a
user comes in he just logs onto your
website and he goes to a URL which says
say Eddie record or Co slash MA
all right if he goes to slash image your
load balancer will see okay he is asking
for the image kind of content so he
should go to this set of servers because
this D service of the image purpose and
if you go to Eddy big Eddy record or Co
slash blog your load balance of an
identifier okay this user he is asking
for the block content so he should go to
this set of servers alright so all of
that is done using your load balancer if
you compare it with the classic load
balancer it is it does not have that
kind of intelligence right what it will
do is basically all the traffic that it
has got incoming to it it will equally
distributed among the number of servers
that are under it all right but with the
application load balancer you have this
option wherein you can divide the
traffic according to the needs of the
customers all right now when you have
divided the traffic again the same thing
will happen here as happens in classic
load balancer that at this point it will
equally distribute the traffic among the
number of image servers right and
similarly the people who want to access
the blog it will equally distribute the
traffic among the number of people who
want to access the blocks over all right
so this is what an application load
balancer is all about so classic load
balancer was something which was
invented earlier and these days nobody
uses the classic load balancer any more
people are using application load
balancer right and that is what our
demonstration is going to be all about
today all right so enough of talks let's
move on to the hands-on that is the demo
part so let me quickly show you what we
are going to accomplish today so
basically a user will come in he will
have the address of a load balancer and
if he asks for the image path or say
server one in our case he will go to the
auto scaling group of server one if he
asks for server - he will go to server
two but all of them will have this same
address that is using your address of a
load balancer alright so this is what we
are going to accomplish today now now
for the
of you who didn't understand that why
did we create to order scaling groups is
because we want this so that is the
image processing service to be scaled as
well and as as at the same time we want
the blog serves to scale as well right
so that is the reason we want we created
two auto scaling groups so I created a
server one which you can imagine is for
your image processing and I created an
auto scaling group for server to which
you can imagine is for your blogging
section right
having said that guys now let's move on
to my AWS console and go to our load
balancers alright so what I'll be doing
now is I'll be creating a new load
balancer and that load balancer would be
off the type application load balance so
as you can see I have two options here
either I can create a classic load
balancer or I can create an application
load balancer so I'll go on with the
application load balancer and I will
name it as live load balancer and the
scheme is internet-facing so since mine
is a website that I want you guys to
access right so it could be internet
facing otherwise you if you are working
in a company and that company wants a
load balancer for their internal
websites that the companies have you can
actually opt for internal internal load
balancer as well but since as we have a
website and we want that to be used we
will use the internet facing load
balancer alright and the listeners it's
HTTP that's fine
and the availability zones like I said
you have to select a minimum of two
availability zones and you'll click on
configure security settings alright so
now you will be specifying the security
group right so in security group you
it's better to create a new security
group remember guys don't include the
default security group for your load
balance edge it's a good practice to
always create a new security group so
that you can cust
customize your rules according to your
needs alright so I played an oosik
the group and specify the HTTP rule and
I click on next and now comes the part
where in will be specifying the targets
all right now water targets now in
application load balancer guys
targets are missing basically but or
scaling groups right so target one would
be your auto scaling group one your
target two would be order scaling group
to target three target for you can have
as many targets as you want but in this
result you have to specify a minimum
number one right so we'll create a new
target group will call it as say auto
scaling live Auto one alright and the
protocol is HTTP port is 80 I will click
on next and I review everything I think
everything is fine and I'll create this
load balancer alright so we have not
done all the settings guys I'll show you
how to do all the settings for now we
have just created a plane load balancer
all right so I have created a load
balancer which is pointing to a target
group one and that target group is not
pointing to my auto scaling group as of
now all right we will do that now in
this part so we have created I just
created a target group called live auto
one I'll create one more target group
which will be called live auto two for
my second order scaling group alright so
I'll create this and done so I now have
two target groups that is live auto one
and live out of two now these two target
groups have to point to my auto scaling
groups respectively
alright now the way to do that you
cannot appoint them here you have to go
to your auto scaling groups right and in
your order scaling groups you have to
select the auto scaling group that you
have just launched so it is live server
one group and lies over to group so I go
to live server one group and go to
details and over here you click on edit
alright and inside edit you have this
option for target groups you don't have
to specify anything in the load
balancers this option is only for
classic load balancer
but we are creating an application load
balancer right so we'll be specifying
everything in the target groups so for
life server one group will be specifying
the demo server one so demo server one
has already been sorry sorry it will be
live or two one the target group that I
just created and live Auto one is
connected to your load balancer so
basically your load balancer will point
your target group and your target group
is now pointing to your auto scaling
group one which are pointing to your
instances all right so this is how it
the visibility comes in so I'll save it
the target group one is live server one
group and the target group two
I'll be specifying in the second auto
scaling group which is here that is live
or two - all right I'll save it and let
me quickly verify if I have done
everything right so this is life server
one group and this is live out of one
fine this is lies over to group and it
is live auto - fine so my load balancer
can now see the auto scaling groups that
I've just configured so let me quickly
go to my load balancer now comes the
part guys wherein I'll be specifying
when to go to auto scaling group one and
when to go to auto scaling group two
like I said we'll be specifying it using
the using the kind of request that the
user has made right so the way to do
that is using is by first selecting your
load balancer and going to listeners so
once you go to listeners guys you will
reach this particular page now in this
you have to click on view or edit rules
all right so once you click on view or
edit rules you will reach this page
which is kind of an if is which is kind
of FL structured so now what will you do
is so you can see that there is a
default rule as of now that anything any
request which is made it will go to live
Auto one all right which means any
requested which is made it straight away
pointed to the order scaling group one
now we will specify if the request is a
if the user is asking for server - he
should be pointed to server two so let
us do that the way we do it is like this
we'll click on add rules will click on
insert rule and now I'll specify so you
have two options here either it could be
the the routing could be based on your
host that is the address of your of your
website or it could be based on the path
now what are the difference say Eddie
record Co this is a host name right now
if I if I type in resources dot ed U
record Co it is still point to my domain
but if if I've specified resources dot
ID record out Co and if I write it over
here and I specify it has to go to
server - it will go to summer -
otherwise if you type in resource or
daily record code nothing will happen
because now if you not configured
anything right so that is the host path
with paths the differences that say you
right Eddie record Co / block all right
so that slash block becomes the path but
with host the thing is the difference is
resources dot ad record or Co so that
becomes one whose name right but with
path you are basically putting a slash
and you are going into a particular
folder all right so you can specify the
path here right it doesn't matter if you
have not specified in a server for
difference for different say you could
the way you could have done the image
processing and block the other way
around rather than having it on two
servers was that you have you could have
configured it inside two servers in your
root directory right it could be server
one for your image processing and server
two for your
blocks but I don't want that because
you're as distributed as your system is
it becomes more reliable right and that
is the reason we have two different
servers for two different set of things
so the way you can route your traffic to
body servers is by typing in the path so
say if I have to go to some of one I'll
type in server one slash star so star
basically means anything after server
one could can be accepted but it has to
go to the for request will be forwarded
to live Auto one alright so if I if I
have server one in my path anywhere in
my path it will go to live Auto one so I
save this rule similarly I say that if
it has server two in its path and
anything after that it has to go to live
Auto - all right let's save it and that
is it guys now my load balancer has now
has saved its settings let's hope for
the best and try executing it so this is
the link guys right if you just type in
this link it will by default go to
server one right so if I go to this link
you can see it is going to serve one as
of now but if I specify slash server one
it will go to my server one and if I
specify slash server two it will go to
my second server now you might be
wondering that even you might have a
different directory in your same server
so let me clear your doubt according to
that so what I'll do is I will go to my
ec2 dashboard right and I will go to
server one and I will quickly show you
if what happens if i type in server two
here alright so this is the IP address
right so if I type in this IP address
I'm going to server one if I type in
slash server two it will give me of
because there is no folder called server
- right same in the case here so if I go
to his IP area you can see server 1 if I
don't specify anything after my address
it will still go to the same server that
is here that is this IP address right
but if I specify slash / - over here it
will not be able to do so because this
is not a load balancer it is directly
your IP address but over here if a
specifies / - it will redirect me to the
second server one second right it will
redirect me to the second server and
that is all that I need all right so
with one address you are actually
pointing to two servers which will be
solving your two problems now the
real-life use case like I told you it
could be four different kind of tasks
say you have a blogging section on our
website and you have an image processing
section on your website if you want two
different servers to host your two
different services you can do that
easily using using a load balancer
alright guys so with this I conclude my
session for today let me quickly go to
my step my PPD so we created we we we we
created a load balancer which
intelligently identifies what the user
is asking if he's asking for an image
he'll go to server one if you ask him
for blogs Ilse go to server - in place
of serve image I just specified server
one and server two so that it becomes
easy for you to understand right one
more part of that I missed whenever you
are you have specified the path that
path also has to be specified in your
server for example I said load balancer
address slash / 1 right so it will go to
your server 1 but then over there it
will look for the server 1 directory
alright similarly if I specify slash / -
it will go to second server but it will
look for the sec server 2 directory so
keep that in mind alright guys so so
with that I conclude today's session
thank you for attending today's session
I hope you learn
something new today now before ending
the session guys I would quickly like to
point you out to the content that we
have on on our social platforms for
fries alright so if you are more keen to
learn more about AWS right you can go
through a blogging section it's over
here it has around eleven twelve blogs
which are enough to give you a kick
start into the AWS world similarly we
also have a channel on YouTube which has
around 48 videos for you to go through
right these videos are updated
frequently you can go through all these
videos and learn more about AWS we have
came up with a new course for the cloud
architect program which basically means
for today if if I if I do a
certification on AWS that is not enough
that is not enough for me to get hired
in the industry right so I have to know
who so different technologies as well so
there there comes in my DevOps there
comes in maybe a programming language
and everything and we at at Eureka we
understand that and hence we have came
up with a curriculum which will not only
teach you cloud computing it alone also
introduce you the topics on DevOps they
introduce you to topics on programming
right and it will also introduce you to
a secondary cloud provider which you
should always have which companies
prefer and for that we have as your
right so you can go through the course
details over here right and again if you
just want to opt for our AWS course you
can do that over here you can see the
batch timings and we have flexible batch
timings for every class if we have on a
lyrica we understand that you as
professionals you don't have time during
an office hours
so we have morning timings and evening
timings as well so you can choose a time
according to your will and if you want
to know more about the course you can go
to this course description section and
know more about the course right
