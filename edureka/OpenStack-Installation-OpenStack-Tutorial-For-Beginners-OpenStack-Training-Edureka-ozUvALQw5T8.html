Rika and today I'm going to tell you how
to install OpenStack in your system
thank you all the attendees for joining
today's session if you all can hear me
properly kindly drop me a quick
confirmation on the chat window so that
I can proceed
okay so Sandeep says yes Siddharth says
yes Jacob says yes
so does Jasmine very well then
so before starting with the installation
let us first understand what is
OpenStack I'm very much sure that you
all know what OpenStack is that is why
you obviously are here to know about the
installation process but still let me
give you a brief overview of OpenStack
well OpenStack is basically a set of
software tools that you can use to build
your own cloud infrastructure to build
your applications on an open stack
provides you with infrastructure as
service when it comes to cloud services
now OpenStack was created by Rackspace
and NASA
together in 2010 and after that a lot of
companies have been contributing to open
stack the OpenStack community is here as
you can see the big giants like IBM
VMware Red Hat Cisco Dell HP every one
of them have been contributing to
OpenStack and the best part about it is
that it is open source so I hope that
you've got a brief idea about OpenStack
any questions on that
no questions very well so let us start
with installation so the first thing
that you need to do is enable
virtualization now for virtualization
you can either use VMware I'm here using
Oracle VirtualBox manager and I'm going
to create Center Sdn there on which I'll
be installing OpenStack so let me go
ahead and open my Oracle VirtualBox
manager so this is my Oracle VirtualBox
manager and I have created a virtual
machine which is a Center s7 machine and
I have assigned 5.5 GBS of RAM to it so
make sure that you assign at least 5 GB
of RAM onto your VM on which you're
installing OpenStack onto because it
a little bit more RAM than other
softwares so make sure that you at least
assign five GBS now I have assigned 5.5
to be safe so let me just go ahead and
start this so this is my Center at 7vm
so let me just go ahead and open the
terminal and this is the terminal off my
Center 7vm so let me just first go ahead
and become the root user asking for
password done and now I'll just go ahead
and run a few commands to configure the
network so the first thing that I'll do
is disable the firewall so for that I'll
just use this command system CTL disable
firewall D now stop firewall systemctl
top firewall D and it's done now after
that I'm going to disable the network
manager so again I'm using the system
control command and I'm going to disable
the network manager
it's done and go ahead and stop the
service
done so clear the screen now go ahead
and enable the network so for that again
systemctl enable Network and then
systemctl start Network
it's done
so we're done configuring the network
for this VM so what we'll do now is that
we'll be installing OpenStack using a
tool called PAC stack now PAC PAC is a
tool developed by our do so this is now
if you want to actually install
OpenStack services one by one this is
actually going to kill a lot of your
time because you have to configure each
of the services one by one install them
one by one and connect them one by one
now with the tool like pax pack it uses
puppet manifest which contains all the
configuration details for installation
and configuring your services so it will
do it automatically so if you want to
save up some time you can use a tool
like pax tag so that is what I'm going
to show you right now and we're going to
download and install the Newton version
of OpenStack
so first I'm going to run this command
yum install - why Centaurus - release
and we're going to download the Newton
version of OpenStack so - OpenStack
Newton and end
it's done so clear the screen so now let
us just go ahead and update the packages
so for that I'm just going to use yum
update - why
so I have updated all my packages at
first honestly on my screen now I'm
going to go ahead and install pack stack
in my system now one thing that you
should keep in mind is that if you're
using OpenStack for general purpose and
you want a general-purpose
infrastructure so for that you can go
for pack stack but if you want your
infrastructure to be specialized for
maybe if it is a netbook focused
infrastructure all the computers and you
want different tailor-made
configurations I say you should go ahead
and try and stall all the key services
that you need one by one and configure
them according to your needs
instead of using pack stack but for
general purpose I would recommend you to
go ahead with pack stacks so now I'm
just going to go and install back stack
so for that I'm going to go ahead and
use this command yum install - why
OpenStack - back stack and Enter
so now backstack has been installed and
I'm going to use backstack to install
and configure all the key services of
OpenStack in my virtual machine so I'll
clear my screen now and now I'm going to
use this command which is back stack - -
all in one so when this come on execute
it will install all the key services and
configure all the key services of
OpenStack starting from Nova which is
compute networking neutrons the image
service glance then the object storage
and the block storage which is Swift and
cinder respectively and finally the
dashboard which is known as horizon
everything will be installed and
configured using this command so I'm
just going to go ahead and press Enter
so now this is going to take up some
time so in the meantime let me just take
you back to the PPD and see what other
steps we need to do or what were the
steps that we have just done so at first
what we did was we use the Oracle
VirtualBox manager that is where we
created our virtual machine and we are
installing OpenStack on and then we can
figure out our network by changing the
network settings we install the
OpenStack Newton release for centerís
now this is not the latest release the
latest one is okata but we're installing
Newton for now now we have already done
that right we have installed it and it
was successfully installed we have
downloaded the package of OpenStack
Newton and it has been successfully
completed we also updated our current
packages using this command sudo yum
update - why and then we installed
OpenStack packs backpacks tag is a tool
which were using to install and
configure all the OpenStack services and
it has also been successfully installed
like I just showed you then we started
back start to install OpenStack Newton
and all the key services now you can see
here these over here is the Nova compute
entries cinder entry cinder is for block
storage mariya DB is used for the
database services and after it's done
you can start using the dashboard which
is horizon to start any instance to
launch any instance and use it for your
own applications to develop applications
to test out applications or for any
purpose that you need now after that
step is done the installation will be
completed successfully and after that
will create a Keystone RC admin file
this is where you'll get your username
and your password to use the dashboard
this is what the file looks like the
Keystone RC admin file and then you can
just go to the link of where you'll also
find it over here so this is still find
all the information of your dashboard
over here all your login credentials and
now since Keystone is the authorization
and authentication service of OpenStack
so this is where you'll find all
your login credentials or your
credentials for authentication and
authorization and finally you can just
log into the dashboard using the
credentials and you can start using
OpenStack so let us go back to our VM
and see if the installation has been
completed it's still installing now it
might take up a little bit of your time
but have patience it will get installed
now you might get an error at this point
because we are downloading and
installing a lot of packages altogether
so sometimes there might be
unavailability of a mirror from which it
is downloading all the packages so it
might actually produce an error so if it
does I'll tell you how to solve that now
let's hope that it doesn't give that
error but if it gives it we should
better be ready right
so there we go there were no errors we
have completed the installation
successfully now even if you get errors
in the middle you can just refer to the
answer file so when you're installing
back stack back stack will create an
answer file now an answer file is an XML
based file which contains all the setup
and configuration details for your
OpenStack installation so if any error
occurs in your system you can just go
and run that answer file using PAC stack
- - answer - file and the answer files
that is created ok so now we have
installed it successfully so we'll just
go ahead and use the dashboard
so for that we just need to open the
Keystone RC admin file so we'll see
where the file is
so this is the file that you need to
open so I'm just going to use cat and
Keystone RC admins yeah so there it is
this is your username admin and this is
your password for the dashboard and your
dashboard will be available on this IP
address and this is the port number so
I'll just first go ahead and copy this
on the clipboard and let us open the
dashboard so let me go to my browser
so we're just going to go and login to
the dashboard you remember the IP which
is ten dot zero dot dot one five slash
dashboard and enter
so it's asking for a username so the
username is admin and the password I
just copied it so I'm just going to
paste it
so I'm just going to go ahead and press
the connect button over here so there it
is you can start using your dashboard
now you have got your identity services
in admin you'll find everything the
instances volumes different flavors for
your instances then you can also
configure your network you can view your
images that you can store here so this
is the glance part so there is this you
already have a default Cirrus image in
the glance repository so you can start
using OpenStack now so that is how you
install OpenStack in your system using
pack stack so guys any question on that
ok no questions very well thank you for
