designing data-driven framework with
selenium-webdriver
okay so the topic for today's webinar is
designing data-driven automation
framework with selenium so what first of
all we will be going through the agenda
for this webinar and then we will
continue with the frameworks so I'll
give you a walkthrough as to what
selenium is what kind of automation tool
it is what are the different levels of
selenium how selenium can help you work
on problems of manual testing and all so
in today's webinar we will be mostly
covering the data-driven framework of
automation with selenium and then we
will first of all I will walk you
through what exactly selenium is what
kind of tool it is how it can help you
come overcome your problems with manual
testing and how to design a framework
which is efficient enough and very
flexible for modification so whenever
you want any kind of modifications you
can just a you know make few changes and
you can get your work done from your
framework so first of all let's get
started
with selenium so what what is the agenda
of today's class so we'll be learning
what is automation we'll be learning
about the selenium suite that is what
are the different flavors of selenium
how they come together to serve the
purpose of automation and everything and
then how to design a framework that is
the test framework and we'll have a demo
on designing a selenium test framework
which is a data driven so I hope you
guys enjoy this webinar I would like you
guys to pour in questions as and when
you have it and I'll answer them if I'm
in the middle of something so give me
please give me some time to answer your
questions
else I'll be answering them at the end
of the class at the end of the class we
will have a 5 to 10 minutes session into
which we'll just be having interaction
for questions and answers so is that
good okay so now all
been working into the testing domain and
you know that there are situations
wherein you have to repeat the same
day's a test or different sets of data
so it is very tedious and tedious task
to repeat the same test with a you know
different data so what happens in this
process is the manual tester he feels
tired the there is a something known as
boredom which is attached to human
emotions which will ultimately affect
your work so the efficiency it starts
reducing with respect to the work and
you might miss out something so what we
are going to do is we will be solving
this problem with the help of automation
so what is automation whatever actions
you put whatever actions or operations
you perform with your test application
manually we would be automating them
with the help of script so what is the
automation script it is nothing but its
lines of code which will help you to
perform the same actions with the help
of the computer code instead of doing
them manually so you write automation
scripts rituals which will simulate the
actions that human would have performed
on the application so you execute the
script that is equivalent your test
execution manually and you have Auto
generated result file also so automation
will help you keep track of all the
results that you generate were each and
every time you run the automation
scripts and then automation can also
help you with taking the screenshots and
auto generation of reports so with
automation your life becomes amazing now
you don't have to do the same thing
again and again with different sets of
data you can focus on more functional
aspect of the application so this is
what is automation going to give you so
what are the advantages of automation
first of all cost reduction for example
if you have to perform a certain test
which is estimated for 200 hours so you
have limited
number of days you need to put in more
resources that is I might have around 8
days to complete my task and I might
need to put up 8 resources to do the
complete test execution but this is not
possible each and every time because it
is very costly to put the resources onto
your project but with automation you can
write a script once through skilled
resources and automation and then reuse
the script as and when required so the
number of times you can execute the
automation script is practically
unlimited you write a script you can
execute it over and over again till your
application is the scene
the second is reusability reusability is
in two aspects the first aspect is
reusability of your code and reusability
of your script so whenever you say that
you write a script test script once and
you can execute it over and over again
till endless amount of time that is
still your application is stable
Automation is fast so what is this
automation it gets executed very quickly
the amount of time that a manual tester
would have taken to actually perform a
test is far more than what automation
does because automation is a script
which will execute as and when you know
the objects on the screen they are
available and whenever you over as as
the code goes forward unattended
execution so once you have your test
scripts and a bunch of test scripts no
less test suite together you can
actually execute the test suite even if
you are not attending the attending your
computer so you can start the execution
you can go off to your from your work
place you can go to your home and you
can write an automation suite in such a
way that after the completion of
automation suite it will send out an
email to you saying that these test
cases have passed these test cases they
have failed and these test cases they
are actually not able to run or anything
any
sort of problem that is being generated
by the automation scripts also that is
also reported so you get a detailed
execution report along with notification
also so not required that a person
should actually be sitting in front of
computer to see if automation is running
or not
then reliability as we have said that if
you ask a manual tester to perform the
same tasks again and again at some point
of time he would get bored he would feel
tired but computer it doesn't get bored
it doesn't feel tired so if you even
execute the same script thousand times
computer is not going to say that no no
I'm not going to execute the script now
I have done it a thousand times before
no and it will execute the script with
same accuracy with constant speed which
is obviously faster than the human being
and with accuracy the next thing is
better quality as there is no deviation
from the actual script you will always
have the same quality run 1 and 1000
will have the same quality because it
will actually execute the code line by
line so there is no question of getting
bored there is no question of skipping
something there is no question of not
able to run something so if it is a
human and if there is some kind of data
error on to the screen you might skip it
over because you are seeing the same
thing again and again 4,000 times so you
assume that this is correct and you move
forward but automation script is not
doing going to do that it will execute
it line by line ok so the next is
selenium is a suite of tools to automate
web browsers across many prior platforms
so the first and foremost advantage of
selenium is that it is a tool it is a
suite of tools that is a collection of
tools to automate web browsers across
many platforms so now coming to the
specific tool that is selenium it is a
automation tool which is able to handle
multiple languages it is able to handle
multiple operating systems and different
browsers
so the sweet it will can it consists of
four different tools so we will discuss
that in the next slides so first of all
let us see what are the features of
selenium support for different
programming programming language so it
selenium script can be written in Java
it can be written in Python it can be
written in PHP it can be written Ruby
pearl or JavaScript and still it will
execute the same set of actions that
were performed by the user support for
different operating systems you can
write a script on one platform in one
operator on one platform that is one of
the operating systems in one of the
languages and you can execute it across
multiple platforms across multiple
browsers so it supports Windows it
support supports Mac it supports Linux
Linux iOS and Android so you see there
is a bunch of platforms that selenium is
supporting support for different
browsers so selenium is you can with the
help of selenium you can execute your
tests in Internet Explorer Firefox
Chrome Safari Opera so these are the
browsers that are supported natively by
selenium okay so now let us see why
selenium is important you see the
biggest Giants in the market that is
Google Mozilla thought box IBM
Salesforce LinkedIn all of them they are
using selenium for their test automation
so whatever test they write as automated
test they are using selenium to write
those tests and they are deriving
fabulous products in markets if you if
you see Google if you see Salesforce
they have fabulous products Todd walks
is amazing lay into selenium so now let
us move forward to understand the
selenium suite first so what the
selenium suite it is the collection of
tools or the different flavors of
selenium so there are four components of
selenium suite
the first is selenium IDE so selenium
IDE it is an integrated
environment we're in sorry selenium IDE
integrated development environment so it
comes as a Firefox plug-in and it is a
actually record and plea tool along with
fastly to to export your test scripts to
any of the target languages then you
have selenium RC so this was this also
popularly known as selenium 1.0 selenium
RC stands for selenium remote control so
this flavor of selenium it dealt with
the browsers with the help of a remote
control server which in turn
communicated the selenium scripts
actions to the browser we will be
studying these in detail in slides to
come so please don't worry then you have
selenium webdriver so selenium webdriver
it is it is the latest technology it is
the latest API from selenium which is
used for test automation and then you
have the selenium grid so selenium grid
it forms a platform onto which you can
execute your stress test scripts across
different platforms and different
machines or browser browsers on those
machines at the same time so if you the
latest version of selenium is selenium
2.0 and it is a combination of selenium
RC and selenium webdriver so selenium is
a free tool it is open-source and anyone
can download it from the selenium HQ dot
orgy site and start using it ok so let
us see into detail what the selenium
suite has to has for us first of all the
selenium ID so selenium ID a tool you
it's a Firefox plug-in which records in
please back user interactions with
browser so whenever you are trying to
perform any kind of functional test with
your application what you can do is you
can just start recording with the
selenium ID what you see on the right
hand side is the selenium IDE it is
showing you how the different
axÃ© there are different aspects of this
we won't be going into the details of
this because the topic is selling add
the detail diamond frameworks with
selenium-webdriver
so I'll just introduce you what selenium
IDE and different flavors of selenium
are so selenium IDE you can export the
programming code in two different
languages like Java Ruby Python etc so
here you can record your test okay it
would get recorded at test steps
whatever you see inside this box that is
come on target value each of the row
would form a selenium test step and you
can export this test into whatever
programming language a target
programming language you want like Java
Ruby or Python it allows to record and
playback the tests conveniently that
were recorded previously in selenium ID
so you can record a test over here you
can save it and you can play it back at
some later time
selenium ID is not the best solution for
production testing because selenium IDE
has many limitations selenium ID is not
used into production environment so
selenium suite RC that is selenium RC
selenium remote control RC is a free
tool that allows you to write web
application test in many programming
languages so selenium RC it has a
programming interface wherein you can
write your code in two different
programming languages and you can
execute it on any of the browsers with
the help of a selenium remote control
server if you see in this diagram you
can see that selenium it has a selenium
RC it has a remote control server and to
which it actually is a mediator you can
see it acts as a mediator between your
test script where you have your test
script okay it can be written into any
programming languages that is Java Ruby
Python Perl or peed on it and the remote
control server would actually interpret
your commands from
your script and would send them to the
browsers in the language that is
understandable by the browser's so RC
server receives the selenium commands
called Cellini's so these commands are
known as Celanese from test program
using simple HTTP GET post request so it
would get the commands in form of simple
get or post request and then it would
process it and we would get it executed
on the browser's now let us learn about
selenium webdriver selenium webdriver is
a compact object-oriented API as
compared to selenium 1.0 so with
selenium RC you had a intermediate
selenium RC server in between for
communication from script to browser but
with selenium a webdriver API you have a
direct connect communication from your
script to your browser
you don't need an intermediate server to
for communication so this is pretty much
fast this is pretty much light weight
than selenium RC it interacts with the
browser directly while selenium RC needs
help of RC server to interact with
browser which makes it slow selenium
webdriver
overcomes limitation of selenium 1 like
file upload or download pop-ups and
dialog barrier so with selenium RC you
there was a issue that it wasn't able to
focus or it wasn't able to deal with
things like file upload or download it
wasn't able to deal with popups and
dialogue barrier so all these ever were
overcome with selenium webdriver
selenium grid so what exactly is a grid
as you can imagine that a number of
computers connected together in a single
network can form a grid but actually
they are just connected to form a
selenium grid each of them should run a
say one machine should work a run a
selenium server and others should run
the selenium node so selenium grid runs
multiple tests at the same time against
different machines running different
browsers and operating systems so as you
can see in this diagram itself that you
have a node 1 which has Internet
Explorer on Windows platform no.2 is
Android
phone note 3 has Safari on Mac and note
4 has Firefox in open 2 so all these
have different platforms and they have
different operate they have different
browsers so you can run the same test at
the same time or two all of them
together ok so now let us come to the
original or the main content of the
webinar that is designing selenium test
framework so for designing selenium test
framework generally we take help of
Excel files to keep our data or the
action keywords that is ok let me put it
forward in a different way okay so what
exactly is a selenium test framework
while testing web applications using
selenium it's very important to design a
flexible test framework that can easily
be modified and reused so actually a
framework is nothing but they are the
building blocks so whether if you
imagine a house so in the house it has a
structure first that is there are
pillars and columns and when the pillars
and columns they are erected after that
you can separate out the space between
them with walls and call different
sections of your house like you have a
kitchen you have a bedroom you have a
living room you have a library so all
this becomes separate part so similarly
selenium framework it is also a kind of
structure into which the different
operations actions and data that you
will be using within your selenium
script is categorized and kept together
ok so there are different types of
frameworks the one the first one is a
keyword driven framework and the second
one is a data driven framework so in
Turkey in Turkey word driven frameworks
you have scripts representation of your
test scripts that is you write the
scripts in the form of action keywords
action keywords like for example if I
want to say open a browser so I would
see action keyword as open browser
and into an Excel and exactly my
framework knows that when I say open
browser where I need to go which line of
code I need to execute and run the
action and what is detail in framework
into details even framework there is
huge set of data or for the same test
and it needs to be run again and again
and again so it becomes very difficult
to manage the data as well as the test
reports so selenium frameworks would
help you to categorize your tests it
would help you to categorize your data
keep them at proper places keep them
properly into your project structure so
that it can be used and reused by your
test scripts so types of test framework
we have seen you ha oh just give me a
second I forgot to explain the third one
so where when you combine the data
driven and the keyword divin approach
together the framework is known as a
hybrid framework so this has both the
capabilities that is capabilities of a
keyword driven framework to implement
the key action keywords and to implement
the same test or an over again over the
huge sets of data that are being
provided by the user so how does it look
like so first of all you have your test
cases then you have your test data along
with the test cases now the test data
it is generally kept in Excel or XML
files Excel is more preferred because it
is very user friendly that is you can
easily modify whatever you have within
your excel files and you can also just a
quick check guys are you able to hear me
ok great actually I didn't find any
question so I thought I am lost or
something ok so let us focus on the
frameworks so as I explained you these
are your test scripts that will contain
the data of your that will contain the
scripts that you want to execute and
then you have your data which is kept in
Excel files so
to read the Excel files with help of
Java you read another framework known as
the Apache API framework so this
framework is responsible and capable for
getting data for you from the excel
files and excel sheets it is also
capable of writing back the test results
to the excel files and iterating over
the data sets that are provided by the
user so then you have your selenium
webdriver so selenium webdriver it is
the API that will help you to perform
your test operations and you have a
reporting inbuilt reporting framework
within which will help you to generate
reports or the youth sets of data and
over they use test scripts that you are
executing typically in industry the
scenario is like you execute almost
thousand to 2,000 scripts within a
particular regression cycle which are
run through automation so if you can
feel what if you can feel say it's a
huge amount of data that is being tried
generated by each of the test runs the
reports and any kind of data or kind of
screenshots that you might be taking
within the execution and everything so
it's a huge amount of data that is being
generated so all these is maintained by
the reporting framework so as you can
see it here you have the test results
and reports and you have the logs also
so what are logs logs are something that
is generated by the system when a
particular action is being performed and
your test cases if you see downwards
they are in the form of hybrid framework
that is the keyword Jun framework and
the data driven framework so let us see
DWM free work is in the data-driven
sorry let us see what a keyword ruin
free work is so in a keyword driven
framework flow of the automation is
dependent on keywords each keyword is
keyword driven framework has a specific
meaning for example if I write wait so
that means I have to wait for some
specific time if I say verify it's the
validation of text object or value or
anything on the screen
when I say store that means I want to
write back and our value from the web
application to somewhere in my file
system when I say scroll down I want to
just move from the upper part of the
screen to the lower part where I say
click enter text or select they are
actually actions those are selenium
actions that you will be implementing
and then would be dealing with them so
when it comes to keyword driven
framework it is you can see a single
script less representation of your test
script you would arrange the keywords in
order you want them to execute for
example I have to login to a particular
application so I know that first I need
to open the browser I need to navigate
to the particular URL I need to type in
the username I need to power type in the
password and I need to hit on the and
submit button or the login button so
each of these would each of these
actions would comprise a separate action
that is open browser would be a an
action for which I would be using for
example keyword as open bra a open
browser then navigate to a particular
URL I can say get URL so get URL is my
keyword and I'll be I know that get URL
needs to be implemented as opening a
particular URL on the web browser then
enter the username so for username I
know that I need to enter a text into a
particular text box so I would be
telling selenium-webdriver as to which
text box I want to enter the tray text
and I would be passing on the text that
I want to enter so selenium text it will
take care with to find that particular
element on the screen and enter the
particular text into it similar thing is
with password so I can use the same
keyword that is enter text for both the
actions by providing different elements
on the screen and I can get through it
and then I have last but not the least
the login button
so login button would have a click
operation so click operation is also
defined within selenium-webdriver I'd be
utilizing the click operation from
selenium by accessing it through some
particular action keyword so clear it in
this point of time or you have any
doubts any kind of queries okay so we go
on to the keyword driven frameworks that
is the action keyword should be
implemented and action keywords would be
implemented in order of the actions that
you want to perform with the help of the
keywords so there are different selenium
webdriver API methods that will help you
to perform actions with your screen so
you need to locate a particular element
on the screen and then you can automate
it okay so let us take an example of
keyword driven framework so how it goes
so any kind of automation it first
begins with finding a particular element
on the screen so I first and the
elements they are located with the help
of the properties so I say the object
need I have different columns into this
framework as you can see you have the
object name I have the value for the
object name I have action so these are
the action keywords those are in this
action row these are the action P words
then I have the property type I have the
property value and I have the status so
into this the object needs a object name
it will give you a picture as to what is
there in that step so this is nothing
but it is for your own use you can call
it as a an identifier for your object in
the visual world
then you have the value so if you have
any kind of value that you need to pass
on from the script to the application
you can put it into this that is the
value column then you have the action so
this is the most important part that is
what is to be performed now if you can
see I have two actions that is enter
text and click so out of which enter
text has been used two times so I'm
reusing my code and I have provided
different properties as to where I need
to enter the text so what is property
type so whenever there are any web
elements if you try to inspect the
elements that is try to go through the
properties and see what locators are
used for the particular element on the
screen you will be finding different
attributes like ID name CSS tag the
XPath and also the different types of
locators like the tag name so you can
use any one of the locator to uniquely
identify element on the screen so once
you are able to identify the element
uniquely on the screen with a particular
kind of attribute and its value you will
be able to exactly perform the action
with the help of action keywords and
their implementations so what is the
property type which identifier is used
to find the object so it will just state
which identifier is used for example
over here i'm using the name property
then in password field i'm using the ID
property and then for the login again i
am using the name property so property
value so what is the value there is
whenever there is a attribute it has a
key value pair so the key is the name of
the property and the value of the
property is the value so for name there
is a value known as log for ID there is
a value known as user pass so these are
the values which will help you uniquely
identify the elements on the screen then
state
if the action was performed successfully
then your strip would write back pass
over here and if the action is not
performed then it would pass on fee so
this is something that is written by
your script at the runtime okay so
moving ahead to data-driven framework so
what our data-driven frameworks so as
already discussed whenever there are
huge volumes of data that are being used
for testing a particular need you come
up with data-driven frameworks that is
you want to execute the same script you
want to execute the same script over an
a for different sets of data so in the
in the first at keyword driven framework
your keywords were different but with
data-driven frameworks you have
different data for the same test
execution executing test case with
different sets of data given detergent
framework is very helpful when you want
to test the application with different
sets of data and doing it manually is
difficult and error-prone
task so you know with huge sets of data
there comes Boldin there comes the
tiredness of the manual tester or for
executing the same thing again and again
and also it's a it's like you neglect
few of the things as you assume them to
be true but your script it is not going
to do that so data-driven framework in a
way is also similar to the keyword
driven framework but it focuses on data
as the variable okay so in this you have
different test cases okay for which you
have data in Excel or XML files
so mostly Excel is preferred as it is
very handy and it is very easy to
operate the Excel files or change make
any modifications okay then you have the
Apache API framework which will help you
to interact with your Excel files
help you to get the data from the excel
files right back data to the excel files
you have your selenium-webdriver to
perform the particular set of actions
onto the web application and then you
have finally your test results okay
so we'll be explaining each and every
aspect of data to an frameworks
over here now for example within the
same scenario of the keyword driven
framework you need to execute the same
script that is you need to try out your
login script for different sets of data
that is I have three users known as
admin one admin to admin three and they
have certain passwords that is demo one
two three demo one to four and demo one
to five so what I'll be doing is now
instead of writing the script again and
again so this is the script list
representation that is in three lines
username password and login I am trying
to define a test scripts I'm actually
defining a test script now I want to
repeat this test script but for
different data that is username and PI
username password login first for
username admin one demo one two three
then for you username admin two and
password demo one two four and then for
username admin three and password s demo
one two five so what I'll be doing is
I'll take help of the data joint
framework so in this value column if you
see there is something in curly braces
that is curly braces they denote the
data variable so this data variable
whenever is encountered by your Apache
Pui framework it knows that it has to go
a particular data set and execute the
complete script or over the complete a
data set that is if here there were 50
rows the same script would have executed
50 times okay so in second column of
data join tab values are in curly braces
which tell the tool that this is dynamic
field and value has to be fetched from
the data set so it is going to data set
it is fetching the value and coming back
total number of execution is equal to
number of rows in data set so if as I
already told you that if there are 50 I
call rows in the data
the same script would get executed 50
times so this is the beauty of
data-driven framework that is you don't
need to perform the same thing again and
again okay so now we will have a demo
with respect to the video driven
framework I have a very good data driven
framework for you guys to work through
and I'll explain you each and every
aspect of the data driven frameworks but
before that just let me know if you have
any questions so far
you can just answer it simple yes or no
if you don't have any questions I know
guys that you are muted you can type in
your question in the same chat window so
we have Prasanna who has a question that
is do you have to prepare the document
for all the views
yes Prasanna see because your
keyword-driven or data-driven framework
it is actually defining what you want to
perform so you'll have to write it as a
you are actually instead of writing the
script you are writing in it in one word
within your Excel files so definitely
you will have to put up write your
documents if you have to execute
different sets of tests but if you want
to just execute it or different sets of
data you can directly pass a parameter
to your data to your keyword driven
framework or your the data driven
framework from where in it notes that
knows that it has to fetch some data
okay so we we do have few more questions
also so I'll be answering those at the
end of the session guys we'll just first
of all try to get through one of the
data driven framework started this a you
know it has a particular Mutoh now I'll
just explain you what this framework has
to do I'll first run through the send a
scenario manually so that you guys can
actually feel what I am doing with the
help of automation
so the scenario says that open a browser
okay go to this site known as Eddie
raker dot Co so once you navigate to
this site at Eureka dot Co you have
search for of course a text box I want
to type in particular test string into
this text box and I do I want to search
okay so when I click on search button
there is a search there are the search
results those are being displayed to me
so what I want to do is that is a
certain title to each of the search
result so for example the first title
says automation testing using
testcomplete 11.0 so my motto is I know
the expected set of results so whenever
I type in testing I know with for my
application that there will be six
result sets I'll be having the titles of
all these result sets and I would like
to verify whether they are in order and
they are correctly displayed to the user
so when I type in testing I have six
result sets okay
I'll be cropping the or I'll be getting
the title for each of the result set
from my web application okay I have the
same thing into my excel file wherein I
have stored the data I will have be
comparing them whether the expected
title and the actual title so as as per
the rule of testing each of the test
case it at the end compares the expected
results with the actual results that is
you know for a known set of data you
compare the actual output from the
application so when these two are equal
that is expected and equal you say that
your script is passing else you say that
the script has passed now field okay so
in my case I have a particular excel
file which I would like to show you guys
so this file is known as test script
excel file and it has a certain things
so first of all what I am trying to
drive through data I am trying to drive
to data the different courses that I am
searching
I'm trying to search with Mikey with the
keyword known as database okay
then I have a certain set of results I'm
trying to search through with the help
of keyword Python I have a certain set
of results through gate testing Hadoop
Java so for instance if tomorrow I want
to search with another keyword all
together I can utilize this same
framework I'll be just adding over here
the keyword that I want to search and
along with that into my data sets what
do I have I have each of columns as a my
expected output so this is my
expectation that whenever I type in
testing I should be shown six results
and those six results should have the
following titles that is automation
testing using test complete functional
testing using test ran o ranorex manual
testing for beginners testing with
selenium webdriver mastering no chairs
and Ruby with cucumber so self-paced so
all these titles are my expected titles
and I want to compare them with the
actual titles that I get from the web
application so this is how the scenario
is and why I am automating see if you
see there is huge data set I want to you
know I have around one two three four
five six seven so I have 7 cause 7
search strings through which I want to
search and I want to get the results for
each one of them ok
and this in the courses tab I have
written whatever courses I would do
source so these are my search strings in
short now let us go to the poor what the
code has to see ok so the first and
foremost thing is I have written this
code in the form of a test ng test so it
has a before test annotation which means
that if it will get executed before each
of the test cases executed any of the
test annotations so this is a setup
method into which I am I want to execute
my test over the Firefox browser and I
want to go to a site known as
www.iberia.com willed methods that
selenium webdriver is providing me
okay that is a dry would get so this
driver it's actually an instance of
webdriver so the webdriver it holds a
your browser instance whatever browser
you might be using so it is going to
have all the browser instance then I
have a after test method that is the
cleanup method of the teardown method
wherein all the resources allocated
within a particular test they will be
unallocated okay then this is my main
test core so this is the name of my test
method and there are few declarations as
you can see okay now the first thing
that I'm doing is I I want to say
iterate through the different courses if
you see I first want to do it read two
different courses so for example when I
come to this that is database then I
want to actually search this string okay
then I want to go to the data set tab I
want to select this column this complete
column I want to iterate through each
one of them that is iterate to the first
row of this database column compare it
with the actual iterate to the second
row compare it with the actual similarly
going forward come to the last row of
database compare it go forward then what
should happen then it should go to the
second course that I want to search this
is my search string then a I should go
for Python so when I encounter Python in
my script then I again go to my data set
I see that there are there should be
only two results and with the following
title itself okay so after that I am
going to a column selector so what does
that column selected do the column
selector
if you see I will just show you the
project structure this is the project
structure so first of all I have a
package into which I am writing my
driver script if you see this is demo
script class this is my driver script so
I need to run this driver script in
order to execute all the other actions
or the scripts that I have inbuilt and
then I have a config file so into the
I have two files of use that is what is
the coarsest or Java so this method
actually it is going to create a list of
all the courses so those are present in
to my courses tab so when this list is
returned it is going to iterate through
each of the list elements okay then I
have the course selector so within the
course selector I need to select the
column through which I read I will
iterate whenever I select a particular
course for example if I select how do I
know into my data set I have placed it
at 0th column so this is the Hadoop
column over here which is at position 0
and so on so this is going to select the
column for me okay then I have my data
engine wherein I have actually kept to
my test script that is the excel which
is providing the data here this is the
excel so this is the data set and this
is the courses that I want to iterate
through okay then I have the utility
package so if within the utility package
I have written a class for excel utility
so this is the class that will help me
to read data from the excel to iterate
through different rows and columns of
the excel to get the cell data and also
to write back results to the excel so if
you see there are four methods major
methods over here first is a set excel
file into which I am setting the path
and the sheet so I need to provide the
path of the excel file to which with
which I want to deal and then I need to
provide the sheet name so whenever you
open a particular excel you have these
this is the excel file completely that
is known as an excel workbook and within
the Excel workbook you have different
Excel worksheets so configuration is a
worksheet data set is a worksheet master
as a worksheet ed your nigga it's a
worksheet so all these comprise the
worksheets so when these six worksheet
five worksheets come together they form
our Excel workbook okay so after that
this is a method get cell data from the
name itself you can know that it is
going to get the data from the excel
exit actually and it accepts to
parameter that is the row number and the
column number so you need to provide the
row number and the column number of the
cell from where you need to fetch the
data so one important thing about excels
are you know the index they would start
from zero
sorry so whatever I am trying to access
here see this selected cell it would
stand at 0th row and zero column this is
first row and first column this is
second row and second column this is
third row and second column so this is
the fashion into which the Excel
recognizes the records inside it so it
starts with zero that is the most
important thing that you should know and
then what I'm trying to do is there is a
method through which that is the gate
row I'm passing the row number and get
cell passing the column number and
getting the cell data okay so there is a
method known as get a string cell value
which will help me to get the string
data available at the particular
position then I have a method for
getting the row count that will return
me the number of rows that are utilized
within the particular column so if you
go through this it is a it would return
you a six now why because it starts with
zero zero one two three four five six
and that is the reason I have just
placed a counter to increase it to the
actual row count okay and then it is
returning the row count the method below
this it is used for writing back results
to the excel file so if you see there is
a write result to the excel file and it
has a parameter known as a map so map is
it it's a collection a part of
collection framework from Java so it is
in the form of key value pairs so
whatever is entered within the map it
has a key and it has a associated value
to it okay so after this let us go
through the row the next lines of code
so there are four particular things that
is you have a row header you have a
column header and then you iterate
through the particular row or column of
the excel file and get to the particular
action so this will basically write back
the result so whenever we are writing
back the result
I will show you this the most important
is the driver script so from the driver
script what we are trying to do is we
are first of all selecting the excel
file and the excel sheet that we want to
deal with that is the courses first then
I'm getting the row count of the courses
because I want to iterate through each
and every row of the course okay and
then this logic is used to perform the
particular actions that is there is a
while loop and there is a list known as
the search text so this list would
contain all the elements that is from
database to Java okay so it would start
a database it would have database Python
JIT testing Hadoop and Java and once you
are into this you have the list you want
to actually go to each of the columns in
your data set over here if it is Hadoop
you want to check that these all food 13
headings there are or these 13 search
results they are displayed to the user
okay so here you are forming a
particular list into which you will
collect all the or all the titles and
this method that is a host title it
holds all the titles of the courses one
by one whenever you're iterating through
it then that is the excel data string
which is calling the get cell data so
you need to pass that card row number
and the column number from where it
needs to get the data at the last what
we are doing is we are trying to perform
a check that is is the course title
equal to the excel data so whatever we
had fetched from Excel that is Big Data
Hadoop if it is the first course title
in the list then only this will pass
otherwise this will feed and at the end
we are writing back all the results to
the excel file so let us quickly run
this to see what happens so what I
expect it to do is for all the
particular courses I expect it to verify
that these
idols are present so first of all it
will invoke the browser it will go to
the URL at Eureka dot Co and then it
will type in search string it will get
the search results and from the and it
will verify each of the search results
with the expected data from the Excel
files so this is the ad Rekha site it
has landed on the edge Atika site now it
will search for a particular course
database it will get all the search
result so as you can see there are 10
search results for database now it has
switched to Python there are two results
for Python moving ahead
watch it there are three results for
testing there are six results
then you have Hadoop for which it's
still loading there should be 13 results
as per the test data as you can see
there are 13 results next is Java so you
see in one shot by writing just few
lines of code
I have executed it over the complete
data set that I do have so let us
analyze the test results now if you see
the test one there is one run or and all
of them has passed so these are the
expected titles and the
result set that is whether it has passed
or not so we have written this complete
to a we have written this complete the
result set to a excel file itself so if
you go to the excel file and you go to
the results tab you can see I have the
course title and I have the result
whether the particular hath Coast title
was present on the screen or not so if
you see this is the Python part that is
for Python the as many results whether
it has actually brought up all the
titles and compared it with the data in
my data set so when this data was
matching only then the results were
printed as pass so now the next thing is
how do I modify it so if for tomorrow I
don't want to go for Java I don't want
to check for Java I don't want to check
for a few of the courses so let us see
now if you see in the result set now
there are 34 results ok now we will
modify our data set sorry the courses
tab and we will see if our framework it
goes only through those particular data
sets okay so we will delete these things
ok now we have only two things that is
data base and Python so we will save
this okay
and we'll run the same per script again
so see in less than two minutes I meet
the modifications to my test script and
I am again ready to run it
so now I expect it to only search for
two strings the first one was database
and the second s Python so it has landed
on the ID recog website it should search
for database first it has got ten
results it should search for Python
second and it should end a test case now
because I haven't provided anything into
my data set apart from that as you can
see it has just gone through the two
courses to search strings that is data
base and python and it has brought me
the results so these results they're
more beautiful going to be done back to
my Excel files if you see there is a tab
generated and it has 13 results why
because database at 10 and Python had
three over here so this is the beauty
that you can modify it with in less than
a minute and you can process the
computer you can run the test case again
and again over different sets of data so
now the floor is open for questions you
guys can ask me as many questions you
like I will try to answer them okay so
we have a question that is we are
currently working on selenium grid
plug-in inside Jenkins starting hub and
configure notes inside Jenkins the issue
we face here is when we start the hub
through Jenkins selenium web plug-in
heart try to register the node to
Jenkins hub from remote machine working
in local machine we can fear the face
couldn't register the node unable to
reach the hub please let me know how to
fix the error so guys this webinar is
very specific to data driven framework
so if you have any questions with
respect to the frameworks that will be
great I'll be more than happy to answer
them so we have a question from Vishnu
Vishnu is asking which framework is used
most that is the data driven or the
keyword driven that's what your question
is - okay so Vishnu most of the time
it's the hybrid framework that is used
because this people who know the
application as well as the different
aspects of application they would like
to put it in the form of action keywords
for any newly coming person - just or
even the developers if they want to
write the test so that the test can be
written in just few words into an excel
file so that is the reason we combine
the data driven
and the keyword driven approach making
it a hybrid framework for working so
does that answer your question so we
have a question from Murali Krishna he
says in data-driven framework all
projects are seen you mean to say that
whether the data-driven framework is it
seemed for all the projects that's one
that's what you mean by this question
mullah Krishna okay no see it depends
upon the need of your application it
depends upon how much volume of data you
are handling it depends upon where you
are handling the data so in this
specific scenario I knew that you know I
have to verify the data across different
search text that I'm putting in so I
have a completely separate text or sorry
tab Excel worksheet for putting in my
data okay and that is put in a column
format that is for testing I have put it
in each of each of the rows in under
particular column itself so it depends
on the need of the project it depends
upon the need of your application as to
what exactly you will be doing how to
find the bug in selenium is a very good
question from mullah Krishna
so see you know the expected behavior of
your application if there is any
deviation of the application behavior
from the expected one that is that needs
to be reported as a bug so this is how
if you
script fields you analyze where your
script fields what exactly is the
problem and there you can find the bug
and file it there is another question
from Vishnu Prasad framework design
Handel senior engineer or test lead in
software companies see it's not that
it's always the senior testers or the
Tesla's who will be handling the
framework it's a in Ajay most of the
companies are now going a child and with
agile there is a flexibility for each
one of you each one of the team members
to put in the contributions and you know
give good suggestions so if you have
good suggestions they'll always be
accepted and you will be put to work
okay so there is another question from
Moodle a Krishna he says is there any
issue where I'm assuming is a bug or a
programming mistake so for this whether
it's a programming mistake or whether
it's a bug you need to be very very sure
as to what exactly you are performing
okay
the deviation of application from the
expected behavior is known as a bug
whereas the deviation of your script
from the expected action to be performed
is known as a mistake in the script so
you need to be very sure that your
script is performing as per your as per
whatever is functionally correct and
only then if it is functionally correct
then you can easily identify the bugs
into your system okay so
is another question that is what is the
framework folder structure that is what
do you guys want to know so I'll quickly
walk you through the framework folder
structure so framework folder structure
generally is in the form of packages you
would be forming different packages
inside which you would be grouping your
scripts or data together so if you focus
on this particular area which says
keyword-driven framework okay over here
I have different packages so this column
the demo dot script is my driver is
where I'm keeping my driver script then
I have a configuration package wherein
there are files related to configuration
sorry so whenever I want to I want to
make a configuration a particular
configuration I would have I'd be
accessing the methods or these classes
to get the configuration in place just
like I have courses so what are the
courses that I have put in my excel file
and then the course selector which
course I want to select so all these
things would come from the configuration
then I have my data engine wherein I am
putting the different data so these
actually I am not using I'm just using
this test script dot XLS so here is the
complete data that I am using then I
have my execution engine again it is
very similar to my package that is
called the demo dot script wherein the
execution would start of my script
so actually for that for this demo I
have starting my execution from the demo
or calm the demo dot script package ok
and then there's the utility package so
utility packages used you know to write
down the code which which is very
helpful for you to deal with all other
other system so into this I have put my
code to deal with the excel files with
the help of Apache UI framework so this
is how it goes so does does that give
your IRF idea as to how this will give
okay so guys let us move ahead so now
let us see what ad Eureka has to provide
you so we have a course of force testing
with selenium webdriver wherein we are
covering all the aspects of selenium
webdriver starting from what exactly
selenium is how to install the tool how
to get it working what are the different
flavors we have all the content related
to the flavors as to with the selenium
ID how it works
selenium webdriver selenium RC and
selenium grid how all these things put
together work is covered under the
course then we have advanced usage of
selenium webdriver for the advanced
learner wherein we will be going into
details with the different methods that
selenium is providing and how to utilize
them effectively with respect to code
reuse we also have the course include
the course also includes designing of
keyword driven and data-driven
frameworks in detail and we are along
with that we would be covering the tools
that would help you along with selenium
like Auto IT school II test ng jacoco
that is Java code coverage and all so
the Edit occurs course it contains
master it will help you to master the
software automation testing framework
for web applications using TDD so TDD is
stress driven approach wherein you
develop the test first and then you
develop the code test ng fit is a
framework for writing your test cases
Schooley sakuni which is a tool for
dealing with desktop and web
applications at the same time and jacoco
is a tool for Java code coverage so we
will be covering this all together we
have a live online class which runs for
30 hours so you would be having 30 hours
of theory and you have assignments for
20 hours so
20 hours of practical work and also
project which would run for 20 hours you
would have once you register with Ed
Eureka you would have lifetime access to
24/7 support whether you can raise your
tickets with respect to any of the
issues you are facing you will be
provided with live chat option and
export technical members who would
assist you with your query so with this
we come to the end of the webinar I hope
you guys have enjoyed this webinar you
have got to learn something from this
and you'd surely like to see you on
board is an edu rekha we have a batch
for testing with selenium webdriver
starting on 21st of November so if you
guys you guys can visit the ID reg a
page that is WWE record Co testing with
selenium webdriver wherein you would get
all the details about the batch and what
are the course contents also this batch
is a weekend batch which would typically
run in the morning or evening depending
upon the timeslot and you have three
hours of class for each Saturday and
Sunday which would mean the five weekend
badge covering 30 hours of your theory
and all the time you have the support so
that if you are facing any of the issues
with your assignment you can get back to
us we have a question from Vishnu with
respect to certification yes
Vishnu we have a project work which we
will once on completion of the project
successfully you will be provided a
certificate from edge Erica which you
can directly add to your LinkedIn
profile so why you need to complete your
project work you need to submit the
project and once your project gives out
you can attach your certificate directly
to your LinkedIn profile
so that's all for today guys thank you
for joining it was great to have you
guys on board thank you for attending
this webinar and you guys were fantastic
audience you had great questions I hope
I have answered them all thank you
