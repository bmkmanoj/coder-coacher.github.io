welcome to this session on Google cloud
platform today in this session we are
going to discuss about what Google cloud
platform is and what are its various
services all right so let's go ahead and
start with the agenda to see what all
we'll be covering in today's session so
we'll start this session by first
discussing what is cloud computing and
then move on to discuss the various
cloud providers which are out there is
providing with the cloud computing
service right after that we are going to
pick one of these cloud providers which
is Google cloud platform and discuss its
various services after that I'm going to
teach you guys water regions and water
zones and how it is related to Google
cloud platform and towards the end we'll
be doing our hands-on where then we'll
be deploying a first server in the
Google cloud platform console all right
so guys this is our agenda for today I
hope it's clear to you so without
wasting any time let's move on and start
with the first topic of today's
discussion which is what is cloud
computing so cloud computing is the use
of remote servers on the Internet to
stall to manage and process data or
rather than doing it on your own servers
or computers all right basically you're
doing storage you're doing processing
and you're doing managing of data on
somebody else's server that is you're
renting servers from a cloud provider
and you're doing these tasks on those
servers rather than using them or doing
them on your own computers or servers
this is what the cloud computing model
is all about now this cloud computing
model this business model is actually
given to you by a lot of companies right
a lot of companies gives you the cloud
computing service these companies are
called the cloud providers now let's
look at the various cloud providers is
it out there in the market right now so
you have AWS your Google platform your
Microsoft Azure IBM cloud ash lotion
Rackspace VMware math and try it right
now among these the top three cloud
providers are Amazon Web Services
then you have the Google cloud platform
and then the Microsoft Azure
right but why are we learning about
Google cloud platform today so let's
share the light in that now I'm pretty
sure most of you guys must have used
over not each of these services every
day in your life right Google search I'm
be sure that even a 14 year old or a 12
year old was just introduced to the
Internet the first thing he went to do
is to is google.com right then we have
YouTube we have Gmail your Google Drive
organizers hangouts etc there are a host
of services that Google asked for water
but what is the point my point is that
you know even for checking the internet
what do you know most of the people they
just type in google.com to check if
their internet is working or not now
what might be the thinking around this
the thinking around this is you're
assuming that Google will work if the
Internet is working you would never
assume that Google will not be working
isn't that something weird right because
Google itself is a service right and you
know it's managed by humans and humans
they tend to make mistakes but still we
always assume that Google Website will
always be up and running so much so that
we check an internet connection by going
to google.com now what if I told you
guys that the technology behind
google.com and the technology behind who
will search is actually or the
infrastructure behind it Google search
is actually will cloud platform isn't it
awesome and they're giving the same
client kind of platform the same kind of
infrastructure to each and every
customer who signs up for Google's our
platform right so for your application
you will get the same infrastructure as
who will search as YouTube as Gmail and
drive or any other service then who will
have to offer Google serves each and
every service of theirs from their own
cloud platform right and that is the
reason and I think I can I cannot
convince you more as to why you can rely
on Google cloud platform for their own
applications as well right so Google
cloud platform was launched recently I
think around 2012 and since then it's
been growing it's been it's been the
growth rate has been off the roof or lot
a lot more and more companies are
actually adopting Google to our platform
as they're moving their applications on
to the cloud right and if you see the
you know if you you just have to guru
indeed.com and you just search for you
know the cloud engineers who should know
GCP you will happy whole picture in
front of you
so this is this is these are some of the
reasons that you should use the Google
cloud platform moving on let's now
discuss what we'll talk platform is all
about and the video source it has to
offer for us right
so Google cloud platform is like I said
it's a cloud service offered by Google
right and it gives you a suit of cloud
computing services such as compute such
as storage such as networking and you
can use all these services for your own
application for the needs of your own
application to host it right and you
know like I said some of the products
that are already there on Google
platform are search then you have
YouTube and you know it speaks a lot you
know service as awesome as YouTube or as
or some little Google search it speaks a
lot as to what kind of infrastructure
they're offering so this is what Google
cloud platform is all about now Google
cloud platform has a lot of services
that it has to offer us so these
services has been divided under domains
now what are the different domains that
you have you have compute you have
storage you have networking and you have
some other domains as well but the main
do means that you have in Google cloud
platform or you know the main domains
which will basically can who which can
basically host any kind of application
that you can imagine is compute to
storage and there's networking using
these domains you can create an
infrastructure for any kind of
application right now before moving
further let me quickly show you the
Google Cloud console and how you can
sign up for it right so let me quickly
go to my browser and for going to move
your Google Cloud console you only have
to do is type in cloud.google.com all
right over here then you have to choose
an account which is basically you know
has your sound credentials and then you
have to click on console and then you
will be here at your console now how can
you sign up for this console let me shed
light on that as well so like I said
just go to cloud.google.com right and
over here you will have an option for
try it free now when you say try it free
so
flower has an amazing option called the
free do so under the free tier you
basically get three hundred dollars
worth of credit which are valid for one
whole year right and you can use these
credits to basically deploy any kind of
service on Google cloud and you will be
basically using it for free until unless
you exhaust your $300 credit right and
I'm pretty sure that you won't be
exhausting it until and unless you use
it for your business because the most
basic computer on Google cloud is you
know it's I think it's one V CPU and
with one gig ram and the price of that
cpu or whether the price of the system
is as low as 0.05 dollars and are right
so I'm pretty sure there's $300 both of
critics is not going to go anywhere so
you can be less assured that you know
you can use it for learning Google cloud
platform and knowing about period
service and launching and this is what
we are going to do in the further
sessions as well so like I said for
signing up for Google cloud platform all
you have to do is click on try it free
once you click on try it free or you the
next page is going to give you this
Simon login page where you have to just
put in your gmail ID or your Google
accounts ID right so let me put in my
Google accounts ID so it's Haman's
shady 9 for Gmail calm once I do that
I'll click on next
last for my password so let me give my
password over here I click on next right
it will ask me a 2-step verification let
me enable it and it's done right so once
you enable it the next screen is
basically going to show you this page
let it load alright so over here you
just have to fill in the details you
know if you want to update from Google
you can click on probably yes if you
don't want them you can click on no then
you have to agree to their terms and
conditions and then click on agree and
continue
right the next page is going to
basically ask you what kind of account
type are you looking at this is the
business or individual now since you
we'll be you know learning GCP and all
you have to do is you know you want to
do demos of books out platform your ex
you'd probably go with the individual
type then you have to fill in the tax
information right so if you are
registered individual or an unregistered
individual so probably you just click on
unregistered individual you you know you
can give you a pan details which are
optional over here once you do that you
will have to have to enter your address
details over here and then the how you
pay now don't worry you won't be charged
anything you know if we're seeing this
option so the time when the $300 credit
option expire that is when when your
credit expires you will be prompted
whether you want to enable the billing
option if you enable the billing option
manually only then you will be charged
for the services that you'll be using
henceforth on our platform otherwise you
will not be charged even if your three
hundred dollar credit is over all right
so over here you will have to give your
car details so just enter your car
details and click on start my feet trial
and the next page is basically just
point you I'm going to ask you for the
verification of your card and once you
do that you was said you are you have
will be ended up on so that $300 credit
will be waiting for you
all right so I've already created in
accountants and here it is right this is
basically the console that will be taken
at so once you're at this console you
can probably explore the various
services that Google Cloud has to offer
us
you have the cloud launcher you have
billing MAPI is in services what we are
interested in is these services right so
we are interested in compute we are
interested in storage and we are
interested in networking right you have
other services as well that are there
from muji or platforms such as
monitoring where in basically you can
monitor the servers that you have just
launched you can see if all of them are
running finally the status and health
checks and a host of other services as
well that will be discussing the further
sessions but today like I said let's
just discuss about networking storage
and compute which are the main domains
that will be used
for washing your own application right
let me come back to the slides and then
probably we can discuss each of these
domains in detail right so let's talk
about the computer domain first so the
computer main has four kind of services
it has a compute engine it has the app
engine it has the Kuban ities engine and
then you have cloud functions so what is
the compute engine so compute engine is
nothing but a raw server so if you buy a
new server what is the first thing that
you do you install an operating system
on it right and that operating system is
basically of your choice you choose
between Linux or Windows and then you
choose between the versions and then you
say ok so this is the kind of operating
system that I want to own show on my
server install it and once you have
installed it you can sort for the
software's to make it a web server or
you know if you are you going to use it
for environment of work at here you can
probably use it for that as well or for
some other purpose you just have to
install the necessary softwares and it
become that right same is the case with
compute engine as well so once you click
on compute engine you will click on
words and machines you will choose the
kind of operating system then you won't
install on you so you know you will
choose kind of configuration that you
want for this how much gigs of RAM do
you need how much of CPU do we need
right and all of that so once you click
on create you will have a Ross over at
an end which has installed the choice of
operating system that you wanted which
is of the desired configuration that you
wanted and now you can install any kind
of software on the server and is ready
to use right this is what compute engine
is all about the next kind of service
that is there is called the App Engine
right the App Engine and cloud functions
is basically an extension of what
compute engine is right an app engine is
basically used for a web server
configuration whenever you have an
application which you want to deploy on
the cloud you can use the App Engine
offering from Google cloud right so what
what happens in the App Engine is you
don't have to configure you don't have
to choose the kind of configuration that
you want for your system you don't have
to look into the installation of the
software's
which will be required for your web
server you just choose ok so math I want
this particular was and I want this
particular software to be installed or
this particular stack to be installed it
will be automatically installed and you
will not be given the access to the
operating system just a button which
says upload all right you will upload
your application on to this server and
everything will happen on automatic your
website will be deployed automatically
and you don't have to configure anything
on the system henceforth right so if you
compare it with compute engine say you
want to deploy a PHP application you
would have to install first the Apache
server then you get after install the
PHP server if your application was using
MySQL you would have to install the PHP
MySQL extension nobody thinks it's built
right but when App Engine you don't have
to configure anything you just have to
say ok so on I'll be using the PHP
configuration you choose that option you
click on create and a server is created
for you you don't have to specify where
you have to store the website just click
on upload and upload your website and
then required file whatever files are
there for your website just upload them
as it is and it'll be deployed you will
be given a link and on that link your
website will be look for it
automatically this is what the app
engine is all about now when you talk
about cloud functions it is the use or
in the as you know it is again a
platform as a service that is we don't
get the access to the operating system
but with cloud functions you do not host
an application it is exactly the same as
happens it but the use is different in
the scene that like I said you do not
use it to host an application or you do
not use to deploy an application or you
use the curve function list for the
back-end processing for example your
application there is a video processing
application all right what may your
application you use is something like
this the user uploads video and that
video is basically you know processed
first and it might be converted into a
different format and then it is stored
on the cloud right so first the website
is boosted so on that website you upload
a video but that processing of that
video can be done by a cloud functions
that's a back-end processing kind of
thing right so that processing need not
be done on the App Engine it can be done
on cloud functions and why will you do
it on cloud functions first it becomes a
distributed computing of architecture
wherein you know even if your website is
down the processing will never stop if
your processing is down probably you can
deploy one more server with the same
configuration with the same code and it
will do the job for you so you don't
rely on one server for everything right
which will basically have a website
ocean as well which is also doing a
back-end processing this will make the
server slow in a couple of as more and
more users log on to it so every kind of
architecture that you create you have to
make it as distributed as possible the
database should be on some other server
the processing should happen in some
other server the main thing that is
there for an app engine is and it should
only host your website if you want to do
the processing do it on some other
servers and this server would be known
as cloud functions so with cloud
functions of 10 years you only have to
give the code for the back end
processing and that is it you just give
the code and it will automatically see
what kind of you know machine it has to
use depending on the workload so if your
workload increases if automatically
scale it up to a different size of
servers or a different configuration of
servers so that it can be done in the
minimum time possible and this is what
our functions is all about all right
then you have the Kuban IDs in general
what is the Kuban it is engine it's
probably the most interesting service of
them all now if you have applications
which are running inside containers
inside docker containers and you want to
deploy the docker container on cloud you
can use the humanities engine for that
container house alright so all you have
to do is you have to migrate your
container on to the cloud and that
container will be deployed on the server
as if it has been deployed
locally all right and this is what
humanities engine is all about or the
next to mean that we have is the storage
domain so in the storage domain
basically use two things there are a
host of things that you can store let's
discuss them one by one the first kind
of service that is there and storage
domain is called the datastore service
so the data store service is basically
an OC
kind of service in which you can solve
no sequel kind of data no sequel data
means unstructured data right so
whenever your application wants a
storage location which is for
unstructured kind of data - location you
can probably store it in a data store
which is a no sequel database right and
datastore and BigTable both us use for
no sequel kind of real or unstructured
data but the thing with BigTable is you
use it with harue application or you use
it with big data applications right so
BigTable can be integrated with HBase
and you can use HBase with you know to
dump its data onto BigTable and will do
it perfectly so that is the only
difference between data store and
BigTable the next service that you have
is called storage service which is
basically used for storage all right so
it's a filesystem which is offered by
Google cloud so any kind of application
or any kind of file that you want to
upload and cloud you can upload it on
these storage domain so it's just like
Google Drive that you use these days
right you have any application you have
a video application you have a PPT you
have a doc anything that you are
uploading can be uploaded on the storage
file system offered by Google Cloud now
how is it different than Google drivers
they use Google Drive as a console yeah
right you use it for uploading it on it
directly but if you have applications
which want to store their data or which
you want to store your files somewhere
rather than storing on a server like I
said I have as create an architecture
which is as distributed as possible so
why not store it somewhere else where
the data is more secure right so your
application can upload the files to a
different location which is that is a
different file system and that file
system is basically this storage service
that is offered by moonflower
all right then you have a service called
SQL which is basically as you might have
guessed for structured data so whenever
your application one is dealing with
databases which is structured in nature
you can use the SQL service from Google
cloud now there is one more service
which is exactly the same
as a square which is called spanner but
the difference between sqn in spanner is
scalability so SQL cannot be scaled
horizontally right
it is only spanner which can be scared
horizontally as well so when if your
application is if your application needs
scaling as well as part of its use that
is you don't know the come out of usage
you know when will it be heavily used or
will it be likely used or the kind of
users which are coming onto your website
very a load to roll today
you can probably use the spanner service
from the storage domain so this is the
worth of storage domain guys moving on
you have the networking domain now so
inside the input domain again you have
three kind of services you have VPC
network you have network services and
then you have interconnects all right so
the VPC network is basically a cloud
network that is given by google cloud
right so if you have two servers that
you have deployed on Google from if you
have two VMs that you have the platter
of Google Cloud and you want these two
VMs to talk to each other basically they
have to be included inside one network
or they have to be included inside one
VPC right so it's a virtual network
which is created around these two
servers so now they can talk all right
and this is what the VPC network will
all board it's a virtual private cloud
that you can create around any kind of
instances that you've launched and we
will all right then you have networking
services so like what I'll do is I'll
just quickly go to the console so I can
show you guys here what these services
are all about all right so we were
discussing the VPC network so like I
said we PC networks are watching private
clouds that you can deploy around your
instances and without these networks you
cannot deploy next so any instance that
you are deploying any server that you
are they probably will have a V PC
network surrounding it all right and
there are different properties
associated with a V PC network you have
like I said we PC network so with this
option you can probably deploy a V PC
network then you have external IP
addresses you can configure if any
specific IP address you want then there
are firewall rules in the sense that
what kind of if you probably want to
connect from your computer if you want
to SSH into your server so for SSH into
your servers you have to enable the
firewall rule of allowing your IP
address to connect to that server using
the SSH protocol so that is what you
configure under the firewall rules then
there are round tables you can configure
the route tables in the networking part
as well you can also do network peering
you can also share that via PC with some
other server as well right so all of
these is possible using the V PC network
then you have networking services which
have services like load balancing which
have said you know domain name servers
and cloud delivery networks what is load
balancing if you have three servers and
if you want traffic to be distributed
among these three servers depending on
you know what kind of application it is
so there are two kinds of load balancers
basically so if you want there are
application load balancers and there's
one classic load balancer so one of the
network to be distributed equally among
servers you would go ahead and use a
classic load balancer if you want the
network to be distributed based on the
request that the user is making for
example if he is asking for you know
stories upload he will direct you to
some other server if he's asking for
video processing he will process you
know direct you to some other server
this is alright then you have cloud DNS
which is basically used for naming
services in the sense if you have an IP
address so your your servers I'm having
an IP address now you will never find a
website which is you know working on an
IP address or in its addresses give you
gives you an IP address stuff so you
always have a domain name that is a
domain name in something like google.com
or ad array cannot cout so you go to
this domain name and it is pointed to
that server all right so this routing of
the domain name to the IP address and to
the server is actually what is done or
configured inside the cloud DNS then
there is a service called cloud CDN
which basically means content delivery
network so inside content delivery
network
you can basically you know create a copy
of your server to a nearer location to
the user for example if I in India I
want to access google.com the servers
would be obviously be in the US right so
if I try to access the Google debase so
the time taken by the server is
responding in the US and compared to the
time taken by the servers which are in
India the servers in the US would
obviously take more time to respond
right because the distance is more so if
you want to solve this kind of problem
where in your application is hosted in
only one region now you know it's push
it in somewhere remotely in some other
country and the user base is in some
other country you can probably go ahead
and use cloud CDN what it does is it
catches your website on to a server
which is existing nearer to the user
right and whenever that user is making a
request for the website it is actually
served from the nearest server that is
to the user this basically it decreases
latency drastically and it basically
improves the user experience it improves
the fluency of your website and that is
why you use cloud CDN then you have
something called as interconnect so
interconnect is basically used if you
want to connect servers which are on
trim that aren't from ice to the servers
which are there on your Google cloud
platform and if you want to include them
in the same network you'd probably use
this service to do that which will
basically create a VPN a virtual private
network with the servers on Google Cloud
and then you can access those servers as
if it was on your own company Network
right and this is was what
interconnected over the pound let me
quickly show you the storage domain and
again so datastore has again four kind
of options it has in this subcategory it
has entities it has indexes it has
admins or entities and indexes are
basically used to identify a particular
record inside no sequel database we will
learn about them as we go in detail
about what datastore is and then we talk
about storage you have something called
as browser which is basically used to
browse files on the storage whatever
files are uploaded if you
upload files manually onto the storage
storage service you can probably use the
browser service to basically see what
kind of files are there in the storage
account that you have created if you
want to transfer the files you can you
know if you want to transfer the file
from from some online community for
example you have some files in AWS cloud
in the s3 bucket and you want to
transfer those files into your your
storage service in Google Cloud you'd
probably use the transfer service with
that right and if you file the too large
to be transferred via Internet you can
use the transfer appliance option for
that what transfer appliances is
basically a device and Google sends you
to your location you can upload your
files through this particular device and
they will ship it back to Google
headquarters where your server is and
they will upload the files manually over
there right this is particularly helpful
if you find the too large to be you know
transferred on the Internet and probably
this process or this way of France you
know getting the appliance transferring
the files over there and then setting it
back to the Google infrastructure would
be faster in those cases you will use
the transfer appliance and this is all
about the services that we were to
discuss today guys so we discussed
photos this various services and compute
will discuss the various services
storage and we'll also discuss the media
services and so today this session since
it's an introductory session let me
quickly show you guys how you can deploy
your first sword on the Google cloud
platform so all I have to do is I will
be pointing to compute engine and I'll
be going on to VM instances once I go on
to VM instances guys now the first thing
that I have to do is to create a project
once I create a project inside this
project I will be deploying the various
servers that I want right so the first
time then you log in they'll have no
project configured so this is the screen
that you will see so you will create a
project and let's name the project as my
project only and let's click on create
alright now this will create a project
for us and once it is created we can go
inside this project and we can create a
force over respect all right and mind
you guys you will not be charged for it
because
the credits that he just got will be
used for deploying these servers right
so you won't be charged it is all
covered under the freeter alright so
once the project is created guys you can
quickly quickly click on create and you
will be taken to the screen wherein you
will have the options or where you'll be
configuring you are so well your first
server that you want to deploy right so
over here you can name your instance
something so let's name it as anyway -
demo all right now so once you configure
the name the next thing that you have to
configure other zones so over here will
be choosing in which region and in which
zone do you want to create your
instances what are regions water zones
let's have quickly have a look at it
alright so regions are basically you
know you can imagine them as continents
and when you say zones you can basically
imagine them as countries alright so
this is just an abstract level of
understanding this is something this is
not what it is exactly is so but
basically just understand what it is is
this way alright so inside a region you
have multiple zones and regions are
basically one chunk of country or one
chunk of continent where the server's
are deployed alright now why are these
huge so whenever you have application
that you have deployed and to basically
protect your application from any
downtime from you know which can be
caused by any natural disasters which
occur in any kind of region for example
if you are you know if your servers are
hosted somewhere in the Bay Area where
in their sea
tomorrow is some flood comes in so there
is a probability that you know your data
centers power might go off right and you
know if a tornado comes in or if any
earthquake comes in and the data data
centers building collapses you don't
want your application to go down at any
time right so you always have a backup
in some other data center as well which
will have the exact copy of your
application in some other server alright
and for the same exact reasons then we
have regions and we have zone so for
example you create a replication you
know when you create a backup introduced
as well so for example
your region is us yes and inside us you
say ok so one part of my application is
in u.s. East one sea and one part of my
application is in u.s. East one B so
what one C and one we basically mean
this that there are two data centers in
that region and these data centers are
basically zones and you have deployed an
application in those two data centers
all right so now if you want to be
double sure about it that you know your
application is still not safe you feel
that your application should not see if
you can actually deploy a third copy of
your application as well in some other
region for example you chose to deploy
it in u.s. you can now choose to deploy
your application as in Asia right this
is one of the reasons that you would
want your application to be deployed in
some other region the other reason for
that could be that you know you when
your application is being used worldwide
right so if your application is being
used worldwide for example you have you
know a domain called Google dot and you
have a domain called google.fr dot-eu
what are the domain basically mean this
basically means that for each region
they have a Google search product why do
we have different who uses products
probably because we have different
server for each product which is
connected to a central server but my
point is that all these servers are in
the respective countries or in the
respective regions of where their
audiences right so for the same exact
regions if you want your application to
be hosted in different regions you can
use the region option from configuration
of the servers and this is my region and
zones are basically used right so
similarly if you want to choose you zone
or a region over here you can choose
from the available options you can
choose whether you want your application
to be deployed in Asia you can choose
within Australia Europe South America
Cubase etc right so let's for now let's
choose let's choose Asia East one be
alright and then what is the
configuration that you want for your
machine do you want more number of CPUs
so when you say one vcp you basically
mean 3.75 gb memory right and it will
have
processor if you use to be CPUs it will
have 7.5 GB of memory and two units of
CPU fuse four units of CPU around with
that you get 15 GB of memory so you can
choose what kind of workload you are
dealing with and accordingly choose a
server over here of the desired capacity
all right so let's choose the minimum of
them all because this is a demo alright
and this is it once you choose the
configuration that you want the next
thing that you would want to choose is
the kind of operating system that you
want to deploy in your so now when you
want to deploy the kind of operating
system you will just have to click on
change and you will have the own list of
the operating system which is available
on GCP to deploy with all right so you
can choose the Linux Linux OS you can
choose Center ways you can choose Ubuntu
you also have red hat you have SUSE
Linux you have Windows alright this
choose the kind of operating system that
you want and click on slip and that is
it
alright so let's let's choose the Ubuntu
server hazards now and let's click on
select all right so once you've chosen
the kind of operating system that you
want the service account right so this
is something that you don't have to
stress yourself about right now we will
discuss me in detail what this is and
probably in the future sessions for now
let's leave it at default and the
firewall so if you are hosting a website
if you want to watch a website on your
server you can probably check on Ehlo
HTTP traffic and an AW HTTP traffic
which is basically a lot of people world
by to connect to your server if there is
a website hosted on it
alright also let's see at the Advanced
Options what is there so basically what
I'm going to show you where are the SSH
keys so what is SH keys it's basically a
way of authentication like you have
usernames and passwords you have SSH
keys as well so when you talk about SSH
key is these are basically public
private key pairs all right so one key
is there with the you know within GCP
people that is the Google cloud platform
people and one key will be with you
right so when you are authenticating
yourself with the instance basically you
have to show your key and
check out the key which is there with
the Google people if the key matches you
will be authorized inside your so
alright so there are basically two ways
that you can create your SSH key with
right you can create your own key that
is you can provide their own key to
Google if you want one or you can you
don't just use the default key that
Google is providing if you use a good
default key you will not get the key
that you guys would be using from your
site in that case you would be probably
just authenticating using the Google
console what is the Google console the
goal console is basically this so if you
want to connect to your server you can
probably use the browser option of SSH
right which you basically SSH you into
the server of your choice of others that
you have deployed not using any
third-party tools such as putty but if
you want to use a tool like putty any
third-party tool to basically connect an
accessor server you would be basically
you be using this particular tool and
then let's put it and forth in that case
you have to create your own custom piece
all right
so how to create your own custom key you
can usually we'll probably be using a
software called footage ends so just
click on footage N and to be open for
you right so this is the footage in
software now what you have to do is you
have to generate a new key right so you
will click on generate and you will just
drag your mouse over here for randomness
and your key will be created alright so
once you have created your Keeler's all
you have to do is click on save private
key and once you click on save your
private key to ask you whether if you
want to not create a password for it you
will just click on yes and it will save
your file on thee on your computer so
you just choose location where you wanna
store it so I just saw it on the desktop
and let me name it as Google cloud dot P
became alright so it will now save your
file in the PP key extension format and
you are set right the next thing that
you have to do is this is
this is basically the content of your
files right so you will click on key
comment and you will enter the name of
your user they'll cut the user that you
want on your system so let's say I want
the user Kamath right I'll type in Hemet
over here and I'll have all the contents
of the key here I'll just copy the
content and I will paste it here alright
that is all you have to do and let me
save it one more time because I think
the user didn't get saved so I'll again
click on save private key and let me
save it with the same name that was
Google Cloud and let me overwrite it
alright so my key has now been saved
let's click on close now because
everything is set here and let's click
on create right so it will now create my
first double - instance on the Google
cloud and there is notice the time that
it takes it will hardly take 30 seconds
for yourself to be deployed on your
Google cloud platform as you see it's
not even 30 seconds took out 20 seconds
to deploy the server and it's now up and
running it's ready to be used so all you
have to do now is use this external IP
address I will just copy this IP address
and open the putti software
I put the IP address over here go to se
says good word browse it you know choose
the key that I saved on desktop which
was Google Cloud or PPK and then click
on open so it will now ask for the user
name so the user name is hemant it's the
same name that you gave in the key
comment alright just hit enter and you
will be able to access the Ubuntu server
that you have just deployed on Google so
congratulations for your first server on
Google clock now this is just one way of
connecting to your server values you
have one more way to connect to your
server and that way is by clicking on
SSH so once you click on SSH everything
will happen automatically there is no
authentication required it will
automatically send the key to Google for
verification and once that has been
verified you will get the same console
as you got in the putty you know
software over here so let's wait for it
it is
in a connection and as you can see my
connection has been successfully been
created and my server has been deployed
on it and I can now use use it as if I
was using it on my own
terminal alright so this is web version
of the putty to use you know if you want
to know if you don't want to use the
third-party tool if you just want to use
the web interface this is probably the
option for you alright and this is it
this probably should do it guys and with
this we come to an end to our session
right so thank you guys for attending
today's session I hope you guys learned
something new today now you know in the
further sessions I would want you to be
prepared with this fashion session first
