today we'll learn how to install bake in
your single node hollow glass door in
case you haven't set up Hadoop already
please visit the Hadoop installation
video earlier in the playlist
let's first download the big package
from the internet since Pig is free we
can just download from Apaches website
as then go to batch epic releases I can
go to download download release now so
folks we have all these releases
available ok so I have downloaded take
0.16 point zero this is one of the most
recent versions this is about 100 MB and
let me show you where I have downloaded
this in my system ok so the pig package
you see here right this is the
downloaded tar file since this is a tar
file we need to first extract the
contents and we can do that by running a
command from our terminal and the
command is car - xvf and file name
there we go folks take it successfully
installed let me go to my home directory
and this down the contents so this was a
big package which we downloaded and pic
is installed here so this folder
contains all of Pigs files what we need
to do next is we need to update the
environment variables with pigs location
so for that purpose we have to go to our
home directory and now let me open the
dot bash RC file which contains all the
environment variables the command is G
edit dot bash RC okay so this no path
set for pig ok
I have my Pig paths here I'm going to
copy it and paste it here so my pig is
installed in this directory and the bin
folder inside my pig directory is again
here so I save it and exit we can start
pig by going to our grant shell and we
can just give the command bij
so folks our big ranch ellas opened this
means that pig has been installed in
your system thank you for watching the
