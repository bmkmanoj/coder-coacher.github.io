talking about animation alright so here
is one of the more important topics in
android application so android supports
two kinds of animation one is the frame
animation and the second one is the
Queen animation so whenever I talk about
the frame animation alright so a frame
animation is one which is driven by a
series of frames
right a series of frames is drawn one
after the other at regular intervals
okay
Pradeep yes which code do you want are
the one that we are covering in today's
class we'll be sending you an email with
the link to the video as well as to the
coding examples to be all right so I was
telling you about the frame animation so
same animation is a series of frames
which are drawn one after the other at
regular intervals so frame work by frame
animation is handled by the animation
drawable class so this is the class that
handles the frame animation let's take
an example for this so if I talk about a
frame animation what I need is first of
all I need an active ray alright so my
frame animation activity extends the
activity here I have a few objects
alright one is the image view so if I go
onto the Declaration of the activity
layout here you can see so here I have a
linear layout sorry I have a relative
layout here and under the relative
layout I have just placed an image view
you can see that this is the relative
layout and I have at present and under
this I have an image view if I just show
you where the image view is so this is
the place we have the image view is you
can see that right so this is the where
place where image views now in the
activity what I am doing is I am
creating an image view get the instance
of the image view and here
I'm sitting as the background resource
imageview what I'm setting as the
background resources the animation list
so you can see I have placed a drawable
even if I go on to the resources friable
here I have an animation list not
example if I open this up you can see a
lot many operat objects here you can see
an animation list so it has like the
opening and closing tags to the
animation list and we here we have
various tribals all right so if I just
go onto the drawable hdpi folder get all
those tribals here I'll tell you how
exactly the frame animation works
alright so here I go I go to my desktop
and I say images do a control V here and
if I go on to show you every item here
alright so this can this is like I'm
containing 32 images here now let me
show you how exactly the frame animation
works so the way I am doing it the same
way is utilized by Android
what I'm doing is I'm just changing the
images and you can see an animation
working up can you all see that so the
changing that I am doing manually with
the next press of the button here will
be done with the help of the frame
animation select close here and I go on
to the activity and this activity I have
a set of drawables so these are the
drawables that I have already placed
these drivers are frames in motion all
right now here we have one shortfalls
that means the frame animation will go
on and on I just show it to you by
running it up
here is my main activity and you can see
the frame animation working up and since
the one shot equal to false it again
starts again going into the loop if I
say one shot equal to true and I said it
to true that's correct like the Jeff
foils there are three if I said it true
it will just run up single time now it
will just run up one time and it won't
be repeating again and now it will just
stop and let me tell you one more
interesting fact about this here we have
used a duration attribute right so the
duration between the change of frames it
is presently 200 so let's change it up
200 and see the animation working up a
lot more faster so I replace them all
once I do that to our run as and now the
animation will be a lot quicker
I didn't see that it has a lot quicker
now all right so let me just tell you a
few things sir can anybody tell me why
is frame animations not the preferred
mode of usage of animations can anybody
think about it can you all just respond
back on to the chat window I do not use
frame animations much
ACEF says because we have to create
images first
I'm just asking Legree what I'm asking
is that as an as a developer I won't be
using the frame animation at all
can you think of the possible reasons
while I why I won't be using the frame
animation at all that's correct
aasif very good very good very good
point that you made here so can you just
elaborate more on under the dime its
efficiency no that's not that is not
something pradeep witches of much I
would say which is much lacking or say
would give you are degraded performance
that's not the case too deep I need some
responses from everyone even if they are
wrong I don't care even if you are wrong
it's all fine at least you should try up
why I won't be using a frame animation
why as a developer I would be reluctant
to use a frame animation
I need responses from everyone chevre
sagar everyone ahead loss of memory no
space because primary mission is not to
make flash alright so I'll tell you the
reason why I will be using a frame
animation first of all is first of all
the reason would be I will be actually
meeting all the images that are in a
frame or are in a motion first of all
that is something that I have to take
care so as a as a UI designer my task
gets increased secondly just to make
yourself a frame an animation I am using
around 632 images which is again not an
intensive operation right and the third
one could be because the frame animation
is actually whenever the window has
booked because if you would have seen
here you can see the window has focus
alright but what if I do not have the
focus on the element then what then I
cannot also use the frame animation so
these are the few factors which actually
make us not use the frame animation at
all I hope everybody understands the
factors that I have told you all right
so then if we cannot use the frame
animation what we should go for yes then
we will be going for the tween animation
alright so I'll just close this up has
everybody understood how the frame
animation works any person having any
doubts in this particular sample you can
respond back on to the chat window then
we'll be taking these two a green
animation from
I hope this is clear to everyone can you
all quickly respond back onto the chat
window all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
