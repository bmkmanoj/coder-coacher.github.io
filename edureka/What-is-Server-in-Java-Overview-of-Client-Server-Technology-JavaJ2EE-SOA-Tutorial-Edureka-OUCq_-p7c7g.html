Internet is basically you know he'd use
this tcp/ip protocol right so in a
client's of the technology right the
client sends the request to the server
the server if it has a detailed process
it otherwise it looks for the data
required data in the data means and
response back to the client server and
server will perform the necessary
information and respond back to the
claim this is the clients of a
technology okay it's a question for you
right what can you give me a practical
example of a client-server technology
and one printer can be connected to many
computers the splinters will print from
all the computers when requested for now
if you look at a web technology if you
look at a web technology client sends
the request in this server and like you
know on the internet server processing
and response back to the client
now if you look at the web technology
example that is amazon.com
anyway shopping website or anywhere like
in a banking application anything is a
web technology now if you look at like
you know the internet server basically
you have a client or your browser then
you have internet from there it connects
to the server and responds back now
again the same thing in a different way
right from the browser the client gets
requests to the server it processes and
responds server is response back to the
browser now let's look at the different
kind of a servers we have right so there
are two kinds of a service one is a web
server another one is an application
server
a web server basically what it does is
it takes the requests around the request
to the particular program right it's
like you know you go to an office there
you will find a receptionist and he or
she will like you know route to guide
you to the correct person
right that's all web server is like a
receptionist application server is
basically it does much more than that
it's an application server is map server
plus some more facilities like load
balancing that is if I have a huge
amount of requests like you know some
10,000 a million requests are coming out
for a web server for a website then if
you use only one system it will be like
you know it will be difficult to manage
because the performance will go on 1
million requests at the same time the
performance of the system will
definitely go down in that case what you
have to do is you have to distribute ok
the application into so many things
ok so many machine that will balance it
like you know maybe 10 first 10 requests
in one system second 10 requests in the
second system 10 requests like that it
uses round-robin technique to another as
I then said there is something called
connection tool it ok connection pooling
is basically you have 10 resources
somebody requests for it one resource is
given the resource pool will have 9
resources if somebody else are asked for
it one more resource is given 8
resources are left over in the resource
pool then like you know somebody this
done with the job they will return it
back to you like you know it then it
will be 9 resources will be left over
now you have one more resource they will
give it back like you know it will
become 10 resources it's a basically
Bank kind of resource pool is like a
bank so you deposit and withdraw deposit
and withdraw that's all is the concept
of connection port there is something
called state management state management
is that
state management is it will store the
state of the user right for example if
you are like you know using using the
shopping cart basically there is
something like you know whatever the
selection you make it usually it should
store on the shopping cart right so
otherwise like you know it'll be
difficult right now there are some more
technologies are provided by the
application server that else ejv
enterprise javabeans is those technology
and another technology TMS Java
messaging service which is not possible
in map server it is only possible in an
application server okay so these are the
needs of differences between the web
server and application server some of
the examples of the web server is is
Internet Information Service and the
Apache Tomcat right then in like
application server you have so many
JBoss is the GlassFish is there right
WebLogic websphere WebLogic websphere so
many things are there it's the major
difference between the web server
application server ok Apache Tomcat is a
web server
okay so Apache Tomcat what it for what
it will do like you know it will keep on
listening for the incoming requests
whenever there is a request then it will
go out to the corresponding program
application server little beyond that
all the three facilities it provides
okay now what Wilson HTTP HTTP stands
for hypertext Transfer Protocol okay it
is on port 80
it's a tcp/ip protocol on port 80 is
HTTP now couple of methods of HTTP you
don't you'll not be using all but you'll
be using only to get and post
you have get head post daily would
please connect so many
so like you know cactus
I'll tell you what is the difference
between get men post so just look at
this light please for 30 seconds now the
difference between gettin posters that
get okay is a display part of URL now if
you look at like you know I forgive you
okay if I type this let's say that's a
charm
so here's part of like you know
google.com you will find as far as the
URL you will find what is type you can
see here you can see what is type that
is a it is going as a get request post
will send the data or a parameter as
part of the request body see what
happens fills okay first the URL will go
then header will go then data will go
okay
so header will have like you know what
is a browser when you have sandwich
protocol it is using all the hidden
information about the browser at like IP
address of the machine and all those
things will go as a part of the header
data is like you know whatever you send
the data from the post method so there
are another ways as the data can be sent
as part of like you know as part of the
URL itself see here the data is going as
part of the URL itself so that is the
get if you know it doesn't go on past
part of the URL then it has post okay
get is used to send the text information
go to posters yeah text early so you
cannot change the binary information
over here that is forget the post you
can set the banner information that is
binary large objects
okay so there is something called do get
do post available in servlets we will
look at those things definitely less
secure than this one
why because see whatever the data you
are sending to the server it is clearly
seen right
hacking becomes easy it is definitely
less secure right whereas the put is no
and like you know it is more secure
basically you are locking in one
application okay
wet banking application you are
providing your user ID and password
correct so in that case what you do is
user ID password so it will definitely
go as a post method because it is easy
right it is like you know it is more
secure it is not your user ID password
will not be seen as part of the URL
right definitely posters much secured
okay so okay next is get URL can be
stored in the browser history the thing
is if you look at this like you know
whatever this if you go to history like
you know browser history so if you go to
history you will be able to see this
website okay so the gate will be part of
the history post will not be part of the
browser history that means what data it
is going you will not be seen as part of
the browser history right so that is
what the get and post differences like
client data needs to be sent to the
server and it is not a huge amount of
data go forget and wherever internet
they like you know I there is a question
for you actually let me see okay now can
you think of one practical scenario
where get and post is required
okay you just look at posters required
like you know when you are entering
sending the confidential data because
your user ID password will not be seen
as part of the URL okay
and so basically for logging information
like user ID password those things for
Gmail we can send it using post and gate
is used in all other cases right
wherever you want to send the data okay
you can send the data
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
