Rekha and in today's session we'll be
focusing on machine learning with Python
so without any further ado let us move
forward and have a look at the agenda
for today
so first we'll see why we need machine
learning we'll focus on various
applications of machine learning and
that will prove how important it is then
we'll see what exactly is machine
learning and we'll focus on various
steps involved in machine learning after
that we'll see various types of machine
learning namely supervised learning
then comes unsupervised learning I'll be
giving you an example of both so are we
all clear with the agenda kindly give me
a quick confirmation by writing down on
the chat box or if you have any doubts
you can ask me
they wanted all clear so does Janice
Theon Jason I usually jog Athena huh or
I find guys so I've got a confirmation
from almost everyone so let us move
forward and we'll see why you need
machine learning so as I've told you
earlier as well we'll be looking at
various applications of machine learning
so the first is imagine if you need some
kind of a navigation on Mars or deep
ocean where humans cannot actually go
there so at that time you require your
machine to automatically adapt itself
towards that sort of an environment all
right so this is one of the example
where machine learning is very very
important now let us see one of the
other applications of machine learning
so the second application is
recommending a product to buyers so if
you have noticed that when you visit
Amazon or flip card so based on your
previous history of purchase as well as
search list they recommend you certain
products in this case these are watches
so if a customer has actually purchased
these many watches and he actually
searched for these kind of watches as
well so with the help of machine
learning there'll be certain watches
that will be recommended for you so this
is actually done by machine learning now
let us see one of the other applications
so the third application is basically
analyzing huge sensor data and then
predicting the outcome example in
weather forecasting so at that time what
happens as you can see in your diagram
is well if there's a guy who's giving
the weather forecast for the day so
basically these kind of calculations are
not possible manually so you need your
machine to actually do these kind of a
calculation so this is another use of
machine learning now let us see what are
the other uses I have given you only
three very common applications of
machine learning although there are many
more applications of machine learning
but I just wanted to prove a point that
how important machine learning is so I
hope you are not clear with the
importance of machine learning if you
have any doubts with respect to any of
the things that we have discussed and
now you can ask me
so Theon is clear so is Jason geography
Nia or at fine guys so our confirmation
from everyone let us move forward and
see what exactly is machine learning
so basically machine learning algorithms
allows us to build self learning
machines that evolves by itself without
being explicitly programmed now based on
user behavior data patterns and past
experience it makes important future
decisions and I consider it personally
as a descendant of artificial
intelligence so this is basically what
machine learning exactly is now machine
learning finds its application in
various speeds it can be used for data
mining natural language processing image
recognition etc there is a huge list of
applications of machine learning so I
hope you all are clear with what exactly
is machine learning if you have any
doubts or questions you can ask me Devon
says he's clear or so is Dinesh Janis T
on Jason Java 3 Nia you see or it fine
guys so let us move forward and see what
is various steps in order to implement
machine learning so these are basically
general steps that I'll be focusing on
so these are the steps that are involved
in machine learning so we start with
collecting your data because you cannot
actually train your machine without data
so you need to provide certain data you
connect that data and then you clean it
so in this stage you actually make sure
that your data has all useful fields so
there are no other useless feeds that
you don't actually require it can be
certain columns or anything basically
after that you analyze your data that is
you perform certain analysis on it now
you can take the example of e-commerce
website so over there what happens
whatever things you search or whatever
your past purchase history is there
right so it makes certain analysis on
that suppose if you're searching watches
right so it will make the analysis that
what kind of watches that you are
searching you might be searching for
Smart Watch or you might be actually
searching for a Rolex if you can afford
that so basically it will be analyzing
all those things and then what happens
is train the algorithm based on that
analysis right after that it will test
the algorithm how it is going to test by
providing certain set of data they know
the actual output and they are going to
test whether the algorithm gives us the
output which is equal to the actual
output and then finally you use it so
these are basically the general steps
that are involved in machine learning so
if you have any doubts till here you can
ask me or if you have no doubts you can
give me a conservation so that I can
move forward
so Chianti is cleared so does I usually
Java T or if I got a confirmation from
almost everyone now let us move forward
and see what are the various types of
machine learning
now basically there are two types of
machine learning techniques one is
supervised and another is unsupervised
learning so if you're training your
machine learning tasks for every input
with corresponding target it is called a
supervised learning and after that your
machine will be able to provide Target
or any new input after sufficient
training so if you have provided your
machine with sufficient data it will
actually able to provide you with the
target for any new input now you can
consider the example of supervised
learning and marketing where you segment
your customers so that you can determine
what our customers are high-priority and
what our customers you can give low
priority now when we talk about
unsupervised learning if your training
your machine learning task only with a
set of inputs not all inputs it is
called as unsupervised learning and
after that the machine will be able to
find the structure or relationships
between different inputs so this is what
basically supervised learning and
unsupervised learning is so if you have
any doubts or any questions you can ask
me and if you want me to lower down my
pace I can do that as well any doubts
any questions you can ask me or if you
are clear with it just give me a thumbs
up so that I can move forward and see
what are the steps involved in
supervised learning all right Leon says
he is clear so is judge the Ru she or it
fine I've got a confirmation from almost
everyone
these are the steps involved in
supervised learning so first step is
training and the second is testing now
basically what happens you have a data
you divide it into two parts you divide
it into training data and then test data
so with that training data you actually
provide it to your algorithm and train
your algorithm on the basis of that data
after that you create a model now you
have test data as well so with the help
of that test data you determine the
accuracy you use that test data and you
actually see what will be the outcome of
your algorithm so if that outcome
matches with the test data then the
accuracy is high so this is how you
basically check your accuracy so there
are only two steps guys training and
testing you have data you divide it into
two parts
training data test data with the help of
training data you actually help your
algorithm to learn then you create a
model and with the help of test data you
determine the accuracy pretty basic so
if you have any doubts or questions you
can ask me all right so there are no
doubts let us move forward and we'll see
one example of supervised learning
so this is the example of supervised
learning which is called a KNN that is
nothing but k nearest neighbor so the
model for canaan is the entire training
data set so when a prediction is
required for a unseen data the Kanan
algorithm will search through the
training data set for the k most similar
data instances the prediction attribute
of the most similar instances is
summarized and returned as a prediction
for the unseen instance so let me
explain you KN an algorithm of the help
of an example so you have a data set
regarding movies and you want to train
your machine such that whenever you give
an input that is whenever you give a
movie name so it is able to predict what
genre it belongs to it can be an action
movie or it can be a romantic movie as
well so let us move forward and see how
it happens so we have these many movies
in the list so based on this data we
actually train our algorithm and then
when we provide a random movie then it
will actually predict that what kind of
a movie it is whether it is action movie
or a romantic movie now how we train our
data we train our data with the help of
two columns others number of cakes and
number of kisses so the movie with
larger number of cases will be a
romantic movie the movie with larger
number of cakes will be an action movie
all right
so what we do is the movie that we want
to predict the genre off we find the
Euclidean distance between that movie
with all the other movies that are there
in the list so first we need to find the
Euclidean distance between California
men and cakes so how we do that let me
show you I will open my calculator and I
will show you how we do that so before
that let me first write in a pen and
show you what formula that we are going
to use so basically we are going to find
the square root of x2 minus x1
whole square
Plus
why to
- why one whole square
where you can consider x2 and x1 as
number of kisses in the movie that we
want to find a genre off and California
men or the other instances and then y2
minus y1 similarly will be kisses so
let's go ahead and find the Euclidean
distance first what I'm going to do is
I'm going to find the difference between
the number of cakes between California
men in the movie that we want to find a
genre off
three - 18 then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to find square of that it will
be 225 all right so let me write
somewhere 225
now we are going to repeat that same for
number of kisses
so 104 - 90 square of that will be
around 196 it is 196 so now we are going
to add both of them so 196 plus 225 421
what is the square root of that is
twenty point five so this is how you
actually find the Euclidean distance so
this is basically what you are going to
do that with every movie all the movies
that are there in your data so first you
find it for California men and then
similarly you will find it for other
data instances as well
now after finding you here in distance
we actually got to know that that movie
is closest to which particular movie in
my data and accordingly my machine will
predict that what genre it belongs to
now over here you can see that we have a
graph in which we have number of kisses
as Y axis a number of cakes in the movie
as x axis now because of that we saw
that it is actually pretty much close to
he's not really introduced in beautiful
women but when we talk about action
movies like Kevin long blade and Robo
Slayer it is pretty far so what which
one will it belong to guys I want the
answer from you all so all of them says
romantic genre this is absolutely
correct so this is all actually Karen
algorithm work and this will be an
assignment for you all guys you can find
the data set in your elements and you
need to perform this particular analysis
that I've shown you all you need to
perform the training of your particular
algorithm in such a way that whenever
some new movie comes it is actually able
to predict that with genre it belongs to
for today's session I'm going to take a
different example and I'm going to
execute that practically so for that
first I will open my charm so this is
the code that I'm going to use in order
to perform the knn algorithm now let me
tell you what data set we are performing
on this algorithm so this is basically
IRS classification so before I explain
is the code let me tell you about the
data that we are going to perform
machine learning on so it is an iris
data basically the problem is comprised
of 150 observation of iris flowers from
three different species there are four
measurements of given flowers sepal
length sepal width petal length and
petal width all in the same unit of
center
now the predicted attribute is the
species like which species it is which
is one of setosa versicolor or virginica
now it is a standard data set where the
species is known for all the instances
so basically what we are going to do is
we are going to split our data into a
training data set and test data set and
we are going to use the results to
evaluate our algorithm implementation so
a good classification accuracy on this
problem is above 90% correct typically
96 percent or better all right so now
let me explain you the code over here I
have actually divides the code into six
parts first is handle data then comes
similarity neighbors response accuracy
and win so let me explain you one by one
so what happens in handle data the first
thing we need to do is is to load our
data file and my data file is present in
the text format without a header line or
any codes so we can open the file with
the open function and read the data
lines using the reader function in the
CSV module after that what I'm going to
do I'm going to split to my data set
into a training data set and into a test
data set so with the training data set
the KNN can use to make predictions and
the test data set can be used to
evaluate the accuracy of the model but
before doing that we need to first
convert the flower measures that were
loaded are strings into numbers that we
can work with and as I've told you
earlier is where I'm going to split my
data into training data set and the test
dataset and the ratio will be 67 is 233
now for that what I have done I have
defined a function that is a load data
set now you don't need to worry much
about the code this code will be
uploaded into your element so you can go
through it and since you understand all
the basics of Python so this won't be a
tough task for you so but the logic that
I told you is same with this function
now what is our next step in order to
make predictions we need to calculate
the similarity between any two given
data instances this is needed so that we
can locate the Kay most similar data
instances in the training data set for a
given member of the test data set and in
turn make up prediction
so basically what we can do is we can
locate the K most similar data in the
training data set for a given at member
of test data set after that we can make
predictions given that all four flower
measurements are numeric and have the
same units we can directly use the
Euclidean formula and as I've told you
earlier as well how you clear in formula
works and it is actually defined as the
square root of the sum of squared
differences between any two arrays of
numbers that is nothing but you can in
this sense enough told you earlier as
well additionally what we want to do is
we want to control which field to
include in the distance calculation
specifically we only want to include the
first four attributes which are a
separate length sepal width petal length
and width one approach is to limit the
Euclidean distance to a fixed length and
we are actually going to ignore the
final dimension so how we do that this
Euclidean function that is there is used
for that purpose once we have located
the most similar neighbors for a test
instance now that we have a similarity
measure we can use it to collect the K
most similar instances for a given
unseen instance so if any instance is
provided to your algorithm we need to
collect the K most similar instances for
that particular instance all right so
this is a pretty straightforward process
of calculating the distance for all
instances and selecting a subset with
the smallest distance values now for
that what we are going to use we are
going to use this get neighbor function
that is present here now after that once
we have located the most similar
neighbors for a test instance the next
task is to devise a predicted response
based on those neighbors so we can do
this by allowing each neighbor to vote
for their class attribute and take the
majority would ask the prediction
so whatever /p she gets the majority
would we will consider that as our
prediction so for that I have defined a
function or a method that is get
response so we have all the pieces of
the KN algorithm in place now one
important remaining concern is how to
evaluate the accuracy of predictions
can't even tell me how to find the
accuracy how accurate our algorithm is
how to find that all right so
one says we can do that by finding the
ratio between the correct predictions
and the incorrect predictions which is
absolutely correct so an easy way to
value the accuracy of a model is
actually to calculate the ratio of the
total correct predictions out of all the
predictions made call the classification
accuracy how we do that we do that with
the help of this particular function
which is get accuracy after that we need
to define a male function and this main
function what I am doing I am actually
passing certain values for example I am
loading this particular data set then I
am going to print the train set length
of the test data set then predictions
all those things and finally print
accuracy now let us go ahead and execute
this and see if it works
all right so it has worked and we can
see that the accuracy is around 96
percent which is very very good now over
here it has made many predictions with
the test dataset so we have 99 data
instances for training data set and 50
data instances for test data set now
this is nothing but the predicted value
and this is the actual value of that
member of test data set all right so
this is how you basically perform knn
algorithm and as I've told you earlier
as well you'll be given one data set
about the movie then you need to find
the genre of the movie so that should be
there in your elements you can find it
and use kanan algorithm in order to do
that now what I'll do I'll go back to my
slides and we are going to see some
example of unsupervised learning now
this is an example of unsupervised
learning we have a clustering problem
now what exactly is clustering so
basically you have data and you divide
that data into two classes so your motto
of dividing that data is to make sure
that you have high intraclass similarity
that is the members of one class should
have very high similarity that means
they should be pretty much similar and
the other motor will be you should have
a low inter class similarity that means
the similarity between class one and
class two for this instance should be
very very less they should be very
dissimilar that's what clustering is all
about now let us move forward so this is
just an example of clustering over here
what happens you have students and
teachers so now you divide them and you
have one class of students and you have
one class of teachers this is basically
what Slough string is now let us see how
to implement it k-means clustering
algorithm so k-means is one of the
simplest unsupervised learning
algorithms that solve the very
well-known clustering problem we have
discussed that in the previous slides
the procedure follows a simple and easy
way to classify a given dataset through
a certain number of clusters and in our
case we are going to assume K clusters
now the main idea is to define K centers
one for each cluster and these centers
should be placed in a very smart way and
the best thing is to place them as much
as possible far away from each other
because we have seen that we need to
form clusters which are very dissimilar
to each other now let me explain in this
algorithm with the help of
those are that is there in front of your
screen now you first decide the number
of clusters as to how many clusters
should be formed then you pick a
centroid you pick any random point as a
century then you find the distance of
each of the point with that a centroid
and then you form the groups based on
the minimum distances after that you see
whether the centroid has converged or
not if yes then you end it over there
that means your clusters are formed that
means you have like cake clusters
available with you which are pretty much
be similar to each other and then if it
is false then it will again find new
centroid and repeat the whole process
now let me explain you this with the
help of a pen now suppose you have some
random points like this
all right and you choose your centroid
somewhere here right and you have one
more centroid so basically we our K
value is 2 and we are forming two
clusters now what happens you find the
distance from the centroid
to each point you find all these
distances for the centroid as well
and then you find the minimum distance
whether this point is closer to this
centroid or this point is closer to this
centroid and on that basis you form a
cluster so if this is a cluster for this
centroid and this is a cluster for this
century
now what happens you find a mean
distance between the centroid and the
point so it will be somewhere here for
it it will be somewhere here here and
then again you form one cluster
similarly you keep on repeating this
process until your centroid converges
and when it has converged that means you
have formed your cluster successfully
this is our clustering algorithm works
guys I hope I'm clear any doubts you
have regarding how it works any
questions all right so we have no
questions right now this is one example
that I've given here now over here we
have actually formed two clusters one
have low income and high balance and one
cluster belongs to the class which have
high income and low balance so this is
one cluster and this is one cluster we
are going to execute this k-means
clustering algorithm practically in the
next session by this we come to the end
of today's session if you have any
questions or doubts you can ask me any
questions guys Janet says amazing
session Thank You Janet for those kind
words I usually say is very informative
thank you are you sheep any questions
guys you have alright so no questions so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
give you a quick recap of what all
things we have discussed in today's
session so first we saw why we need
machine learning we saw various
applications of machine learning then we
understood what exactly is machine
learning and then we saw various types
of machine learning namely supervised
and unsupervised learning we focus on
supervised learning and we saw how to
implement care and algorithm then we saw
an example of unsupervised learning that
is clustering for that what algorithm we
were using we were using k-means so this
is what all things we have discussed in
