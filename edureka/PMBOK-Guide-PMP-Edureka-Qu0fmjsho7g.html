discrete version of project management
body of knowledge and it exists
corresponding application area knowledge
general management skills and
interpersonal skills so what is p.m.
bucket it is essentially a standard the
it is one of the things that you need to
understand is PM bokade birthing you
talk about one particular methodology
methodology like a jail and pins two and
so on are different than p.m. Bookman
takes a little bit you know higher level
overview in which it proposes 47
processes which are the which are
supposed to be the best practices in the
project management that needs to be
applied for the project to be successful
all the time this p.m. bucket is
published by the VMA and inputs it takes
inputs from practitioners and academics
happening how this okay it is a digital
version we saw the body of knowledge it
coexist with Carol this is very
important would go into this
corresponding applicant so there is a
overlap between what PMO guide is going
to say with respect to your application
area novice your general management
skill and interpersonal skills so they
are not something exclusive to each
other like they are not standing alone
so if you draw a few circles they are in
intersecting with each other and
definitely there will be certain overlap
with respect to application area general
management skills and interpersonal
skills which is required to get your PM
mob-related 47 processes so they don't
they don't perform
standalone basis
this claim is essentially organized into
three sections the project management
framework which includes essentially
introduction I mean admin project
lifecycle and organizational includes
these few chapters then standard for a
project management of a project which
includes PI process group I pick
initiation planning execution
Mauritanian control and flows then
project management processes or a
project 47 process so you will see that
there are a lot of planning related
processes and essentially there are a
lot of initiation closing execution but
mostly you see more processes in
planning execution and monitoring and
control so these three will have a
bigger chunk of processes then you have
worked enema a distinct knowledge alias
so right from integration cost time to
school till your stakeholder management
so these are all are your ten different
knowledge a so these three numbers you
need to you'll you'll remember by the
end of this course itself five processes
47 processes and ten distinct and even
you know this cook session itself you
remember shouldn't see a problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
