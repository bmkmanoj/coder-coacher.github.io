HBase or to use HBase way to use a Swiss
Swiss architecture and multiple ways of
learning design to HP in HBase so
problem in real world the problem in
real world like one of the few things
that you saw in hive where you can see
other other models like if the data
grows large and you want to access the
data in real time hive and other systems
does not does not load quickly so like
in Twitter and LinkedIn and definitely I
do a lot of data and especially when
your data size goes to millions and
billions you cannot access to your data
in real time using technologies like
hive and empower or Impala might work
however Peak or MapReduce so HBase is
defined develop on top of HDFS but it's
architecture is totally different but
you have to keep in mind that it uses
HDFS for storage and and it's it's used
to for two purpose most of time in your
industry when when you are want your
data to be real time like real time
means when you query your data you
should be able to read your data within
seconds and when you want to update the
data or or make some updates you should
be able to do that within seconds so but
for very very very large data so the in
those cases HBase is used and at the end
of this session we'll try to design a
database for something like Facebook or
LinkedIn pretty common use case
so we'll see how we can do that and how
things will work so in most of these
cases that we saw what is common use
data fast random access did as little
structured and and like even in high we
saw the data was structured
semi-structured at least but the schema
in HBase is variable in hive the schema
was static once yours schema is defined
it doesn't change too quickly but one of
the flexibility in HBase is that schema
you can add columns pretty quickly so in
HBase there is one of the common
commonly you'll hear it supports many
billions of rows and millions of columns
so we'll see how it supports billions of
rows and millions of columns and and
also a need of completion since your
data size is doing pretty large and one
other use case is compression and you
need compression to save some space and
HP support stats and the other important
thing is distribution so one how did we
do distribution in hive basically by
using partitioning right that's siding
starting means partitioning your data
and we saw that how we did that in
height so that partitioning in hive was
manual we had to create partition based
on certain columns and as the data grew
we will do it insert overwrite and using
that column it was creating separate
folders for separate month or whatever
is your partitioning column so it's
basically partitioning your data or
across that but as your data grows you
want a automatic partitioning of your
data you don't want to each time create
a new partition based on a certain
columns so that that's also handled in
HBase your data is as the data so gross
it's automatically handled by H which
you don't have to do anything you don't
have to decide a partition column or
anything like that it's automatically
handled in back-end by H base
so that makes it's pretty useful so
we'll see other use cases like this so
distributed database sorted data we'll
see what is this we'll see a use case at
the end but this is a high-level
classification and on different kind of
no sequel database in HBase is one of
the no sequel database so so the common
examples are like basically you can
divide these no sequel databases in four
groups one is key value store another is
BigTable and other is documented a base
and craft database so in key value store
everything is stored in terms of key
values and BigTable or you can see
BigTable clones is in implementation of
BigTable paper so basically Google
published is BigTable paper and HBase is
one of the implement is enough willis
BigTable paper the other implementation
is cassandra or others are hyper table
so if Cassandra and HBase will be pretty
much very similar I don't know much on
hyper tables so what it should be pretty
much implementation a big table so if
you read if you want to see what is
BigTable paper you can just look it
online and you should be able to find it
it's published by Google research so
these these are basically clones our
implementation open source
implementation of something that Google
published in its research and they have
been using it for indexing web then you
can imagine to index all the web was
really big challenge for Google so
that's a lot of data so definitely HBase
which is implemented in a big table can
handle a lot of data pretty easily the
other is document database so in this
document oriented database
everything is a document and your
storage model is basically document you
store your data into
comment' and set of documents and you
can basically search I find in words or
other other activities YouTube in terms
of document structure and also DB
MongoDB and this all these theorists or
are based on these documents storage
model and the third higher level
structure is graph database and graph
databases used mostly in situations like
Facebook are linked LinkedIn well you
can you want to find the connection and
everything in the crafted abyss
everything becomes age and Nord so you
can imagine a use graph with everything
is connected to everything like in
facebook you have friends and your
friend is again connected to a friend
and then hugging those friends are
connected to friends so basically you
can represent that whole model in terms
of graph and this all of this data in
grab data bits are stored in that model
you can see how scalability and speed is
high for this big table and is less for
graph database but for navigation and
complex queries it's most efficient to
do process using graph database and list
efficient process using key value store
and BigTable comes after R so if you
want to go navigate a part like your
friends and friends and friends and
friends its fastest in graph database
bus slowest in key very stern that's
what it wants to say through this
through this slide now we are officially
on HBase so HBase is sparse sorted map
will see what is sorted map its
distributed it's consistent will see all
of this so distributed means its
distributed across different computers
and that's why it's not balanced and
it's consistent means once you modify
the data it's consistently modified the
data is consistently modified it's not
like it leads you into an intermediate
state and it's multi-dimensional so
we'll see what is top margin diamonds
now we'll also see what sorted map and
we'll also see sparse
mmm in next few slides this is a mystery
of HBase
so it was released BigTable paper that
was in his in 2006 and so how the
country was started in 2007 and then
2008 and 10 and then in finally in 2011
to the point 92 percent effort was oh
sorry HBase was released another good so
this I don't know now
so data model this is a slide that I
want to show you first before anything
so can you all see this data model slide
so there is a concept called column
family in HBase and Andrew key so look
at this site pretty high at high level
excuse me so you can see here name
address name and address can be called
personal data right and birthdate and
gender can be called demographic so when
you create a table in HBase you create
column family and under that column bam
you have list of columns which are
higher QL and that's why it's
multi-dimensional database let's see
we'll go back to swap all the slides
again but I won't
I'm personally like a lot of demos so
that's what I'm going with this light
and then I'll do demo and then we'll
come back to go theoretically so will
that work but for that to work you all
need to understand forwards here from
this slide only then I can go to demo so
one is rocky one is column family and
then call them and
step so rocky zero primarykey so all the
data all the databases has own primary
key right so and there is going to be
only one entry per primary key in any
any database so it's similar in eh bits
as well so these are the tip words that
you have to understand in HBase so any
doubts on Rocky
doubts guys any questions at each other
- other says well Santos
butter okay so can primary compositing
ki be composite yes it can be composite
so Loki's primary key not that is one
level hierarchy it groups multiple
columns so you have a column family and
all the columns that currently you know
in our DBMS Rd p.m. so any sales but
primarily first to a table with us HBase
is a key value pair or do they match so
we'll come back to that question money
but just for now just keep in mind
because I won't I'll just show you demos
and then it will become more clear that
row key is a primary key and it's like a
unique key it's like a key so if you are
thinking in terms of key value pair its
key and your value is your column is
your full row so it's like a hierarchy
so column family is a top hierarchy and
on under column family you can have
multiple columns so here you can see
under personal data these three columns
name address and unser under demography
it is birth date and gender so timestamp
at the end is a time is a time value
when the data was inserted or modified
so yes same key can be used to associate
different column groups so root loci is
like a unique key to access a whole row
of your data it's like a key for the
full row it's like a primary key you can
say it's like a primary key as well this
is always going to be one unique row key
for one entry then column family column
you already know it column but multiple
columns are grouped under one column
family so that's that's the only thing
new thing here in this in this HBase and
then there is timestamp so timestamp is
the time value when the data is inserted
and it's automatically is this value
value is automatically maintained by
HBase so same key can be used to
associate different common groups right
column columns in a column cook can
overlap columns in column group can
overlap right in one column family you
will have one column but now the company
column is I didn't
fight by two things : family and then
name of column it's like a parent-child
relationship so let's say under under
Gupta like let's say Gupta is the title
there is three Gupta in our class let's
assume Manas is also let's say X let's
not take somebody's name Y &amp;amp; Z so this
this GU disk just you can say as a
column family so it's like title so if
you want to identify some specific name
then you have to go full column family
and then the name of the column and then
it should be a value so it's like a
higher kill order so column family
equals Gupta and then column equals x
then value is equal to something so very
cost like you can say Delta if its
column families again Sharma now the
name of the column can be X or something
something Z or R it doesn't matter but
until it falls falls into a separate
column family doesn't matter it's a
separate column so it uses both the
names so it could be comma so we'll see
all these through demo but just keep in
mind that call Rocky is a primary key or
unique key to identify the full row but
now you have one more high V called
column family and everything inside that
column everything inside that column
families are going to call them and then
inside that column you have the values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
