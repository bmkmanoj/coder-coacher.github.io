the most important concept in C which is
arrays so what is an array or why do we
need a days now the program so far that
we've written we have declared a few
variables and we've made use of those
variables but let's say I want to write
a program where I want to store hundred
numbers entered by the user does that
mean I'll go about declaring 100
variables I can go and do that C doesn't
stop me I can go and declare int a 1 a 2
a 3 and so on until 800 and it can store
each number in a separate variable but
then of course with hundred variables
and if you want thousand variables which
is because very difficult to write your
program firstly and then managing those
variables is a much bigger task so C has
a way to declare a large collection of
objects of similar types they call
arrays so let's say I want 100 integers
I can say int variable name in this case
a and then within square brackets I can
say 100 in the example here I have
declared 20 integers so I've in a 20 and
like I said if this is a local variable
they'll all have junk values so I may
want to initialize them in the beginning
itself so I've shown you the example
right here on the slide if I want
initialize them to particular values I
can initialize each one of them to a
separate value so when I say int a of 5
I have 5 integer objects so the first
object or the first variable has a value
for the second object has a value 23 the
third one has 100 and 0 and then minus 1
but let's say I want to initialize all
of them to 0 and if I have like 100
objects I can't go about saying 0 comma
0 is 2 degrees again so I can just say
int a of 100 or event a or int a of 20
equal to 0 now that I've initialized my
adding accessing each element is simple
the first element is a of 0 the second
element is a of 1 so if on ax is the nth
element will be a of n minus 1 now
please remember here in a of 5 has five
elements but if you want to access the
fifth element you'll be accessing a of
four because the numbering starts from
zero so a of 0 is the first element so a
of
four is the last element which is a
fifth element a of five is not a valid
axis you cannot access a of five if your
size of your array is just five so the
size of the array is n you cannot access
a of n you can only access from a of 0
to a of n minus one now let's look at a
simple program to go through these
concepts so I have hash include stdio.h
and int main oh yes I want to have 10
different integers so I can have int a
of 10 and I want to initialize all of
them to 0 initially so I am just going
to say 0 so like I said the first
element here or the first integer is a
of 0 so if I want to store the number 10
in the first integer I can just say a of
0 equal to 10 it's very similar to
accessing normal variables now if I
access all of them what you lined up
doing with arrays is generally user for
loop so let's say I want to accept 10
integers from the user so let's have an
index n time for I equals 0
because has to go from a of 0 to a of 9
so I less than 10 I plus plus so I have
a loop which goes from 0 to 9 all that
we do is ask the user to enter a number
so I can say printf
enter a number scanner
percentage D address of a of I the end
of the for loop so what we do in the for
loop is we have a loop that starts at
zero goes until 9:00
because only until I is less than 10 so
when is I is equal to 10 it comes out of
the for loop
I say scanf and i say address of a of I
so I is initially 0 so it will be a of 0
so what are the number the user enters
first will go into a of 0 the second
number enters will go into a of 1
because I would have become one there
will become a of 2a of 3 automatically
you get 10 numbers in the user and is
storing it in the array
now let's see if we store everything
correctly so you're going to display all
the 10 numbers again on the screen say
printf numbers
again for I equal to 0 I less than 10 I
plus plus printf % HD because to an
integer a of 5 so just the way we needed
a for loop to take input from the user
you again need a for loop to access
every element of the array there is no
way to print an array which is one
single printer statement a printf you
need to pass work in an element you're
printing and we already learn that we
have only a few basic datatypes if I'm
running an integer it's percentage D so
I can pin only one integer at time using
the printf so if I'd open the entire
array I need to put in the for loop and
print one element at a time and that is
what I'm doing here again finally system
pause return 0 let's compile this
program no I'd also warnings let's run
it enter a number I say 1 2 3 4 5 6
let's enter 100 in between 34 56 12 and
there you go it says numbers and it's
printed all the numbers on the same line
why is that so because we missed out or
no backslash n we just print the number
we don't go to the next line so it's
printing all the numbers next to each
other row backslash n now let's compile
and run
let's enter the ten numbers well again
go with one two three four five fifty
five forty four thirty three twenty two
hundred and there you go one two three
four five fifty five forty four thirty
three twenty two one hundred it's in the
exact same order as we entered it so we
printed a of zero first which is one
then a of one to the number two and so
on so a of nine was the number hundred
please remember the size of the array is
ten which means it can store 10 integers
0 to 9 is 10 integers so if you try to
access the a of n element or in this
case a of 10 it can read to a
segmentation fault the ik c compiler
will not give you an error if you try to
access a of 10 but please remember not
to make such mistakes because it will
cause memory corruptions we shall talk
about how later so now we've seen how to
initialize arrays and how to use them
using them is also simple so just like
accessing a single variable you can
access any particular element in the
array if I want to access the fourth
element I would say a of three so that's
simple
now let's look at a memory diagram to
see how arrays exactly work in memory so
let's say this is our memory here now
that you already know if I say int a
because an integer let's assume integer
is going to take up four bytes in memory
is going to allocate four bytes and call
this a now if I say a equal to twenty
he's going to put the number 20 here now
arrays are something similar the only
difference is because we want multiple
objects of the same type is going to
allocate contiguous memory of the same
type so if I say int B of five he's
going to allocate memory for five
integers and they're all going to be
contiguous so you're going to have to
each integer takes up four bytes so for
five integers
he's going to allocate 4 into 5 which is
20 bytes so this entire memory is going
to take up 20 bytes and it's going to
call this B so if I say B of 0 equal to
10 the first 4 bytes you put the number
10 through like 5 different elements can
be stored here so if I say B of 1 equal
to 5 is going to put 5 you so ad is a
simple when I say in B of 5 he's going
to allocate 5 contiguous blocks each
block of size int and then he's going to
call the starting block as B so how does
the program know where B of 2 is it's
simple he knows where B starts although
the program needs to know is where is a
starting address for B he knows B starts
from here from this point if he wants to
access the third element
it's simple which is nothing but B of 2
he knows the first element is right
there where he starts the second element
will be four bytes after the first
element because each element here takes
up four bytes because he knows B is the
type integer so on the second element he
is going to add four bytes to the
starting address here and then go to
that particular block and access the
element if I were one the third element
he adds eight bytes and goes to that
particular element simple so when I
won't be off to basically what he does
is he takes address of B plus the index
which is two into size of int so size of
integers for so if I say 4 into 2 8 8
plus the starting address of B so B
starts over here you add 8 to it if you
add 4 you come here you add 8 you come
here and you have the third element
which is B of 2 because this is the of 0
B of 1 B of 2 B of 3 B of 4 so as you
can see C programs are very simple it
does not need to store a lot of
information within itself like in the
case of a days all he needs to know is
where the address starts to access any
other element this simple arithmetic so
we know that in arrays B of some
particular index is an integer itself so
B of 4 is an integer but what is B alone
if I just say B B is the starting
address B by itself just says where this
array starts and he uses this starting
address to access every other element in
the array
and this is the exact reason why I said
vinner it when I try to access B of 5
the compiler will not give me an error
because the compiler does not matter
what you're trying to access is just
some memory location I can access any
memory location but then you may get a
error when you're running the program
and this is because B of 5 does not
belong to your program until B of 4 is
what belongs to you B of I is the next
block which may belong to some other
variable within your own program
or it may belong to a separate program
by itself so by accessing that and
writing something there you may land up
corrupting somebody else's memory like I
said see simple he does not know the
size of the area Exeter he just knows
where the array starts he does not know
whether his array belongs to you but
when he saw running the program the
operating system knows whether that
particular memory belongs to you or not
so if you try to access a memory that
does not belong to you your program
might just quit with an arrow so let's
come back to this simple program that
we've written now let's see how do we
pass arrays to functions we know how to
pass variables now let's see how do we
pass in adding it's pretty much similar
so let's have a function void because I
don't want the function to return
anything func and it's going to take an
array as a parameter so this function
func or let's call it display the
function display is going to display all
the elements of the array so I say why
display and it's going to take and add
it so I just say this
so now within the function if I want to
display the adding or all the elements
of the array I need an index and I need
a loop for I equal to 0 I less than now
I know they're only ten elements but
then the function actually does not know
whether the nine elements 10 elements
100 elements it has no idea so form if
I'm going to write a generic function I
cannot just guess say how many elements
are there in the array a because the
function display is needs to display the
entire array no matter how many elements
are there let's say next time out
instead of a of 10 I say a of 100 I'm
not going to go about changing the for
loop everywhere right so the simplest
thing to do is pass the number of
elements in the array to so I can say
int now so now I say I less than num I
plus plus say printf % HD /n k off hi
so now that that function is going to do
the displaying part I'd not need the for
loop here instead of for loop how do I
call the function in pass an array I
just say display and I pass the area by
just using the variable I need to pass
in number two so I say a comma 10 so ice
so I'm passing the array a I'm saying it
has ten elements so it's going to
display those ten elements let's compile
this no errors or warnings enter a
number I'm just going to say it's ten
numbers and he's displaying all of them
now let's say in display I say display a
comma five he's going to display just
fine numbers
one two three four five as you can see
there is no way for C compiler to know
how big is the array or how many
elements are there so whenever we're
writing programs we need to take care of
all of that so when I will display the
entire array I have no idea where the
array ends so I need to either
hard-coded saying okay I know in this
case there are ten elements so I could
have had the follow from one to ten or
if I want to write a generic function
which anybody can use
I say passing the array and pass me the
number of elements in the array that you
want to display
I shall display that's what this
function does so passing arrays to
function is simple you just give the add
a name of the variable name and when
you're writing a function which accepts
of array as an argument you just say the
type of the array you just use the
square braces you do not need to specify
any particular size within this because
they can send any added a want of any
size
so now we've learned an important
concept in sequel arrays to have a large
collection of similar objects we define
arrays and we've seen how to use these
arrays how to access each and every
element in the array how to pass an ally
to a function so let's write a simple
program in this program we're going to
find the largest number but our job is
to write just a function you simply
write a function to find the largest
number and I give an added so the ID can
be of any size the array could have 10
elements it could have 20 elements that
should not bother the function largest
the function largest should accept an
array and it should return what is the
largest number let's see how we're going
to do that so let's maintain the same
program we have a function called
display is going to display all the
elements which we may not use in this
program now we have the initial for loop
which is going to accept ten elements
now our job is to write a function
called largest which will return the
largest number so we know it needs to
return integer so we're going to say the
return type is int let's call the
function as largest it's going to take
an array as an input so int let's call
it arr and because dictionary I said
there it could be of any size we need to
know the size of the array to so you're
going to say int num
now let's write the program
so how do we find the largest number
given a set of numbers simplest thing is
first assume the first number is the
largest number after that check every
other number is any given number is
larger than your largest number then you
make that particular number the largest
number so let's have a temporary
variable or let's call it int largest
equal to the first element so I'm going
to say ARR of 0 I cannot call large it
as just zero it's not right to
initialize it to just zero because if I
say large is equal to zero and if the
array AR has only negative numbers then
automatically you will assume 0 is the
largest whereas that array would not
have 0 in its 0 as its objects so we
initialize largest to the first element
which is ARR of 0 now we need to go
through every other element in the array
so we need a for loop for I equal 2 we
already seen the first element so we
need to start from 1 I less than num I
plus plus we need an in time
now what do we need to check when you
check if this particular element is the
first or ARL for one is larger than
largest the largest is equal to a R of
one so if I is one initially right so if
a RR of I is greater than largest then
largest is equal to a R R of I so once
we finish this for loop in the variable
largest we will have the largest number
all we need to do is return the largest
number so you say return largest this
simple right now from main all we need
to do is call the function largest with
the array in R K a and number of
elements is 10 and finally whatever is
returned we need to print it so easy say
printf percentage T say largest n
there we go let's save this program
compiled no errors or warnings run we
need to enter ten numbers I'm just going
to go with one two three four five six
seven eight nine zero the largest is
nine let's try a different example let's
give negative numbers now - one - two -
three - four - five - six - seven -
eight - nine and - 100 the largest would
be minus one you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
