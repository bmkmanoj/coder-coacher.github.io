America and today we'll be discussing
about the Google cloud certifications
now cloud trained professionals are in
high demand and for a good reason
understanding the how of cloud computing
requires broad knowledge across a number
of fields so now before we discuss about
the certification if you want to learn
about the Google cloud platform and the

cloud architect town architects overseas
application and architecture development
in Coward environments including public
cloud private cloud and any hybrid cloud
additionally cloud architects act as a
consultant to the organization and they
need to stay up-to-date to the latest
trends and issues cloud architect's may
also be involved in legal areas of cloud
computing by negotiating contracts and
working alongside legal and procurement
departments architects ensure service
level agreement requirements are met a
professional architect enables
organization to leverage the Google
cloud technologies that this
certification you can design develop and
manage robust scalable and dynamic
solution and admins to application
infrastructure and data solution on the
Google cloud technology now coming on to
the details of this certification exam
the duration of the exam is two hours
and the format is multiple choice
question and multiple select the
registration fee is $200 now you can
start learning with the basic tutorials
and also by practicing on quick labs now

is a company which provides hands-on lab
learning with real time and real
environments it has a tie-up with Google
so you can practice all
and all your real-life scenarios they're
now coming onto the assessment and the
syllabus part of this flower architect
exam we have design and plaid cloud
solution architecture so in this section
of designing and planning a cloud
solution architect one should be good at
designing a solution infrastructure that
meets the business as well as technical
requirements it includes topics such as
business use cases product strategies
cost optimization supporting the
application design some integration and
few trade offs
now that the designing work also comes
with the designing of network storage
and computing resources there are some
topics such as integration of
compromises with multi floor
environments notification of data
storage needs and mapping to storage
system and data flow diagrams now other
key areas include creating a migration
licensing mapping network and management
planning and testing and
proof-of-concept now coming on to this
extent do we have managed and
provisioning cloud solution architecture
now one should be good at configuring
network topologies which include
extending to own promises or hybrid
network extending to a multi cloud
environment some security features you
should know about the data protection
now
other topics include configuring
individuals for storage systems data
storage application data processing and
compute processing security and access
management now coming on to the third
section we have designed for security
and compliance now it includes topics
such as Identity and Access Management
the cloud I am data security penetration
testing separation of duties SOT
security controls designing for legal
compliance and legislation basically
everything that is related security
comes under this session now the fourth
section is analyzing and optimizing
technical as well as business processes
now it includes software development
lifecycle plan continuous integration
and continuous deployment the process of
troubleshooting or post-mortem analysis
structure testing and validation hiatal
enterprises of processes stakeholder
management chain management and decision
making processes now the fifth one is
managing implementation advising
development or operations team to ensure
a successful development of the solution
comes under this
you need application development testing
frameworks data and system migration
tools now coming to the final section we
have ensuring a solution and operations
reliability in this section we have the
monitoring logging and altering of
particular solutions and deployments the
deployment and release management
supporting operational troubleshooting
and evaluating quality control measures
now coming on to our second
certification exam which is the
professional data engineer now data
engineer designs builds maintains and
troubleshoots data processing system
with a particular emphasis on the
security part the reliability falter on
scalability fertility and efficiency of
such system are also handled by a
professional data engine a data engineer
builds massive reservoirs for big data
they develop construct test and maintain
architects such as databases last key
leader processing systems once
continuous pipelines are installed to
and from these huge wheels of filtered
information data scientists can pull
relevant in assets for their analyses
the data engineer also analyzes the data
to gain insight into business outcomes
the statistical model is to support
decision making and create machine
learning models to automate and simplify
the business process a professional data
engineer enables data-driven decisions
making by collecting transforming and
visualizing data the certification exam
follows the same details and the same
patterns that is it is multiple choice
and multiple select it has a duration of
two hours and the examination fee is
$200 now coming on to the assessment and
syllabus part of this professional data
engineer certification first of all we
have the building and maintaining data
structures and databases these includes
future advances in theta technology
changes to business requirements
awareness of current state and how to
migrate the design to a future state
some data modeling trade-offs and schema
design the second part is designing data
processing systems now the
responsibilities included in this
section are batch and streaming
deployment transformation acquiring and
importing data testing and quality
control connecting to a new data source
provisioning resources
monitoring pipelines and adjusting
pipelines the third section is analyzing
data enabling machine learning now this
one is very important in this we have
data collection and labeling create a
visualization dimensionality reduction
data cleansing normalization defining
success metrics feature selection and
engineer a algorithm selection debugging
a model performance and cost
optimization and online dynamic learning
basically everything that a data
scientists or a data analyst through
machine learning comes under the section
now the fourth section is modeling
business processes for analysis and
optimization now the responsibilities
include mapping business requirements to
