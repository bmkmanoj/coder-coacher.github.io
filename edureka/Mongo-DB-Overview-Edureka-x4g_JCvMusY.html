now we understood concept behind no
secret of evocation also we understood
how many type of categories are theirs
and then we saw what all benefits is
there we compared with relational
systems so now let's understand mongodb
know so we know MongoDB is an open
source database and it is being kept up
by a changer engine is our company it is
an agile database that allows a schema
to change quickly as application rolls
so as I said it gives you a dynamic
istomin i will show you how it provides
a dynamic signal how you can create
everything on fly almost of the things
on fly it provides high scalability it
provides high availability it leave Miss
Emma Morley computing which is very very
important point so it gives you faster
region mobile you VA provides native
application and automated physical which
gets you more reliability and
operational flexibility so these are the
things we shall see later with nobody so
how it helps and what's happening
nowadays if you see today's goal every
day we can receive new or kind of
applications or new applications are
being evolved we are following different
different kind of development methods
for example sometimes we are using
waterfall sometimes we are you know
using agile methodology or something
either so in those cases again you
should have some different kind of
system which supports all your
activities if you see about the data
growth nowadays bottom of data is
growing exponentially now different
different kind of architecture you will
have in place you will have to split it
architecture you would have different
different kind of platforms different
also you will see different different
kind of data types use the unstructured
volume of faith is the semi structured
and so on so for those kind of
environments you have to have different
kind of system and that's the region new
ship will are no sequel are big data
solutions can see to the pictures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
