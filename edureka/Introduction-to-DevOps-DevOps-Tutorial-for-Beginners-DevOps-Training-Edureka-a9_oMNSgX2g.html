YouTube channel my name is Sora and
today I'm going to focus on introduction
to divorce so without any further ado
let us move forward and have a look at
the agenda for today so this is what
we'll be discussing today we'll begin by
understanding what exactly is divorce
and how it works we'll also look at
various divorce phases and one of the
various divorce tools available in the
market after that will focus on a couple
of fuse cases of divorce how it can be
implemented into your life and then
finally in the hands-on part I'll show
you how you can prepare a bill pipeline
using Jenkins so let's move forward guys
and understand what is divorce if you
want to know why they've officers
introduced what was the methodology
before divorce you can refer the divorce
tutorial video I'll leave the link in
the description box below so here I'll
be discussing only about DevOps what
exactly it is so divorce is basically a
software development strategy it is not
a tool it is not a technology it is not
a framework it is a methodology and the
aim of this methodology is to bridge the
gap between development team and the
operations team there are lot of
conflicts between the two teams for
example though software works in the
developers laptop but it doesn't work in
the tests or the production environment
similarly the dev team wants agility
whereas the ops team want stability so
there are many other conflicts between
the dev and the off side of the company
which resolve with the help of DevOps
right so what exactly is DevOps
basically it is a software development
strategy and the aim of this strategy is
to bring together to Devon the off side
of the company now this slide basically
tells us about what are the various
phases involved in DevOps and what are
the various tools available for those
phases so the first thing is planning
you get the requirement from the client
you start planning your application
right and once planning is done you
start writing the code now there are
multiple developers who are writing code
for that particular application so you
need a system that can manage the code
for example if I want to go back to the
previous commit how can I do that or if
I want to check the previous version of
the code basically to manage the source
code we have multiple tools like gate
subversion git is a decentralized
version control tool and is preferred by
mostly industries and this is included
in the courses well after that the code
is built now build life cycle includes
lot of things it includes validation of
your application compiling your
application packaging your application
performing unit tests integration tests
those things are done in this face then
what happens the build application is
deployed onto the test servers for
testing and once testing is done it is
deployed onto the prod servers for
release and after that it is
continuously monitored by tools like nag
us in Splunk now let me focus on the
tools which are there so for the build
we have multiple tools like maven and
and Gradle depending on the kind of
application you have you choose the
build tool for Java applications we
usually go for maven then for testing
that is the end user testing or you can
even consider it as functional testing
in this case we use selenium after that
in order to deploy the application onto
the prod servers there are tools like
puppet chef ansible and salsa so puppet
chef Hansel and salsa are tools like
these are called configuration
management tools the major aim is to
provision and deploy your application to
provision your nodes for example in the
test server I might require a particular
software stack maybe a lamp stack right
so I can write scripts using these tools
and can deploy it onto the test servers
as well as in the prod servers so all of
these four tools have a similar
architecture that is a master/slave
architecture in which I can write the
scripts for a particular software stack
in the master and deploy it onto the
notes right so with this we can actually
maintain an accurate historical record
of a previous system State as well so if
I want to roll back to the previous
version of the software stack I can do
that as well because everything is well
documented in the master so it can be a
puppet master it can be a chef master
can be ansible
control machine or it can be a salt
master as well so these are the four
tools that we call configuration
management tools and they play a major
role in divorce now for docker it is
basically a containerization platform so
what I mean by that is you can create a
docker containers which provide the
consistent computing environment
throughout the hdl-c lifecycle plus it
basically containerized is your
application and has a lot of advantages
over virtual machines if you have heard
about micro services so docker is an
ideal environment to have a micro
service architecture right I'll discuss
more about docker in detail later on
currently just understand that it is a
container ization platform now the heart
of devops is this integration phase that
you can notice here and what the most
famous continuous integration tool is
called Jenkins Jenkins has well over
2,500 plug-ins for various development
testing and deployment technologies so
what exactly
is integration here basically
integrating all the stages that you have
seen all the stages whether it's coding
building source code management of
building your application testing it
deploying it monitoring it all of these
phases are integrated with the help of
tools like Jenkins so let me give you a
scenario how we can use Jenkins at the
moment any developer makes a change in
the source code in the shared repository
Jenkins will pull that code and prepare
a build once the build lifecycle is
complete it will deploy that build
application on to the test servers for
testing then it will deploy it onto the
prod servers for release and finally it
will be continuously monitored by tools
like Naga voice which will give the
feedback to Jenkins and it will notify
the concerned teens about it right so
this is how Jenkins work guys this is
one use case that I'm telling you about
and this is basically cut the nest
deployment so this is basically how we
can use Jenkins and DevOps lifecycle now
let's move forward and we'll focus on
how you can implement the verbs in the
real life so we're going to discuss a
couple of examples here so one example
is that you have a source code in the
git repository this is how you are
managing your code you have multiple
developers committing code to the shared
repository several times a day so
Jenkins will pull that code prepare a
build then deploy it onto the test
servers and then finally deploy it onto
the prod servers your tests and prod
servers are configured by tools like
puppet chef and ansible so these tools
the CM configuration management tools
that I'm talking about puppet chef
ansible are really important guys
because they not only maintain the
accurate historical record of your
system state they also ensure that the
computing environment remains same
throughout the software delivery
lifecycle my major aim is to replicate
what is there in a developer's laptop
throughout the software delivery
lifecycle so that I don't face a problem
where the application works finally the
developer but doesn't work well in the
production or in the test environment
right so that's why we use puppet chef
and ansible now let me tell you a very
good example where puppet has actually
saved millions of dollars everyone's
heard about New York Stock Exchange
right so in New York Stock Exchange the
software of a trading terminals was
upgraded with the help of puppet it was
working fine that day but in the next
morning it didn't work properly they
have a lot of bugs with us now with the
help of puppet New York Stock Exchange
was able to roll back to the previous
table version of the surface thought
within 90 minutes people might think
that 90 minutes is a lot but
is not it is actually a success of
configuration management due to which
the New York Stock Exchange was able to
save billions of dollars imagine what
would have happened if the problem would
have continued so this is an example of
DevOps how you can implement it now let
me talk about docket a bit how you can
implement a docker
in DevOps right so these are the two
ways in which you can use docker in the
box so what happens a developer writes
the project code in a docker file for
example a requirement for a micro
service whatever the requirement for the
application is the developer will write
a simple docker file right it's very
easy to write once the docker file is
written we can build docker images from
that and with the docker image we can
build as many containers as we want
now containers are nothing but an
environment where you can run your
application for example if I require a
Linux environment I can run a Linux talk
a container right similarly that depends
on the kind of environment that you what
then what we can do is you can upload
the docker image onto docker hub and
through docker hub various themes Beach
staging or production can pull that
docker image and prepare as many
containers as they want now docker hub
is nothing but I get repository of
docker images now with this architecture
what is the advantage so whatever was
there in the developers laptop I was
able to replicate it in the staging as
well as in the production in one
similarly there is one more way you can
use docker so if you write a complex
requirement for a Microsoft or Cerf I'll
upload that onto the git repository so
from git repository Jenkins can pull
that docker file and build whatever was
there in the developers laptop into
testing staging and production right so
these are the two ways in which you can
use docker in DevOps now let's move
forward and we'll understand a very
interesting topic called continuous
integration containers delivery and
containers deployment I actually noticed
that a lot of people have confusion
behind these three concepts so let me
just clear that out for you and it is
one of the very important concepts in
DevOps
so let me introduce continuous
integration first so the moment any
developer commits a change in the source
code the continuous integration tools
like Jenkins can pull that code prepare
a build ones build is done it can
perform unit and integration testing as
well right till this stage it is called
continuous integration right you are not
deploying your application on to any
server even for testing purpose right
even for functional regression testing
so this is basically integration stage
now what you can do next is
automatically deploys out of the test
environment to perform acceptance
testing or you even call it user
acceptance sua t-test or the end user
testing so once you do that in an
automated fashion it becomes continuous
delivery now continence deployment is
basically deploying your application
after testing into production for
release so continuous deployment is
something which is not a good practice
because even after the end user testing
there might be some checks that you need
to do or you need to market your
application right so there might be
multiple thing that you want to do and
you don't want it to be automatically
released right you wanted to perform a
lot of checks before you release it in
the market so that's why continence
deployment is not a good practice
whereas continence delivery is what
every company tries to achieve nowadays
so I hope I'm clear the moment any
developer commits a code and till the
unit and integration test where your
application is not deployed on to any
server or any environment it is
integration testing once it is deployed
to the test environment for a user
acceptance test it becomes continence
delivery and when it is deploy to
production for release then it becomes
continuous deployment so this is the
difference between continuous
integration delivery and deployment I
hope you have understood it now let's
discuss the DevOps use case so we are
going to implement this use case
practically in today's session so what
we are gonna do we're gonna use Jenkins
to prepare a build pipeline in which
we'll compile the code we'll review it
will perform unit testing we'll package
it and we'll deploy it manually guys
remember that we are going to deploy our
application manually so I will also tell
you how to do it automatically but in
our use case in our practical we are
going to deploy it finally we will be
using Jenkins for this purpose so
there's a source code repository present
in github right so over there a test
cases are already written it is
basically an address book application
it's a java application so I'll be using
maven here and I've already installed
Jenkins in my Auburn - box so you can go
ahead and refer the Jenkins installation
video if you have any difficulties and
installing Jenkins Raich let me just
open my open to machine and I'll show
you there so guys this is now going to
box and over here I've already installed
Jenkins and I've configured it at four
eight zero eight zero and these are the
jobs that I was talking about in the use
case as well first I'm going to compile
the code then I'm going to review it
then perform testing and then finally
package it into an executable format or
in a distributable format let me show
you how you can create a project the
first thing you need to click on new
item
right once you click on your item you'll
be directed to a page something like
this where you need to enter the name of
your project and the type of project so
I've created a freestyle project so all
the jobs that you are seeing here all
the projects are actually freestyle
projects because it is pretty flexible
apart from that there are lot of
features which are there in the other
projects are present in the Freestyle
project is where so let me just quickly
give you a walkthrough of these project
so the first thing is compiled so I'll
just go ahead and click on configure and
I'll show you how I have configured it
the first thing I need to do is give a
name to my project so basically the git
repository with my source code is
present when I click on build up I've
invoked the top-level maven targets so
bavin has this build lifecycle let me
explain you that now a lot of people
think that build only means compile it
doesn't mean that there's the entire
build lifecycle where you can validate
the code where you can compile it test
it basically you can test the compiled
source code using a suitable unit
testing framework and these tests should
not require the code to be packaged or
deployed then you can even package your
application take the compiled code and
package it in a distributer format such
as jars or voids you can verify your
source code you can install a package
and you can finally deploy your
application as well so this is basically
maven build lifecycle and first thing we
are going to do is invoke the compile
phase of the maven build lifecycle just
click on apply and sleep let me go back
to the dashboard and I'm going to show
you the code review project as well let
me go ahead and click on configure and
pretty much the same the name of the
project write the code review then
source code management the basically the
github repository where my code is
present then in the build triggers tab
let me just take you these things so
trigger builds remotely you can use
scripts for that you can build after
other projects or build so I'm going to
build it after that source code is
compiled then I can even click on build
periodically I can click on build when a
change is pushed to the github I can
even pull my source code repository that
is my github repository I can configure
Jenkins to pull the github repository at
regular intervals and if there is any
change then it should pull that change
and prepare a bill for me so here I'm
going to show you how to build a project
and other projects of bid so after
compiling the source code my code will
be reviewed using the PMD analysis so
here also I will invoke the top-level
maven targets now let me explain about
PMD is so it is an extensible cross
language static code analyzer what I
mean by that it basically finds common
programming flaws like
unused variables empty cache blogs and
necessary object creation and so
it basically scans source code in Java
and other languages for potential
problems like possible bugs what can be
possible bugs for example empty try
catch finally switch statements it also
checks for dead code so dead codes are
basically unused local variables
parameters and N and private methods
things like that it also checks for
suboptimal code which is nothing but
wasteful string string buffer usage etc
etc and it also looks for over
complicated expressions if I have to
give you an example think of you know
unnecessary if statements or for loops
that could be actually while loops right
so these are the things that the PMD
analysis report will give us right and
this is where it will be stored post
bill actions tab let me just give you a
walkthrough of this build so here are
multiple options you can execute shell
you can invoke and you can invoke Gradle
scripts right so there are a lot of
things that you can go ahead and check
up I am using invoke top level maven
targets apply and save
so if you want to see the PMD analysis
report I'll just show you I've already
executed this project one so I can see
the lannisters report here so it says
that there is a number of packages then
the number of files present then there
are multiple categories so there are
empty code which are forward unnecessary
r5 and you scored as two then what are
the types of these warnings so we have
let me show you empty cache block there
to empty cache flows in a to empty
finally block and unused private fields
are too and useless parentheses are
fight then let me show you the warnings
these are the various warnings and if
you want to find the details so here you
can find all the details of the warnings
that are present in the report so this
is about the source code review then let
me show you the tests project so let me
just go ahead and click on configure
it's pretty simple guy is pretty basic
what I have done in the other projects
go to source code management tab here
you'll find the repository link builder
guys I'm going to build it once my code
review is done and then I'm going to
invoke the top-level maven target in
which I'll invoke the test phase of my
maven build life cycle let me just go
ahead and up save and apply let me go
back to the dashboard again and I'll
finally show you how I have packaged my
application so I will go and click on
configure and over here you can find
that when you go to source code
management tab you'll find the github
repository link then when you click on
build triggers will be build after other
projects are built and finally in the
top level maven targets I am going to
invoke the package phase of the build
lifecycle of maven this pretty much it
let me go back to the dashboard and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
pipeline view so I'm going to give a
name to my pipeline so let the name of
my pipeline be build pipe right you can
give whatever you name you want I know
it's not a pretty fancy name just click
on OK you'll be redirected to a page
that will basically ask you to configure
your pipeline the way you want it's
pretty self-explanatory just give a name
to your pipeline description how you
want the layout to be so I want compiled
to be my national job then build cards
the number of display so I can just
select any row headers if you want write
column headers currently there are no
header sizes
click on just the build number and the
name refresh frequency is three seconds
just click on apply and ok so my
pipeline is configured now all I have to
do is click on run so the first step is
basically compiling the source code so
you can see that it is executing when
it's yellow in color that means it is
executing so let me just finish this
yeah
so if I click here
I can see the console output as well
so here you can find all the necessary
logs is web
so Mike source code compiling step is
done right combining a source code is
done knot is reviewing the code
similarly if you click here you can find
the necessary logs here right you can
find all the details there after this
unit testing will be performed test
cases are already written in the source
code so yeah you can see that code
review is done now the test project will
be executed
so you can see that it has started
executing the test project and then
after this it'll package my application
into a word file similarly if you click
here you can see the console output or
the necessary logs that you want to see
and they just get over and after every
three seconds it is refreshing so you
can see that my package project is
started
so they started implementing the package
project or you can see that it is yellow
in color that means it is currently
executing it
so you can see here that the logs are
present here you can just have a look
here so let's just wait until it is
executing
so it is done now you can see that my
war file will be created in this
particular directory let me just open my
terminal and show you there as well let
me clear it
so when I go to that particular
directory and hit an LS command I can
find my address book dot war has been
created now I'm going to deploy this war
file on a tomcat server so for that I
need to start the Tomcat server and let
me show you how I can do that first I'll
go to the storm-cat directory let me
clear the terminal yeah I need to change
my directory to tomcat nine now over
here I'll just execute the startup
script startup door Sh
so my tomcat server is running let me
just go to that particular port so I've
configured it on 8,000 localhost port
8000 is my port number where of
configure Tomcat when I click on manager
apps
I'll be directed to at this particular
page and over here all I have to do is
give a context path so let that be Ed
Eureka - war and the directory where it
is present so I'll just write here
address book dot war I'll click on
deploy and finally you will see that my
application has been deployed so Eddie
raker dot war is present
you that it has been deployed now let me
go back to my slides so I hope you have
enjoyed the practical that we have just
executed let me just give you a quick
walkthrough over all things we have done
so we have a source code repository
present in github so I have just used
that repository and with Jenkins I'm
using maven in order to compile the
source code then review it then perform
unit testing and then finally packaging
it and then I have deployed it manually
on a tomcat so right so this is what I
have done and I've used then kids for
this particular a practical so I hope
this session was useful for you guys so
