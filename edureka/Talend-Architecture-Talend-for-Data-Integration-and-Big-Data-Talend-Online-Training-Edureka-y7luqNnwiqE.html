in this session I am going to talk about
talent architecture as you all might
know talent is a software integration
vendor which provides wide range of
software and services without any delay
let's move ahead and see what all topics
are there in today's list so I will
start off by giving you a short brief on
talent followed by its various products
then we will clear up the talent open
studio to see its internal architecture
which makes talent efficient yet
user-friendly finally we will see the
functional architecture of talent
because of which it can identify and
correspond to our various needs so let's
get started but before I talk about
talent architecture you must know what
talent actually is so let me begin by
giving you a short brief on talent as I
have already mentioned talent is an open
source software integration platform
according to the Gartner Magic Quadrant
talent is considered to be global leader
in big data and cloud integration
solutions it provides various software
and services for Big Data cloud
integration data management and many
more not only this the current version
of talent can process the data up to
seven times faster and that too in the
one-fifth of the original cost as
compared to the previous versions on top
of this talent tools act as code
generator that is when you create a job
or a business model at its GUI at the
back end and automatically converts all
the underlying programs in Java and the
best part about talent is that all its
products are considered to be future
proof by future proof I mean panel is
comprised of everything that you might
need today as well as in future to meet
the marketing requirements so it's very
less likely to go out of the market any
time soon and because of this more and
more companies are using talent nowadays
and as a result talent holds up to
nineteen point three percent of total
market share since its original in 2006
and delete it has launched a wide range
of products let's take a look at some of
its main crops so let's begin by
checking out the list of its enterprise
products the enterprise products include
talent tool for
data data integration data preparation
and cloud integration and they're all
licensed you need to buy them before you
can download or use them moving on let's
see it's open source products which are
more popularly known as talent open
Studios there are Vegas Thailand Open
Studios of label like for Big Data video
integration with a preparation metadata
with a quality and ESB finally let's see
the platform's a wheel by talent so time
provide platforms for big data real time
big data
these are preparation MDM either
management cloud integration with the
services metadata manager Hmong all
these products talent open studios are
most popularly used the reason behind
they are free of cost and even can
download and start using it right away
moreover if you like the product you can
go ahead and buy its Enterprise version
which will obviously come with some of
the additional features as compared to
the open source version now that you
have the basic idea of what talent is
and what are the various products a
wheel by talent
let's now take a look at the internal
architecture of the tank open through
use which are most commonly used now if
you see here this is the basic
representation of the thailand open
story it shows how jobs are executed at
the back end as we already know talent
provides an extremely user-friendly GOI
where all we need to do is drag and drop
the components to create a job or a
business model all these jobs and
business models are stored in an XML
format in Thailand open studio now
whenever we execute the jobs they will
be converted into java codes and the
business models will be converted into
polar codes and backing by code
generator I hope this gives you a better
understanding of an open studio so now
let's look at the bigger picture to
check out its functional architecture
talents functions architecture and evils
it to identify the various functions and
then interact and correspond to the
different IP needs if you see here I
have divided the entire architecture
into three functional blocks which are
color-coded let's see the functioning of
each of these blocks one by one the
first block is responsible for the
building and in
fresh off jobs as you can see this block
includes one or more tank openstudio
api's and web browsers from here in
users can easily carry out the jobs like
degeneration leader services and many
more and studio allows the user to work
on any project for which he has the
authorization what I mean is you need a
proper authorization to access any job
from the talent Open Studio or the
talent studios also the end users can
connect to a remotely based
administration center using a secure
HTTP protocol from a web browser moving
on to the next block this block includes
a web-based administration center which
is the application server that is
connected to two shared repositories one
will be based on SVN server and the
other one will be based on DW server the
administration Center enables the
management and administration of all
project the administration Maddalena
like user accounts access rights and
project authorization is stored in dduba
server whereas the project metadata like
jobs business models routines and so on
are stored in the SVN server which makes
it easy to share them between different
end-users the last block is responsible
for the deploying and execution of jobs
now this block represents the execution
servers that run the technical processes
or which we more commonly calling jobs
when our more job service can be
deployed inside your information system
they run the jobs according to the
scheduled time or beat or the events
that are set inside the talent
administration center web application
moreover the in user can easily transfer
any of the job to a remote execution
server directly from the studio so this
is how a job is executed in talent so
with this we come to the end of the
session and talent architecture
hope it was informative thank you and
have a nice day I hope you have enjoyed
