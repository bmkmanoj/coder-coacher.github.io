tarika and the topic for today's
discussion is the google cloud storage
so without any further ado let's go
ahead and have a look at the agenda for
today's session so first we will
understand what is Google Cloud storage
next we'll learn why is Google Cloud
storage necessary and why is it used in
the industry moving forward will see the
various cloud storage services which are
offered by Google and finally we see a
demo on each one of these storage
services one by one so let's understand
what is Google Cloud storage now Google
Cloud storage is a set of various
storage services offered by Google for
different domain scenarios it is a
restful online file storage web service
for storing and accessing data on the
Google's infrastructure Google Cloud
Storage allows worldwide storage and
retrieval of any amount of data at any
time you can use the cloud storage for a
range of scenarios including servicing
website content storing data for
archival and disaster recovery or
distributing large data objects to users
via direct download so let's understand
why we need Google Cloud storage first
of all it has a single API for all
storage classes the Cloud Storage
consistent API latency and speed across
storage glasses simplifies development
integration and reduces code complexity
you can set custom policies to
transition data seamlessly from one
storage class to the next depending on
your cost and availability needs at the
time it is designed for 11 lines of
durability who would Cloud Storage is
designed for 99.99 that are 11 9s annual
durability it stores the data
redundantly with automatic checksum to
ensure data integrity with
multi-regional storage your data is
maintained in geographically distant
locations it is highly scalable and
performant now Google Cloud Storage is
practically infinitely scalable whether
you are supporting a small application
or building a large exabyte scale system
Google Cloud Storage can handle anything
it is strongly consistent
when I write succeeds the latest copy of
the object is guaranteed to be returned
to any ket in globally now coming to the
zero carbon emission you have many
things to consider in the cloud platform
you choose first of all it surprised the
security the openness and of course the
products available now Google believes
you should consider the environment to a
sustainable cloud is not only good for
the environment but also good for your
business by moving storage from a
self-managed data center to GCP the
emission directly associated with the
company's data storage will be zero now
here you can see we have certain users
who use Google cloud platform for the
storage services we have Spotify
coca-cola Evernote Motorola Philips and
many more now let's have a look at the
various Google cloud storage services
provided by Google we have the cloud
storage we have cloud sequel next we
have the BigTable the cloud datastore
and cloud spanner when liquid to the
details of each and every one of these
services in this video so let's get
started with the cloud storage now cloud
store is a scalable fully managed highly
reliable and cost-efficient object or
blob store it really defines what the
industry can expect from online storage
by providing a unified offering across
the availability spectrum from live data
tab by today's most demanding
application to cloud archival solution
near line and quote line it has many
features such as single API across
storage scalable to exabytes of data
very high availability across all
storage classes as we saw earlier that
Spotify was one of the users of the
Google Cloud storage now Spotify uses
Google Cloud Storage for storing and
serving music using regional storage
allowed them to run order transcoding in
Google compute engine closed to protect
storage
now what moveth cloud store is there are
two different methods we have the
console
we have the gsutil tool now console is
provided by Google on the web page or
the web UI itself and gsutil is a set of
commands or tools which are used in the
cloud SDK so let's go ahead and see how
we can work with the Google cloud
storage
first of all you need to login into your
Google cloud platform account I need to
go to the console
in the left hand side in the stool bar
you can see we have the various services
which are the compute storage networking
monitoring and the development tools and
the big data tools so today we'll focus
on the storage services so let's go to
the storage section as you can see here
I have the option to create a bucket so
let's understand what is a bucket the
cloud storage lets you store
unstructured data objects in containers
which are known as buckets you can serve
static data directly from cloud storage
or you can use it to store data for
other Google cloud platform services so
let's go ahead and create a bucket so
first we need to input the bucket name
next we have to select the storage
classes now there are four types of
studies classes which are multi regional
regional near land and coralline out of
these two the multi region a region are
based on the geographic regions whereas
Nearline and coralline are based upon
the usage now multi-regional is used for
the data which is accessed frequently
around the world regional is used for
the data which is accessed frequently in
only one part of the world coming on to
Neil and encode line Neil n is best
suited for the data which is accessed
less than once per month that means you
can access it maximum once per month now
cold line is best used for the data
which is accessed less than once per
year so now I am going to select the
regional storage class next we have to
select the regional location
and step on the create but and
in seconds your bucket will be created
as you can see that there is nothing
inside this bucket here you can directly
drop your files here from your PC or
your laptop and you have the option to
upload files upload a folder or create a
folder
let me just upload one file
within seconds the file is uploaded and
it's shown here now that you have seen
how to create a bucket and upload a file
the same can be implemented using the
gsutil commands for that we need to
download the cloud SDK now cloud SDK can
be downloaded from Google Tappin on the
first page and you'll be redirected to
this page now you can install it for
windows mac OS linux or other operating
systems i have already downloaded so
i'll just fire up the cloud education
now just to create a bucket all you need
to do is type in the command gsutil mb
which is make bucket - c which stands
for the class the storage class which I
am going to select as regional - L
stands for location and - P which stands
for the project ID and finally you have
to input the name of the bucket
for project ID you can refer to the my
first project or whatever your project
just copy your ID from here
paste it and then finally you need to
input the name of the bucket
so now to list the buckets all you need
to type in is gsutil LS
as you can see we have two buckets which
is a troika bucket and the edge rekha
bucket - the same will be reflected on
the website itself
as you can see her Erica bucket - is
also here now to list the contents of a
bucket you need to tap in the commands
gsutil LS - R and the name of the bucket
so as you guys saw earlier that I
uploaded an image to the first bucket
which I created I do rake a bucket
select my list the contents of that one
as you can see it's showing me the image
which I uploaded now to delete a bucket
we have an easy command of gsutil RM - R
and the name of the bucket
Here I am deleting the second bucket I
created and after that will list the
buckets to see whether it was deleted or
not
the steam will be reflected on the
website
you fish this bait
as you can see we have only one bucket
which is the a Judaica bucket so now
let's go ahead with cloud sequel now
cloud sequel is a fully managed database
service that makes it easy to set up
maintain managed and administered
relational my sequel opposed CRE sequel
database in the cloud the cloud sequel
offers high performance scalability and
convenience precision on the Google
cloud platform the cloud sequel provides
a database infrastructure for
application running anywhere it is fully
managed for CRE sequel database service
and my sequel database service the data
is encrypted when stored in the database
table now cloud sequel can be integrated
with other services such as App Engine
the compute engine and external services
via the external IP now let's go ahead
and see how we can work with the cloud
sequel
go to the taskbar on the left-hand side
tap on the sequel button and here you
will be asked to create an instance
which will be our sequel instance to
step on the button here you have the
option to choose between my sequel and
postgre sequel the pasta is equal is in
beta format so I'll select my sequel now
there are two options first we have the
first generation and the second
generation now second generation has
seven times the throughput and twenty
times the storage capacity than the
first generation it is less expensive
and it supports my sequel 5.6 and 5.7
now in order to create your sequel
instance all you need to provide is the
instance ID and set a root password
so the instanceid here is editing a
sequel - and the password now you need
to select the region and the particular
zone in this tap on this create button
and your sequel instance will be created
within minutes
so now that our instance is created
let's go ahead and click on the instance
ID now as you can see here we have so
many options like user databases
authorization SSL backups replicas and
operation now let's get to the user part
here we can create a user Korn by
default we have a root user so let's
create a user just input YouTube
username
and put in the password and within
seconds your user will be created now
coming on to the database part here we
have the option to create a database by
default we have three databases which
are the information schema my sequel and
the performance schema let me create a
database employee as you can see
creating a database is so easy now the
database which we created and the
instance we created can be accessed
using the Google cloud shell as well as
the Cloud SDK so we'll see how we can
access the same using the cloud shell
now in order to connect your sequel
instance to the cloud shell all you need
to type is G cloud sequel connect the
name of the instance and you username
the instance name is at Eureka sequel -
and the user name is crystal
as you can see within minutes I was
redirected to the my sequel shell of the
instance now this my sequel shell works
in the same way as any other my sequel
so let's first check the databases
we have the EMP database which I created
just now you can use this database and
perform the same functions as a my
sequel shell now coming back to our
services next we have the cloud pick
table now cloud BigTable is Google's no
sequel big data database service it is
the same database that provides many Co
Google services including search
analytics Maps and Gmail it provides
massively scalable no sequel database
suitable for low latency and high
throughput workloads it integrates
easily with popular big data tools like
Hadoop and spark and it supports the
open source industry based standard
HBase API now cloud BigTable is a great
choice for both operational and
analytical applications including IOT
user analytics and financial data
analytics you can use BigTable as the
storage engine for large scale low
latency applications as well as
throughput intensive data processing and
analytics the BigTable provisions and
scales 200 or petabytes automatically
and it can smoothly handle millions of
operations per second changes to the
deployment configuration are immediate
so there is no downtime during the
reconfiguration cloud BigTable stores
data in tables which contains row each
row is identified by a row key it is the
same as any no sequel database now data
in a row is organized into column
families or a groups of column a column
qualifiers identifies a single column
within a column family a cell is the
intersection of a row and a column and
each cell can contain multiple versions
of a value now working with cloud
BigTable there are two ways we have the
HBase which is the shell base tool and
we have CBT which is the command-line
tool written in Co now let's go ahead
and see how we can work with cloud
BigTable just go to the storage section
click on BigTable and here you can have
the option to create an instance to stop
on that button and here you can see you
have to provide your instance name in
society is automatically created now you
have the instance type which is either
production or development now production
is not preferred unless and until you
have a very high availability
requirement with a minimum number of 3
nodes plus it cannot be downloaded now
development seems to be the best choice
if you want a low cost instance for
development and testing though it does
not provide high availability but it can
be upgraded to production later now we
need to select the zone you have to
select the storage tab which can be the
SS T or s DT now SS T has a lower
latency and higher read QPS which is
query per second to stop on the create
button and within seconds your instance
will be created
so guys as you can see here that I have
created an instance which is Erica - BT
the big table instance now let's go
ahead and fire up this instance using
the cloud shell first of all we need to
enable the api's which is the cloud
break table API and a cloud BigTable
admin API for that we need to select the
project here let me select my rotten now
the a Piazza are enabled
and I have created the instance all we
need to do is open the cloud shell now
so guys as you can see here it
automatically connects to the github
repository of the Google cloud platform
and now to connect our project to the
Google cloud platform all we need to do
is type in the command G cloud config
set project and the project ID
let me just copy the project ID
and now to start the H Michelle we need
to tap in the command QuickStart dot Sh
as you can see it throws an error that
you cannot perform this action because
you don't have the permission to modify
the Google Cloud SDK installation
directly but instant they read in the
command with sudo as you can see it is
scanning for the projects and
downloading the project from the maven
repository it's building the quick start
with the snapshots and in a moment
you'll be connected to the HBase shell
you
so guys as you can see here now that we
have entered the HBase shell now we need
to create a table with a column family
cf1 all we need to do is type in this
command create the name of the table
which is EMP and the column family name
not to list it or when to typist list I
will list one row in the table EMP now
to put the value of any value in a row
Arwen supposed using the column family
CF 1 and the column qualifier c1 all we
need to do is put in this command
the row number which is r1
the column family which is cf 1 column
qualifier c1 as the value to be inserted
first of all I will be inserting a value
okay now let's insert another value and
to see the values inside a particular
table all you need to do is type in the
current scan and the table name as you
can see here in the our Munroe let me
put in another value in the row r2 and
scan again you see that we have two rows
each of which have the values in the
column family when we have the timestamp
and the value written as a Drakkar tcp -
now to drop the table there are two
commands to be inserted which is
disabled the table name I'll put in as
disabled EMP and the second one is drop
EMP now when I list the tables will show
me zero tables so the same can be
implemented by either CBT which is the
command line using the go command so
let's go back to our presentation now
next we have the cloud datastore a cloud
datastore is a no sequel
document-oriented database built for
automatic scaling high performance and
ease of application development cloud
datastore features include automatic
transaction which implies that
operations will either all succeed on
and will occur high availability of
reads and writes massive scalability and
high performance flexible storage and
querying of data we have the balance of
strong and eventual consistency
encryption at rest the cloud datastore
automatically encrypts all the data
before it is written to the disk and
automatically decrypt the data been read
by unauthorized use now cloud datastore
is ideal for applications that rely on
high availability structured data at
scale you can use the cloud datastore to
store and query all types of data you
can use it for parade catalogs that
provide real-time inventory and product
details for a retailer user profiles
that deliver a customized experience
based on the user's past activities and
preferences the transactions based on
acid properties for example transferring
funds from one bank account to another
now data objects in cloud datastore are
known as entry
and an entity has one or more named
properties each of which can have one or
more values entities of the same kind do
not need to have the same properties and
an entity's value for a given property
do not need to be of the same data-type
cloud datastore supports a variety of
data types for property values these
include the integers floating point
number strings dates and binary data
each entity in the cloud datastore has a
key that uniquely identifies it the key
consists of the following components let
us see
so first let's select the location
now entities are nothing but data
objects in the cloud datastore as I
mentioned earlier now it is setting the
region and will have to input the
following identifiers for a particular
entity we have the namespace of the
entity which allows it for multi-tenancy
the kind of the entity which categorizes
it for purposes of cloud datastore
queries we have an identifier for the
individual entity which can either be a
key or an integer an optional ancestor
path locating the entity within the
cloud datastore Hank
as you can see here we have the
namespace the kind the key identifier
and the properties to be added so let's
input the name
the kind I'm entering is a demo which
will easily help me categorize it for
future purposes no key on fire can be
numeric ID or a custom name just tap on
the Create button now you have two
options which are query by kind or
queried by cheaper
you can add properties such as for the
name I'll enter
type string
you can add another property
just click on the Save button now you
have two options here query by kind or
query by gql you can filter the entities
here apply filter which is the key ID is
an integer equal to 500
you will get the following output now
that we have seen cloud datastore let's
go ahead and have a look at the cloud
span a cloud spanner is a fully managed
mission-critical relational database
service that offers transactional
consistency at a global scale schemas
sequel and automatic synchronous
replication for high availability a
cloud spanner is the only enterprise
create global distributed and strongly
consistent database servers build for
the cloud specifically to combine the
benefits of both relational database
structures with the non-relational base
horizontal scale this combination
delivers high performance transactions
and strong consistency across rows
regions and continents with an
industry-leading 99.99% availability SLA
no planned downtime and enterprise-grade
security now as you can see here the
spanner gives a certain advantages over
traditional relational database as well
as traditional non relational database
as you can see in the traditional
relational we cannot have high
availability as well as scalability and
interest and non-relational we cannot
have a particular schema and we do not
use sequel but in cloud spanner we have
the benefits of both the traditional
relational and the traditional
non-relational now let's go ahead and
work with will cloud scanner
just go to this panel it automatically
enables the cloud spanner API for your
project so you do not have to do it
manually so now let's go ahead and
create an instance you can write the
instance meme
you can set up the configuration of
regional or multi-regional you can
select the number of nodes
just tap on the create button and it
will create a cloud spanner instance we
sews panel is very easy you just need to
tap on create database button and it
will create a database
you can add a table
you can add columns here
you can also add column sales so suppose
you want to add the ID also you can set
the prime D key just tap on the create
button
and spanner will automatically create
the database for you you can monitor
your database or you can change the
database you can also query in your
database you can run a query from here
or you can have it just by selecting the
particular database and you can edit the
schema you can either add a column or
delete a column or you can add values
now that we have seen the cloud spanner
here are some other useful cloud storage
options we have the persistent disk
cloud bigquery and the Google Drive now
persistent disk is a high-performance
block storage service suitable for
virtual machines and container storage
it offers unmatched price to performance
ratio you only pay for the capacity and
you are never charged for the provision
a ops
additionally persistent disk offers
multi readers mounts and on-demand
volume resizing to simplify operations
now bigquery
is Google's fully managed low cost
analytics data warehouse
it is server less and there is no
infrastructure to manage no need to
guess the needed capacity or
over-provision and you do not need a
database administrator you can focus on
analyzing data to find meaningful
insights now finally Google Drive is a
collaborative space for storing sharing
and editing files including Google Docs
with a 15 GB of storage space available
for free accounts now that we have seen
all the services provided by DCP let's
see exactly where and when these
services are being used as different
application and workloads require
different storage and database solution
we will offer a full suit of
industry-leading storage services that
are price performant and meet your needs
for structured unstructured
transactional and relational data the
image given here helps you identify the
solution that fit your scenarios whether
they are mobile application hosting
commercial software data pipelines or
storing backups now you might be
wondering what is Google Cloud storage
for firebase the firebase mobile and web
access to Google Cloud storage with
server less third-party authentication
and authorization now let us see when
these storage are used and in which
scenarios
first if we want to store a block type
we use the cloud storage to use images
pictures videos objects and unstructured
data when we come to know sequence we
have the cloud data stored and the count
BigTable cloud datastore is used for
hierarchical data and BigTable it is
used for low latency read and write
access and high-throughput analytics
coming to sequel we have the cloud
sequel which is the web framework for a
structured data and cloud spanner which
is used for mission-critical
applications and high transactions now
cloud storage the examples are storing
and streaming multimedia storing for
data at its load and disaster recovery
coming on to cloud datastore it is used
for user profiles product card logs and
game state now cloud BigTable is used
for IOT finance personalization
recommendation monitoring and graphs
cloud sequel is used for blogs content
management websites business
intelligence application CRM ERP and a
commercial application coming on to
cloud spanner it is used for financial
service which are mission critical
global supply chain and retail now we
are left with the persistent disk a
persistent disk are used for virtual
machines to share read-only access data
across VMs it is used as a backup of
worth running VMs now bigquery is used
for large data analytical reporting data
science and analysis and big data
processing using sequence so guys I hope
you have enjoyed this session on the
Google cloud storage and you might have
a brief idea for the various storage
services which are offered by Google
thank you for listening to this video I
hope you have enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
