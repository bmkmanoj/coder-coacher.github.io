special session on Python interview
questions so as to how to tackle various
Python interviews as you know these days
that you know Python is very well known
and highly sought after language okay so
there are a lot of people who work and
fight them while looking for Python as
language for different purposes so
Python spans across the various
different domains
okay so typically people might have
heard of Python basically as a scripting
language or as a web application
development language or something
similar to on those lines but it is not
limited it is not limited to just that
Python can go way beyond this particular
scope so as defined as the current
market trend so if you take a look let
me just show you right if you just take
a look at python jobs impact on jobs
these days you will be able to see that
you know there are a whole plethora of
jobs available as such so let me just
take up one single example okay so
you've got people looking for jobs in QT
based development you've got F ups
you've got software development with
other languages you've got you know
jQuery you know which means to say this
is front-end development you've got for
a so we're distributed architecture so
you've got it in cloud computing you see
there is number I see math which means
to say it is data analytics so you've
got a whole lot of domains where vitam
can actually apply okay so from the
industrial standpoint python is heavily
used in web application and back-end
development in core application
development all these particular things
and to make a job easier so it is also
used for data analytics in such an easy
language then you can use it for you
know data analytics web scraping and a
whole lot of other so let's go to our
various questions and I would like you
know like
to interactively ask your questions as
well so that you know probably I could
help you solve how to go ahead and
answer your Python interview questions
also please remember this that you know
couple of years ago Python was not so
predominant as it is right now
so the quality of interviews were much
more lower so basically they would
typically ask you simple questions okay
these days you get to hear
domain-specific questions go typing
questions and a whole lot more okay so
what we will do is we will go into the
core Python questions and then delve
into more of the domain specific
questions okay
are you all clear so if so could you
please reply with the Y R and n - yes
and n4 and n could apply in the question
section that you have Roma your answer
please could you please reply with a
wire name all right thank you so much
all right so let's move forward
so a sport indeed.com okay just taking
at the Python trench you'll see the
percentage of matching job postings
across the various years of 2012 I span
back way before 2001 I go back into 2007
2008 even before that so back then it
was a little lower much lower actually
because it was not predominant now
you'll see that you know there are heavy
spikes there are couple of Falls but you
know it is still spiking upwards even
with the dawn of new languages new
framework you see that Python
relentlessly goes forward and you know
people still keep on adopting it one
because of the ease of use - because of
the you know what you say the simplicity
of the language okay and three it pays a
lot so to actually show you the details
you see that the annual salaries of
developers based on languages okay
you have asp.net you've got PHP Python
Ruby this is a just general statistics
that we have bought over here okay
they've been moving on pretty much the
same level now you see that Quentin has
never reduced and in comparison the
salaries in last four and this is in
Indian lakhs per annum
okay
so the starting salaries here has been
given for one to two years of experience
any other between 2.5 to 4 lakhs for 2
years of experience anywhere between 4 +
&amp;amp; 4 4 plus years of experience it is no
close to 8 lakhs per annum but I
wouldn't really commend exactly saying
that you know this is what you are going
to get it depends on which particular
domain you are joining into this
particular company you're joining into
there are a lot of factors which are
involved as well but I would definitely
say that you know it is well paid
language as such so there are people who
have you know four to six years of
experience oiling close to 10 to 12
lakhs per annum as well okay now and the
agenda is basically to get into the
various interview questions that you
probably need to tackle these are you
know couple of tentative questions that
you could face so you could have a whole
lot more so I will get into a couple of
them so that you know you get a better
margin off if you do have a question you
know a specific question will probably
tackle those as well alright now so we
will be packing basic Python questions
general questions web scraping and data
analysis okay now a very exciting
question so when you're talking about
basic writing questions there are
examples of specific questions which
keep repeating okay this is the first
question that we have what is the
difference between a deep and a shallow
copy so even before I get into this let
me just check with you all so can you
give me a background as to which
particular background do you come from
will come directly from Python and you
know what you want as a takeaway from
this particular session so I would be
happy if you could reply in the you know
questions box please a quick
introduction into you know basically
what you are looking for in this session
as such and you know what do you want as
a takeaway okay where you answer that
okay let's tackle a couple of questions
that okay so as I said basic Python
questions my suggestion would be to get
yourself familiarize with the various
data structures that you have in Python
okay that is a most heavily asked you
know
it's heavily asked as such so you've got
questions like you know what is the
difference between lists and tuples what
exactly do you mean by mutable what is
immutable so you've got a couple of
questions like that okay all right so
Rome are you willing to come as a Java
developer you are expecting to learn
Python and know what you should focus on
so as to move into Python that's a great
thing to do because you would find it
pretty easy to in a move into Python as
compared to working in Java so we will
take a look at this with you let's go
into the basic Python questions as such
what you would typically come across so
what is the difference between deep and
shallow copy okay so let's do one thing
okay let me open up a pipe and from
okay No so even before we get into this
let me just give you a background so
what do you mean by a shadow copy it
means that it is used when in new
instance type gets created and it keeps
the values that are copied in the new
instance so basically we are copying
okay copying whatever is off the new
instance from an existing instance okay
so it is used to copy a reference
pointers look it copies just the top
level values
it doesn't copy each and everything and
create a new object so there would be a
references okay for example okay I have
l1 is equal to 1 2 3 4 ok this is a
particular list ok I have a list l1 1 2
3 4 now L 2 is equal to l1 I will create
okay I wouldn't say it is a copy is just
a reference of l l1 and l2 so if I even
do L 2 dot F end of 10 so it would
reflect both in l2 and l1 okay this is a
no this is basically a referencing - you
know Python referencing now when you're
talking about copy
we usually have you know a particular
module named as copy so the shadow copy
works this way so I've got l1 okay I've
got l3 okay I'll create LP or P dot copy
plus l1 okay if you look at l3 it is the
same as what we have in l1 no l3 dot
append of 11 let's take a look at l1
comma L - oh ma l3 no ok l1 is at 10 l2
is a 10 and l3 has moved to 11 which
means to say it is created or copy okay
this is a shadow copy okay so it is used
to copy all the reference pointers it
copies all the values but it creates a
new original by itself in a separate
memory location so to check the memory
location you can do this l1 idea of l2
I do and three
okay you see L 1 and L 2 are the same
what else is different
which means to say that there is a copy
which has happened but you know the
admin structures in copy so the admin
structures of L 1 are not copy 2 L 3
okay so we won't delve into that depth
because there's a whole lot more
happening okay there's a whole lot more
happening but what I can tell you is if
you watch actor the person this is what
you need to say anyone so basically your
shadow copy copies all the reference
pointers all the work values and it
creates a new memory location so as to
you know you have a copy of the entire
set which you created whereas a deep
copy it takes care of all the references
of the references and a whole lot more
which means to say it has to make it in
a pointers to each and everything it has
to make clear-cut copies for each and
everything that does not happen in
shallow copy there is no one book that
does not happen in shadow copy okay so
deep puppy gets deeper and deeper and
when you take you know where you save
copies of instances as such that is
where issues come in when you're using
deep copy so it makes it much more
slower to run deep points okay it makes
it much more slaughter because it has to
copy all the references all the admin
structures all the values each and
everything whereas Shadow Copy does not
copy all the admin structures just the
top level references and original values
that's either clear on the copy and the
deep copy yep so the example for deep
copy would be something like this okay L
for copy dot deep copy in case you were
asked about that so L - okay L for ID of
L for you'll see it's got a whole
different idea altogether okay so this
is how you create a shallow copy and
this is how you create a deep copy
please remember this because it does
come up not frequently but you know it's
good to know something like this
particular thing what is the difference
between copy you know a regular copy dot
copy what is a deep copy and what is a
regular reference are you all here
oh great so let's move on okay let's
move on so the next question this is a
very frequently asked question that is
what is the difference between a list
and - okay what is the difference
between the two often now we already
took a look at lists as such no let's do
it again these are all lists over here
one two three
dinner was this animals marks and
comments are on lists and the tuples are
the one within these lists so let's go
back here let's create X or l1 again
three four okay and T one and the two
two three four okay so here's the
difference okay
lists are data structures which can be
modified at runtime whereas your pupils
cannot be modified at runtime okay we
have lists methods which allow us to do
that for example list dot FN of ten will
allow you to do it this happens at
runtime
okay but we cannot do that to a tuple
okay we cannot do that what you put
we will see that you know it does not
have such attribute so you might wonder
why do you need two pills when you have
lists okay
the reason being when you have fixed
data and you know exactly the size of
the data which is coming in to you okay
or coming into your server or coming
into your application that is when you
use lists because these take up fixed or
static space okay whereas your lists are
allocated space which you know is
dynamic in nature we can append we can
remove for example list L 1 dot remove
of three and you see that Rho 3 has been
removed so you can keep on modifying it
whereas your pupils are fixed in nature
if anything about fixed amount of data
coming in fixed amount of data going out
and you are thinking about memory
intensive tasks always go for tuples
where you are thinking about buffers
when you're thinking about queues when
you're thinking about you know our
stacks always think about lists am i
clear on that so the first question
which might come up would be what is the
difference between a ListView and a
tuple basically a list is mutable a
pupil is not a my view could you replace
the wire name so for example ok still
unclear as to where to use tuples now
you have got a database okay my DB okay
so for example I have got fixed columns
okay column with ID column with name
and a column with Marci okay so the list
represents the rows okay so this is one
row this is the second row
something like this okay when you know
exactly how many columns you have you go
for a tuple when you don't know how many
rows you have you go put up particular
the list that is how it has been you
know it is structured even all ApS
might equal polska is equal sequel life
are all structured this way okay
where the columns are represented by
pupils and the lists are represented by
a rose okay so when you are the writing
in data you have fixed number of columns
so you have a fixed number of data you
cannot simply tell I want to write n
number of columns into an N minus 1
number of you know column database does
that make it more 3 aroma all right ok
so that is about less than pupils and
there is one more thing okay you might
get a question like this okay say L 1
is equal to 1/2 on 3/4 karma and I would
put in a tuple inside this ok so let me
ask you a question will you be able to
modify the list
okay so modify the list or in will it be
able to modify the tuple the duple
exists within a list which is a mutable
thing okay and here I will give you
something like this 1 2 3
okay so you've got l1 and you've got l2
okay will you be able to modify this
tuple could you all reply from my
explanation you should be able to answer
this so shear is a thing to pull you
will never be able to modify will you be
able to modify this list which is inside
the pupil though so you say I don't
think so but it is if you are able to
modify it because it is referenced as I
said earlier so if you see l2 now it
would have not been modified
remember lists are referenced when even
inside this the structure the attributes
of a list do not change even if they are
inside a pupil it's a tricky question
for you know beginners it does come
across all right now
how do we achieve multi-threading in
Python is a question which comes up okay
so Python does have a threading package
okay so as to it's got a threading
package it's got a multi processing
package there are two different concepts
threads are related to in a specifically
addressed and what a processing is
specifically related to the number of
cores which you have on your system okay
now - has something called a GIM
global interpreter lock this is a
question which comes up okay
typically when it comes to threading
this is a question which comes up as to
what is a GI l the GI l is a global
interpreter lock which makes sure that
only one thread can execute at a certain
point of time in Python
okay so what happens is that the thread
acquires the GI L it completes the work
and moves on to the next thread so if
you are talking about my teeth reading
this is what typically happens okay
you've created multi threads using the
threading package okay what happens is
that it moves from one stress with the
other thread to the other dress so that
it seems as if it is executing in
parallel okay it's executing in puzzle
but what is happening is it is actually
taking turns using the CPU code it looks
like it is executing faster okay but not
necessarily all the time but there is a
particular way
it's a dirty hat if you might see you
can have a good turn off the GI l over
here okay if
mix okay so it does not happen puzzling
it mimics parallelism is what I would
say okay it mimics palaces but there is
a way to do it passionately also where
you can turn off the gif please remember
this is a very what you say dirty way of
doing it so if you turn off the TI n
your memory management can get messed up
so typically they will do that there are
other packages which have come in which
makes better use of threading okay so
you have to be very careful while using
the threading packages so when you're
turning up your GIS you have to make
sure that you write your semaphores your
new Texas properly so that it does not
mess with your memory management okay
because python memory is internally
managed by you know the Python
interpreter itself unlike you know
something like C or C++ where you know
you have to do the memory management
part okay so is that clear through your
so G il can always add an overhead to
your execution okay I'm not saying don't
use you know multi-threading okay I am
saying multi-threading is heavily used
okay it's just that it is used depending
on context so in case you have a lot of
course it makes sense to you something
like no ready okay is that here to
everyone okay
decide once multi-threading you can make
use of multi processing where multi
processing takes advantage of the number
of cores you have so if you say I have
got a core processor you can make use of
all those four cores and run parallel
jobs on all those four ok so you've got
something called multi processing for
that library called multi processing for
threading you have something called said
everyone I won't give up it now basic
Python questions when it comes to
ternary operation so I wouldn't call it
exactly turned in behaves like returning
operation okay so there you know you
have conditions if X or Y okay something
like this so how does it work okay so
basically this how you do it so you've
got x and y okay X comma Y is equal to
2500 15 X state of this example of the
path is a form of 50 we need to find the
largest among these
so you have to be short as to what
you're doing X if X
greater than wine
else why okay if X greater than Y else Y
which means to say it evaluates for X so
it will give X if X is greater than Y
else it will give Y so when you take no
big you would have got this particular
answer okay so the expression gets
evaluated like this X less so in this
particular case this is not X greater
than Y it is X less than Y this is for X
you know this one over one okay so it's
not big it should be small instead okay
so it is true so if it is greater than Y
return X else return Y that is what
basically happens here are you all here
how to use know how to mimic a turning
operation great now what is monkey
patching in Python this is something
which appears when you have gotten into
classes as such ok now so basically it
means to say that you know you're
applying a patch at run time okay or
know basically dynamic modifications of
class or a module at run time so
basically what happens here so let's
quickly create this example recreate
this example over here and then I'll
tell you what is the use of monkey patch
so please remember to not follow this
particular thing follow this particular
you know syntax because I am using new
cell classes this is a question which
comes up again as well okay do I use old
style classes or new style classes this
is something called an old style class
is using new set of classes always use
new style classes it is only legacy
architecture which makes use of old site
classes new style classes where the
classes inherit from objects and object
parent class as such death itself okay I
am creating a particular in a function
rent
so it says that you know just print this
in case you work in working with no okay
I will import something like M so
typically I would import it from a
separate Python script answer over here
I'll show it to you directly in practice
what exactly you're going to do okay
monkey cell
print
in Kiev so basically this is going to be
your
which we want to apply to this
particular function in this particular
class okay so what you're going to do is
my class so if you do my class dot F now
instantiate this class first X is equal
to my class
ex Dante okay so you see that you know F
is printed over here okay now
my class dot F okay so f becomes a
function attribute of this particular
class okay now is equal to monkey
underscore F so I am forcing this on to
this particular function okay now what
happens I will create an object obj okay
which is my plus okay
obj dot F will give you monkey F then
you know it would have applied this
particular cat but on to this particular
function I appear as to what happened
exactly
so we are applying or dynamic change or
a particular function in a particular
class at runtime did you all understand
how it is applied I such we are you know
forcing a particular function into a
particular function attribute of a
particular class contain if you
understand so what happened here is that
you have a particular class which
contains a particular function f okay so
this particular function is completely
independent of everything else which is
part of this class it is only part of
this class now you create an additional
function or at monkey F so which you
want to patch into this particular
function of this particular class you
follow me so far
Romo okay now what we are going to do so
initially if you are calling directly
from that particular class my H is equal
to my class X dot a it will give you
this F this is a one which was found
earlier which is naturally a part of
that particular class okay now what you
do is you are going to create another
function which is not part of this class
remember not part of this class you
create a function okay and you have a
different working of that particular
function and you want to patch it for
this particular function which is part
of the class okay you are going to force
this particular function which is why
you do my class dot F is equal to monkey
underscore F where F is a function of
this particular class monkey F is your
what you say as function following me so
far everyone okay
now what I do I create an instance of
that particular class after patching and
you see that patch has applied over here
so are you clear everyone are you clear
now as to what exactly I did okay so why
hit is used is basically you know it is
used as a quick fix in case there are
issues you know in the code itself is
basically for the you know similar to a
consumer it's not a constructor it is a
self definition for a particular person
okay so to create instances as such ok
now so basically what you do is you
create you know patches so as to get
dynamic attributes at runtime which you
were initially not thinking about or you
know applying quick fixes so as to you
know at runtime select things to not go
wrong maybe you know something there was
a functionality and it is not working
right so you go ahead and apply a patch
for that something like this okay this
is how you do it without changing the
class itself okay now here is a question
okay how can you randomize the items of
a list in place in bite okay so this is
a question which makes you know
something called at random we have a
particular module in Python called
random wrong random input shuffle okay
you've got a whole lot of stuff within
random but you're not going to take it
up so what I do is we'll create a list
just a moment
okay so we create this particular list X
is equal to keep the blue flag
individual items and you want to shuffle
this thing in place okay you want to
shuffle the original item reshuffle of X
when you print X you see that the you
know items have been shuffled you do it
again you see that again it has been
suffered okay this is how you shuffle
items in place either here or right
super now right a sorting algorithm for
a numerical data set in Python so maybe
the question is not quoted clear but
what we are trying to say here is right
absurd for a data set which is a string
so basically integer strings basically
okay so 1 4 to 10 5 are a string in a
set of strings or list of strings okay
which are all actually integers so how
do you do that so there are two
different ways of doing this okay so let
me do this l1 is equal to 1 for
identified so 1 or 2 &amp;amp; 5 okay so one
particular method is doing this now you
have a string so if you do n1 dot sort
let's do this
l1
side
we'll give you something like this okay
it does not the right thing that does
not right at all
okay and you wouldn't want something
like this okay
what you want is 1 2 4 5 10 so when you
do a sort like this it's applied on the
ASCII characters asset so it applies on
the first found ASCII characters which
is why 10 will also come out of this so
when you want to do an integer 1 this is
what you do this is the first one l1 is
equal to
end of I or I M
mortices so and L 1 dot sock
so now you see that it has been sorted
in place so what we did here it is we
use something known as a list
comprehension which can we know travels
over a particular list quickly and no
shorten your code you create a list in
place itself okay
which means you say for I in l1 that
means we are traveling over l1 first and
we are creating an integer out of that
particular thing we are forcing it into
an integer type int o y4 i in l1 once we
change all the items into an integer and
then we sort it in place are you are
clear regarding this now okay similarly
you can do the same thing in a different
way by using another one so l2 is equal
to
you use map fit of ink coma
L - okay l too got sort not a production
let's see first we change it into an
integer this is a very short one instead
of using a particular list comprehension
you can use a Mac okay Mac of int comma
L 2 and L 2 is equal to 1 4 2 4 &amp;amp; 1 n 2
dot sort will give you the sorted items
so there are two ways of doing it this
is one way and this is the other way
okay are you all clear so Mac what it
does is it takes up any function okay
and it maps it to a particular list of
items does that answer all your
questions that you have in mind
Omar modern one all right now you have
another know set of questions over here
which basically are you know simple
programmatic questions so let's take a
look at that so t1 is equal to a b c d
and
t 2 is equal to 1 2 3 4 5 ok this is a
data structure so you want to create a
dictionary out of two different lists or
tuples which have matching number of
arguments this is how we do it
zip of T 1 comma T 2 okay what you get
is a list of tuples which are zipped
together a b c d e when you do get all
zip of T 1 or T 2 you actually get a
particular no zip dictionary which is
created from the lists or the Gilberts
is it clear with everyone ok so this is
the first thing you want to create a
list of items ok a list of integers from
0 to 9 you do it like this using range
range of 10 okay now if 2 is equal to
sort it off I for I and a 1 if I in a
not OK what it means to say is first we
are going to traverse over a 1 which is
0 to 9 okay 0 1 2 3 4 if I in a 1 so I
will pick the value 0 1 2 3 4 till nine
it will set whether the value of I is
present in a not okay or not
whereas a not so basically your a naught
is equal to this moment yes
so you will not get that a naught
okay so what happens is that you get it
as an empty list reason being it
searches for you know value check for a
not in order a dictionary okay and it's
it's for the keys to be one two three
four five and it is not it is a values
which are one three to five or whatever
five okay it is he values want the keys
all right which is why you get an empty
list
similarly a three is referred to
sorted off
I spoke
and not
of s or s in a lot okay so we are
doubling over a knot first okay we are
traversing over a knot we are traversing
worthy actual killer such a CB e d okay
so it sets for a knot of s okay we check
for a knot of s so what happens we get
it has one two three four five you get
the values for all of them
similarly a four is equal to i 4i and
a1fi in a three okay so we are
traversing over a one this time and we
are checking if you know this 0 1 2 3 4
5 is present in a 3 you know which is
actually present okay and when you do a
4 you see that it will give you the very
spot on 2 3 4 5 now if 5 is a dict
comprehension this was a list
comprehension this is a dict
comprehension
now I : so I would be your particular
key okay I put on I into I that is we
are creating a particular square of the
item or I in a 1 if I will give you 0 0
1 1 2 4 3 9 4 16 so on n 9 okay so we
are creating our dictionary
comprehension by using this for I in a 1
okay we are traversing over a 1 which is
a particular range of items and finally
is 6
equal to we are creating lists of items
I into I
for I am a 106 we'll give you the same
thing as a list of a list
so are you clear with how these work as
such from a very tough level are you
clear with how these work very nice now
there are some more things no when it
comes to regular expressions inviting
okay how do we do various things and you
know vital so we've got an re module so
we've got split gives us a reddish
pattern to split a given string into a
list okay
so split it uses a regex pattern Sark
will find all the sub strings where the
richest part in matches and replace them
with a different string okay and sub n
will replace it like it does in sub but
it will give you how many replacements
happen okay for important RG okay my s
is equal to
something like blah blah blah something
like this okay you have a red X pattern
lettuce pattern is equal to block
something like this okay so what do you
do is my s are you don't split off my s
okay okay okay so the best way of doing
it is typically doing a normal split
okay so let me do this
okay so what it does it splits over the
pattern BL a okay blla blla blla the
first one is an empty string then it
gives you H H n H pattern comma the
string that you want a good for okay
substitution okay I'll do it for S sub n
because it was similar to sub okay re
dotsub n okay off your pattern that is
not
, your string which is my ass
so you've got a pattern okay replace
block grid so I miss out this inhibit
pattern and my s okay so it will replace
the block is you know BL okay it will
replace with what a particular a so if
we take it the other way around
pattern comma E
is so it replaces BMA by a only a okay
did you get it how it replaces a
particular pattern everyone are you
clear with how it replaces a particular
pattern okay so let me go back again
okay so you've got your string my s you
got a pattern which needs to be replaced
okay and you have an item
replacement item a okay are you got sub
n okay re dot some n your replacement
item
I turn which needs to be replaced and
your string okay would be this way but
if you go this way your pattern your pre
placement item and your string going to
do it this way take your pattern replace
it you know replace all the items in
your pattern with the replacement item a
and you get a H a HK h so be La Vie la
is replaced with a a a and it gives you
how many times it has been substituted
are you clear now so roma okay so let's
continue with our questions what is
inheritance in Python okay inheritance
is basically gaining the attributes and
methods from one class into another so
from the parent class will be the child
reservoir from the base class to the
subclass as such okay now so there are
different types of inheritance okay so
there are single there's multi-level
there is hierarchical and multiple so
typically the highly used ones are
either single inheritance or multiple
inheritance no how does it actually
function so they're a derived class
acquire the members of a single
superclass is known as a single
inheritance multi-level is you know one
class derived from no another class
which derives again from another class
so basically a derived class is
inherited from a base class and the
other one inherits from the previously
no previous class SSB so d1 inherited
from be S Plus b1 okay and b2 is
inherited from there's a mistake here it
you know what you see the inherits again
no from that particular class
hierarchical is based you know one base
class you can inherit multiple child
classes so basically it might be
something like this I got a class
like glass
plus M plus my plus
and two plus of my class
hierarchical inheritance you have to be
careful while using hierarchical
inheritance because if you are
instantiating both big classes you have
to be sure as to you know which one you
are going to use you know if it is going
to be using from m-class or a CPA are
going to be from m2 class if it is
deriving from the same one looking you
have to be very careful especially with
the functions which have been derived
from the base class as such okay now
multiple inheritance is very derived
from multiple classes okay it is from
multiple class so my class
you
so another class
we'll derive from my class comma my c2
something like this so child will derive
from two different you know super
classes as such are you clear as to what
exactly inheritance is so you've got an
example here v1 v2 child class parent
class pass and v1 and v2 okay so this is
basically what you mean by inheritance
in - okay moving on to the next part it
might not be relevant to everyone but
there are people who are it means moving
into web application development as
specifically to genre might find it
irrelevant
okay now there is a question so
mentioned the Django architecture so
there are various patterns which are
available so you've got MVP you've got
MVC you've got NV t now MVP is you know
a Model View and template it is similar
to that of MVC which is Model View
controller but here what happens is that
model is similar to both of them both
MVC and MVP the view over here functions
as a controller itself okay in this V
the view in Django functions as a
regular controller it takes care of all
the controller aspects where is the
template the T okay is similar to the
view you know MVC
so basically view it is a tea that is
template is similar to the V in MVC that
is a view in MVC because T is basically
the templating part where you have your
HTML templates your text template but
different types of templates
typically your HTML template now you've
got your model which is part of your
database where you know you define your
database as such a database schema is
defined in the model the view and the
template Maps the model so basically the
developer provider model interview and
have template then map set to the URL
and Django does the magic to serve it as
such okay you have got the model we have
got the template it is then taken up
into the view and given as a URL through
Django to the user I all clear regarding
the Model View template
structure as such so templates would be
your regular HTML pages which contain
dynamic elements in them okay for
example let me just give you a simple
template as such for example I have
something like this HTML
slash HTML
Edie
/
bori
/ boy
you
okay your say we can contain dynamic
elementary my title something like this
for variable called my title where let
me just do this one second
my body something like this so my
culture and my body are information this
is a template okay so the viewer will
pull up information from the model
probably all the titles and body
information is in the model just an
example okay is inside the model which
is inside your database so what it does
is it takes up the title it will
populate it to the title it takes up the
body it populates with a boy respective
body Thank You body title body so you
can have hundreds of items and you can
have a single template serving different
types of templates does the transfer
your question troma okay so now explain
how you can set up a database in Django
so we will go with default database
which is sequel Lite which stores data
as a single file single file system so
you can also have databases like Osprey
my sequel or format MS equal under than
sequel Lite but then you need to use
your administrative tools to create a
new database signal for example we might
have to use something like sequel as me
or something like that okay to create
your database as such for your project
so basically either way with your
database in place
it tells Django how to use it okay this
is where you settings P dot P Y files
comes in so you in your setting that py
file is where you do all the
configuration regarding that particular
database or you know your web server
information all these things go ahead
Rhea setting not py5 so you've got your
databases so databases will tell you the
default no or in on your star bar or
your slave or whatever it might be so
the default database you would typically
have a sequel light so you give the name
of the engine
database DB backends super likely
because if you let three is your
particular database and you delete it to
a particular now base directory names of
mails the IATA has to be also mentioned
over here and we will of security is
your actual database okay it is going to
be the name of your Oracle database okay
similarly there might come another
question as to where do you you know
start your whether you have information
regarding
your web server or anything like that so
that comes under something called as
manage dot py you got another and put
managed or py so be sure about setting
got py and manage dot P word I only on
that alright now how do you write a view
in Django so we talked about templates
we also showed you a simple template
which we have okay how do you write a
view okay
a view is similar to a controller which
pulls up information from your model and
your template and serves it to the user
an example is like this so you have you
know views dot py5 where you put from
Java or HTTP or HTTPS was because you
are going to give out an HTTP response
import date type so what this particular
view does is that it returns the current
date and time as an HTML document so
bail if you will create you'll get an
HTML response and an HTML file which
shows the current date and time so it
will contain it is now blah blah blah
okay say it is now I don't know what
time it is so somewhere around eleven
ten it will give you an output saying it
is now 11 10 M or whatever it may be
because it pulls the information from a
standard D time one now puts it in the
HTML and replaces this person page s by
that information and returns you the
HTML response now you might be thinking
what if I have template files available
so in that particular case you have to
first use a loader to load in the
template by doing a get template ok and
then you have to serve the response over
here by rendering the template ok
are you all clear okay so you have you
know getting the template rendering the
template serving your responses and how
to write a view in general so what does
Django template consists of so it is a
simple text file as I showed you it can
be a XML type CSV type HTML type and you
know n number of other types as well it
can contain variables like I just showed
you earlier my title my body it can be
replaced by various values when the
is evaluated and the tags as well you
can change the tag information that
controls the logic of the template so
you've got your database model know
which is controlled by the models or py
file you've got your new stock / you've
got a separate template folder which
contains the various templates and you
have your URL or your URL views which is
your particular so basically you create
your route these are all your routes
which are your URL and you pull up here
you know this URL route through the
browser and it will render the template
and give it path your browser you know
this is the workflow of a particularly
HTTP request and such but what does a
template contains XML CSV and HTML as
per our you're clear now this is a
question which comes up explain the use
of session in Django framework okay look
it is possible that you might get a
question like okay so I have a
particular user who's logging in ax say
you know 11:15 okay and he probably
keeps himself logged in okay
and he leaves the particular place okay
and after like another two days he comes
back and he sees that you know he is
still got them
okay so how do i you know this is
another way of doing the same thing
regarding session how do I see to it
that the user logs out after a
particular type so that is where you
make use of something known as sessions
in Django okay you know so Janna
provides a session that will allow you
to store and retrieve data as per site
visitor basis so you know you will
create a random session it could be a
random keyword as such which would have
the session data for example it might
contain cookies it will contain session
ID cookie so that you know it will be
put from the client side which replies
it will solve on the server side so in
case your session cookie as a timeout it
will then after two hours you are
supposed to log out by default so even
if the person comes after two days and
tries to enter that without a cookie is
a session ok you know it will tell that
you have been logged out please you know
log in again that
with session IDs and cookies come into
picture okay so this is very good for
security as such okay it is very good
for security that way you are not
pulling data from the server and storing
it on your client side I will clear what
a session is so it is a certain know
basically an ID which allows you to give
your users in tick now what are the
different types of inheritance science
in general okay so there are three
possible in ethical styles so you put
abstract base classes also known as ABC
you have got multiple table inheritance
and you got proxy model so what is an
ABC so the styles are used when you want
parents class support information that
you do not want to type up for each
child model so basically you will have a
particular parent class okay and you
would want the in a parent class to put
information and you do not want to
create it for each and every child class
as such that is very use and ABC as such
so ABC is also used to create particular
classes okay which are not completely
you know what is it implemented as such
it is a better approach than you know
just creating empty classes as such
exactly you cannot instantiate an ABC in
Python as well so if you can you know
you have your child classes derived from
baby because that is because it is an
abstract based class and you will not be
able to know what is instantiate a base
class as no abstract class as such okay
it has to come from the child classes
which are created from that okay
similarly you've got multi table
inheritance so you've got an existing
model and you want to you know create a
model based on you know that existing
table okay another particular model is
on the existing table so you don't have
to write each and everything down you
can inherit from multiple table as such
okay you want say you know you have a
class called book you've got an article
we have got two different classes you do
not want to create a particular class
which has got all information regarding
book and article from scratch instead
you can just derive from those
particular classes as you can directly
derive from the
classes but please remember one thing
you have multiple table inheritance so
by default so it allows you to alright
basically existing functions as such but
in multi table inheritance it does not
allow you to do that okay I agree on
that
so what am proxy models now proxy models
so you can use this model if you want to
modify the Python level behavior without
changing the models field so you can
create proxies where you are making
changes to the actual database wire and
existing you know or you say a proxy of
the existing class so you create a
particular model so model defines a
particular table now you want to make
changes to the table okay you have
different behaviors for that table you
can just create proxy models for that by
doing proxy models you can have multiple
behaviors without changing the actual
behavior of the base model itself that
is where proxy models come into picture
now what is contained in a field class
so as simple as that what is contained
in the piece class or jungle vehicles so
if it contain the database column type
if it is integer astraying worker or
anything like that
the default HTML widget availed when
rendering a farm field whether it's a
exports whether it's you know whether
it's a particular you know all email
you've got an email text text field
something like that you've got different
types of field classes okay you've got a
password for you anything like this so
that is the default HTML widget and the
minimum validation requirements so
number of characters which you can enter
number of lights which it can be can be
in the text box all of this come in the
field class please remember this minimum
validation requirements
default HTML widget and the database
column type okay coming to the next
section that is web scraping the using
pipe these questions so how do you save
an image locally using Python who's you
are address you already know ok so there
are various ways of doing it so this
will work directly if you are using from
you're local so you're local it would
actually work correctly so typically
what I would do is something like this
by
support requests my URL is equal to w w
w HT TP
from this
the quests
get water okay so you see that you know
you are getting response R is equal to
requested get the let's to this with
open of image dot PNG former WP as F
not right I'm sorry about that it should
be fancy a bit elite
yes
right
that's sorry sorry about that with a
mistake in the sub that's okay we need
to do encoding also because it is not
allowing me to do our dot text is giving
you the encoding of the image okay so
this is the importing of the entire
image we need to encode it and then
write and then you would have your image
ready you'll be able to save your image
as such you can see the image on it now
how can I get the Google cash edge of
anyone okay how do I get it Google cash
aid of any water let's do one thing
using the following format so if you use
webcast or Google use a Content so or
open this up
you can actually
this we so your new artist for example
www.eddecosta.com
let's go so you'd be able to get this
information so you will be getting cash
count and this is a cache content okay
it has been provided by your CDN okay so
this is your cache content and you'll be
able to get the cache content by doing
this webcast at Google use a pen 10.com
search so and so you can do this now you
are required to scrape data from IMDB
top 250 pages it should have filled
movie names your and rating how do you
do this so this would probably come up
as a coding question okay
typically not as complex you might get a
simple one so how do you approach this
so you have to get into imdb.com first
okay and you don't get the information
first
this particular eye on following me so
far
so you go imdb.com topic nor through 50
movies okay so there are various ways of
doing it okay but for this you have to
start with beautiful soup on this
beautiful soup
from bs4 import for soup beautiful soup
is a password also basically an HTML
parsing library okay it's used for web
scraping it's heavily used for web
script import request request will get
your you know information okay so you
are in is it 42 so you have your URL so
soup what so you create your response
that is by using request get URL so
you'll see that you'll have a written
response 200 which means to say you've
got the response object which contains
the text which contains all the
information regarding that particular
page okay and you need the text from
then and you need to pass the text from
that for parsing it this is how you go
about first open up the page inspect
this page okay and check what you need
so what you need is the fields movie
name your and rating there are various
ways of one such queen is this
particular thing so got find children
for moving in TR movie dot find find in
a command to get all the instances of
this TD the theory class containing
column name title column so class
containing title column
similarly your will be entitled okay
under your secondary info again you have
you know rating column landing you've
got a whole lot of information but that
has to be first asked for here okay
so typically I would come here over here
and I would first go check on this so
what I need is the TR TR continue see
that you have got various tasks under
lister list
just a second roma let me you know let
me just go through this i will tell you
what exactly beautiful superzeros for
there so this is how you do it first
once you get this list earnest okay you
have a list
so let's do soup is equal to beautiful
soup we have got soup is equal to
beautiful so quick so you are going to
do this so is equal to beautiful soup of
rest dot txt so what is going to happen
it is going to create an object called
beautiful soup I would not be a response
that you have got from the response to
the text part of it okay so if you check
so it should have pulled up all the
information and created a soup of it are
you following me so far okay now what do
you need is soup dot so your question
was super supportive beautiful soup you
need to find something so super
beautiful signal what it does now we
will do this okay I want Lister list a
list is equal to soup dot find okay so
box find class so you can do this
something like this
we don't want TD we want the body class
s listen - list
list so this is supposed to find me one
single item which contains the class
list a list a list you'll see you it
would have pulled up that information
regarding the tea body okay
now the tea body we need TR okay so we
have got n list soup dot find all so T
our mighty ass I'm going to be super
fine don t are let's check what we need
under Teton okay TR we just need the TR
information okay we just need a PR
information within this for you okay gr
not super ta find on so we want and
let's start right Apollo okay I think
this will not go in with that or you can
use find capital T us okay it will give
me all the tears in this all dirty our
information in this okay now under this
we need specific information so this is
how you go about it
under this okay for TR empty ours okay
Frank I'll just give you one example
okay post column let's take this one for
example okay expect
you have something title column okay
class title purple now you get to the
point of exit bottom
friend
PR dot signed
class cool
find we want TD
plus column
title column so one by one we enter into
this body
coated with in quotations
okay so it fetches me all the title
column information
okay so let's refine this some more dot
text okay it will give me all the title
columns you see all the title columns
here a bit for that this is how you put
all the information I all clear on how
to approach this particular problem okay
next data and this is using now numpy is
one of the modules which are heavily
used in pipe
okay so how do you go about using this
so you would get a particular question
saying how to get indices of N maximum
values in an umpire array okay so you
have to use these particular things
import numpy as NP a RR is equal to NP
dot array you are going to have you know
n number of items please remember this 1
3 5 4 5 4 6 5 something like this okay
now you can make use of our sort there
is a particular thing called arcs or a
RR dot our sort will give you the
indices the indices for this particular
thing okay in a proper order
okay sorted indices so what do you need
the top three positions okay top three
items so minus three Coon so 2 4 and 3
off : 1 minus 1 so 3 4 and 2 is the I
ignore answer which I get over here ok
what are the difference between the
numpy array and our list so let me tell
you this okay just give me one second
so let me recreate this array 1 3 2 4 5
here are our sort of - 3 :
of fold goal 1
okay 403 as they are put that implants
now what do you want so what you want is
the difference between not by array and
list so we will go to get to that let's
give me a second
or numpy s MP is equal to NP dot array
so we will first do this particular how
do you calculate a percentile with
Python so we go to this first okay and
then we will move to that particular
question we have got a couple of things
something like this he is required to or
will just do this n P dot percentile n P
dot percentile of a comma the percentile
level the 50th percent or some type
would be this fine okay
so you can set return the 50th
percentile so you can directly feel them
the percentile level and you will get
the information regarding the percentile
level so this is the question which you
asked for one okay what about the
differences between number and lists
okay so it is much more efficient
because all these structures have been
reference NC with item you have vector
and matrix operations for free so
basically something like this okay I
have got L 1 is equal to 1 2 3
something like this
okay
so L 1 0 is equal to NP dot array of
and one
okay so we will create l2s one
okay now if you do L 1 plus n to say you
want to add items of L 1 2 and eggs also
1 plus 1 2 plus 2 3 plus 3 4 plus 4 PI
plus 5 and 6 plus 6 L 1 plus L 2
regularly would give you something like
this but if you create an array with an
umpire array this is what would happen
l1 ARR plus l2 ARR would give you 2 4 6
8 12
one of your questions Roma okay
so this is one of the examples okay so
you get a lot of vector and matrix
operations so that you know you have to
you can avoid unnecessary work of
recreating the original operation number
array is faster you get a lot of built
in and built it with Mumbai FFTs and
pollution searching linear algebra
students s etc you've got a whole lot of
stuff which is included so what about
the list so lists are no general-purpose
containers effective in irregular
insertion deletion depending upon
catenation etc and it is dynamic in
nature okay but it does not support
vectorize operations like element wise
addition multiplication division all
these particular operations are not
supported which is what the advantage
actually is does that answer your
question
roma yes so roma so numpy can not store
different data types in a single array
it is homogeneous when it comes to a
single array but you know you can have
arrays of
Ghoulia's you can have arrays of strings
you can have a use of integer float
etcetera separately within a single
array it has to be homogeneous okay now
what is the difference between numpy and
sci-fi you've got something called numpy
you've got something called say fact we
have two different modules numpy is a
much more raw module as such if I were
to see so number would contain nothing
but the array data type and the most
vedic operations like indexing etcetera
your numerical code is typically inside
cycle okay but you would see that number
and say if I add white compatible with
each other because scifi is built on top
of gunpoint
so we're sci-fi has retained all the
Odyssey operations of numpy but it's got
a whole lot of its own operations for
example numpy contains linear algebra
functions even though they are more
properly utilized and they more properly
be known to cypher you can contain
integration differentiation all these
operations are provided in cipher ok and
it is much more easier sci-fi fan taste
fully featured versions are nearly as
algebra modules so if you are going to
do cell scientific computing it is
advised to use both numpy and sci-fi
together okay which is a recommended
thing so instead of using it
independently do not one so it it makes
more in a sense of doing something like
that okay how do I make 3d plots or
visualizations using one pipe on Saipan
so like 2d plotting you have 3d plots
but you've got a basic no 3d flawed code
M plot 3d sub package which is part of
your macro clip package
okay there is another package called
Maya VI which provides high quality 3d
visualization features ok for 2d there
is another beautiful charting library
called bouquet it is based off of bukit
or GA s locator JS library if you want
simple charting just charting okay
you've got LVDT you have got different
types of you know libraries which can be
used you've got Matt employed 3d sub
package for 3d like you know 3d you have
got for 2d you've got okay which is
dependent on the folk' dot J's library
you've got so the 3d you've got Maya VI
Aspen
we also got NV d3
which is part of the d3.js library okay
so you've got different beautiful
charting ApS which you can use okay now
how do I find in distance of an array
where some condition is true so you can
simply do this NV dot array or you have
an airing of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 click a
greater than 3 you will find all these
you know audience you will automatically
create a boolean or boolean matrix as
such n P dot non 0 a greater than 3 will
give you the indices so the output comes
up this way so let me just state that up
okay so a is equal to n B and P dot
array
one two three
five six seven eight nine okay from
YouTube this print a greater than three
and you get the boolean array print NB
dot non zero of a greater than three all
the nonzero numbers which are greater
than three will be created as a non zero
index so you might be wondering what
does this represent so if you look at
this 1 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 2 1 and 2 2 are the
actual indices okay these are the
indices so this is 1 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 2 1 2
are you are clear how that comes into
picture so these are the ones which are
the indices as such
ok so you see this array okay let me do
this so you see what we wanted is for
all the items greater than 3 so how it
comes up is you will get two separate
tuples you have to take it in a parallel
with each other 1 0 you see if 1 0 index
is a 4 1 1 is 4 5 1 2 is 4 6 2 0 is 4 7
2 1 is 4 8 and 2 2 is 4 9 ok that is how
it comes up now how do you rename column
headers in pandas dataframe so let's do
this ok import an - as PD will take up
this data this piece of data where we
have a dictionary okay we have a
dictionary which contains lists so you
but these would be your column names
commander date and score would be a
column names and these would be your
entries just Molly whatever it may be
okay data as so and so enter next you
created a data frame out of the existing
data with a certain index whatever is
different locations repeat most articles
marry Kumar you Yuma etc so you create a
data frame with a specific index so
when you type DF you will see that you
will get your values and this way okay
you get your values this way you want to
rename your columns so DF dot columns
will give you all the column details
Ares commander date score you just
simply do this data time school you do
this and check for DF it would have
change column it's this is how you
change column names in kindness I all
clear okay now what is a function used
to iterate through values in a manner
that one also retrieves the index so for
index
, row in D F dot hitter rose
print index kymaro okay you will see
that it gives you both the index as well
as the column information you have the
index parties and you've got the column
information leader time school leader
time school are you are here this is how
it you can get the information okay so
these are the various ways of doing it
one other question so how do you convert
how to convert a list of dictionaries
into a panda's data frame so we have
that question earlier and we did that
more directive so you had a bit let me
go back data so you've got data over
here which is a dictionary containing
all these items so print PD dot data
dreams of data
get up data frame which is created just
going PD dot data frame okay that is how
you simply create a data frame out of
your dictionary right now so there is a
question here let's say that I have a
data frame the estimate is a date we
have PD the data frame of this
particular type PD data frame okay so
you see DF is like this and how can I
subset based on a list of values okay
list of values is something like this so
it is a list containing values simply a
list containing values we simply do Y is
equal to so and so okay let's do this
one sick this is equal to DF of D F of a
so we are now searching for a in list of
values we are searching for three and
six
let's do one thing
one second
so the F of a will give you this we need
a list of values okay the F of a
for
we see these is ambiguous and
item a dot any are a dot d s we can do
this we have them small thing
yeah
we can also do this for ya
probably four
so list of bye
so this is a little longer way
Oh
if I
don't em if of a
print taken so you can do this but that
does not give you the value
so we have to you know maybe you know
get it to a certain point where it is
in of a of type
or the other way around so I look into
this there's a slight mistake in this
particular question that's what I see
okay so basically you would be able to
you know subset it based on the values
okay you can also do this being in fear
of
okay by doing be F of D F of a dot is in
three comma six so if you pass the
subset directly so through this
particular method it is a little bit
difficult but it makes sense to use
something like this D F of me is in 3
comma 6 it will give you whatever is
there for that particular subset
wherever there is 3 and 6 okay in a ok
so if you change it to be you would
probably get the value for only be
subset for B I have here you can also
put this with it now you've got a data
frame which contains both you know what
you see you've got not number so you
know that in a particular are the same
okay in a particular data frame we can
have regular numbers as well as not a
number if it has not been given order as
you know what do you say mixed-up
numbers or mix of the strings and all
that it takes it up as not a number okay
in that missing numbers it takes up as
model number in that case how do you get
only the ones which are not a number so
in that particular case you just give
this DF dot is infinite it is is finite
or so and so for example if we do it
sure
so if I give you only the finest
fighters this is just an example of what
we had done earlier so I don't know if I
can replicate this just give me a second
let me see if we can replicate this
particular thing
okay so we can replicate this
for that let me just copy this over
for this
put this as be
yes so you get only the finite rows are
you all clear how to get only the finite
rows is finite is going to be the thing
which we are searching for now there is
a particular question as to how to write
binary data using Python so typically
this is a question which comes up when
you are talking about picking up image
files or sound files or something else
in that particular case make sure to use
our be okay they are be much more that
is by three mode F is equal to open file
named red finally you don't need import
struck over the earth so that is only
for unpacking so you don't have to
bother about that file name a read
binary when you are reading it s is
equal to F read news 8 bytes you need to
use 8 bytes at a time and read it so
that will allow you to read a binary
file it will give you the location and
the byte value at that particular point
similarly F dot right if you want to do
a write binary you simply do F is the
code open of WB and you can write
information Road you can also write
image information to it so an example
which I have would be this okay just a
moment so one more important library is
in noise the OS library I will give you
another question so how do you get the
current working directory this is by
doing OS dot K so I want to change the
directory okay to wake up
slash desktop /e rake up is how I'm into
it
os not get CWT will give me
this current working directory okay and
also just dir of get CWD let's get
through all the files which are present
now I am looking for an image file okay
I am looking for an image file if items
M on items intro answer
if items start IMG at P&amp;amp;G in items or
print items okay so I have a file by the
name IMG file of PNG okay so what we can
do so using this there is open for or I
will do this so I want to do one thing I
want to copy over IMG file dot PNG okay
and create another file okay I will just
want to copy it over so I will be making
use of both read and write IMG file dot
PNG remember that you would have to do
read my very first
okay G is equal to open my IMG dot PNG
dot right mind rehear F dot right dot F
dot V I will just go ahead and write
everything in in one shot
zero teacher
J must have not read J dot right okay J
dot crews
if not close and let's do that
particular thing for sorting for our
files
you see this new file called mile IMG
dot PNG has been created let's check if
it exists so you can see my a IMG has
been created as such by overview as to
how to do this okay so that make brings
us to the end of our particularly know
session regarding interview questions
okay so do you have any questions at all
when to use dictionary and when to use
lists okay so when you have key value
pair okay for example user name password
okay
in such cases I would put it in a
dictionary okay
typically I wouldn't use user name
password I'd probably have user name and
identity or something like that I have
use our dictionary not for that
particular case for example let me just
do this
okay my users
user underscore ID is something like
this okay so I have a dictionary which
says you know Roma won so you said
waiting to use lists meant to use
dictionaries so basically a dictionary
which contains lists as the values for
example Roma at the rate Jimmy calm is
going to be the email ID and the ID
itself is going to be 101 one two then I
would probably have you know what you
see something like you - polo - at the
day gmail.com comma 1 1 3 ok
something like this so that you know
when you are accessing I would check for
the person called Roma and I'll get her
information and I will check for Roma of
zero I'll get her email ID you get my
point
does that answer your question any other
questions
okay that is a question I will not be
able to answer for data analysis which
is better Python on our okay so that is
a question which is typically asked but
not in a plaintiff interview so that
would be from a developer perspective so
I am a Python ester so I would
specifically go for bison it depends on
the ease of use I am happier with Python
I have an ease of use with pike as
compared to R I are taken a look at art
but I still feel the what you see a
learning curve for python is much more
flat compared to that apart if I was to
take up our immediate hundred Python I
can do so much more as compared to R as
well so I could do R that is that but
both are really good statistical tools
and you know data analysis and pretty
much on the same level when it comes to
data analysis is what I have put but you
know that is my preference where I would
use Python any other questions all right
so that should be about it for our you
know interview questions thank you so
much for attending today's session and
you so much Norma thank you for your
kind words and you know have a nice day
