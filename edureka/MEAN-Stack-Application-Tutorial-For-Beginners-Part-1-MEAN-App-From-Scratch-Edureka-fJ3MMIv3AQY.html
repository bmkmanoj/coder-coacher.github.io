to this ninth video of ed ragazzi
angular course for beginners in this
video we're gonna go ahead and learn how
to create a full-fledged cloud
application where we'll be implementing
all those operations such as inserting a
new data to your database or reading
data from your database updating a data
or deleting certain need so basically
we're gonna go ahead with a stack called
as mean stack we'll talk about mean
stack a bit later on so far we have
covered all the so called building
blocks of an angular application we have
worked around components we have
understood how an angular application
get bootstrap what is data binding how
to work with directives how to add
routes to an angular application how to
create forms there are two different
ways that is reactive forms and template
different forms we have also covered
what is the purpose of services in an
angular application now in my previous
video on angular services I talked about
a special module called as HTTP module
for putting all your data access logic
whenever you are retrieving or sending
data access requests to your server
in that case you will be using this
particular module so there I told you
that when we learn how to build a credit
application at that time that is in this
video we're going to go ahead and use
that HTTP module extensively so I'll
show you how to make a state ap services
or how to make all those API calls for
retrieving and sending data alright guys
so let's go ahead and understand what is
a mean stack application so basically a
mean stack reflects an architecture of a
full-fledged functional website where we
have mean as an acronym that stands for
MongoDB expressed angular and noches
now as you know angular will be used as
your front-end application to which your
user will be interacting and then you
will have node and Express as your
server and MongoDB will be used as your
database so for example suppose you
click on a button or you submitted a
signup form in that case your front-end
application will send a request for
putting the data that you filled in the
form to your database that request will
be sent to your server the server will
process that request and finally
interact with database and put that
particular data after that the
we'll send some acknowledgement based on
that your funding application will know
that this particular action has been
completed successfully
now building any functional website
requires these pieces of technology that
is you need a server for processing all
the requests that will be passed from
your front-end application you need
front-end application that is in our
case we are going ahead with angular and
then you need a database for storing the
data not because of this there has been
many acronym that has been spawned so as
to describe the stack that a website is
built on now this mean stack it was
coined by an engineer at MongoDB called
as Valery Karpov so he was the first one
to go ahead with this particular
architecture where he used MongoDB as
his database and node Express has a
server and your anger as his paper now
about Express it is a minimal framework
for writing web application that comes
along with node that we'll be using
today so I will explain you all the
course that is there in our server site
so now what is crud crud again is an
acronym that stands for create read
update into it basically these are the
operation that will be performing on our
data now we'll be getting all these
methods as you can see for creating will
be getting post method from our HTTP
module
similarly for reading the data or
retrieving the data that is there inside
our MongoDB will be using get method for
updating any data that is already in our
database will be using put method and
finally for deleting data we'll be going
ahead with delete method
so all these HTTP methods will be used
in our service class and also in our
server side so I will show you how to do
that and explain you what is the
signature that you have to follow in
order to go ahead with these functions
alright so let's get started with our
shopping list application that we'll be
building today so I have picked this
shopping list application because it is
very simplistic in nature you don't have
much of a logic and it is easy to let
you understand how to integrate
different different pieces of technology
together and second thing is it is also
easy to demonstrate how to go ahead with
all those HTTP methods for retrieving
and sending data that's why I have
chosen such a simple application once
you are femoral eyes with all these
stuff you can go ahead and build complex
angular
application on YouTube alright so first
of all what we need to do is we need to
set up our dev environment that is we
need to set up MongoDB we already have
node for an express it is an again an
NPM dependencies we have to just go
ahead with NPM install command that I'll
show you later on and we already know
how to set up angular or how to create
an angular project in case you are
watching this video for the first time
out suggest you to go ahead with the
second video of this playlist where I
have explained how to set up dev
environment or how to install node for
angular and I have also explained the
entire project structure or the file
structure of an angular application so
you can go ahead and check out that
video so as to get a detailed
explanation of how to set up an angular
application or how to start an angle
project so now the only thing that we
are left with is Express and MongoDB so
let's go ahead and install MongoDB first
so we for that you have to go to the
website call as MongoDB comm
now go to the download tab
now here as per your operating system or
platform that you are working on based
on that
choose the correct installer for example
I am working on Windows so I'm gonna go
ahead with Windows I'm gonna go ahead
with my Community Edition and there this
is the button that you have to click so
as to download the Installer I have
already downloaded so as to make this
process quick now the next step is you
can go ahead and check out the docs so
if you're going at with some other
platform that is Linux or Mac in that
case you can follow the documentation so
I'll show you where you have to go to
getting started and there you will have
installation section and if you go down
you can see that we have different links
for with respect to different platform
that you're using how to install or set
up MongoDB so I'm gonna go ahead with
Windows
now we are already done with the initial
steps that is downloading the Installer
and then after that you have to create
these two directives so let's go ahead
and install MongoDB first so I'm gonna
run the Installer next except next
complete install that's it so installing
MongoDB is not a big deal it's quite
simple in Windows and Mac and Linux as
well all you have to do is follow the
step that has been provided in the
documentation that's it
so all right then our manga diva has
been installed now what I have to do is
I'm gonna go ahead and open my node.js
command prompt and there I'm gonna
specify a directory where my MongoDB
data will be stored and then what I will
do I'll issue a command so as to let
MongoDB know about that particular
directory that I have created so I'm
gonna go ahead with the command make dir
and I'll say data the name of the file
I'll go inside data and I'll create a
subdirectory called as DB all right now
this is the command that you have to go
head with guys that I'm showing over
here just copy it over here and paste it
now
here you have to specify the path of
that particular directory that you have
created so where your MongoDB data will
be stored so let's go ahead and provide
that particular path so I'll say data
now hit enter so now as you can see the
MongoDB service has been started and
whatever data that you're gonna store in
your MongoDB will be stored and that
directory now if you want to start the
service again what you have to do is you
have to go ahead to that particular
directory where your mama deep is
installed so I'm gonna go ahead and do
that I'll say
point four then inside that you will
find a folder called a spin inside that
if you do dir you can see that we have
an executable called as manga d dot exe
that's what you have to run you know it
will start your Moore would he be
service and then what you can do you can
connect this a MongoDB with your server
so as to interact with your modeling so
I'm going to go ahead and say MongoDB
thought exe and the service has been
started by default it will run on port
27 0 1 7 so that's the port that we'll
be working on so now we have already
installed our MongoDB the next step is
to go ahead with our Express so let's go
ahead and print one more terminal and
we'll go to our directory inside that
angular tutorial and then I'm going to
create directory where all my back-end
codes will be stored so let's go ahead
and do that let's say shopping list the
name of the project
and then let's create a directory called
as crud back-end all right now let's go
inside that particular directory now
here what you have to do you have to go
it with the command called as NPM in it
now this will generate packaged or JSON
file for you where you will be
mentioning all your dependencies so to
ask few details about your project so
we're gonna quote with cut back and
version description simple back-end
server I will say entry point file the
file that will be executed in the first
place whenever you start your server so
you can name it whatever you want so I'm
gonna go ahead and name it as entry dot
yes so as to make it obvious now you
have to provide the name of the author
when I go it with my name and then yes
so now as you can see we have that
package or JSON file created for us so
let's go ahead and open that particular
folder shopping list
so this is a package or JSON file guys
here you can see all the details about
your project the name the version the
description and the main field that
tells us what is the entry point file
that will be executed in the first place
whenever you start your server right now
the next thing that we want to do is we
want to install all those dependencies
that we require in order to go ahead
with our back-end code so let's go ahead
and do that so I do CLS and then I'm
going to work with NPM install now first
of all what we need we need Express so
all our code will be written in Express
jas so I'm going to go with Express so
NPM install Express
all right have a look at your package or
JSON file you can see that that
particular dependency that we have
installed just now has been added to
your package or JSON file now once you
are done with your code what you can do
whenever you want to share your quotes
with any colleague or any of your friend
you don't need to go ahead and send them
food along with your dependencies what
you do you just share your quotes along
with this package or JSON file and that
person can go ahead and issue the
command call as NPM install that
particular command will look to your
package or JSON file and will install
all the dependencies from there
in case if you are installing a
dependency and it's not being added to
your package or JSON file then in that
case you can go ahead with a flag called
as - X and save so what I'm saying is
the next dependency that we want is body
parser so I'm going to go it with body
parser this is to parse the JSON data
that we'll be seeing and after that I'm
going to go at with - - safe
now then we need course that is
cross-origin resource sharing I will
tell you that we will talk about it
later on so let's install it for now
and then at last we need Mongoose so as
to interact with our mama DB service
that we have initiated so let's say NPM
install Mongoose
- - safe
so where is now all our dependencies has
been installed so let's go ahead and
create that particular file entry door
chairs from which our execution will
start so let's go ahead and create a
file called entry door chairs and we'll
begin our coding from here so let's
start building our back-end code so for
that what we need to do is we need to
import all the modules so importing
modules so we need Xpress we're gonna go
ahead with Express for importing a
module you need to go ahead with require
keyword so say require Express so these
are the dependencies that we have just
installed next I'm going to go ahead
with Mongoose or this will be using so
as to interact with our MongoDB service
or MongoDB database all right now we
need body parser
the car body parser
then we need curve
require course all right
now let's instantiate our Express so we
gonna go ahead and say we're app equal
to express the constructor that we're
gonna call it alright now the next thing
that we need to do is we need to connect
or MongoDB and then after that what
we'll do we'll start our server so for
that I'm gonna say connect to MongoDB
for that I'm going to use the Mongoose
the variable that we have created so as
to use all those API stack our mom was
provide with respect to MongoDB so I'll
say mom will start connect for
connecting to your MongoDB and here you
have to specify the URL so we'll say
Mongo TV turning on local host and port
2 7 0 1 7 right and after that you have
to specify the name of the database in
case the database doesn't exist at that
time it will be created on its own so
you don't have to worry about that so
we'll say shopping list
now we need to verify whether our
connection to MongoDB was successful or
not so we'll say on connection and here
right Mongoose dot connection dot on and
if it has been connected
I want a console log so basically I'll
go ahead with my callback and I'll say
console dot log MongoDB connected at
port that is two seven zero one so
alright now on connection error
I'll say Mongoose taught connection
taught on and if there is an error I'll
say error and console.log that
particular error so that we can fix it
up now the next thing that we need to do
is we need to specify the port on which
our server will be running so we'll say
Const put let's make it caps and it will
be three thousand then at last we're
going to go ahead and start our server
so for that we'll say AB taught listen
and we'll specify the port and the
callback to let us know that the server
has been started
server has been started at port
all right so let me open the new
instance of our command prompt or what
we can do we can go ahead fit though
texts iater terminal as well so we'll
say no so as to start your server or
search to execute your server code you
have to go it with the command a node
and the name of the ending point file
that is in tail or chairs and we can see
some and here we can see some error so
basically if we are not in the correct
directory so we're gonna say CD crud
back-end and then we gonna put it with
the command norwood entry door chase
some type overhears let's go it fixed
arts would say plus over here and now
little error has been dissolved
all right then
so now as you can see the server has
been started at 3000 and our MongoDB has
been connected as well now what we can
do
basically to check whether our server is
running or not we can send some response
on some routes so let's go ahead and do
that so we'll say AB dot get and we'll
get her out as slash so basically
whenever you visit the URL localhost
3000 at that time we gonna send some
response so say request response and
we'll send the response as
hoo-wah so now if i visit the website
localhost or the URL localhost 3000 you
can see that we are cutting this cannot
get slash this is because we have made
some changes to our server code and
since we have made the changes we need
to go ahead and restart our server again
now instead what you can do you can go
ahead and install a utility call as note
Mon it will keep watching for changes to
your server side code and restart the
server for you so we'll say NPM install
and it will say an own one
let's install it globally so this is the
command to install node 1 that is NPM
install - G load Mon and next time
whenever you have to execute the
server-side code for that you will go
ahead with the command boatmen instead
of node in T dot jeaious that node one
command will look to a packet or JSON
file that we have specified in trade or
chairs as our entry point file so we'll
say node Mon now each time you are
making some changes for example let's
say some changes and you press control
us so as to save your code you can see
the server has been be started for you
so now if you visit local of 3000 this
particular URL you can see the same
content over here that is some changes
all right now similarly what we'll do
we'll be adding the routes for our crud
operation that is create read update and
delete that will take place on our
database and we'll put all those road in
a separate file call us out or chest so
let's go ahead and create that so we'll
say a folder route and inside that will
create a file called as routes store
chairs alright
similarly we will be putting schema that
our MongoDB will be following in order
to store the data in a separate folder
called as model so I'll say model
and here I'm gonna create a file called
a shopping item tour chairs all right
now what we need to do is we need to add
some middlewares first second we need to
import this outscored GS file in which
we'll be adding all our routes with
respect to all the credits so let's go
ahead and add middlewares first so we'll
say app adding middleware the first one
is course no course stands for
cross-origin resource sharing so
basically what we are doing we are
having some requests and response
exchange between two different domains
the first one will be our local host
3000 and the second one will be at
localhost 4200 where our angular
application will be running although
both are running on the same domain but
the ports are different so for that the
course rules has been violated so in
order to bypass that you have to enable
course
so we'll say AB dot use and we'll use
the course middleware that has been
tried by NPM now next middleware that we
need is body posture so we're gonna say
body posture and then AB dot use so this
is the method guys AB dot u so as to add
a middleware to your pipeline so here
we're gonna go ahead with body parser or
JSON because we'll be working around
JSON data and then at last what you need
is you need to define all the routes so
now the middleware that we'll be adding
it will be diverting all the route call
to this outdoor JS files so before that
means to import that particular file so
we'll say Const route and then we'll say
require and here we'll provide the path
of that route start J's file
you don't need to specify the dot yes
extension all right now here what we can
do is AB dot use now whenever there is a
request with route ending with slash API
all those requests will be diverted to
our out start GS file that is what I
want or here so I'll say slash API and
after that I'll divert it to my route
file alright now since we haven't
exported our routes therefore we are
getting this particular error the outer
door cues requires a middleware function
but quarter object so let's go ahead and
export it so in our routes toward GS
file you're gonna say Const Express we
need to bring Express over here so we'll
say Const Express require Express and
then we'll be using router for adding
all our route let's make it where is it
off Const nowhere router which comes
with Express dot outer constructor
alright and then what we need to do is
we need to export it so let's say module
dot exports and we'll export this router
now this router will be used in order to
add all the routes with respect to
different different operations that
we're gonna make so we're gonna have
different operation for inserting a new
data for that we'll be having HTTP
method as post whenever we want to
retrieve the data we want to go ahead
with STD B method call ask it for that
also we're gonna go ahead with different
route so that's what we're gonna do so
let's go ahead and do that so here we're
gonna say router dot cat for retrieving
the data basically this particular route
will be adding so we'll say retrieving
data from database now router dot cat so
whenever call is being made to let's say
testing get route
and then we'll have request/response and
next in our call back in the last case
we want to send a response as rest dots
and
and we'll say get route tested all right
so now let me explain you the flow that
will happen if I make a call to this
particular Road so first your execution
will start with your entry door chairs
where there will be a connection with
your MongoDB and then there will be all
these a middleware that will take place
to first the course that will allow us
to make requests in response between
different different ports in our same
machine second we have body parts or
JSON that will help us to parse the JSON
data that will be in the request body
and after that any call that is ending
with slash a peer that is having a slash
APA in its route will be diverted to
doubt store chairs so I am having a call
with localhost 3000 slash API slash
whatever I write over here for example
if I write fubar in that case it will
look for our route store JS file and it
will find that particular method with
respect to this particular route that is
slash fubar and that method will be
executed then so in right now we have
put our out as testing get route so that
is the only Road that we have written
over here so let's go ahead and add that
route and then we should have that
response as get route tested so let's go
ahead and check whether it is working or
not and you can see that we are getting
the same response so this is how you add
different different routes similarly
we'll be adding roads for all our HTTP
methods we will have a get method for
retrieving data we will have post method
for inserting a new data we'll have
delete method for deleting data and
we'll have put for updating a data so
let's go ahead and add all those methods
who will say router dot post again we
want to mention some route over here so
we'll say post route and similarly we'll
have a callback which will have request
response and our next and later on we'll
write the code for posting or putting
the data so while putting the data we'll
be using all those API stack Mongoose
provides in order to interact with our
database that is MongoDB database so
let's say to Roo later now let's copy
this for
our api's so it is for inserting new
data then we'll have updating the data
for that we will be using put
let's make it put similarly we will have
one method for deleting our data and
similarly we will have a different route
so we'll say slash slash deleting the
data and hair will say delete
you are getting some error let's check
out that error so we'll say unexpected
token all right
so post route instead of comma we have
passed full stop so let's add this com
everywhere
replace that first off with a comma all
right so now we are not receiving any
error anymore so we have added all these
methods so these are the methods that
will be called from our front end
application basically these methods will
be called along with our out that we'll
be putting over here and then finally
whatever logic that we have written
inside those methods will be executed in
order to perform those operations on our
MongoDB database now the next thing that
we need now is to go ahead and create a
schema which our MongoDB will be
following or all the items or all the
data that we'll be sending to our
MongoDB that will be followed by that
particular schema so for that I'm gonna
go inside my model folder that we have
created and inside that I have file
called a shopping item purchase now as I
told you we are going to go ahead with a
simple shopping list application so for
any item that we're gonna add in that
list it will have three field the first
one will be have the name of the item
the second one will be the quantity how
much quantity one of Pi and the last one
will be whether that item has been
bought or not so let's go ahead and say
Const Mongoose equals to require and
then we wanna say Mongoose
then we need to add the schema so we'll
say shopping item schema equals to
Mongoose dot schema inside this schema
method or function I'm gonna pass an
object where I am gonna write my schema
so we'll provide all of key or all the
field that we want to have in our data
or the item data that we'll be sending
to our server
so we'll say item name
now here you have to specify the type of
each of the field that you are gonna
have in your item object so for our case
the item name should be strings will say
item name type it's equal to a string
and then you have one more field called
as required which I'm gonna set it to
true so whenever there is a request for
adding an item where the item name field
has not been filled or it's empty in
that case your MongoDB will reject the
insertion of such data our next thing we
have item quantity so we'll say item
quantity and again we're gonna go ahead
and write the type as string
capital us and then he have required
again and we'll set it to true and then
the last field will be item bought so
this signifies whether the item has been
bought or not so again we're gonna say
type is called two boolean and let's
make this as number and seed of strain
so we'll say it number because the
quantity will be number right we can go
ahead with string as well but it is
better to be as number now hair will say
card and we'll set it as true all right
now again what we need to do is we need
to export this particular schema so
let's go ahead and do that so say
accounts the item equals to module dot
exports equals to Mongoose dot model and
it will export it as item and would say
shopping item schema that we have just
created all right now let me give you a
brief intro about MongoDB basically
MongoDB is a no sequel database that
stores data in the form of document and
now as compared to your I DBMS my sequel
there we have database similarly we have
database in our MongoDB now in our DBMS
we have something called as table which
is equivalent to collection which is
again a group of documents that is
similar to rows that you have in your I
DBMS table in East document you have key
value pair set of key value pairs so the
key that we have mentioned over here are
item name item quantity and item bought
so these are the keys that will be
inserted in each document which will be
inserting in our database and the value
will what the user will specify in the
angular or the front end application so
this is how your mom would EB works
alright so now next what we need to do
is we need to use this schema and we
need to add all the logic to all our
routes now first of all what we need to
do we need to import that for table
schema so let's say Const item equals to
require
and here we're gonna say the name of
that particular shopping item gorgeous
file now here we're gonna refer to the
part of that shopping item tortillas
file so for that you wanna say go back
one step that is because we are inside
our out folder now we have come inside
our crud back and folder here we want to
mention model there is the name of the
folder and then we're gonna provide the
name of the file that we have created
for our schema so we'll say shopping
item alright now the next thing is that
we're gonna use all those API is that
MongoDB provides in order to insert a
data or retrieve data or delete data or
updated data so let's go ahead and do
that now this katma that will be used
for retrieving the data so we're gonna
go ahead with item that's the schema and
we're gonna use all those API of MongoDB
so I'll say item dot find and there this
is the API that has been provided by
your mama DB so this fine what it will
do basically it will return all the
documents or all the data that is being
stored in your database in our case
which is shopping list database so now
here I'm gonna say a callback function
so I'm gonna say function and there we
will have error and the second thing
will have items where all our shopping
items will be stored the data regarding
shopping items in case of error we need
to know about error so we're gonna say
restore Chasen and here we gonna pass
error else we need those items
right so this is as simple as to add
guys now this restored Jason this Jason
method has been tried by your Express so
this haul Express makes your life easy
it decorate all your response method and
provide you with such methods called a
Jason that will add the headers and all
those stuff in your response and finally
you can send it to your front-end
application so now the next thing that
we're gonna do is again post method that
is inserting the data oops we forget to
mention the route the route that will be
called so let's make the route as items
alright so whenever there is a call
local hosts 3000 slash API slash items
in that case this particular route will
return all the items that is stored in
our MongoDB database so now for post
we're gonna go ahead and specify else
item only and here what will happen
basically will be having the item that
we want to insert in our request body so
we will be using all those data and then
finally we will be saving it to our
database alright so now let's go ahead
and create a new object called as new
shopping item and this will be of type
item so let's say new item and here
we're gonna provide the values that
we'll be having in our request body she
will say item name equals to request dot
body dot item name and similarly will be
having item quantity which again will be
request or body dot
item quantity and then item pot well
that will again we'll request body dot
item but all
so I have my new item ready the new
shopping item and I have added all the
values to my new shopping item object
now I need to save this object to my
database so again I'm gonna use my
API that has been provided by MongoDB so
in our case you're gonna go ahead with
new shopping item dot safe and again
we're gonna have our callbacks
this time I'm gonna use the arrow head
function so we'll have error as our
first argument then we'll have us second
argument as item and if there is an
error in that case let us know about the
error so restore JSON error if there is
no error then we can pass a message as
well so let's pass a message so we'll
say message
item has been added success fully
so our post method is done guys now the
next thing in our list is updating the
data so let us go ahead and first check
our two methods that we have created now
for checking your api's we're going to
go ahead and use something called as
postman which is a great Chrome
extension that you can use so as to
check your APS so let's go ahead and see
what it is so it is postman Chrome
extension now this is the extension that
you have to add to your Chrome web
browser know you have to click on
launcher so let's launch it so basically
it will act as our front-end application
for now so basically we will be
forwarding all those get requests and
post requests from our postman and there
will be putting all our data that we
want to send or that we want to store to
our database so the first one that we
want to do is insert a new data because
there's no data inside our database as
of now so we'll say localhost 3000 slash
item so this is the route of your post
method if you see if we go back you can
see the route for our post method is
slash item and before that let's add
HTTP slash all right now inside body we
need to put all our data the data with
respect to the item that we want to
insert let's go to the raw part and here
you gonna cue Jason so the first one
will be the item name let's name it as
egg and then you will have item quantity
it will be of let's say 12 we need a
dozen and then at last we'll have item
bot which is a boolean
since we are adding to a database of
course it will be set to false because
we haven't bought it yet all right so
this is the item that we want to insert
now we'll set the content type as JSON
know whatever do you have to hit the
send button and now you can see we are
cannot post item so let's see
the status is for not for not for so
basically there is no route that is
being masked because we forgot that
slash EPA part because any load that is
having slash epi after a local host 3000
will be forwarded to our route or chase
file so let's go ahead and add that as
well so we'll say local host 3000 slash
API slash item so this was the error
guys now if I click on send as you can
see now we are getting the message as
item has been added successfully now
let's check they're using our get method
or let's add few more items so let's say
this time we need bread and we need to
and add that as well
now what we need to do is we need to go
ahead with our cut method so as to
retrieve all the data or all the items
that has been stored in our database so
we're gonna say HTTP localhost 3000
slash API slash items because this is
the route for our get method now if I
quote and click on send you can see we
are getting the data that is being
stored on our database that we have just
inserted now if you notice we are having
one more field over here called as ID
this is being generated by your MongoDB
you don't have to generate it so for
each of your document or each item that
we'll be inserting to your mama DB
database your database will generate the
value for the key called as ID that it
will add to all those items that we'll
be inserting so now if you want to
delete or update any of these fields or
any of this item what we can do we can
go ahead and make use of this particular
ID field because it will be unique so I
hope you got the idea how we're going to
go ahead with our update method and
delete method so let's go ahead and
write the logic for updating the data
that is there in our database so for
that the method is put now we'll make
the route as slash item and after that
we're going to append something called
as ID the same ID that has been
generated by our mom would be B so we'll
say ID now we can access this ID using a
parent so that is what we're gonna do so
for that let's go ahead and say item the
API that we want to use that has been
provided by Mohammed EP is called as
find one an update so we're gonna say
find one and update and here the first
argument that we want to pass is for
recognizing or identifying that
particular object that is there in our
database I'll say ID equals to request
dot parameters or parents dot ID so this
will basically give me access to this
particular ID field in the route itself
and after that I'm going to use an
operator provide by MongoDB called as
set so as to set the values with respect
to the newer value that we have received
in our request body so let's go ahead
and do that so we'll say dollar set and
here we're gonna say item name because
request taught body taught item name so
basically we can copy this stuff from
here and put it over here
all right so this is what we want so
these are the new updated values and
finally the set operator will set the
values of the item that we want to
update with respect to the newer value
that we are receiving over here so we
are done with our two arguments the
first one was for identifying that
particular item the second one was to
update the values the third one will be
a callback so let's go ahead and do that
as well so we'll have it as our callback
so this is the parenthesis for second
argument so here I'm gonna say function
and we'll have error and result in case
of error we need to know about the error
so that we can fix it up we'll say rest
or JSON error and in case if we haven't
got any error in that case we can go
ahead and do something called as rest or
a result JSON so let's go ahead and see
that as well so again we'll go to our
postman and here we want to go ahead
with a put method before that let me
copy this ID all right so what we want
basically we want to update the quantity
from 12 to let's say 24 so we'll copy
this particular ID from here all right
in order to identify this particular
item then we'll go to put and there the
route is slash API slash item and after
that we have to provide the name of the
ID that will be used to identify this
particular item an inside body we have
to provide the correct or updated value
that we want to have with respect to
this item
so we'll say egg and we'll make it 24
and this is false
all right now let's go ahead and hit
Send now we are getting the original
value over here because we write the
code in such manner that is we return
rest or JSON the result the result
contained the always in value that we
wanted to update now what we can do we
can go it with a get method and let's
make the correct route call and in that
case you can see that data or the field
item quantity with respect to egg item
has been updated
so our update method is working fine now
now the next thing that we want to do is
we gonna go ahead with delete
again for deleting our data we need to
identify that particular item and for
that again we can go ahead and use this
ID so we'll say item and then we'll say
ID now we're gonna say item dot remove
so this is the API that has been
provided by MongoDB and here we're gonna
provide the ID us request or parents dot
ID and the next thing will be our
callback which will be error and result
so in case of error we want to know
about the error so we're gonna say a
rest or JSON error
else you wanna have result she would say
restore JSON result
so now let's go ahead and delete one
other item over here so you will say
let's go ahead and delete this bad item
so copy this ID we'll go ahead with a
delete call and after item we're gonna
go ahead with this ID and just you have
to hit Send as you can see we are
getting a response as and that signifies
the number of item that we have deleted
and the okay status has been set to one
so finally that item has been deleted we
can again verify it using it and this
time it should not see that particular
grade item so as you can see the bread
item has been removed so now all our API
is working so basically our back-end
code is complete now in the front-end
application in the service class we want
to use something called as HTTP module
and there we're gonna make calls to do
all these methods that we have written
with respect to these routes and then
finally your servers will interact to
your database and fulfill your request
or process your request and send you the
correct response so guys this brings us
to the end of the first part of this
means tired application tutorial we
divided the whole video into two parts
as the entire video came out to be of
more than one hour in the next video
we'll be building our front-end or
angular part from scratch and then our
entire main stack will be completed so
don't forget to check out the second
part guys see you in the next video till
then have fun bye I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
