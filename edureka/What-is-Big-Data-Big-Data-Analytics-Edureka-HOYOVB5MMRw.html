but how does it exactly affect our lives
it is involved in our day-to-day
activities even when we are buying
random things here is Amanda buying a
dress and is confused which one to buy
she thinks that will be a good idea to
get some suggestions from her friends
there is a comment from her friend Wow
the same dress with less surprise should
she buy it right away or is it too soon
to decide maybe she should continue her
hunt for the dress a little more she
checks her phone and the same dress is
popping up in her Facebook Instagram and
even YouTube then she gets a
notification from Amazon with 40%
discount promo code it's a pretty good
deal no doubt about it
and then she buys it but if you think
about it was it really her sole decision
to buy this dress from Amazon or was she
persuaded to she even sees a
recommendation for shoes that goes
through the tress those are pretty nice
looking shoes and she gets them too but
how did Amazon grab this opportunity the
money she was about to spend to the
store Amazon has it now big data
analytics in real time helped Amazon to
give the right person the right deal at
the right time for the applications of
big data doesn't end at ecommerce
companies are using big data to target
their customers better and gain insights
to improve their business even pop stars
like Lady gaga are using data of the
users listening preferences to determine
the most popular playlist for her live
cakes and compose more songs of the
preferred genres Facebook is using face
recognition tools to compare the photos
that you have uploaded with those of
others to find potential friend of yours
politicians are using social media
analytics to determine where and how
they have to campaign the hardest to win
the next election the big data that we
are talking about is unstructured data
the volume is huge and it is coming at
an accelerating rate
and our traditional systems are not
capable of handling big data this is
where Hadoop comes with a distributed
framework to store data are known as
HDFS and parallel processing with
MapReduce and real-time processing with
SPARC and he don't need high-end servers
to set up your Hadoop cluster
you can use the bare minimum commodity
hardware the more computing nodes you
use the more processing power you have
what you are doing with one machine
earlier can be done with 10 machines in
just one tenth of the time Hadoop is
also fault tolerant if a node goes down
jobs are automatically redirected to
other nodes to make sure no losses are
suffered Hadoop is fast easy and cheap
to implement it has been anticipated
that US alone will experience a shortage
of 140 thousand to 190,000 Big Data
professionals by the end of 2018 and
this will open up immense opportunities
for product and service companies in
other countries as well so if you're
thinking of learning big data analytics
think of Eddy Rica</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
