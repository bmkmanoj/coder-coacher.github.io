today you will learn to install hedge
base in your single node Hadoop cluster
in case you haven't set up harue big and
hive already please watch the previous
videos in this playlist
let's first download the HBase package
from the internet and since it's free
you can download it from Apaches website
I'm going to Google HBase download click
here to download hedge base so we have a
number of releases here and I have
already downloaded this one point to
point to version I would request you to
do the same because this is a stable
version of hedge base now let me show
you where it is present in my local file
system so the HBase start file you see
here right this is the downloaded
package and need to extract the contents
from this star file we can do that by
running your command from a terminal the
command is tar - xvf filename
okay now that we have one taught this
package there are three steps that we
need to follow we need to first update
the environment variables with hedge
basis path next we need to create a
hedge based directory and finally we
need to update edge basis configuration
files so let's get started with updating
the environment variables for that we
need to first go to our home directory
and run the G edit dot bash RC command
so in the bash RC file H basis path is
not set so I have the path here I'm
going to copy it and paste the path this
is H basis path and we're just informing
the environment variables where it's set
so I'm going to save it and close now we
need to source the bash RC file so that
the terminal understands it's updated
okay now we need to create a hedge base
directory and we can do that by going to
our hedge base folder let me list down
the contents and create a directory here
mkdir and filename so folks this is the
newly created folder all right now the
final step is be to update H basis
configuration files and to update the
hedge basis configuration files we need
to go to this folder so let's go to CD -
on F okay I'm going to list down the
folders here and the HBase environment
or SH and the HBase side door XML these
are the two configuration files which we
need to update so that or how to
clusters up and running so first let's
update the side-door XML file I do a G
edit
HBase side-door XML I go here my
properties are here one of copied it is
and pasted here so first of all here we
indicate that HBase root directory is
present here so whatever processing is
done the data is stored in this HBase
storage folder which is inside this
directory and then there will be a
zookeeper folder which will be
automatically created inside this hedge
bei storage folder which again inside
this directory okay now let me save this
and close this next we need to update
HBase environment or SH let's run a g8
command for that now in here we to
update Java as path so this is where my
Giudice is installed I'm gonna paste the
path okay I'm going to save it and exit
now to start hedge base need to go to a
hedge base folder here we are and then
mean to run the command dot slash bin
slash start - HBase dot Sh
now that HBase is started let me run a
pseudo GPS command to just verify if all
the processes are up and running
okay folks as you can see our hedge
master heads region server and hedge
quorum peer these three demons have been
started recently let me now show you how
to enter the hedge based shell for that
let's change directory we do now go to
this bin directory let me know CD space
bin and now window run the command HBase
shell folks now we are in the HBase
shell which means that HBase has been
successfully configured in our Hadoop
cluster to verify that HBase is running
let me show you the user interface of
hatch master - master which has the
process we can I can show you that using
my mobile Mozilla Firefox one six zero
one zero folks this is the user
interface as it says the version is one
point two point two and if you scroll
down you can notice that our HBase has
been stored in this directory thank you
