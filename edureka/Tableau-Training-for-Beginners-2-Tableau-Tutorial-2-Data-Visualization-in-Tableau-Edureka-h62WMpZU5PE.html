session on data visualization in tableau
this session is primarily focused on
beginners and this is meant to give you
a heads up on what what is tableau all
about and what are the kind of benefits
that one can reap as part of using
tableau for the data visualization
purpose my name is Barney I have over 13
years of experience and majority of my
career I've spent as a data scientist
and doing a lot of data visualizations
on tableau our our executed empty number
of projects in the space
that's inch are about my profile
even before we get started what is this
tableau about most of y'all might be
aware that this is a data visualization
tool however why should you learn
tableau why not any other data
visualization tool which is available
for your axis in order to answer this
question we need to look into one key
thing from a key resource organization
right this organization does a lot of
research by collecting a lot of
resources let me show you that
there is this thing which is called as
Gartner's Magic Quadrant and this is
available live on your tablet website
and as you all can see tableau holes
leaders position Wow what else do you
want right with respect to the ability
to execute and completeness of vision
tableau is in the leaders quadrant of
Gartner's Magic Quadrant which is
extremely well respected across the
globe godness research now there are a
lot of other visualization tools such as
click view it's far away tableau has
already outsmarted click view
MicroStrategy and so on and so forth
let me really want one thing clear up
front that data visualization is not
about generating fancy graphs absolutely
no our objective is to explain a story
or tell a story using data visualization
to our way a stakeholders
if a client gives you a product client
might be having a lot of questions that
he or she wants to answer as part of
data visualization now that should be
your objective help me the business
objectives of the client not present
beautiful aesthetics fancy graphs that's
not a project err point want to remember
now let me show you one small exercise
which I was part of and let us
understand on what data visualization
means and how data visualization will
help you meet your objectives as well as
your clients objective let me show you
this here is there a the visualization
stuff as part of using this data
visualization we have tried to crack a
lot of business problems and that is for
two key stakeholders or rather three one
is for the team coaches another is for
the player and the third thing is for
the fans and by now you all must be
aware that this is something related to
sports because I've spoken about coaches
player and fans absolutely you got it
right this is all about NBA basketball
and as you all know it's one of the
moods followed games in the US and
across the globe so we have told
teams participating 82 games every year
and there is plethora of information
available on this particular website
called Basketball Reference comm 1.04
million records this is the count of
records which were extracted for playing
a game right now we want to quickly
analyze all of this data and try to make
sense out of that what are the key
questions that we want to answer as part
of this we want to develop a data
visualization which helps three key
stakeholders one is team coaches
right and there is the player and the
third thing is fans sorry about the
spelling mistakes there but these are
acquainted kind of questions that get
answered as part of this data
visualization what is the trend in the
performance of the team which of the
worst loss teams and best win games of
the season against which team the team
is strong or a the strongest and against
which team is a team playing weak are
the weakest and how is a performance
rating when played in home run and non
home grounds take example of Indian
cricket team did he wanders home ground
off say they're not doing that's a
different story but they do wonders in
the home ground and abroad it is the
exact opposite thing right so if you
were to analyze the Indian cricket team
and give information to the coach and
say that hey this these are the
combination of players who do wonders
against England team these are the
combination of players who do wonders
against Australian team
if you can segregate and give this kind
of insights back biostatistics that
would one
for please how is that helpful how are
they performing from game to game in the
season
who is scoring more for the team and
against which teams they perform well
right and against whom they perform and
now these are the kind of questions that
we want to answer as part of
visualization our objective once again
is not to generate fancy grants our
objective is to solve these business
problems as part of a visualization and
that is exactly what tableau will help
you do let me open one such data where
utilization in shape well it also
appears amazing isn't it now this is
tableau for you all and we have created
- boots
the one which you're seeing here is
color the - pool you can insert these
kind of images write your own context
there now let me show you these two -
boots by the way in order to come up
with these dashboards we have worked on
a lot of you know individual worksheets
and based on that we have come up with
this I see that there is a question let
me look into what that questions Annan
policies
I'm not audible I am not audible to you
guys can everyone please comment on that
I'm audible all right an answer we'll
request you to check your settings that
you're in because majority of her
friends are able to hear me all right so
this is the interaction part you can
just drag and drop the images right here
you see image right you can just do that
I've just done double click select the
visualization of your choice your job is
done there based on all the individual
sheets you can create a - puh and that
is what I've exactly done here now I'm
here I've created a dashboard which will
heat which will help solve all the
business problems which we have seen
these are all the radius teams which
have participated
I can select a team of my choice there I
can say which year stats I want to work
into I have data here represented right
from 1967 on this 2040 2014 there how
many games did Chicago Bulls win how
many did they lose and I've
appropriately represented that as a
crime graph best ways against so they
have done amazing against Denver Nuggets
Philadelphia
and so on and so forth and they have
done D worst against Los Angeles and
these are the way it stinks right so you
get to see the worst five performances
of a team and what went wrong and the
best five performances of the team and
what went well you also get to see the
win-loss trend in 2014
they've started off with a win a win a
win a win and then stuff then they start
losing in towards the end the buckle
right against the radius teams does how
the Train looks like and if you see the
home ground performance versus the non
home world performance it's visible
clearly that team is performing
extremely well at home ground and
there's a significant dip when it comes
to non homegrown matches right so in
this way you can come up with a lot of
analysis total rebounds right what do
you want to tell us is how many people
are assisting whom right - the number of
steeds steals means I have the
basketball someone else comes in Pig
start by interrupting me I try to shoot
a goal
someone blocks it
how many times you have commit faults
alka Gerard says how do I create a
dashboard I'll show you the Anoka
towards then I'm definitely going to
display that my intention here is just
to give you an overview of what are the
weightiest business problems which can
be solved using tableau and from
playable perspective can anyone see me
who is that player who is extremely
famous in this sport who is extremely
famous in this sport anyone anyone
Jordan Priuses LeBron James
I'll go with the majority PSO propwash
when he sees its
Jonin what is fooling
should I go ahead and keep scrolling and
try to find out that me it's not jardin
by the way
exactly so let me type that and let me
see that here we have Michael Jordan
great guys
y'all are following the game I'm happy
for that so once we select that there's
no data appearing why is that so
don't be surprised friend this 2014 and
this great player the legend has played
to a great extent in this era 1980s
right so you see that this person has
played amazingly well score a lot of
points and Iran ear his performance has
only increased if you see free-throw
success rate has increased did it
further increase oh yeah it has further
increased and in this way this person
has done wonders and I'm telling you a
story here of a key legend of basketball
its performance started dipping once
again and then he has come out he'd come
ahead to actually help his team win the
title and that is the kind of story
which you can see let me show you one
more story which is called as animation
chap we have something called as
animation chart within tableau
using which you can come up with
extremely effective presentation let me
show that is it here
once again while I try to open that or
it's the same thing so let me go here oh
yes this is the one while I was in
Russia to represent all in the IT
employee Association this is the graph
which have used let me put that in a
presentation mode so that it might look
a lot more convincing for y'all this is
an animation chat and this is how I
paste my presentation here is a play
symbol if I click on that you'll see
that these red dots which are GDP of the
radius nations actually start increasing
ways on how the country is grown let me
play them let me play with a faster
piece here we go and you see that the
GDP of us is certainly increasing in in
Japan and then all of a sudden you see
that China has outsmarted Japan and it's
a second largest economy right now this
was pretty fast can I complete the story
which I intended stay in Russia No so
let me reduce that let me reduce the
speed here now it makes sense someone
was asking me these questions at a
Russian GDP so less I told them that hey
your GDP information wasn't available
for long it wasn't available right
publicly now you see that the US GDP is
increasing Germany is doing a great job
there is a Germany there yeah and then
Yuki Japan sorry it's doing great job
and then you have Yuki which is doing a
good job France Italy are doing a good
job Indian GDP is on par with Chinese
GDP and then suddenly Russian GDP seems
to be increasing their Australian GDP is
also increasing now Japan has outsmarted
Russia u.s. still goes strong and then
we have Germany which is fast catching
up
China is all of a sudden trying to gain
its food source strong since 2005 that
it is outsmarted most of the growing
nations
Chinese GDP was on par with Indian GDP
in 2005 I believe if I'm not mistaken
they're not in 2005 I mean yeah here it
seems to be almost DC Japan was the
second largest economy and then what
happened what differentiated China from
the rest of the world right and look at
the Bob bull there it's just increasing
like crazy and towards 2006 2007 2008 so
on and so forth it has zoomed up to a
great extent now that's the current
world we are living in 2013 14 and 15
year period I haven't and I'll analyze
that but these are the kind of
interesting graphs that you can draw
using tableau now imagine you presenting
to a client in this way the kind of
influence that you won't have on the
client would be amazing isn't it
right now let us move on and let me show
you a few more interesting stuff on
tableau this is how the looking field
would be of tableau once you connect for
the first time this is the view that
you're going to look at and then we have
two inbuilt data sources one is sample
superstore and another is world
indicators right
now if you asked me to create a similar
kind of visualization and let me show
you how simple that is in tableau here
is well indicators
it's a nimble data set by the way you
can access that data source and try to
come up with your own visualizations all
I'm going to do is expand health take
health expenditure per capita measure
and drag and drop on the column there
let me close or minimize the show-me
panel and then drag and drop life
expectancy of female here there you go
now I see that there is only one value
appearing here why is there only one
value if I go to the wall indicators if
I right click can say edit data source
our view data source for that case
you'll see this data source
right and you have all the different
variables there you have health
expenditure per capita there is no one
value there are a lot of values here
then why is it that there is only one
value appearing for that
this data is aggregated all these data
is aggregated right in tableau so you
know to disagree gate that all you need
to do is click on analysis uncheck this
aggregate measures there you go the list
of data appears now all you need to do
is drag your dimension on the pages
right and you see that this is the graph
that you know would actually help you
create that animation chat and then now
I can drag and drop the region dimension
in the max P now you see the different
regions African region Asia Europe so on
and so forth if you just press on play
button here you'll see that this starts
moving slowly and now you can tell your
story to the stakeholder it's not a
static graph that you're using you're
using a dynamic graph and telling your
story while the visualization is in
progress this would be far more
effective in comparison to showing
static PowerPoint presentations number
one right so let me take your questions
now so I'll cup
your problem or question in salt here
what software did he use that's a custom
build software lakshmana Padmanabha
right it's not something which was
already in place and Rajat Chopra has
this question how to create our own
leadership you cannot create a data set
but if you already have a data set in
place you can use that to come up with
these kind of interesting visualizations
to solve your business problems for
example
that just says how to create yeah that's
the problem
hanky ramakrishna has this question easy
serpents us if your question is on where
the tabloids opens us no it's a license
to these kind of features would not come
for free but you can still do a trial on
14 day free installation or you can go
with tableau public on which you can
perform a lot of these exercises tableau
is not open source
if not how much is a question from
Watchmen it's nineteen ninety nine
dollars for tabla professional it's nine
ninety nine dollars for table standard
it comes for free if you want to access
student license can normal excess sheets
be used for travel absolutely Rajat
there is a provision for that are there
any prerequisites to learn this course
Pranay if you're looking into building
your career on data visualization of
business intelligence or data analytics
this would fit like a tee for your right
and please can you okay alga has this
question please can you run the dynamic
data such that it shows what happened
across years what do you mean by dynamic
data Alka I didn't quite get you I'm
trying to see the movement or do you
want me to include 2014 and 15 data also
or I didn't quite get that question
because that data was having all the
data ah that would take some time Alka
because I need to establish the
connection and all that
sorry I'll not be able to represent that
now in the interest of time otherwise I
would have done that but offline
probably you can drop an email to
support at Eureka dot Co and they'll be
able to provide you with the answer and
pronounce this question can you remark
we get values now and repeat the
experiment please how can we do that
premier let me show you that can you
show us how the data actually looked
before opening it on time hello Raj it
has a question to run reports does one
need to have some kind of plug-in on the
workstation can this report be deployed
over web you have a web application also
available for tableau all right so a few
of your questions with that don't
disagree get the data
right and then try to run for that my
answer is simple you cannot run on
disaggregate it what could you run on
this one data point right even if you
want to do that here we go
so what since that does that you I'm not
really sure do you want to see the
entire world how is it moving maybe but
I mean that's not a good measure average
is not a good measure at all all right
let me show you one more quick thing on
how easy I mean I'm pretty sure majority
of you are into analytics if you're not
I would request you to pursue that
because that's a sexiest profession of
21st century
oh yes Rajat you can share the data or
the web so that recipient also gets to
see the dynamic changes but they have to
play they have to click on that button
Riya you can do soup right let me show
you this when I click on this connect to
data source you see that there is an
excel file here right so you can work on
Excel one of your questions gets
answered here if you have a text file
load that you Jobs down statistical file
your job you can connect to majority of
the statistical files including your SAS
SPSS and our what else are you waiting
for if you are into data analytics or if
you're planning to pursue your career in
that was the best tool right and then
you can connect to a plethora of other
tools which are tableau specific you can
connect to the tableau server a lot of
other servers look at the number of
servers that you can connect to here
right if you any one of y'all is into
Big Data cloud era Hadoop Haughton works
Hadoop math are hadoo
you can connect to all of these tools
right so you can do an amazing job here
that's another advantage one of you was
asking me a question on hey can you show
me the data how would the data look like
before the visualization here we go
I've just right clicked on the data
source I'm saying view data and this is
how the data would appear right these
are the way these columns these are the
various rows now no matter how much time
you spend on this data raw data bringing
about inferences would be extremely
difficult so let me show you one small
example there let me connect to a
different data source which is inbuilt
which is sample superstore I'll take
your questions in a while if we connect
meister let me complete my staff all
right say I want to look into hey what
is a relationship between sales and
profit as my sales increase are my
profits increasing or am i giving
additional discounts to increase my
sales and hence my profits are
decreasing what's happening here so let
me drag and drop profit measure onto the
column shelf and let me drag and drop
sales onto the roadshow oh my god I
should have had sales on the x-axis and
profits on the y-axis now do I need to
remove these and then drag and drop once
again or do you need to swap these once
again absolutely no all you need to do
is click on this swap option your job is
done right when I click on the swap
option look at what happens to profit
and sales they swap the positions there
there you go you have only one major
here now once again it is aggregated in
order to disaggregate this all we need
to do is go to analysis and click on
aggregate measures now I see for a fact
that as an how the scenes increase the
profits are increasing but sales less
than 5,000 has a mixed response we see a
positive trend as well as a negative
trend right now
the prediction model on top of that and
tomorrow if my sales department comes to
me with a sales figure saying that hey
this month we have met $500,000 or we
have made $1,000,000 but my sales team
comes up with these kind of numbers then
I should be in a position to predict and
tell them what would be the profits even
before someone calculates them how can I
do that oh absolutely
tableau is not just good at data
visualization it is great analytics as
well so let me click on analytics here
we have something called a string line
all I need to do is drag and drop but
then I went ahead dragged and Rob you
see on the top that there are four
options appearing right I can either do
linear regression logarithmic
exponential polynomials if any one of
y'all are aware of these distributions
it's okay otherwise do not worry let us
just drop that and it generates a linear
regression now when I hold my mouse
right there is an equation which is
appearing there 0.18 double zero six
seven x sales plus or minus twelve point
seven three to nine that is the
statistical equation now if someone
gives me the sales value all I'm going
to do is input the sales value in this
equation to get the profits
you can do this with a bunch of other
examples hydrosis sorry wait was as
calories consumed if you go to a
dietician and say hey doctor I'm eating
so many calories I'm eating this kind of
food then the doctor would simply teen
the calories consumed in this kind of an
equation and say hey if you continue the
current lifestyle you will gain 10 kgs
weight and thereby you might be getting
hot stroke
or you might become a diabetic bitch so
all these kind of analysis are happening
as we speak
and the other two bands are called as
confidence intervals right now one key
takeaway for you from statistics
perspective if someone comes to you and
says can you tell me what will be me
sales for the next quarter you should
never ever give a single number
why because probability associated with
any single number is always zero
if I say hey what would Indian cricket
team score against the South African
team tomorrow in a one day international
if any one of y'all says 300 I would say
that the probability associated with 300
is zero you should always give a range
right if you would have made a statement
such as if Indian team might score
anywhere between 275 to 325 if the bad
first then it makes sense there is a
probability associated with that hence
we have these bands which you see these
are called as confidence levels right
now you can just right-click for the
statisticians click on edit current
lines you can go with logarithmic
exponential or whatever comes to your
mind while you fold it is linear
regression and if I right click and
sorry if I click on describe trend model
I see the entire regression equation and
that's the amazing stuff this is one
thing now let me take your questions and
I'll show you the dashboard part because
there were the questioner on that I
think we can use geographic data set to
absolutely we can use running can we
show the change in profit as scenes
increases can we show the change in
profit as sales increase I believe that
is what we have shown like the change of
es in previous one yeah we can do that
we can do that but you know in the
interest of time let me move on to the
next visualization towards the end if
the time permits I'm going to show you
that
you
all right in the formula there's place
um - there's conquer sees is it plus or
minus it is plus negative of that so
it's - basically it's plus minus 12.1 -
so it'll be negative
how do we integrate tableau with SAS
okay
how does it vary so I'm Rita como has
this question on how do we integrate
tableau which sense as I've told you all
you need to do is click on that go to
the statistical files SAS is there for
you so use the SAS file and do that yeah
there are a lot of API available which
will help you connect with the external
sources right and with respect to are
also there are a small commands that you
need to execute with respect to SAS also
you need to run a few commands on SAS
and on tableau to establish the
connection you can do that right but
friends extremely sorry in the interest
of time let mean one I'll take your
questions towards them no I haven't come
up with that formula that's a bigger
discussion all about right there's a
bigger equation so if you're asking me
how did we get that equation
that's called as linear regression
equation it's calculated based on lot of
statistics right for this you need to
have some kind of statistical background
this is y is equal to MX plus C that's
the equation of the line there
right nm is the slope of the line house
land the line is and we're on y-axis
does this line intercept that's call SC
y is equal to MX plus C that's the
equation of the line if we can go back
to our school days we might have discus
that but now it's becoming very relevant
the things which we learned at school by
the way anyways let me move on and show
you - boot push which I'll take your
question sir so bear with me please let
me rename this particular sheet by
right-clicking and say hey I want top
five customers all I'm going to do is
drag and drop customer name on the
column drag and drop profit on the roads
why do they do so because I want the top
five customers now I do not want it to
be represented in the vertical format so
let me swap here are my customers
they're not ordered they are not ordered
so let me arrange them in descending
order by clicking on that here we go
now if you just click on the drop-down
of customer name click on filter there's
a an option called top here if I see
there's something called as my field you
can enter your own value or you can
change this and say hey I want only the
top five customers based on profit I
click on OK I see only the top 5
customers there look at how simple it is
now probably it makes sense for me to
provide these top five profit making
customers additional this comes that
would be more beneficial right now let
me create a new sheet let me rename that
she and say bottom five customers let me
do the same thing let me drag and rub
the customer name and let me drag and
drop the profit once again I want to
swap it and represent that in horizontal
format the
I want the barsen horizontal comments
once again I've swapped it let me
arrange the customers in decreasing
order of profits or let me do the other
way right in the decreasing order of
profits now you need to do a filter I go
back to the top option here I go by
filled in still top this time I'm going
to change it to bottom either I'm
interested in coming up with bottom five
customers so I click on OK there you go
but you know this kind of representation
looks a little awkward let me reset the
axis all I need to do is right click on
x-axis click on edit access and let me
reverse the direction and even before I
click OK I want to check whether it's
going to work on up so let me click on
apply there let me see whether it does
work wow it has worked so I'll click on
OK now to work sheets now let me create
a third sheet worship if you want to
generate a map right all you need to do
is select latitude and longitude expand
the show-me panel and click on symbol
Maps
let me collapse the show-me panel now
the world map appears here each time you
get the latitude and longitude values
you can generate the woma and by default
the show-me panel choose which maps are
which graphs would make sense data
graphs which have blurred out would not
be applicable in the scenario and when I
hover on that map that particular graph
right also that has a blue border
highlight right that means that's the
default chart which you have to use
tableau based a lot of data
visualization principles is telling you
that hey use this map it makes sense
right and also there are explanations
here there should be one geo dimension 0
or more dimensions and zero are two
measures
let me collapse a ShowMe panel by the
way that's a floating panel right this
one show me is a floating panel I can
just float it around let me close that
it will go back there yeah now I want to
see profits by state so let me drag and
drop concrete under the color on the max
beam you see United States pop up all of
a sudden why is that - in the underlying
data there is only country only United
States details right now if I want to
get into the state level all I need to
do is click on the plus sign there right
you get the states and then you can
click on minus plus you can fear on you
can get to the let me click on that why
isn't work it's working
yeah now it's working yeah we can drill
down to the city level to the postal
code level you know you can do all those
things right now let me stop it at state
level I want to see what are the profits
at the state level so now let me drag
and drop profit on the color
there you go and tableau is intelligent
enough to see that hey you have negative
profits I'm going to represent that
using the red and wherever you have high
profits I'm going to represent that
using dark green and this is called as
the speed of the pointer right it's
lighting speed so when I just move my
mouse pointer around it's going to not
the even a split of a second to change
the values it's real time there look at
that the speed at which it's changing
amazing right now let us create a - pool
before that let me rename this I'm going
to rename this as steep by profit now
let me create the - boot here is the
dashboard icon there let me click on
that now what if you forgot to rename
these sheets you have renamed search
well I'm good what if you forget to
rename the sheets do you need to go back
to the sheets check what that is come
back to the dashboard and then pull a
sheet now all you will do is hover your
mouse pointer on the sheets which you
have created and it's going to show
small visualization here as a thumb ring
look at the strength of travel the right
amazing now stayed way profit let me
drag and drop that here and the
dashboard now I also want top five
customers so I can either please these
top five customers on the top half of
the graph of the dashboard are towards
the right side I've done it towards the
right side I also want to represent the
bottom five customers all I'm going to
do is drag it to the bottom off the left
side right side sorry now you have the
top five customers bottom five customers
in the state by profit
if I click on this takes us him nothing
happens if I click on California here
nothing happens
why is that sir because you haven't done
anything on this right now if I click on
any of these right for example say I've
clicked in Texas I want to see the top
five customers in the bottom five
customers of Texas only I don't want
overall top five and bottom five
customers so all you need to do is click
on this drop-down and click on users
filter now look at the magic which
happens I click on Texas I see the top
five customers and bottom five customers
of Texas right I mean there is only one
customer person and if I click on
California you see the customers from my
perspective that's the strength of
travel once again so this is
had for you all today let me take your
questions now let me see what I can do
you
all right folks I'm waiting for your
questions
hope I've answered most of your
questions if not I will request you to
repost your question so that I might
take your questions now yeah I see there
are a few questions coming up is there
any website to have practice on table
I'm Rita you can actually go ahead and
look into tableau website itself right
and Ed Eureka has 30 hours of tableau
training right let me show you that
sorry for missing out on that just a
minute sir Eureka provides and there's a
bad starting on 24th October for any one
of y'all is interested to join that
right so you'll be taught about the
radius conditional formatting scripting
linking the way discharge creating
dashboards integrating if any one of
your is aware of statistical tool called
are you can integrate table with R and
towards end you get to implement one
project life which will make your
exposure to tableau both from
theoretical and practical perspective
very robust 30 hours of training 20
hours of assignments friends 50 hours
and 15 hours of project work and most
interestingly right you will get
lifetime access to your visualization or
elearning sorry whenever there is a
training the session is recorded and the
session is shared across with all the
participants and you will get that
access for the rest of your life
probably you can even give it to your
kids if there is no revision in the to
version right and one more interesting
part is there is 24 by 7 support that
means at any given point of time any
question that you have just drop in an
email to Ed Eureka and there are pool of
trainers and one or the other person
would solve that for you
right that's the interesting part and
this session recording and the
presentation will be available to you
within 24 hours to put then when you
close the session there will be a
feedback box so we box right pop-up
window I request you all to take the
feedback and then provide your genuine
feedback on how we can make the future
webinars more interesting and more
engaging all right
I'm Rita practice questions I mean I
would request you to look into Kaggle
that's an open source crowdsourcing
platform wherein there a lot of
challenges posed you can also earn as
part of participating in man say
approaches Prabhu answers questions cf
purchase their stuff question how do i
distribute the report to another person
to view for this we have something
called as tableau reader similar to your
adobe reader right if i have a PDF
document i said it send it to you prabhu
how would you read that obviously you
would install auto baccarat reader and
get your job done right on similar lines
we have tableau reader if it all the
opposite party does not have a tableau
desktop our tableau public comes for
free you can save your visualization to
a PDF document you can save your
visualizations as a PPT and also share
it across so these are the bunch of
advantages right Rajat has this question
I think when we use it then we can have
yep how to integrate it with
to have a mama that's extremely simple
integrating with tableau as I've shown
you table already has he you know
integration with a lot of Hadoop and one
and snap our hot and works cloudera
right there are just ODBC connectors
right that you need to install you need
to provide the sarony ifconfig is a
command that you need to run if you are
already aware of that right on the hive
server
hive server to has a lot of additional
features it's not available in Mac my
bleep but yeah you can just use it give
the pro so one 'man then you should be
good to connect there being a fresher
can I get a job in the stablish bond
Priya's question absolutely Brown appear
the craze for tableau has increased
tremendously because it's also
statistical to right it's also
statistical to right you should not
discount that from there that's the
reason why tableau has a lot of edge so
yeah there plethora of opportunities
even for freshers Prabhu has this
question should the other person need to
purchase a license or is there some kind
of P where available
yeah I've answered that tableau or
reader is there or this person can save
the visualization to the PDF are 2 PP DM
and share it across how can we show
dynamic data with PowerPoint as source
no that will not happen Alka so it's a
static content which are going to share
but in order to see the dynamic
visualizations or the animation chart
which I've shown you one has to have
tableau reader
sure from establish a used only with our
because I really hear SAS and tableau
this is not because of you know tableau
I would say this because of the
popularity of our our has at the moment
fifty percent of the market share
I'm a die-hard fan of our so if you guys
are looking into getting into analytics
I would say go with our any training
with our mastering data analytics with
our advanced predictive modeling with
our do it with our Gallio we have
tableau certificates tableau specific
certifications as such you have tableau
server certification as well as you have
tableau desktop certification I believe
there are two levels in tableau desktop
certifications and they're very
preferred yet absolutely and this course
provided by Eureka will help you clear
that certification alright folks thank
