welcome to the second part of this
angular form video of Erika's free
angular course for beginners now in this
part I'm going to talk about reactive
forms now in the previous part of this
angular form video we understood how to
go ahead with template driven forms
there we understood how we can go ahead
and find different different directives
in order to implement template different
forms in angular so let's get started
with our reactive approach now while
working around reactive forms we won't
be using directives such as ng model
will be relying on underlying api's
instead of binding object models to
directives as waited in template driven
forms so we'll be creating our own
instances inside a comprehend class and
construct our own Java Script models
this will allow us to write code that is
easily testable keeping all the logic
intact in the same place instead of
putting it around different form
templates so I know of the theory guys
let's go ahead and learn how to
implement reactive forms in angular and
what are those modules or what are the
codes or syntax that we have to follow
in order to do so so I'm going to open
my text editor now what I'll do I'll
spin a polite server using ng surf
command so as to host my application
locally
all right so the belt process has been
completed but seems to be somewhat okay
all right so the build process has been
completed select go ahead in our browser
to localhost 4200 because that is the
port at which our application is being
rendered now unlike template driven
forms in case of reacting form we'll be
working around competent class so more
work will be inside our component class
whatever controls that we want to define
will be defining inside our corporate
class so let's go ahead and create a
component
and GG component reactive forms now
whenever you are working around reactive
forms or whenever you want to implement
reactive forms you have to import a
certain model called as the active forms
module so if you remember in case of
template different forms we used to
import forms module in the similar
fashion whenever you are going ahead
with reactive forms you have to import
reactive forms model so let's go ahead
in our route module and there let's
import reactive forms module from
address angular slash forms sorry for
the typo
now you're gonna put it inside your
importer now finally you have imported
the reactive forms for you now the next
thing that I'm going to do is I'm going
to implement an interface that we'll be
using as a model for the data that we'll
be receiving from our form so let's go
ahead and do that
user tortillas export interface user you
will have three fields name which will
be of type string
then you will have contact
and at last we would have email
so finally our interface has been
created now we need to visit our
component and import that particular
interface
all right so
is the data that we'll be receiving from
our forms will be user details so we
will be having three fields that is name
of the user contact number of the user
and the email ID of the user and then
we'll push the data that we have
received into an array of type user so
let's go ahead and create that list I'm
gonna go ahead and create a list here's
a list this will be of type user and for
now let's initialize it with an empty
array now so as to create our controls
for the form that we have and group them
together as a form we're going to go
ahead and import two classes the first
one is called as form group the second
one is called a swarm control from add
great angular slash forms
let me give you a brief intro about form
group and form control classes so these
classes for example form control class
it tracks the value and validation
status of an individual HTML form
controls such as input and offers a
different public EBI methods which we
can work around with similarly form
group as the name suggests it keeps
track of the value and validation status
for the set group so it is a group of
form control instances so the first
thing that we'll be doing is we'll be
creating our form group model and
instance of form group so let's go ahead
and do that so let's name it as form of
type form group
now what we need to do is we need to
register all the form controls all the
controls that we want with respect to
name contact and the email ID inside
this form groups so we're going to go
ahead and use this form instance and
we'll be using the constructor of form
group in order to register all the form
control instance so basically we will be
passing an object that object will
contain all the controls that we want so
the first control will be of name new
form control
now inside the constructor of palm
control the value that you only pass
will be for your initial data the
initial letter that you want with
respect to the control in your form in
the template that will be a displayed
for now let's go ahead with a null data
or the empty string then we want and
control for contact
and at last we want to go ahead with
email
so finally we have instantiated the
formed loop model now it's time to bind
this to our Tom so we're gonna go ahead
with our template reactive form template
and here I'm gonna create a form element
and we remove all this method and action
attribute because we are not going add
with any xhr requests and also I'm going
to go ahead in the user active coil is
no violated it rest exposed to use its
native validation methods now here what
we want is we want three controls namely
name alright so it will be named and we
want an input which will be of type text
and I'll talk about this name attribute
later on once I have finished with
defining all the fields or all the
controls that I want in my forms or all
the input element so I'm going to copy
this up now we want one for our contact
one for email alright let's go ahead and
add our bootstrap classes as well so
we're going to go ahead with form group
similarly we're gonna add puts our class
to our input element as well
form control
now in order to associate your form
element with that of the form group
instance that we have created so just
now we have created this form group in
sense so we need to associate or bind
this form group instance with that of
our form element for doing that you need
to use a directive called as form group
so I'm going to go ahead and use that
and here you pass the value of that
instance to which you are associating
your form element in our case which is
formed
now the next thing that we want is we
also want to associate each of this
input element with that of our form
controls so for that we have an active
called as form control name which will
get the same value as we have assigned
or which we have assigned to our form
controls so the first form control was
name then the second one was
our contact then again we cannot go
ahead with
email now remember guys you have to
declare this palm group as a binding so
as to associate your form group instance
with that of your form element and you
have to use form control name as a
directive with a corresponding object
key name which you have defined as your
form control so for now we have created
our basic templates now what we need to
do is we need to go ahead and add a
submit function so whenever a person
clicks on a submit button a particular
method will be executed so that we can
access the value that has been entered
by that person and then we'll push that
value to this user list array so let's
go ahead and add a button which will be
of type submit add user all right
now here again we're gonna use or catch
ng Submit my event so I'm gonna go ahead
with ng submit event and I'm gonna bind
it with a method called as add user now
here what I'm gonna do I'm going to pass
this form group instance this is
actually exactly same as the template
driven approach but what you can do you
can optionally reference the form
internally to the component instead of
passing it as a value in the function
which we'll be seeing later on so what
for now what we'll be doing will be
passing this form over here so as to
access the values and then let's go
ahead and create that method that we
have defined over here so I'm going to
go ahead inside my form component and
I'm going to create this method which
will take the form or the instant that
we have or the value that we have passed
and then let's control it out form dot
value all right now the next thing that
I have missed over here is to nest my
component with that of our app component
so let's go ahead and do that
so this is our phone now if I add any
value over here
and then an email ID Aashish at the rate
a do Rico if I click on this button you
can see that we are able to receive the
data or the values from our farm now the
thing that is missing over here that we
are not able to receive the contact and
the name field let's go ahead and check
our quotes once again so we have
assigned the controls a form control
name properly we have binded it properly
this is for contact and this is for
email
similarly we gonna go ahead and check
out over here as well so everything is
fine over here alright now let's see the
value it's correct
similarly it's correct okay so the
reason that we are not able to receive
it because of the type of mistake that I
have done it will be form control name
let's go ahead and rectify it
and let's try it out again Ashish
so now we are able to receive all the
values that we want sorry for the typo
voice so now what I was trying to say
that in template driven approach what we
did we passed and template reference
variable with respect to the form that
we have so as to access all the values
now what we can do we can also access
all these values internally from this
form Group instance itself so what we
can do we can go ahead and console the
value of the form group instance that we
have created inside our component so I'm
going to use the disk keyword so as to
refer to that particular property and I
am gonna go ahead and check out the
value and if we get the same value in
both the cases then that means that we
do not require to pass the value or the
form instance in the function so as to
access the values at all so let's go
ahead and do that so I'm going to go
ahead with our sheesh and then
now if I click on a user can see that we
are getting the same values so the first
value that we are receiving over here is
because of the value that we are passing
in our ng submit function and the second
we are receiving is because of the form
group instance that we have graded the
property that we have created and using
that we are exiting the same value so we
do not require to pass this value inside
our function at all so that's the
difference case so now what we can do is
let's go ahead and add our functionality
so as to put it inside the area so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
this thought user list
dot push and each time whenever a person
is clicking on submit button I want to
push that value inside my user list so
let's go ahead and do that
this thought-form dot value all right
now let's do one more thing let's go
ahead and put an unordered list with an
li tag and here I'm going to use ng for
directive to iterate over my list user
of user list let's add a bootstrap class
to make it more presentable so it will
be list group and this one will be list
group ID
now here I'm gonna interpolate the value
of user that I have so let's go ahead
and check out whether it is working or
not
all right so the problem that we are
having because we haven't assigned we
haven't accessed the individual field
that is there inside our object
so as you can see everything's working
out now the thing that we have still not
worked on is the validation part now
let's go ahead and understand how we can
go ahead and add a validation so we have
three fields right we have one field for
our name
so the first validation rule that we can
add over here is for required now in the
template driven approach what piece to
do is to use a directive called as
required in the template itself so as to
add the validation rule but in case of
reactive forms you don't need to go
ahead and do that what you do is
basically in your form control instance
you pass your validation rule as a
second parameter so here what you do is
basically need to import Pareto from
your forms
all right then
first argument was for an initial data
the second argument will be for all the
validation rules that you want to add so
I'm going to go ahead and use my
validators and I'm going to say quality
restored required because I want all the
field to be mandate for user to enter
now same thing I want for my contact dot
required and similarly I want the same
for my email know next thing what we'll
do we'll add a disabled property not
submit button so whenever any of this
criteria of the validation rule that we
have added is not followed by the user
the person who is submitting the form
that button will not be enabled till all
the validation rule has been satisfied
so let's go ahead and do that so we're
going to go ahead with a disabled
property and we're gonna use the same
form instance overhead form dot invalid
so till the time the form has some
invalid values or any of the validation
rules has not been satisfied at till
that time pure button will be disabled
so now you can see the add button is not
working so let's go ahead and add a CSS
class so as to make it more visible

success
now as you can see the button has been
disabled until you enter value in all of
these field then only the button will be
enabled
now apart from that we want more
validation rule for example for email we
want a valid email to be entered by the
user so for that what we can do we can
add more validations in order to add
multiple validation rule to your form
control what you do is you put it inside
an array so what you're gonna do here is
you're going to go ahead and pass an
array and there you're gonna append all
those validation rules that you want to
add to your form control so for example
I want value Ritter's thought email
because this is the email field now
let's go ahead and check out whether
this works or not so for example if I
have entered the value now here what I
want to do is I'm gonna go ahead with
some incorrect email let's go ahead with
Josh Todd 23 you can see the button has
not been enabled yet let's add more
validation rule over here
now what I want to do is I want to add
more validation rule to my contact field
as well so another validation will be
the person should not be allowed to
enter character into the contact field
the second thing is suppose we are
expecting the user to enter their mobile
number you can go ahead and correct the
label as mobile number as well let's go
ahead and do that so I'll say contact
it's a mobile number alright this is
absolutely fine this is just for the
demonstration guys don't take it too
seriously now the thing is that we need
to add a validation so that the person
through eyes the correct mobile number
and a moral number comprises of digits
instead of characters and it is of ten
digits so we're going to go ahead and
put all those rules over here so again
what you need to do is we need to pass
an array array of all the validation
rules that we want the second rule will
be validators dot pattern where we're
going to pass a reg X and I had that reg
X with me
all right now also what I want is I want
the number two P of ten digits in length
okay and the max width should be of
10-digit as well
all right so for now we have added all
the validation rule in the previous
video if you remember we print ahead
with the max length in our directive in
our template with all the letters we're
in small so please keep in mind while
going ahead with such validation rule
and similarly I want validation rule for
my name field as well so I want the user
to enter characters only and the second
thing is a person's name cannot be a
single character so I'm going to go
ahead and use that as well
all right so we have added all the
validations now what we need to do is
when to display the correct message
whenever a person is violating any of
these validation rule so we gonna go
ahead in our template and then what we
want to do is we are gonna add a div tag
and here we're gonna use alert alert
danger the bootstrap class for
displaying some warning or some message
now here I'm going to use ngf directives
so based on certain condition that is
whenever a person has violated certain
validation rule on that case I want to
display a certain message so again I'm
going to use the same form group
instance with which I have associated my
form element so I'm going to go ahead
with form and then it provides you
different API such as get now here you
can access the control to which you are
referring to so I'm going to go ahead
with my name control and there I'm gonna
check my whether it has got any error or
not so I'm going to work with has error
function and inside that I'm gonna have
that validation rule which I want to
check with respect to this particular
div tag code for which the corresponding
message will be displayed so let's go
ahead with required first and now let's
display it as name is required
alright let's copy this to all of our
controls here will be having contact is
required the control that we are
referring to is contact and the error is
same over here similarly I'm gonna go
ahead with my email
now just a quick intro what ngf does is
based on certain condition it adds so
remove this dev element from the donk
so whenever this form got get email dot
has error will return a true value in
that case it will add this particular
dev element to my Tom and you will be
able to see this particular message and
finally your class your bootstrap class
will add style so that it looks like you
are displaying some error message
overall this whole method returns a
boolean value so whenever that
particular field has that particular
error or someone has violated a
particular validation rule that you have
specified over here it will return as
true and finally the message will be
displayed so let's go ahead and check
out whether
it's working or not so as you can see we
are having the message being displayed
and as soon as I entered a text over
here we are seeing that the message has
been vanished now what I want is that I
want this message to be displayed on the
runtime as we read in our template
driven forms so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use something called as
form dot get again the control name dot
touched now what will happen is if a
person has clicked on this fill and then
intentionally has left this field vacant
and move on to the next field in that
case only the message will be displayed
over here the same thing has to be added
everywhere
all right let's see whether it is
working or not
all right so the thing is I have to
change the name the control name to
which we are referring to
so now it's fine now we want to
display different messages based on the
validation that we have provided so if
the number that a person has provided
has less digits to that of expected in
that case it should explicitly mention
that particular error for that what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get rid of
this required for now and I'm going to
go ahead fit and firm dot get email dot
invalid see if both of these conditions
are true that is there is some
validation issue with the control that
we are referring to and second the
person has click on then field and then
click on anywhere else other than that
particular field in that case only that
particular type element will be added to
the top and inside this we're going to
add multiple tags now we do not require
any bootstrap class over here now here
what we're going to do is you can again
use ng F and we're gonna specify the
validation rule that for which we want
to display the message all right so the
first one will be has error required in
that case I'm going to say name is
required all right
I like this for email so I'll go ahead
with email is required now similarly we
can have a case where the person is
entering some invalid email so I'm going
to go ahead and add the validation rule
hours email and we'll say invalid email
all right I will add it on the other
controls as well
so this for our contact no for our
contact you're going to go ahead and
change the name of the control that we
are referring to contact
first error will be the contact is
required now the second error can be
your invalid contact in this case the
error will be off type let's say min
length alright and we can say of mobile
number yeah we can say less than 10
digits all right similarly we can have a
tip tag for max length so I'm going to
go ahead and put more than 10 digits and
sorry for the type over here guys
so let's go ahead with our name
now we're going to change it to name
so the first panelist name is required
the second will be of type packing
all right so we forgot the pattern part
in our contacts which will be adding
later on so here we'll say invalid name
all right
now let's go ahead and add this over
here same thing I think you should copy
this up and put it over here and this
time it will be invalid contact
now let's change the controller name to
name now I guess we have done fine so
basically we have added all the nzf dev
tags for displaying the alert message
for the error that person will be doing
while entering the forum now let's go
ahead and check whether it is working
fine or not for example if I go ahead
and put a mess one two three and if I
move on to the next field I should get
an error as invalid name similarly if I
put just a single letter again if I go
ahead you can see the same error is over
there I'm gonna go ahead with my full
name over here now for the contact
number let's go ahead with the character
you can see we are getting the message
as invalid contact now let's add the
number so now here we are getting an
unexpected behavior so let's go ahead
and check that so the first thing for
the contact was we put it as thirst we'd
put it as invalid both of these truth
and only we will go ahead now inside
invalid we have required then you have
min length all right so here you have to
pass it as many lengths it's small L and
similarly for others no if I go ahead
fourth or she Bakshi the name is fine
now let's go ahead with nine eight seven
six four three two one zero
if I go more than that you can see the
error is there now if I go less than
that you can stock in the error is there
now if I remove that we can see the
contact is required so everything is
working fine now similarly for email we
can go ahead and check it out as well
the email is required and the invalid
email poor thing our pink represent at
the same time because an empty field
will be having the same as an invalid
email so what we can do we can merge
these two so I'm gonna say copy this
over here so what I want is basically
when a person is leaving that field as
empty then at that time this invalid
email should not be there at that time
so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it as
not
so let's see whether it works a lot so
the email is required is happening we
are not getting second error so what is
happening where it's quite simple
whenever you are leaving the field as an
empty it will return a value as true
which I'm making a false and filing am
putting in an and operator with out of
my email validation that email directive
that we have applied and using the and
operator we are getting the final value
as false and therefore invalid email
development is not being added to our
table
so I should do the same thing over here
so what I want is this particular
validation will return true in case the
pattern is not matching where you are
going at with characters at that time I
should get only one message not this
more than ten digits message so I'm
gonna go ahead and put his hand and then
put this so in case I am going ahead
with her character this will be a true
and I am going to make it as a false the
same logic that we have applied before
now let's try this out again we are
getting all right so since I've applied
it more than ten digits let's go ahead
and apply the same thing over here as
well so now as you can see we are
getting in well contact so finally
everything's working out so let's go
ahead and see whether a form is working
correct or not
then let's go ahead fill it Josh and
let's change the email as Josh and let's
say so everything is working fine so I
guess now you have understood how
reactive form works guys I've shown you
all the example how you can go ahead and
use a form group and form controls in
order to achieve reactive forms so I
have covered everything guys so this is
how you go ahead with reactive forms now
the important question when you have to
use a reactive form or where you should
go ahead with template different forms
so if you notice in the active forms we
have specified all our logic inside the
component class which is very easily
testable
the second thing is all the validation
rules has been added inside my component
class so in all those cases where we
have multiple or complex cross
validation rules which encompasses
multiple fields together in those cases
it is easier to go ahead with reactive
forms whereas template event forms are
good for going ahead fit all those forms
which are very simple in nature and the
second thing is that they have very less
complex validation rules that
encompasses multiple fields so that is
the important point guys so that was all
about reactive forms and template levant
form guys so we have understood the
difference between these two the first
one is more dependent on directive
whereas the second one gives you all
those api's who has to work around with
now in the next video i'm going to talk
about services you will understand a
concept called as dependency injection
as well which is used to inject the
service into a particular component so I
hope this session was informative for
you so see you in the next video till
then have fun bye
