you guys are doing well now in the
previous video of this Erica's free
angular course for beginners I have
shown you how to create a mean stack
application from scratch so there
basically we learn how to integrate
different pieces of technologies such as
MongoDB express anger and node also
abbreviated as mean stack together so as
to build a fully functional website now
the problem with that particular website
was that we were able to access that
particular web application that we
created that is the mean stack app
locally only what if you want to go
ahead and deploy your application on a
cloud so what are the steps that you
have to go ahead so what we're gonna do
is basically we're gonna go ahead and
deploy our mean stack application on a
platform known as Heroku and best part
about here okuu is that it provides you
all those services for free so let's go
ahead and deploy our shopping list miner
application before that let's have a
look at our shopping list mean
application and see if I go to localhost
4200 before that let me go ahead and
spend my server and serve my application
as well so I'm gonna go to my directory
crud back-end
all right here I'm gonna go it with a
command ng serve so as to serve my
application on port 4200 and similarly I
need to spin my server as well the
Express server that I had and before
that what I need is I need to start my
mom would he be services
alright so my MongoDB service has been
started on PO 2701 7 here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna go to my back-end code
inside the back-end code project
directory and I'm gonna shoot the
command old one alright and there you
can see that we have our Express server
has been started on port 3000 and
MongoDB has been connected so let's go
to our browser and we go to our
localhost 4200 so these are shopping
list application lags so there we had
all the crud operations or all the rest
API is over here so what we can do we
can go ahead and add a new entity such
as item that we want to buy you know
where we are going for shopping suppose
what I want is butter and I want to as a
quantity and if I go ahead with I'll
button you can see that that particular
item is being added similarly we can go
ahead and delete a particular item we
can edit a particular item as well for
example I won't change the quantity to 1
all right then we have option for
checking and unchecking for the item
that we have pot so if we do that even
if we wrote the application the same
state of that particular item will be
maintained in the check box so all those
stuff how to do that we have learned in
our previous video now the next step is
you have to go ahead and deploy this
particular application on who so for
that we need to install few dependencies
the first one we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead to our dashboard
yoku calm and here basically you have to
create an account guys right now I guess
I have created my account already so if
I go ahead and login so you just have to
go through a normal sign a process over
there provide your credential email
username and the password that you want
and then you will get a dashboard like
this over here now here basically we're
gonna go ahead with a node.js server so
there we gonna deploy our code base that
we are having now with our current code
base what is happening is we have
already be set up locally which is
running on the port 2701 7 so what we
want to do is basically we want to shift
this MongoDB implementation to the cloud
all that you're gonna use something
called as M lab calm or MongoDB lab so
let's say and lab calm again you have to
go through assign a process over here
and create account
for the basic usage they have provided
all the services for free so don't worry
about that so I'm gonna go ahead and
login that so for that I'm gonna say
Ashish uh shoe and I'm gonna provide my
password
alright so we had done two things so far
first we have created an account on
Youku and the second thing that we have
created an account on am lab so as to
set up our MongoDB on cloud now there
will be some changes with our codes as
well so let's go ahead and do that
now if you see now that we are getting
deprecation whining over here that open
is deprecated in Mongoose greater than
equal to four point one one four attack
we need to go ahead and check out this
particular website so let's go ahead and
do that
now here what we want to do is basically
we have to set this particular option if
you read the entire message over here it
says that we have we have to set the
muse Mongo Clyde option if using connect
so let's go ahead and do that so
basically we have to provide a second
parameter if I go back to my back-end
code my entry door is filed it that is
the entry point file and here I have to
provide parameter and that will be set
to true use Mongo client that is the
property that we have to sector all
right now once we do that you can see
that the progression warning has been
gone right now what is happening is our
angular CLI is serving our application
on 4200 about 4200 instead of that what
we want is we want our noche servers to
host our application so basically what
we're gonna do we're gonna fill our
application and then we're gonna host
the files that has been pinned or
generated by our ng build come on and
using that you're gonna host that to our
node.js server so for that let's go back
to our angular application and there we
have a file called as angular - he lied
or JSON and here if you see we are
having a property call as out the air
that means if you go ahead with an NG
build come on at that time a folder
called test will be created and all your
build files will be present over there
so let me show you that as well so if I
go here to it ctrl C now and I go ahead
with the command at G build
on a quick note with the angular 5
version this ng build command will be
basically using your aut that is ahead
of time compilation so you have two
modes of compilation in your angular one
is called as jet that is just-in-time
compilation and other one is called as
AO t or I had a bank composition in this
case your templates are gonna compile at
the build time and then you're gonna go
ahead and serve them with whatever
server you want so now as you can see
that this folder has been created and
these are my build files that I need to
serve using note now one more difference
that you have to make in your codebase
is you have to go back to your teat a
taught service class where we have all
the data access logic here we were
referring to our local host 3,000 that
was the domain on which our Express
server was running and that was the name
of the port that is 3,000 that we had
configured over there now if you are
serving the application using no chairs
it will take the domain name by default
and you don't have to go ahead and
mention it
the same goes with your hero queue as
well so once you deploy your application
on Heroku and they're also your
application will be served by no chairs
so whatever domain name that they will
be having it will be using that
automatically so let's get rid of this
HTTP localhost 3000 for now so you know
make this changes everywhere in all our
HTTP requests
all right so far now what we have done
we have made the changes in our data so
is class and we have learned about how
to go ahead and build our angular
application using ng build come on now
what we want is basically I want a
public folder inside my pack and code
folder and I want all my pill file to be
generated over there so for that I'm
gonna go ahead with my angular CLI dot
JSON file this property and here I'm
gonna go ahead and give a reference to
that particular folder so I'm gonna say
one step back because it will be
referring to my source now if I go back
I'll be inside my root folder that in my
project directory and inside that I'm
gonna go ahead faith crud back-end and
inside that I'm gonna go ahead with a
folder call as public this folder will
be generated automatically so you don't
need to go ahead and create this folder
explicitly
so once the bail process has been
complete you can see that public folder
has been created inside my pack and
project but now I no longer need my crud
anger project so let's go ahead and
remove all these now what we want is
basically we want to serve our
application using notes so let's go
ahead and say our application in the
localhost only once we are done with
that we're gonna go ahead and deploy the
whole codebase to hero pool so let's get
back to our entry door chase file and
here I'm going to need one more module
call us our paths so let's go headsets
fair path equal to require and I'm gonna
mention path all right
now I'm going to talk about this
mongolab configuration later on let's go
ahead and make some changes so that we
can serve it now one more thing that
will change is since we are not aware of
the port on which our hero qu
application or the server are that we'll
be deploying our application so we're
gonna go ahead with some property known
as process taught env thought pork in
general if you're using Linux you will
be very well aware of that that node.js
application are paying host on 8080 port
so let's go ahead and use that as well
now here I want to go ahead and refer to
my public folder that is a static asset
on which all my build file resides so
let's go ahead and do that so I'm gonna
say after choose and here I'm gonna say
Express store started so as to list all
my static assets and here I'm gonna use
that path model that we have added
basically we want a function call as
join
and then we want to refer the current
directory path using underscore double
underscore dir name and we're gonna join
it forth public now after that what we
want to do is we want to serve all our
Pihl file basically we want to serve our
index dot HTML file so for that I'm
gonna say AB dot ket let's go ahead with
all the route that that's why I have
used a string over here and then I'm
gonna say request response
and for sending the file or for serving
of are you gonna go ahead v resn files
this is the function that you want to
call and inside that again you have to
mention the part where your index dot
HTML is residing I'm gonna say part or
join and underscore underscore TIR name
and then I'm gonna join it with my
public folder so I'm gonna say public
and inside public I'll be having index
dot HTML that is the file that get
served by your browser alright so once
we are done with all these changes let's
go ahead and serve our applications so
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and
open a new terminal and I will go inside
my pack and folder and I'm gonna call it
with a command load one now as you can
see server has been started at four 8080
and MongoDB has been connected so let's
go ahead to our port localhost 8080 and
let's see whether it works or not
alright so everything is working fine
guys now the next step is we have to set
up our Mon would they be on the cloud so
for that we're gonna go ahead with em LA
so now you have done your sign-in and
after that what you have to do basically
you have to click on this create new
button for creating a new more would he
be deployment
and here you will get different options
for what are the cloud provider you want
or what is the plan that you want
basically gonna go ahead with a free one
that's the sandbox and let's hit
continue and here I'm gonna go ahead
with Europe and I'm gonna click continue
and I'm gonna name my database a
shopping list
alright then you had entered again you
need submit order and now as you can see
that your database has been created all
right now in order to access this
database you need to create a DB user so
what you have to do you have to click on
this particular database that has been
created for you and once you do that you
have an option for creating users so
click on this users tab over here and
add a database user now here you have to
name oh the database user over here and
the password
alright then you go ahead and click on
create button now your database user has
been created and this is the URL that we
will be using for connecting to mobile
app let's go ahead and copy it and this
is what you have to do over here
basically have to replace this
particular URL with the Mongol app you
are and here the changes that you have
to make is you have to put your DB user
over here that is at Vega in our case
and here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to coil I did a cow one two three
all right you know let's save it and
then let's go ahead and stop our mom
would you be server if we don't need it
now let's check out our application once
more and as you can see we are getting
the message as MongoDB connected now
basically what I can do is I'm gonna go
ahead with my application hosted on 8080
and if I reload it now there are no
items that is airing in my mangal app so
let's go ahead and add some so I'm gonna
again go ahead with X and I wanted
thousand I'm gonna go help with add item
and as you can see the item is being
added let's go ahead and check other
functionalities as well I'm gonna say 21
and it's working let's delete it it's
there
now let's let's appear and you want a
six-pack and item we check it reload it
everything is working fine right so what
we have done we have successfully move
our MongoDB on mongolab we have made
changes so as to serve our application
using load so finally our No Chaser
application or the back-end application
is ready for deployment on hero so now
the next step is we have to go ahead
with the hero so here what we want is we
are to go ahead with node.js server so
basically our application is no chance
now for Heroku you need to install two
things the first one is your hero cou
CLI and a second thing that you need is
kit so let's go ahead and do that so I'm
gonna go ahead and click on am ready to
start and the first thing that we want
is to download the Heroku CLI I'm gonna
say Windows 64 and if I click on it you
can see that that particular installer
is being downloaded over here now
meanwhile it is being downloaded let's
go ahead and set up our kit as well for
our
windows so what you have to do after
I've get four windows installer and
there's a website called as get - sem
calm this is the one that you have to
was it and here you're gonna get
installer with respect to different
different platform so choose the kind
installer with respect to the platform
that you're working on I'm going to go
it with Windows and again I'm gonna go
ahead with 64-bit for Windows setup now
our download has been completed so let's
go ahead and run the Installer so first
we're gonna go it with Kurt now click on
next again next next so basically we are
not go ahead for the default
configurations over here it says to
avoid any confusion
let's go ahead and click on launch get
past because that is what I will be
using for today now once you do that you
will have command line interface for
using kit which is called let's get bash
next step is we're gonna go ahead with
our hero qu c li installation so again
you have to run that particular
installer and I'm gonna go ahead and
type my password so installing the
Heroku CLI n kit is another pigtail you
just have to click on bunch of next
buttons and click on agree and that's
all your turn with hero qu and gate now
the thing to remember when you're
installing your kit you make sure that
you have closed down all your command
from instances of in Windows because in
my previous experience I had some
difficulty while installing hero qu and
get while my command prompt instance was
running
all right so I guess the gate
installation or the dollar has is
running again all right so let's cancel
it
yes and let's close down it now so we
have done with KITT and we are done with
our yoku know once you are done with
your kit installation you have to go it
with a command kit conflict and then you
have to go ahead with the flag - -
global so basically you want to go ahead
and set up your credential so I'm going
to go ahead with user dot name for
setting up your credential go ahead and
visit the website github.com and make a
sign up over there providing all your
credential username and the email that
is quite so I'm gonna go ahead with the
username has at Rica are sheesh because
that is what my username is and next
thing that I want is I want my email
over here so I'm gonna go ahead with
email
all right now if I go ahead with a
command get - - version you can see the
current version that I'm having on my
windows now let's get back to our Hiroko
deployment steps and let's clear the
screen as
all right so we are done with the Hiroko
download we are done with the gate we
already have node and NPM in our system
so let's go ahead to our next step now
basically this step is about preparing
your application so we already have our
node.js application working therefore we
don't need to go ahead with this step in
case if you are following this video for
the first time you need to go ahead with
this command git clone and the URL that
has been provided this will basically
thrown the entire project to the current
directory that you are having and then
you have to go inside to that particular
directory no J's getting started and you
have your node.js application ready so
that you can use so as to deploy it on
here oh now next step is to deploy your
application so for that you're going to
go ahead with the command here okuu
create so let's do that before that what
you gonna do since we haven't pushed our
application mean stack application to
the kit right now so let's go ahead and
do that so for that you're gonna go
ahead for it / e to the e directory and
inside that I'm gonna go ahead to my
polar angular tutorial and then shopping
list and inside that I'm having my third
packet basically this particular step
except that there is a dot kit file
inside your node.js application so for
that you need call get in it so that's
all we want
alright now the next thing that we want
is we need to go ahead with the step
here okuu create so let's go ahead to
the step yoku create this will basically
set up a hero KU application for us
which we can access to a URL I'm gonna
go ahead with a doko create over here
Hiroko the bash command is not found so
let's go ahead and check that
all right so it is working over there so
now let's go ahead and try it over here
again maybe just we need to run our kid
patch again so let's go ahead with our
kid - Akane and let's browse to our
project directory which is inside my II
drive inside that I'm having angular
tutorial and then I'm having shopping
list I'm sorry now shopping list and
inside that I'm gonna go head fit crud
back-end all right now let's check our
Roku again so I'm gonna go ahead with it
oh go create and as you can see it is
working now so make sure that once you
have download your hero cool CLI then
you have to restart your gate pass
application if you are following this
video now this is the URL that you have
to go ahead with in order to access that
particular application just copied over
here and let's go ahead and paste it
inside like it
oh okay tab that I was having for
downloading it and as you can see we are
having our hero KU application that we
have created just now alright now the
next thing that we want is we want to
push all our project to the get local
repository so for that I'm going to go
hit the git add and talk that means to
add everything that is there inside my
project directory to your local ripple
in case if you don't know or if you are
not familiar with git you can go ahead
and check out our kit tutorial video and
what is kit with you buy a Drakkar and
learn about all those stuffs also you
can go ahead and check out the kit
tutorial block that is there on at
Eureka that explains all these basic
stuff and come on about kit and how does
it work now it will take two minutes
guys so you don't need to worry about
that
now as you can see all the files has
been added now the next step is you have
to go ahead with get comment - am flag
that's the flag that you have to pass
and then to pass a comment let's go to
the comment deploy my mean aft to Europe
all right so all these file has been
created on my key table now the next
step is let's go ahead and check our
steps over here so we have done all
those stuff now the next step we're
gonna go ahead with a skit push Heroku
master
we have committed all those files and
deities that we have added to our local
repo and then finally we have pushed to
Heroku master now the next thing that we
want is basically it will be giving me a
URL to which I can go ahead and see my
app work
all right so let's go ahead with our
status so nothing too free because we
have caught some error over here
previous eve hope decline so basically I
had my repo already over there so let's
go ahead and retry that so I'll say good
push yoku master
no I guess everything is deployed over
here now
the last thing that I want to have is I
want to copy this and let's check out
our air that we were getting in our
previous wash so the error that we were
getting was trying to push some rafts or
to get here okay so we are getting
everything order alright so let's go
ahead and check out the error or the
status that we want to know
okay it is saying no known issues at
this time in case guys you are stuck at
something or you're receiving the same
error you can go ahead and comment that
in the comment section below and you're
going to go ahead and provide all the
solution that we can have for that
particular error that you receive all
right so now if I go ahead to my next
step it's saying that you can't go ahead
with Hiroko open this will open the URL
for you or you can go ahead and use this
particular URL that will be generated
over here as you can see if we go back
down you can see this is the URL that we
are having if we go ahead we'll have our
Hiroko deployed over there
so now the next thing that we wanna do
is go ahead with that URL and we are
getting an error so let's go ahead and
check all the logs that we want so gonna
say Hiro kulaks
and the air that we are getting is the
sing script start already so what we
have done wrong over here is basically
we haven't added any script called as
start over here so basically what your
hero KU application or noches
application does is it goes ahead with a
command NPM start so if I can show you
how it works if I go it with the
documentation it is no chairs and I
guess if the introduction on setup
so this is how you go ahead with the
logs
no this is the file that I was talking
about define a proc file so using a proc
file a txt file in the root directory of
your application to explicitly declare
what command should be executed to start
your app or what you can do is basically
you can go ahead and add a script over
here or you can go ahead and say start
now we're gonna say node our entry point
file that is entry door chairs over here
let's save it down and then let's close
our current server and let's go ahead
with a command npm start so now as you
can see the npm start come on is working
so let's go ahead and add this
particular change to arkett so for that
i'm going to again cool head with git
add dot alright as you can see the
packet or json file has been changed
let's go ahead with the comet and I'm
say I'm gonna say Kate comet - and and
some changes in me after deploy on here
all right so one file has been changed
now the next step that we did was
basically we went ahead where to get
Porsche
yoku master
all right now let's go hit this time
with the command that has been provided
by in the step that we were falling so
I'm going to go ahead with yokoo Pierce
killed one copy hit over here now this
is to ensure that at least one instance
of the app is running and it is set us
free now what we can do is we can
directly ko it with the command hero
open and once we do that it will
basically open that application for us
in your default browser now as you can
see that we have successfully deployed
our application on Heroku so there's the
URL guys that we'll be using now here
you can go ahead and add a few things
supposed to check out whether all the
crud operations are working well or not
so I'm going to go ahead for it let's
say butter again and we'll say two and
let's see it is being added or not yes
working let's go ahead and edit that I'm
gonna say Pierce and I want 12 those
changes has been made to our database
not last thing that we want is we want
to delete something let's go ahead and
check our check and check option and
let's we go to this particular web app
now as you can see that particular check
and uncheck option is being maintained
as per our database so this is the
entire application guys now we have
learned how to deploy that on the hero
KU this is the step that you have to
follow in case you are falling along
with this video for the first time I
would recommend you to go ahead and
check out the previous two videos of
this free angular course for bigness
where I have shown how to create this
mean stack application from stack and in
the next video the last video of this
free angular core series I'm going to go
ahead with a firebase application
alright guys so see you in the next
video
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
