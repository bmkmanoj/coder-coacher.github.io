players i will be using the video
players in android applications so that
is all that we are going to cover now
all right so if i talk about the android
media of them all right a media player
is an easier way if you want to play an
audio file in the background or
somewhere in the application media
player class can be used to control
playbacks of audio or video file streams
let me show you an example how are you
making use of it all right is something
that is very important so whichever file
you feel like housing or using within
your application has to be first of all
placed under the draug folder can
everybody see the doc folder here in my
screen let me tell you about this how
are you going to create this up go on to
the specific folder right water
resources go on down you and hear you
say a new folder and you have to create
a new folder with the name are aw let me
tell you about this it is only the draug
folder that you have to use in order to
house all your media files because
android is very specific with the folder
naming conventions and also the folders
structuring right so if you are you
making use of raw folder it
automatically looks up for all the media
files in the drawer folder right if you
are placing it somewhere else it won't
pick up the media files but my point
here so how are you going to use this up
you just create a media player object
start the media player object or create
a media player object with the raw file
that you have placed under the graph
folder so you place an mp3 file inside
the application folder and you give it a
path right and just call the media
player door stock nothing fans here
media player will do it everything for
you right let me show you an example for
this so here what I have done is I have
created a small example here which would
play audio file just showing to the show
it to you
alright so here I have created a small
example which contains this particular
activity it contains two bottles one is
a player song and then is a stopper song
button but go on to the audio player dot
Java you see my media player object
alright and I'll also boolean status so
this stainless variable is being used
here in order to check whether my media
is playing or not so that if I want to
stop any media I can just check whether
I'm actually playing your media before
stopping it up or not all right I click
to click a button play a click a button
stop a listener and attach them up to an
onclicklistener here I say if my status
equal to true that is if I state is
equal to true I say media player not
stop all right it's like I'm playing a
media file and in spite of having that
media fight being played I try to call
play again so what I need to do I have
to first of all just stop the last
recover last playing which was getting
played so I call media player not stop
and do a status equal to false right so
I'm doing a stainless equal to false and
I say if my state is equal to two all
right if my media player is equal to
hold that means I'm just calling this
top on the play button again if i click
on the play button again I am
necessarily doing is I'm calling the
pause stop again I say state s equal to
do I send this variable to true then and
I call media player not create and media
player dot star so what am i doing stop
the last one that was getting played set
the state of spiritual to be true so
that I can play the next file right that
is what my button play is doing here all
right let me show you here this is which
case a any person having any issues here
in understanding my boolean flag here
and also the media player object can
respond back onto the chat window and
let me also show you how we're how much
taste this media file I placed under raw
resources
and then I go on the wrong folder and
here I have played a file should I will
do that for you sir no me when I write
knowing is I'm attaching the only
business after attaching the onclick
listener I check whether my state is
equal to true whether i just checked
whether the media file is already
getting played if it is already getting
played i'm doing a stop on the media
player because i need to first of all
stop the last file that was getting
played alright just let stake here right
I have to stop the file that he was
getting played and I said the status
equal to false goddess now nothing is
better getting played and I say said
this state is equal to two again because
now I have to start playing again I
can't create the media player object and
just to a star on the media player and
on the button on stop listener what am i
doing I'm just topping the media player
let me show you my running this up this
is very I would say this is very easy to
do alright because we have an a3 high
for us which does the playing for us
right so just go to the API given the
file path whichever five bars you want
to start playing and it will
automatically do the playing up for you
all right and if you all want I can also
do you or say give you an example
wherein you also have a progress bar
with the media player so the way you
move the progress bar the way the media
moves alright so that is a more
realistic example of using the media
player I'll show you that also in the
coming sessions let it run up and then
when it runs up I'll show you that how
the media player works say if i click on
play here it will start playing a song
file for me all right i'll just open
this up
I hope everybody can hear in this up all
right so what is it being hand to the
earth I just call the file give it a
file all the media player object and do
a start on the media player right now if
I click on stop as well stop the media
player and let me also tell you they are
have also few methods that you call
people can look into one is the media
player cause and what is the media
player not start let me tell you about
this if I say I call on the media player
dot cause whenever a song file is being
played and I call media player not start
again so what it will do is it will pick
up the file from the position it was
paused at and also a few things if you
are using media in any of your
activities just make sure that at first
of all whenever you are grouped or
overriding the on back pressed let me do
it for you I'll over I the on Mac press
so that whenever you click on the on man
Martin inside the on Mac press just make
sure that you click or say stop the
media so that it does not keep playing
in the background few things to remember
whenever you press them hard we're man
wouldn't stop the media file otherwise
it will keep on playing till the time
the activity is removed from the or say
the application is closed down by the
manager everybody understands what I'm
trying to say here all right and even if
you are doing a finish on the activity
just before you call the finish on the
activity just to a media player not stop
right so similar to a media player we
also have something which we call as
video player right can we use it on
destroy that's correct treasure that is
the exact place where you have to use it
up on the on back pressed and on the on
destroy these are the two places that
you have to take care of it
all right now similar to the media there
you also have a video player right but
that video player is given to us with
the help of a budget the budgets name is
video of you right let me show you how I
have bored with this example of a video
player alright so here gonna have that
same folder just remember same folder I
have to place the video file also the
3gp files have to go in here 3gp are the
mp4 files all right in the drawer folder
same place go on to the video player
activity here I'll be needing a widget
so if I go on to mania you'll see a half
placed a video view here and everybody
check this up a video of you object
where are you going to find this up in
the images and media you just go and
drag and drop a video view object just
let me know if this is clear to everyone
in the images and media drag and drop a
video of you object let's go to the
video player our activity inside this if
you see here first of all take the
reference of the video of you then there
comes the difference let me tell you
about this whenever we work on a video
of you right we need to give it a file
path but since if you all know video
files or something that are quite heavy
quite large in memory size so they are
not the ones that are actually picked up
by the are binding are you all getting
my point because if I have to create a
our file on how to create a mapping for
it then in a way I am wasting resources
I first of all map my our file then ask
it for loading the video of you path and
then all the kinds of stuff so whenever
we are working with a video of you we
actually ref refer to the exact file
path exact file path of the video file
so
you see I'm using a URI a URI is a
uniform resource identifier right it is
actually a path to the actual video file
that is being housed by the device so if
you see I am doing up you are i did not
pass android resource let me tell you
about what this contains it's like the
data data folder so this particular you
are i dot bars first of all goes into
that particular android resource folder
that's correct rubber and at first
they're looks out for the package name
which is the package name of the
application then add water does is it
appends a forward slash in order to find
a raw file i hope now this complete
phenomena would have got more clear to
you why are we using the exact path here
because a window file is quite large so
that is why we have to make use of the
exact file path here i say send the
video you are I to the part that I have
just fixed up then I can also sort all
right but if we have video 3gp and video
not them before you cannot have two
files named file ends with different
formats praveen all right it will give
you this compar android eclipse will
give you a problem here if it finds out
to file names with similar names because
if you are seeing here you are actually
referring to a single file not using the
eight states right I say believe you got
sent video URI and if you want you can
associate also the media control us with
it media controllers are the ones that
give you the play/pause forward next or
same forward or remind behavior on to
the variable whenever you click on the
video view it will give you a few
buttons at the bottom I just show you
that let me just run this up
we'll take some time to load up because
it's also caching up the video file with
it so if you see here is a video file if
I click on it you can see anybody media
controls and everybody see this these
media controller right so that is how if
you want to have the video player
included inside your applications that
is how you have to create all the video
files and refer to them riffs are
separately like if you have to play a
video bonheur given a video one path
similarly video two parts alone and so
on and so forth right that is how you
will be using a video player inside your
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
