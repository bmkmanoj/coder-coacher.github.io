Java let's look at what is actually a
specification in digit right what is
let's say
you
see I want to get a franchisee of Pizza
Hut right what are the things I should
be doing or let's say you want to start
a business of franchise self dessert
what are the different things you will
do the question to you now right take a
minute of time
please stipend you will see the budget
you'll see the location you'll get the
license you get dream we get that visa
hurt a brand using the they know okay
information about how they make the PISA
they learn about it
learn about market conditions they area
pay the franchise city is okay yes
and they keep the menu or the pizza
buying all the resources of ingredients
marketing yes you will do all that big
changes based on locally it's not a
person right like if it is let you know
yeah based on the local needs you you
make is a correct but okay definitely
all these things are considered now
let's move on to the specific direction
let's say you will talk to
we'll talk to the Pizza Hut water who
gives a the French ICT and let you know
you sign the contract you have seen a
place okay and Pisa Hut owner will give
you the specifications right so this is
how it should be correct what are the
things he might say right he will say
this is how Pisa hurt will be so what
are the things the specifications Pisa
ha owner says that I should follow so
they will give complete specification
right see in that what is the color of
the room how the chair should be how the
Meno has to be displayed right so many
things like this they specified right so
how the pizza dough has to be how you
how much you have to make it how much
you have to supply it in what container
you should supply it apart from
container wash what else you should
serve they have a certain standards
right do you get an option of deviation
of that like you know the color of
posters the way I want no I will not
have an option if I take the Pizza Hut
franchisee I will not get an option to
change the way I want I can I need not
put like I cannot put like you know the
might film actors picture along with
freezer Hut no it is that how exactly
please aha is there in all the
franchises the same thing I have to
maintain that is specifications
okay that is specification
you
if the specifications are given I must
follow it right so it is like interface
will specify the specification and the
classes will follow them okay that's
that's how it is looked at right let's
look at it now interfaces are used to
implement the expected behavior of a
system or a theta type that's what I
said basically interfaces are used to
implement interfaces will specify what
behavior it has to be and classes will
use that interface and implementing Java
does not support multiple other hands
intervention interfaces are implemented
we looked at yesterday that Java does
not support multiple inheritance right
we looked at it yesterday right like you
know half plus a plus B then I have plus
C extends a comma B I cannot say that
yesterday we looked at that we look at
that like it last a and Class B a like
you know one class cannot have two
children okay so that is do this is not
possible but it is possible through in
hair X their implements multiple
interfaces now let's say I have I have
one interface I will tell you how to
define interfaces let's say interface a
and I have something over here I have
another interface be here okay and I can
say implements you can implement
multiple interfaces in a class
okay now let's look at a practical of
interfaces
you
it will start killing with a keyboard
interface okay
then you will say okay here in the
interface
I just specify the metrics right let's
say I just specified for this class okay
I have to specify implements a the
moment I say it'll throws an error the
reason is that okay
it is not you are not we are saying that
we are implementing the standards given
in the interface but we have not yet
implemented class immediately looks
saying that it is not there or not okay
it's not there so it says and
unimplemented methods you can just click
on it right now I'll say return e plus B
these override is annotation which is
not required for you
even if it is there if it is not that it
is fine so it is just the compiler time
checking that like that this is derived
or implemented from parent or not okay
now multiplies in K comma int me I'm
just specifying the standards as part of
multiplicative weather interface now the
woman see it says I have implemented
method so multiplication you have added
as part of the interface but you have
not added the implementation for that
method that's what it says
now as usual let us define the object of
interface 1 I 1 equals 2 new interface 1
semicolon so I would so now let's take
how they introduced the scanner classes
for you ok no problem I will
you
okay now let's look at the program okay
I have an interface where like so I have
interface by name a where I have defined
two methods my add and multiply add
function will take two arguments
multiply function will take two
arguments okay it returns in danger
this is what that's specifying the
standard like a resort
okay now I'm the person name is
interface one I have implementing those
standards it is it is that like you know
I can implement one standard I need not
implement another standard no that does
not work if they specified the standards
I must implement all standards if I say
like you know the moment I remove this
immediately gives an LLC here and
unimplemented methods the type interface
one must implement the inherited
abstract method a dot well okay
okay now I have provided the
implementation okay I have provided the
implementation for ad and month inside
the plus it in interface you will not be
providing any implementation you will
just provide the signature right so what
I'm saying is if the franchisee has to
be taken the specifications are given
only by like you know Pizza Hut oona
right or main branch rest of the
branches okay who takes a franchisee
should just follow the rules the
implementation how exactly it is you to
go and bring the chair
give me putting in the same color is
that my us whoever runs the show they
have to like you know have the
implementation implementation okay okay
here I have a static void main I have
declared the object of interface one
that is a class this class you know this
right interface one in the name of the
class I one is a variable new is the one
which allocates memory for the type
interface one so it will take the size
of this interface one class and okay so
much memory in the byte is very many
bytes in the memory and that reference
will be assigned to I wonder does that
object address can be given to either
okay
you
we'll be given to him and so Ivan
becomes an object of interface one that
is how you you consider it as but it
never leave this is what happens now
scanner is a class is defined in Java
utility okay Ave tivity so you say SC is
a name of the class variable the same
way I have this is interface one is my
class scanner is Java class Java utility
class scanner as he knew you are
allocating a memory and scanner is of
the type you're allocating memory of the
type scanner and you're passing system
dot in system dot n means you are giving
the keyboard as the input right for the
keyboard you are giving the input then
then you have printing system not like
you know this message will be displayed
on the screen
and like you know you are declaring a
variable int X and SC SC the
object dot next int that means whatever
the data you are taking next is an
integer value okay you're telling the
keyboard right you actually to read next
value as integer okay and assigning to Y
then again SC is the object you are
using only one object here okay using
the object function right so SC dot next
int you are reading another integer
variable the next which is coming
through the input stream is integer that
is what he has specified and assigning
integer variable now let's say like you
know Ivor is a interface one object that
is the our class object then dot add X
comma Y address the method which we have
written here okay extra my way whatever
the data we have passed it will be
assigned to this function that it calls
call by value and performs the addition
and returns if I give 5 a.m. 5 it adds
and returns the value result similarly
multiplies
return the value to results multiplied
am see here I've displayed added result
is multiplied value is right so this is
what address let me write the score
asked me to enter two numbers right I
will enter 10 and 15 so added value is
25 and multiplied value is 150 right
I'm linter another number five and six
added value is 11 and multiplied value
is 30 right this is how you define
interfaces okay I will complete the
topic of interfaces and I will allows
I'll give you time to ask me questions
or interface before we go on with
packages okay now you see interfaces are
used to implement the expected behavior
of a system or a data type okay
interfaces will specify the standards
and you will have to implement them okay
the class which you may like you know
says implements must implement all the
methods of the interface okay Java okay
this I have already shown an interface
has has a set of method declarations yes
you are aware of it so like you know we
are just specifying the declaration it
does not have a method body but only
method declarations so that's what I all
you it does not have a method body like
this it just have a declaration that's
all the to use an interface a class must
in a class implements keyword is used so
if you want to implement that interface
you just have to use your implements
that interface okay so it gives if you
don't override all the methods in the
class the class has to be defined as
abstract this is maybe look into
abstract message me little later okay an
interface is same as class except class
has can be instantiated but interface
cannot be right yeah you cannot create
an object of interface let's say my
interface name is a right now you will
say a a one equals who knew a so you
cannot instantiate the object of into
see here cannot instantiate the type of
8 ok this is not possible an interface
can be identified by using interface
keyword and the name of the interface is
like this how do you defy the interface
interface name of the interface like
this interface and name of the
interfaces eh
okay why do we use interfaces any system
which needs the expected functionality
requires interfaces for example to music
functions of a bank is deposit and
withdraw these two functions can be part
of interfaces for banking application
you
you will have like you know two basic
functions deposit and withdraw must be
there in any banking transaction so
Yuki's two methods can be part of
interface okay how do you define the
interface interface area electorate let
the breath deep lazy you have a class
called rectangle implementing area so
length into length and breadth of the
arguments here tetanic that we have done
a multiplication in this example
interface calculate the area of
rectangle is given
okay
interfaces okay actually when you see
let's say I have int div and
a comma int B right the moment I see
this it will give an error and I'll
implement added implemented methods okay
so here if you see override this is
called annotation okay so it is not
mandatory okay it's not mandatory it
just says that this div is there in the
as part of the interface are as part of
the base class it has been overridden it
is for compiler to check whether it is
there in the base class or not the
correct way of here is there or not that
is the annotation it is not mandatory
you can just knock it off right it is
for the compiler check that is there or
not the base class or yeah okay in the
interface it is there or not that is the
reason of this override annotation it is
not required see this annotation
overwrite it's not mandatory it is just
for a compiler check okay otherwise
please look at this code you're ok with
it
you
okay now let's look at okay let's look
at interfaces little more detail
attributes can be defined in the
interface absolutely see I can define an
attribute when that becomes a constant
value index equals o int I preview II
liquor I'll say attribute equal to four
okay 600 right so so I can use the value
of six our attribute here okay I will
have to say system dot out dot println
name of the object is I 1 dot attribute
okay so I can say value of attribute is
your defining the variable in this
interface right so what it should
display
it should display 600 correct because
it's a variable of the interface and it
is like a base class only it is it
interfaces is also like means class only
thing is you will not be able to extend
okay and method body will not be there
okay when I run this 600 will be okay
into two numbers swell and 323 added
values 15 multiplied value is 36 and
value of that repute is 600 now these
attributes can be used in the
implemented class that's what I showed
you the attribute values cannot be
changed in a class as if as it acts like
a final variable I will not be able to
modify the attributes of the interface
it will become like a final see the
final field a dot attribute cannot be
assigned the moment you define a
variable right so in the interface it
becomes a final variable okay
what is the final variable a variable or
attribute which cannot be quantified
okay now let me ask you a question that
is what is a final variable and final
method okay if a variable is declared as
final the value of the variable cannot
be modified okay now let's say I will
define another interface me okay we can
extend the interface
okay now I will say divide okay now
let's say now let's say I will implement
me here okay interface is that an
interface B is that interface is the
definition where I can define the
standards right so now I can extend the
interface the interface B is extending
from interface E right okay now it has
one method one more standard you are
provided as part of the interface now I
have a class which is implementing from
me okay now please think about it and
tell me how many methods I want I want
to excel all right right the
implementation can I write only live or
should I write ad mundum or ad div or
admin how many functions I have to
implement in my class okay please name
the function names okay take time please
type
kindly respond so that you will get the
maximum benefit of the class whatever it
is right or wrong when you participate
you're part of the subject right if you
are not knowing information about that
concept I will help you to know but
please participate that's what my
request is Suresh I saw the answer no
problem
think about the concept of inheritance
okay then extending its inheritance
there so as I'm getting that I'm able to
see it's just that it Scrolls
pretty fast so many people respond right
but I make sure that I look for your
name or two and if I'm not responding to
anyone kindly let me know
okay so just think of interface air two
classes extending it means a classes the
D classes then and me class extends from
a right so that means when you see is a
parent class B is the child class all
the methods of the parent class will
come into the trail class
so that means added Mallos will come
into the child class so the peds least
as if it is like you know got in here
right that is in inherited that's what
we looked at yesterday so when i given
me all my three methods has trained unit
see here so all the threads has to be
implemented when i say and unimplemented
methods see here add multiply intention
all the methods must implement it so
here i have to look at the concept of
multiple sorry in the concept of
inheritance
see
see I did well use 50 x ray values 50
difference 10 by 5 is 2 and value factor
6 ok so interfaces can be extended you
can have an interface you can have
extension to that interface all the
interface of the parent will get into
the child because we are implementing
the concept of inheritance right and I
said the the purpose of interfaces is to
provide the standards okay same thing
area area 1 extents area so here one
area is there here another area is that
one will take to our commit to this
function overloading is been provided I
provided a difference right now if you
implement this rectangle you had
increment for argue with two arguments
one with less than another one with
radius okay now interfaces can be
extended with some information about it
like the classes can be extended even
interfaces can be extended if they have
no program there are two interfaces
interface one interface to that is what
like in our example it is C and B okay
and interface 2 is extended from
interface 1 if a class is implementing
interface 2 then all the methods of
interface 2 and one must be implemented
as interface to use extended from
interface that we are aware of so all
the methods of and so what I had asked
you the question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
