into the session let me introduce myself
my name is dinesh kumar and i have
nearly 10 years of experience in UI
development are nearly four years of
experience in angularjs and made a trade
workers creating custom widgets using
angularjs for our projects is the
briefing toward me and our objectives of
this framework is firstly we get to know
what does angularjs and why do you need
to end it is that we will be covering in
this introduction to the end of the
earth next we'll see what are all the
features we have in this angularjs
session after that in the 70s we have
one component called controllers so how
can we eliminate them data in this
controller those things will be covering
it is our third session next one else
will be covering about so if you want to
have this page navigation and other
things how can you achieve using angular
things the last one we will be creating
custom pitches that is a component in
angularjs using C D or D pjs this is
what our today's inductive first what
San jose-based angular to yourself
opensocial javascript framework so it is
not only built by usko Henry and Adam
drums later it has been taken by Google
now Google is building this angularjs
framework and why do we need a
JavaScript on the client side not really
you this might have seen the other MVC
frameworks in Java r dot man over there
where do we need to have an MVC
framework with the cleanser so if we
build an application with MVC framework
in the kinds that you will be having
more control from the you it then each
and every component should be separated
properly for example if you are writing
everything in a single bit like all the
views other
known as in a single pipe that won't be
helpful so we have to keep everything
separated that's why they said also we
are implemented Model View and
controller so the model will be having
all the data whatever your processing
neckline side then you will be having
your presentation later that is your
normal HTML then in the controller will
be having your business logic and the
custom validations whatever you need to
do it in the client side this is the
separation of MVC never angular JS next
so what is the what are the features we
have in our angular JS ok the first one
if you ask me we have our data baby this
is one of the biggest problem if you are
using any other normal javascript for
example a jquery so in the jquery if you
want to bind a data what I mean normally
we will be getting the data from the
back end like a dollar on jacks or
whatever it is did you have to find the
element by ID our class then assign this
data up to the element this is what you
will be doing then if you are changing
in the data in your view that is a
little shimmer taken you have to read
the venue and bind it to your model
density to the wagon but if you are
using angularjs it is having to me data
burning because of this through main
data binding if you are changing the
view automatically your model we get a
medic in the rain if you are changing
the model if you will be getting update
so what does it mean for example I have
a text must in the text box if I enter
any data automatically the data will be
available in your controller just you
can send it to the backend java.net
whatever it is otherwise if you wanted
to any other operation you can do it
over there you need not to find the
element and get the value those things
should be not automatic it you'll be
ahead of this were calling it as a day
depending the same way I am changing a
model in the back and Erica I'm getting
the data and I will gassing to the scoop
available and this scoop video moon will
be updated and this will update the view
this is what we are calling it as a
my name so one of the key feature of
languages next one is dependency
injection so whatever you need any other
external modules you can inject those
modules inside our angular this
application so you need not to have all
the modules in a single fight you can
create multiple models and whenever you
need to smarten you can inject those
modules inside our application that is
what we are calling it as a dependency
injection the third one is robbie's so
what is in crowded na mele each and
every web page will be having its one
tab navigations for example we will be
having like home page contact page and
settings page so if you are eating on
home what do we do just you will be
reloading the page and we will load then
next one contact if you are clicking on
settings you will be again reloading a
bit unload this settings this is what we
can do is that normally the obligation
but I don't want to do that in a single
application itself I wanted to lower the
templates or I don't want ever trust the
page so if you reverse the page what
will happen you will lose the context so
all this script and all the variables
whatever you declared it will be become
empty because you are reloading the web
page right instead of that I do not want
to reload the page I want to load a
content in the specific area how can we
do this those things you can achieve
using Ravi so we will be seen or this
routing in a few minutes next one is
directives so what does it mean by
directed directive is a abstraction
function of your angularjs code for
example in the jQuery or any other
JavaScript you will be having ng it just
clicked even so what is it look it is
calling some particular function further
they have written some logic in their
back end in the same be another jas
having its own directives like ng repeat
it is it will act like a for loop on
that plane say I mean in the HTML source
you need not to write a for loop and
bind the event to the HTML just what you
can do is you can write a Fargo on the
controller itself so the controller
whatever data you have that will be
updated interview you can list it in the
view that is one of the awesome
directive in this angle is ok these are
other ppl directives are away but I want
to create my own directly so how can I
do this that also angularjs is giving
option so already they are giving more
features in this directives but if you
want to create your own that also
possible for a particular element you
can give a view as well as the
functionality for example I wanted to
create a directive something like hello
the nation so if I give hello dinesh in
my HTML it won't be having any
functionality are you but using his
custom directive I can give specific
view to the directive as for less this
is what the functionality needs to be
done for example if you are giving input
tag in the HTML what is happening it is
creating like a text box and so whatever
you are typing that data is visible over
there that is the functionality and it
is having the view the input text i
equal to text in the same way if i give
hello dinesh that is register element in
HTML for that element we are giving our
own functionality underwing that we can
give using our custom directive in our
session mostly we will be concentrating
on HTML how can we find a beaut in this
controller then how can you share their
data is between the controllers then how
that be inheriting the controllers like
parent to child and child ekran check
this will be covering the session
externus will be discussing more about
ng ng route on you a hug later we will
be building basic d3 matures or see
previous using angular this instead of
having more in this critical we will see
more in practicals will see you will
show you the code ok so first we have
understand
the architecture of our angularjs
project how does it work in angularjs if
you see it will be having a directive
guard ng act so once you load your
angularjs script in your HTML page what
is it goes it will look for this ngf
directive once it finds this NTM
directive it will consider that whole
page is a NT application for example if
you are including this ngf in your body
so whatever you have inside that body it
will be there angular.js component it
will be rendered as a angular these
directives and filled us this is how
angular this one's so let us see how
does it happen now many just consider
this left side whatever you have is your
browser and in the browser just we will
be giving our static HTML what is it
just it will be having code whatever we
have do or ng repeat whatever so the
ng-repeat is core it is there but we
don't know what is the functionality of
the ng-repeat even browser don't know
that we have to bind a even you have to
compile it so how can we do so whenever
you load this in the browser what does
it do it will find the NGF 16 finds this
MGR the NGF will lead having two methods
one is compile and routes cook this root
scope is like a global variable for
application so whatever you are
declaring in this root scope you can
access it all over the application and
if you're creating a controller this
controller will create a Chinese school
so the child scope will be available
only for the controller so now what does
it happens it will take the static down
to this application and the application
passes this root scope winter down to
the company method this compile method
 fills your hold down with your root
scope and it will be giving you the
dynamic down so once this gum has been
compelled your browser we get to know so
what is the function of your ng-click or
what is the functionality of your
ng-repeat all the functionality will be
pointed to
browser this is so angularjs works okay
then before we go into this controller
inheritance let's see how can we create
a basic angularjs application let's go
into the coding so what are you going to
do first i have downloaded my angularjs
quite so you can see this angular not
winter days if you want this you can
directly go to the angular not over gijs
you can download this angular mean fine
otherwise you can get the cilium fire
officer now already i have downloaded
this angular meanwhile now I wanted to
create a basic hello world agora this
application let us see how can you clear
them so just on creating a further one
application one let me create a new file
i have created empty HTML file over here
and i am opening that file in my sublime
editor so just i close to everything let
me open the file in my supply married oh
okay yes i have my MP html5 let me
create a basic issue this chain with 15
this is the shortcut for a sublime
editor it will create a schema angle
hello world just I'm giving it either so
first what you have to do is you have to
include your script script so when we
have Wrangler this application it is in
my primer lig photo / lav / angular dot
Minn dot J's now this is why I have my
script / I have just given the path
right then what I'm going to do here i
am going to declare my application so
before we declare just see how does it
renders
h1 hello so like you open this in the
browser now if you open this here we
have loaded that particular angle a is
fine you can see it in the library that
has been loaded into your web
application now if I want to perform any
other expressions like let me put it
right here one plus one so what will
happen so let me load here one plus one
whenever you are loading it in the HTML
it won't company anything just it will
give you are it is it will be considered
as I miss Tamra volume so what does it
mean it is you're just a static dot
there is no functionality binder so what
we needs to do to bind the functionality
we have to pass this to the angularjs
app so angularjs will be having dollar
compellent route method that Dom will be
passed to the dollar company with root
scope so we will compile and it will
give you the dynamic doc that's what we
need to do so you have to defend your
energy up so you can give whatever name
you want this first I am NOT going to
give any other name this time defining
my app refresh now what is it the once
you are included your javascript file
that is angular JS file it will look for
ing our directive so it is finding the
NGF directive in the root of your HTML
so this whole file will be considered as
an angularjs application and this fire
the whole HTML will be passed to your
angular JS app and it will become pile
and it will give the combined document
so in the angular JS if you want the
available like in javascript will be
having evolved method they ever have a
time if you want to perform any
JavaScript operations you can give it
over there in the same way if I want to
perform any JavaScript operations you
can give it in there double braces the
double progresses whatever you are
giving that will be compiled over here
for example i want to multiply
three in 25 okay listen so it is minding
play how did you give you the result but
if it is a normal HTML happen just it
will show you only the normal three into
fight with this clever braces ok now we
kind of this angularjs it is compiling
and it is giving the result now we have
done the printed the basic angularjs
application now let us see what is the
use of controller and how can we pass
that data between the applications let
me create a new script file so whether i
can defend my half and i can define my
controls i'm going to call it as custom
dodges so i have created a tailspin so i
have to include the same file right here
script my so sequel where where is
custom just i'm giving my custom file in
custom today's i have included my file
over there so I just let me delete this
in a don't wander now what I'm going to
know just get in find our Apollo but
instead of defending my app I wanted to
leave this application I am going to
call this application ask dem it so now
again define my app in my script so if I
want to inject it as a model to some
other application also that is possible
I can inject the same app where a
frequenter angular dot module ah your
application name so whatever the
application name you have a given just
give the same name were here demo and we
are not going to include any other
dependency in our application that's why
I can give the empty dependency if you
need to include any other dependencies
like eng route or you a router you can
mention those dependencies over here but
for now this is the basic application so
i don't want to include any other
dependencies so adjust market us empty
now I heard define my application up to
the one I want to do is
want to create my control so over there
i can write all my business logic and
the validations whatever I want to do it
from that client site so let me define a
control after controller so here what he
hell do you have to define your
controller name first I am going to call
it as test controller and for this disk
controller what you have two passes you
have to inject the scope Taylor and
dollar scoop so with this Darla scope
only you are object will be binder so I
have injected my dollars come over here
and defining a various coupe enable the
orders cook that mean equal to welcome
to webinar okay welcome to angular
webinar so this is my dollar scope me so
I have to be created one variable called
me and I it is a scope variable so this
cook variable I should be excessive in
the v so what he added you have to
define your controller also in your HTML
5 deal so how can you create a
controller ng-controller not BG sorry
typo mistake ng-controller iniquitous so
whatever your control of name it is a
test controller now if we are mentioning
any other contents over here we think
this theme everything will be considered
as a view for this controller so
whatever the scope variable you should
be able to access it within this view
that is the use of specifying the Delta
in the scope variable for example I have
grated misko payable taller scope that
name equal to welcome to this webinar
now if I want access disco payable what
I can do just in the expressions I will
be giving me now let's see this in that
is Gemma here you are see welcome to
hedge trimmer whatever I have
given in the scope variable that you can
access it in there instead of mentioned
Cal scope variable let me define it as a
normal death so this is how we me
declaring a JavaScript files in the
variable in the JavaScript so that name
equated welcome to a winner so if i
refresh the page what will happen so
this name is not be fun so it is not
giving anything you can see right here
normally in the JavaScript oshawa
without defining a variable if you try
to access it will throw error but here
you are not seeing any error in the
console you can see all the error
message will be handled if you are using
within this expressions and your
expressions it will be handled properly
ok now instead of making a name let me
make it as a scope variable scope dharna
now this will be accessible in back view
so you are displaying this particular
HTML right here if you want to do the
same in the jQuery what do we do we will
be taking this particular do IDR class
and you have to bind a kalman the text
of this value our anything so here we
are not about doing anything just we are
defining our scope variable and we are
displaying the scope variable in our
view isn't it really simple we will do
the huggable where Tori it has something
else to a binding so what does it mean
by to a binding let's see that I am
defining it as I h1 tag so whatever it
is here let me put it then I am creating
a input type equal to test and model
equal to me so whatever the scope
variable you created in the controller
those variables you can access it over
here with this directive card ng model
now it will put this particular scope
variable value as a text box valid let's
see that in the brochure now here you
are saying I didn't write any other book
just I have defined my scope variable
here
here I made it and given the same scope
variable to the ng model so it is giving
the same text box value to the text box
if I edit in the text box automatically
the data will be updated you can see the
other so this is what we are calling it
as a two-way binding whenever I change
the view this text boxes maybe you never
exchanged the view this model actually
whatever we defined here name the scope
variable automatically is getting
updated if you want to do the same thing
in the normal jquery what will happen is
hard to watch this keep even whenever
the key a payment happens get the value
of the text box and bind it to any other
element those things you need not to do
it over here because of this to a
binding future whatever you are entering
in the text box that will be
automatically updated in the model this
is what we are calling it as a to be
binding do you guys have any questions
so if you have any other question just
will spend five minutes for this and
whatever you have question I will answer
in touch then we can move to the control
inheritance so from one kv I got a
question what is dependency right here
so for now we are using a simple
application in surah simple application
I want to use any other external
application also inside my app so how
can I do this for that you have to
inject your external application who's
this using our dependency injection in
our next to demo we will see how can we
inject ing route are you a route inside
the application ok if you want the
access in your external application you
can inject those things in our
application using dependency injections
so from so I got a question is it
supported in all the process angularjs
is supported in all the latest
processors like Firefox Chrome Opera and
the latest IE also from knowledge we
have a question how can this variable be
declared as a global okay so for example
this name can be accessed now you are
seeing this engine this name can be
accessed only in this particular
controller so if you want to access the
same name in multiple controllers what
you can do one way is you can use it as
a root scope so if you are rooting using
as a root scope that will be considered
as a global variable you should be able
to answer certain all the pages but the
problem is the root scopus if you are
defining any variable as a root scope
data whenever you are changing the data
your whole application data vp again
updated so it will affect the
performance so you should not defend
anything as a root scope variable but if
you want to make it as a global you can
share it by creating the services this
is how you can create a global variables
in anger this by sharing the services
so from so are taking we have a question
is there a workaround forward process if
you are using ie8 it is supported and
ie7 very much less but the later
versions whatever you are using english
is like 1.4 and 1.5 1.3 it is not enough
supporting but if you want to use it in
the wood browser you have to use ID
equal to mg app in your HTML rude if you
use it over there so you should be able
to access this angular JS application in
your word writing but all the latest
process is fully supported with angular
JS from promote we have a question not
only what kind of data we will keep in
the root scope so sometimes what will
happen we won't be having much time to
develop a web application by creating
data on sharing the data of the services
for example today night if we have a day
model happen just we will be grating
everything in the global variable then
you should be able to access it in the
application but that is like a worker on
it is not a permanent solution if you
have a very small application you can
have it in the root scope that won't
affect much but for example consider I
have 30 or 40 controllers in my web
application so if I have 20 are 40
controller so what will happen if i make
small change in my root scope variable
let's do that here i am going to depend
this as a root scope variable so if you
want to define it as a root scope a
variable instead of scope you have to
inject air routes cook now injected
others hope this has been created as a
root scope variable if a seat over here
the same thing you can see if i change
anything it will be minor
okay so i am using this variable outside
of the controller the controller scope
only between this but i am trying to use
this variable outside of the controller
still I should be able to use this one
because of defined as a root scope able
whenever I make a change what is
happening all that child of the scope
variable will be updated so whenever you
make a change the dollar watch him it
will trigger once the watch even
triggers it digests you're all scope
variable now if i define it as a Scooby
refer only this coke variable whatever
it depend in this controller this thing
only we can update but if I mention it
as a root scope or the controller if I
have 80 controllers all lately
controller scope it will be updated so
it will reduce the files ok guys let's
go into the next module that our
controller inheritance
ok so the controller Hagen's what does
it mean we control the inheritance it is
just like a normal hour java
intelligence if you want to access your
parent variables and methods we will be
using elements in order to inherit our
parent class to the child so in the
child you should be able to access on if
you find methods and variables inside
your crap in the same day whatever the
scope variables and four methods you
defined in the controller the only thing
you should be accessed in your child a
daughter so right here I have written a
piece of code my first wanna do NT
control a shiver parent control over
there i have defined 18 put i equal to
text and the moral is me so in say like
inside the pattern controller i have
eaten one more controller that is your
child so if i just bring the child what
happened whatever i have written in the
pattern that will be available in the
child you should be except are your
parents cook very little so if you want
to go over right now so you can go right
in that side but then one be reflected
in your parent or just it will be
overwritten in your child answer why do
we leave this unfolding in here even if
i want anything just like an event in my
side control it so then what do we need
to inherit it for example inside one
controller I mean fire six controls so
all control honest I wanted to use the
same functionality so instead of carbon
tasting the same functionality non 500 I
will be defining it only in a parent or
product so from the power controller I
should be able to use those puncturing
all the child not robots hi Jake and
order on all the power of the pie
controls should be able to use this
panel controller function it is mainly
use it uses to enable the bifurcation
and the
recently that is the main advantage of
using controller inheritance in our web
application let's see how basic jammu on
this controller inheritance so hey let's
go to ovoid so here instead of creating
only one controller I am going to make
multiple controllers first control is my
parent controller here I have the name
and the same way I have the ng model he
inside this controller I am going to
define another control of God child
control my child controller also had
defined it here here also i am going to
print so let's put up clear separation
this is take charge controller here it
will be a bad parent control in the same
way it will define the names over here
it's to whatever name is defined then i
am defining the same you put up in put i
equal to test ng model equal to me so
what i am doing just I am trying to
access the same variable whatever
defined in my parent control let's do
this so let me go here so here you have
to define a parent control and shut off
this control parent controller and
instead of a root scope let's make it as
a scope here you can see I can I'm
defining two times the same scope
variable what I'm doing is so who are
working on this load assam unification
of the files so for example if you are
working in this node application what
will happen so whenever you deploy your
code we will be compressing all that
mystery ml's and javascript everything
so here I
each and every time I have to use it as
a root scope that be it is taking more
space also and it will increase your
page wait so instead of that here it
will be defined as I a and this Co paper
so you can define it as a a here again
so this particular scope will be passed
into this variable that's why we are
invented as a 2 times but now for the
development purpose if independent as a
year now I know this is a squad that all
of scope later if some people comes and
see for example you won't be having one
or two lines of code it will be five
hundred or three hundred lines of code
in the fight ok so in between yell at me
hear that name so they will get confused
they have to go on top under as to see
what does this yay then only they will
get to know ya yesu dollar scope
variable so for the development purpose
we will have it later whatever the scope
variable the same lee but whenever we'd
apply it we have some kind of grunt or
any other costs greiner it will compress
your fire so that time automatically
this variable will be changed into some
other variable name with some less
length like ABC whatever it is ok so we
can reduce the whole page size now what
happened just I defining right here from
parent one from parent one ok now if i
run this i will get a error because i
have to define my child controller also
let me define the child controller
my child controls the same scope
variable but I am NOT going to create
any scope variables over here just i
define my child controller order nothing
is there i defined a name only in my
pattern controller the chain controller
is empty but i am accessing the name in
my child control you can see it right
here let me refresh the bitch now you
are seeing right here this is my parent
control in the power controller whatever
data I have it over here down scope name
equal to from band 1 so it is coming
from pal one in the text box also
serving the data if i change anything in
the text box it is changing in parent
controller as well as in that child
controller okay this is what we are
going to see here against the zoo this
particular scope variable has been
inherited from your child controller the
stripe controller is accessing your
parent control scope but we are we can
use overriding also over here in the
application for example if we want
lowers overwrite the data it will be
overwritten only in the child controller
not in the pattern just we are over
rating the Baron control of scope in the
child controller okay so now what
happened already his child control is
having some data that's why this is not
getting affected okay so this is so you
can overwrite the data from your parent
controller to the child control let's
see this also now i have defined two
controllers one control within another
control let us try to access the same
scope variable outside of the controller
here i am going to define another
controller deal
ng-controller equal the second control
okay here if I try to access that
variable name that we put a tab then
only will get to know maybe we have this
third controller second control okay
refresh now i am trying to access the
name already me people we didn't defend
this controller ah so that's why we are
getting the error if we define the
controller so what is this control the
name is second controller okay now it
depends n controller but whatever data I
defined in my first it is not accessible
it my child second controller am i right
this controller scope will be accessible
only within this controller area you
this is what we are calling it as a
given okay so whatever you define inside
of this controller here this view only
gets update if you're changing the scope
and the scope variable can be accessible
only in this so if you want to access
the same scope variable over here in
these controllers what you can do you
can create a service and with this
service you should be able to share that
data between multiple controls otherwise
let us see this also instead of sharing
the data with the service now I am going
to share it with their roots cool so if
we depend it in the root scope let's see
the result now you can see the data in
second child controller as well as in
this second controller also because the
root scope will act like a global
variable so whatever data you are
depending in your application with the
root scoop that will be accessible in
all the controls as well as you can
access it in de all set
also now this is your first controller
scoop and this is your second controller
school now outside of the controller
Here I am trying to access this label
each one oops way of control let's print
this data name whenever I play here you
are seeing the data from parent one so
the sewer scope variables will be
accessible everywhere when the only
trouble if you are using a very
large-scale application you could define
anything in the root scope once you
update the root scope it will update you
were who scooped evils whatever you have
it in your application that was about
the performance so mostly you have to
try to avoid using this route scoop
variables in your application so the you
guys have any other question in this
controller inheritance the best you can
post your questions i will be answering
for the next five minutes so from the
vendor even have a virgin what editor
you are using this is a sometime you
later I this one of the best editor for
other you a developer's how's the
clippings are oil over here for css3 SAS
control angularjs employee so again you
this Ranger so now the best editor so
from can be p how pushing do do we have
only the scope and root scope are do we
have any other variables we have only
just these two when that one is the root
scope and another one at the school
paper we don't have any other variables
if you are defining an armored local
variable you a controller that can't be
accessed in your view but you can define
normal local variables but that can't be
accessed so from our village I mean as
we have a pushing since we define the
parent controller in the other ones will
automatically
the scope variable exactly because it is
inheriting that depth up from your
parent and roller it can access all you
were score even whatever in defending
the panel control right here who are
seeing the data now i define this data
in my para controlar this can be
inherited to this child so the child can
access this particular and data so from
the hood in our question can we pass the
controller as a dependency into another
controller first are possible so you can
pass only services hartley's values
constants to the controllers not control
within another controller if you want to
share the data between the controller
you have to create a service or factory
with those things only you can share the
data you can guarantee us a controller
in under control so from watching you
have a pushing how can I give one
controls available in another controller
with root scope so if you are defining
it as a dollar scoop a liberal in your
controller then you can be accessed by
your root scope so if you are planning
to you root scope a review in your
controller the root scope is totally
shared with your application so whatever
you are definite as the root scope that
will be available all over the figures
so you will not be dependent hear it
again from us if we have a push in
without root scope call completion of
the data so because if you are hard
using the root scope the one thing with
to share in the data you have to create
a services in the services possible
scope variable and inject that
particular service into longer control
over there you can see so the reverse
asking is controlled as a signatory
natural exactly in the controllers are
single
let me tell you this what does it mean
by single secret enemies it also
lingerie it is a BK instantiated one in
once near a vacation control and
services unpaid everything our singleton
objects where factory is not a single
them so from Tommy we have a cushion you
created a name variable that is the
keytar use a different can we create our
one variable so just this dollar scoop
that name is the normal variable you can
define whatever you want instead of this
you can create like anything so now ABC
will be a variable oh and here I have
access to everything if by ABC is just a
very nothing else now it would be able
to access it right here now you are
seeing by ABC okay it is just available
ok now let's move to the next module the
wrong things in angularjs so we have
seen the demo of controller inheritance
next to us angularjs roles so they say
what is it ring bearers if you want to
do a particular template between a HTML
you should be able to load it with the
crops before what you will be having in
I phrase are the grave with the frame
you should be able to lower that content
within a contact that's how we will be
doing instead of do that if you want to
load a webcam played with in the
antechamber you can use ng rocker are
you a doctor in angularjs applications
we have these are the two main modules
for this erotic this m0 term is built
very core angle race team but then
probably the center of the risk you
can't use this turtles are if you want
to use multiple views insider see this
and on it those things are not
possible en0 but if you want to use the
Tigers for example
staying or remains on the pitch the
amazing whippet you will be on the main
menu that is all products sitting
contacts or whatever it is ok this is
the maintained in order click on the
phone the boom page will be loaded
product page will fit over in that
specific container but inside the
product page you will be having multiple
please again in the products you will be
having euronics and resist this kind of
getting insane one holding you may have
so if i click electronic they have load
the electronics content over there so
this is one of their kind as a child out
if you want to use this Charlie Rose you
have to go with this you a daughter in
short of ng powder ng router charge cows
are not possible so we'll be using that
you were under the you Erica he will
consider the stick inside out is instead
of you were dollar route parameters okay
over here if you see in the engine order
it will look for them probably you are
so whatever comes after the hash or a
column has slash home slash contacts so
he take okay this is the you are there
for this particular you are I want to go
a specific complete so this is how
engine out of it would ensure that i
want to the first eight so it will be
give more options over here for example
the state within a state is possible
multiple states in a single view that is
also possible that is the difference
between the NGO dinh ru error so if you
want to build a very complex
applications that then you can use you
ever or this multiple rows but now I'm
on to it just a basic application gets
full playing taps in car engine every
day I have to load those contents of
that then you can use Darla and yoga but
now we will see
the demo of ng rotor as well as this you
a router let's go to our page again let
me clear available so it may confuse I
cleared everything just I have to find
my application and I have my mg of this
is to be defined our application and our
angle just one custom days it also a
little bit leading her just I have my
account just like define my application
right here now I want to use ng router
in my application so if you want to use
n 0 ver you have to include one more
script file script furred and the
sources so I have it over here right for
if you want to you change it over how to
include this angular all taught meet rjs
this will be available in angular oh and
your day yesterday our dream from there
you can download the script file also
now we want to use this angular Rob
let's go here and include it in our is
Gemma the days so we included that
script file over here but you can sing
our new JavaScript if you include the
file you should be able to access all
the functionalities available inside
this fire but here in angular taste if
you want Laxus those functionalities
what we have to do you have to improve
that module has a dependency module for
your application so now what I am going
to do I am going to include this as a
dependency for this ng Rob this is the
module name of angular drop that has
been included as a dependency for our
application once it is included so what
I have to do I want to configure the
house ok just before we include let's do
this that I am creating a deal just
create some tasks
ash / oh gosh / contact again let's open
this in the browser okay so whenever I
click on the school this has become has
boom now you're seeing right here in the
you are after hat you RC / own picnic on
front of that you will be getting the
heart but whenever it becomes a who I
want to load the home template over here
right here in the bottom you know same
way if i click on contact I want the
world of the contact how can you lose
part of this we will be using an entire
outer now i define included my m0 that
as a dependencies to the application
again now you have the create the
configuration file for your energy up in
angle days we have one more feature that
a model called confit so once you launch
your application automatically it will
go to this conflict whatever you will
depend over there it will be executed so
we can defend our configuration of our
entire outer in this container country
and this function through after we've
included NZ order this engine of the
rich having a functional taste like
dollar door providers or URL rotor
provider now i just need only taller or
provider route provider again that has
been included now if i wanted config
this raw how can we reversed dollar on
provider dot then your URL is slash home
you have to go this particular template
so here you can define your HTML as a
template or you can mark it as a
template URL and he can load the HTML
from the outside also but now let me
define it as an origin flip
template home template okay just i am
going to guard a top home template come
to it then another one also we have one
is the home / your video though home
tempted and if it is a contact what can
I do for that also you have to create
your own country then this is / contact
whatever you are given right here this
you are when it is / contact it has to
load the template dear and I want to
load contact template it is done now you
have defined your roles but whenever I
didn't give this / Tomas / contacting
the URL where do we need to load this
template that is how to define for that
I am going to take me right here dear
whenever I Enda you are a /strong load
is this specific template over here eng
view so this is the connective available
inside this specific fire angular crowd
are not make a jest this directive will
be available so if I mentioned this NJ
view it will be like a place for them so
this template will be loaded in the CMG
if it change it as a bone this bone
template will be loaded contact contact
MLB road this is how we will be
configuring the angularjs rose let me
open this in the browser now nothing is
going whenever you click on go on minute
let me see any other error so we wins
races that is the error
let me go here and let's give come so
this is what they are Oh / now before it
will be like this oh ok whenever this is
nothing is there so if nothing is there
here it won't come to this configuration
here because it is not finding / low as
well as it is not finding contact so in
one load a knee a little bit whenever I
click on who this URL has become / one
if you are you are a becomes lash comb
it will come over here and if you go to
this specific template home template
where you loaded you load it in this
container here you are seeing boom
generator if i click on contact this
will become contact template that you
make it as big so again you get shown
that each one okay now refer you are
seeing home template and Khan Academy if
i change the url it is big it is loading
that particular template over here in
the HTML in the same way instead of
loading the derrick template you should
be able to lower that template you are
also over here ok that loading definite
you are as those things will be seeing
it in there you around them right so now
what I'm going to do it here you can
load one to one level of router but
inside this template if you want to load
another thing place how can I division
that is not at all possible so i wanted
to do that also for that we can't access
this Angela router father I wanted to
use the UN order so let's see improve
the angular UI router in shut off
Angharad i am going to remove this file
instead of this i am including angular
you a raga its delete everything I do
not want
let me delete this configuration files
now this angular mg router won't be
available because my report and be in
circa this angular you Erica so here you
have to inject that particular
dependency so follow the anchor you a
router the dependency is you a not over
this is the angular order more you live
in the same way we have to create our
configuration file for this you a router
in that app lets create this Afghan
conflict so here for this you in order
will be having two parameters one is
state provider another one as you are a
total provided using the state provider
we should be able to create multiple
states and you can access those things
so let's pass them two parameters string
provider and dollar you are a router
provider then you have to create the
configuration in the same way now what I
am going to do dollar estate provider
dot before we had I have been event when
the URL is there we have to load this
instead of that here i will be creating
a new state i am creating a new state
and for this state and creating the
configuration whenever revival becomes /
home load this particular template dh1
home template from you a router / big
then I want to create another state also
d'aste I am creating one more straight
Carl contact and when the URL is /
convex lower this template let me copy
paste it so we can save some time it is
loaded from contacts template okay now
what I have done the same way already
created a configuration file in the mg
router in the same they I have creator
the config ages so you have it depend
the same interview if you want to access
what do we do first let me create a game
a href equals them hash home hash /
contact so this is how we'll be
mentioning our x square it should be a
contact so let me make it as contacts
okay now we define these things but once
you just define you have to mention
where you have to load this file also
write in the same way how we used our UI
view mg you in the same way we have
another directive called you in so those
files will be loaded in this specific
place order right let me refresh this
application you can see there is no
error father's whenever you click on
home this boom template is loaded
contact contact campaign I once again it
is not refreshed properly because here
we have mentioned the template as for
template from you a road map at this one
let me open this again
so now you are seeing home template from
you a router and if I go to contacts it
is showing the contacts from you Adam
let's make it like a simple application
so i am going to kill some hostiles for
this style let's call it as a menu class
mainly just main menu bought her one bit
solid just for separation because i'm
giving mistakes paddington pics and here
that means you know said whatever I have
a a that i anchored i am just finding
the tank attack i'm leaving some sailing
over there also margin five pics first
up let's take a look how does it look
like so normally we have this main time
now what I want to do here instead of
loading the templates right so instead
of loading the templates I want to do
the HTML instead of template how can we
do them let's go here so this is where
we have our application in app one here
let me create some more HTML files new
home dot HTML let me copy paste it you
have to contact
contact our HTML and hold on HTML let me
open those files inside editor whom that
HTML it is to nothing md in the same way
contact our HTML this is also empty so
what I'm going to do here i am going to
give this filename h1 this template
loaded for on fire home while okay boom
dot HTML file the same way i am going to
mention here h1 this fire is beam loader
from contact thought his channel okay i
just created two templates file and i
have to give the park instead of this
template it may remove this template you
are we are not mentioning a template now
we are mentioned in the template you are
so where do we have those template just
in the application itself you can see
the folder it is more here so you can
directly here home dot HTML and if it is
a contact template URL is contact our
HTML now we are loading these two
templates over the inside of that
template you are loading that HTML files
now we will wish i will show you this
one more thing if i try to run the
ceiling in my chrome browser let's see
what happens let me remove it okay i
refresh my browser nothing is happening
okay here you are not about seeing any
other error but if i click on the boom
it is giving here at like cross-party
support ever because chrome is having
more security so it is not allowing to
lure the
extra file inside the application this
won't rht my contact on camels are
external files and we can't lower those
external files so now here you are
seeing it as a file but if you are
loading external another file inside
this he does like cheating the browser
okay we are trying to access the
external files so because of the
security purpose Kronus not sticking
them but if you are running it as a lip
service using the tomcat are unknown
service what will happen it won't be
become a fight it will be a local folks
at the time you should be able to load
the external applications okay so that
is one of the way otherwise what you can
do for now we will run this in there
Firefox now I am loading this file has
been loaded from this template right so
now you are not about defining that
Derek HTML in the template we are
loading the file from the HTML so this
is possible from you air or garages and
a raga but we will see the special case
in that you another now what I am going
to do inside this I am going to create
one morning class summon some men oh I
will be having your other engine tuned
so here I'm going to have to you are a
href equal to slash hash / contact /
test one this will be the first one and
i am going to create the another you are
this is test two let's take a look how
does it look like in that browser let me
create a styling father's I'm going to
fix away with 200 pigs float left and
you are list style nah right so i define
this you are right here he loaded that
page if i go to the contact here you are
seeing the other two links also we click
on this link it is adding / contacts /
test1 and test2 for this also i want to
configure my crowd parameters so how can
i do this here let's go to our router
configuration you need to create the
nestor states so i am going to create a
state this state is coming inside you
work on texted so contact dot test one
this is the state name and we have to
mention you everywhere if my URL is /
test one okay now we are not giving
contact / test one just we are giving
test one so what does it mean you do is
already inside the contact and for this
state we are giving creating another you
are so instead of creating a template
URL just great let me create a template
till loader template test one in the
same way let me create another template
test two and as you are we'll be test to
hear this loader from test tube now we
have created a child template but then
we need to lower this template that also
in our dimension here you have a sub
menu over here let me create the submenu
entire class submenu container and this
will be my new IMU so this view is
inside your parent view that containers
will be loaded over here in this view
and the child impede ordering that
mainly to separate this one let me kill
some stage for this so here you I'm just
giving a bada bada one picks all ep3 and
float left me this 500 pace ok now let's
take a look so it's gone let's see what
is happening let me check whether we
have any error ok we missed based out of
San a semicolon let's see from the
configuration ok here you can see I miss
come on ok let me refresh now everything
is it I how do you make this as a
property that's why we are not getting
the exact you can feel whatever you're
expecting it is class main controller
main container let's give CSS for this
wait hundred thousand H this enough fine
I 200 pics let's take a look now you are
saying so this is loaded from the
contact but if i click on any of that
test ed has to the oily right now you
are seeing this so this is what we have
instead of this should be a test two
that's why we are getting the same you
are now you can see you are contact
controllers floor and here if you go to
the boom this is your home in the
contact again you have one more you a
doubt that from this you wherever we are
loading our child route sauce so this is
one of the way to access all your files
okay let me go here this is our child so
let me explain once again here instead
of keeping our h1 let me go sit over
here now you should be able to see so
from here again we are starting our
contact erased my in the connector which
their mother again we are loading our
child news this is one of the best
feature available inter you a router and
he may have some other problem also if
you say like some mother you are also
here in the URL what will happen it
won't lower the pitch just leave me
there in the same URL because we didn't
do you find this road for that what do
you have to do if you said you seen you
are you can mention that also you are a
grounder provider than otherwise low /
boom what will happen if it is not
finding the URL in this configuration
are ready to load the phone now this is
working fine if i go to contact your
contacts loaded it is too
flora Vista to slaughter everything is
working as they expect them but if i
type anything right here that we go to
this one and from here i am going to
type something else when i click on
enter automatically it is loading the
poo so here we are mentioning if we are
not finding the specified URL load the
HTML if the URL is not available
otherwise loads in the stable that's
what we are depending right here so this
UI router is simple as well as it is
having more features compared to ng
router so let's go to the next module
then we can have five minute session for
this building custom research and the
CMG router let's go here and the next
one is building custom widgets so to
Bill your own custom widgets in
angularjs what are we do it now many
will be using the custom their actives
the directives will be having each one
functional despite several whatever you
see ntp you that is a directive pinned
by this angle chase paper so those guys
build something so this directive is
acting like a place you order in the
same way if you want to build any other
custom directive you can do that by this
widgets okay so what I wanted to do I
wanted to create a new Richard her like
a graph I want to plot her landrum
further they wanted to create a graph
sorry create the midget so if I just
plot the normal craft inside a
particular element 100 0 each and every
time I have to call the graph or a hair
turn create the configuration file that
is not possible I want to create a only
one gender a binger and wherever I want
I should be able to access that midget
that is what I am expecting now then you
should be able to create using the
custom images so you can create your
widgets as a element type r attribute
class or card so this will be a little
bit advanced topic so let's just
concentrate
so now what I'm going to do let me take
it everything I do not want it so just
we have and I don't need my dependency
also i have deleted my dependences this
one as well I don't need these fights
own dot HTML no only I need this one I
let me delete everything let me have a
clear 5 ounce a day late okay we don't
need this angular now I did one here
angular I don't need any other
dependency now I am going to build a
graph you say c.p.r depleted so far the
body are do you have to include those dt
and c 3 j's in your file script your
source is I have it in my library / d 3
dot Minn dot J's then your cdjs also so
to give the proper look and feel already
see three days guys is having a spy
chief let me include that size jitter so
as library / c 3 dot Minn dot CSS okay
now what we want to do I wanted to
create a widget later graph the line
graph matra micra this was the things i
wanted to clear it how can you create
this let me create a basic controller
there ng-controller equal to test
controller let me define the same
controller here after
controller just as controller and you
say me however we define let's mention
the school function of your dolls go so
we defined our scope side yard let me
create a basic directive I am going to
call this directive ask yes c3 line /
simply land now i am creating a new tab
this tab is not at all available in
angularjs r it is not a dollar valid
HTML tag just am gaining this time for
this step i am going to heal a specific
functionality ok so far this time if you
want to create a specific functionality
how do we do that you can achieve by
that custom directed haha directive this
one on the feature of angular directive
and whatever the name you have given C 3
line c3 who I am this directive will
return an object this is the type of the
directive whatever you are doing so what
does this time it is that element type
in their HTML so if you are defending
overhear anything like a DTR so this is
the aggregate but this is the element so
we can mention our directive as like a
romantic it is an element then if you
want to pass any smoke variables from
your controller that you can access it
in the director because each and every
day whenever you create the scope it
will create a child scope for the
directive then you have to share the
scope from your controller through
directive for that you have to create
your scope variables so I am going to
pass one data card at the data and that
will be here able to authors in in the
directive so far that they are giving
this equal to so it will be having equal
and am risen equal to
able to provide this way finding you can
access the data from the controller as
well as you can access the data from
direct you to control if you use a it
will be accessing the only the value the
compile value next understand you should
be able to pass the function from the
controller ok now just I need only the
data then the link function so whenever
you know this directive automatically it
will note the link function or a
controller function now I did only
relief function it will have scooped the
other man and attributes you can name
whatever you want just I will be calling
this one as name element and aggregate
after that here I have to write the
functionality for main engine so simply
grab oh yeah you can call whatever you
want this I'm going to Carter simply
grab equal simply are generated so this
is a c3 method generate and you pass the
graph configurations buying well you
need to bind this graph wherever i'm
using this yellow man over there i need
to bind the graph this is what i am
giving the element where i need to find
this crap next you have to give the data
for this crap so Delta it needs x axis x
axis i am going to call it as ax and
columns i will be having some hard core
data part now later you will be passed
the data from the control x it can be
one two three four five and the value
for this why 12 30 to 40 35 for then you
have to mention the type of this graph
type like this i need a line graph now
we defined a basic directive so whenever
I try to
access the director ac3 so it will give
this specific graph let's try this let
me open it in the browser now it is give
me this Langer am i right so but I
hardcore at this data so it is not about
a useful directive army so whatever data
I want to pass it from the controller I
want to use that data so for example I
want to show the information on cricket
school right so let's do this Darla
school dot score score sequel to I am
going to define it out but over whatever
the school my x axis will be even
forward first to over my y-axis will be
a score first to our tendons in the same
way let me you this far fios second /
third lower is fine second / third over
42 / and fifth power ok so in the same
way you can give whatever you want first
to our tour ends so eigen over eight
men's 12 19 and 18 five or six ok now
this score I want to pass it from my
controller to directive so we have
cleared out of scope variable cons
directive for that you should be able to
pass this controller scope now you
should be able to access this goes over
there but it is expecting it as hurry so
you have to convert you are objecting to
I how can we do get columns I am
creating one javascript function as i
get columns function
yet columns so the same thing right I
have to check whether and didn't make
any typos but X equal to em tra i am
going to defend this and y equal to it
is also em tra let me define inside why
one of the variable then I am be having
the full scorecard details in the scope
object I want to look through an iron
needs to build that JSON object far
where I equal to 0 is then scooped on
beta dot length I was just so let me
build this object so X dot push the
scope taught beta of i dot X so it's
accessing you push to the act in the
same way why not push scope dot data of
i dot y so x and y axis will be pushed
you to this let me return this as a data
return array X comma Y now whatever data
you passed from the controller that will
be passed to this feature and you should
be able to discern that refresh I think
so we are getting some JavaScript era
length is not defined
I have to check whether can i access
this data right so first we will check
over here can we access this course so
where do we have a directive and the sea
lion here this is what the controller
what we give fine let's go here refresh
now you should be able to access the
data it will delete this so the time you
didn't save it properly that's why now
you are seeing my first / I depend on us
for as to second / 6 3rd or whatever I
suppose I defined it is kind in the same
way you should be able to create
different types of beaches now i agree a
terror normal this III crap okay in the
same way I wanted to create barrera our
pie graph everything you can create it
only once now if i call this C 3 graph
taken I didn't have to make a call once
again gesture in algebra and in shock
who's I wanted to show the employee's
salary or whatever it is okay some take
me make it a self I'm going to create
one Moscow variable okay here i am
creating one moscow variable called Sal
the salary will be having a day here you
can mention your x-axis or y-axis that
will be displayed in there next to graph
my x axis will be chained one y will be
10,000 so my I first employees having
10,000 k so again my eat good and by
like this you can mention whatever you
want it to so just we create a limited
so it should be usable a very fit now if
i refresh the page you will be getting
two graphs one is for your scores
another one
I salary what already built right so
let's make it as two three four it will
save me if you want to build any kind of
custom grabs the everything is possible
just if you want the next one is
competent and pass the data you are just
passing the data for this wheelchair it
is creating lick it up in the same way
whatever business logic you want to
build you can believe in the midget and
we can reuse it anywhere and obligation
that is the best use of creating bit
changing angular JS let's go to the next
slide we have seen the limp off building
angularjs widgets hey so if you register
its angular this course with our Erica
so what are our promptings we will be
covering first one obsession it will be
covering the introduction to JavaScript
MVC framework and the anger is so each
and every module it will take we are
some time ok so the position will be
taking via the fam and over there we
will be expanding you they torch into
JavaScript framework and annual rings
the next session will be independence
intentions and controllers how can you
share the data between controllers using
services and packard so we'll be
discussing more about the house
detectives or if you toss in the fourth
session you'll be the one component
however we build a basic crap the same
thing will be building some complex
craft take a drag and drop and do this
and everything the fourth one will be
there third of all the bodies now maybe
you have seen one is a you wherever it
is the same way we haven't we need
third-party modules then the energy
storage are in GQ so we will be
discussing more about the third party
module and testing so how can you do you
need is for angle gives we will be
discussing about the data / foot model
in our lot six tomorrow we'll build into
the end web application with angularjs
node.js and we'll be using their project
areas like
astronomical boosting speaking about six
model last will this end to end the
application using angular and node
modules these are other topics will be
covering for registering with our
agriculture okay so what are the
features we have it in our director
first one you will be having the life
online classes it's a very moral taking
the vibe our main castle and the only
thing will be a recorder and it will be
a virtually nowhere else so then if you
have any readout our supporting will be
available for 24 / 7 so you can ask your
courage over there to include versa when
supportive culture is our other each and
every module is having its won't push so
we can test our knowledge what we
learned in the specific model and hunt
after you will be having a project work
you get a web application with angular
nodes every advance you will be getting
a certificate from over a car that you
get linked to your LinkedIn profile so
you guys have any question then spin
five minutes i will be answering for
your questions game so if we have any
questions this poster s'okay from
randomly have a question what does app
can't be so acronym is one of the module
irrelevant exactly layer so wherever you
are building it as a common method if
you launch the application first you
come to the counting method over there
whatever the one star is have written
that will be executed inside this egg
hunting
from Kadesh we have a question let us
know cost causes so all the price
details will be available in our hearing
of it you can go over the chick formed a
ring of it there will be defining as
well as the price for this who's Arthur
will be available you can get it from
there so from Venus you have a version
can we make any scope variable dependent
on another scope variable so if you want
to make a dependent scope variables what
I have to do what if one day is off the
rocks off you go see available then only
you are changing the one so beautiful
automated in the others scope variable
will be changed so that what is that way
you can dependent on another scope
variables Superman
we have bushel can eng bind instant data
attribute in c3 line element so the c3
line and whatever we had anticipated so
if you are using the empty by what
happened just we will be taking the
theta from the controller but I have to
pass the data if any change happens from
the controller I have to reflect back to
the controller that's why we are using
this isolated scopes and scope variables
inside our collective not we are not
biting the data so from lean which we
have a pushing his angularjs is a
first-half nice if framework it is not a
fast and easy framework utterly ember.js
backbone and knock over there goes our
all the MVC framework on a plane set but
it is better that those frameworks
because if you compare in language is
there are nearly third in those dark
circles in the upper screen if you are
getting any other place you can post it
in the forum will beginning we can sir
another one a little more modules or
wherever so if you want to be anything
you need not really everything from your
scratch already model should be however
just include those modules as a
dependency into your project you should
be able to access it so personally if
you ask me I will feel this angularjs is
better than ever and the backbone so
from needed Pierre pushing how those
angularjs better than jquery hoping we
should not confirm a play with ovens the
same thing as legit is different ideas
different angle this is a framework but
jquery is just a viper so it is having
only the plane only the functional gives
what we can implement so they created on
top of java screwed so we can access all
the JavaScript function is it simply but
either this is a framework you can build
an Indian web application with proper
structure it is far far better than this
jake would so if you can come back break
your company it is far far better
so do you guys have any other pushing
otherwise it from Hamid class goes in
for a moment we have a question there
what is the difference between MVC
controller and angular control so now
MVC controller means you it is most of
this is same so what we are doing here
constricting access or the nominee MPC
control or what we do we will restrict
access over here how can you share the
data between two things how can we
navigate to the places here in our
energies controller we will be writing
our business lodgings and this will be
the model for your data okay so all the
data will be shared from the controller
and in the controller will be having
dollar watch and digest methods so if
your model changes automatically this
watch gets triggered a little of
interview about new changes the ones we
can trigger the controller induct a
store on these concepts will be
available name and good control so what
is factory okay so factoring is one
another another feature available in
angularjs it is so if you want to share
the data between the controller I will
be in a factory in the factory I can
create one more variable function so I
will inject the factory invisible
controller whenever I change the food I
will push that stupid able to the
factory so the same factory you can
inject into the other controller if you
want to interact between two controller
you can't inject one color into the
other control but you can intake the
factories so inside one factory I will
inject the variables whatever I wanted
to put and I will take that faculty
longer controller over that you can
charm the data so amazingly be using
this factory to share the data between
the
so from random t have a question can we
list as much as you are a country in the
okapi so app config is not one hella far
as you are a configurations so you can
do any operations over there in our
country but we have to define our
configuration on the page rule so
whenever your applications lose we have
to compose a particular method and I
wanted to some operations that is what
we are doing in the economy so in the
country using our you are you a doctor r
ng rotor you can load any template a
number that is no restriction for
forgiveness really thank you very much
for registering the session if you have
more questions or anything suggest you
can roll over and you can attend our
angularjs session in the header rekha
will be answer recovering all the topics
n2n we will be covering this angle
decisions thank you very much guys let's
see you in the search engine right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
