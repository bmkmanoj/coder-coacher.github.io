if you have been working with
Senjem Facebook Messenger users age
based at the database so all the real
have charts that you do they do
internally use HBase is a database so it
visit the reader has been used by a lot
of different vendors you know lot of
companies I know know our users lost on
you
huggable so a lot of companies they have
moved from traditional RDBMS to no
security doubles so that's can anybody
tell me when do you think that you can
move from a relational our DBMS to a
knows ability levels if you have a
website now if you want to think about
the back end of a data back in the
website when you do you think that it
will be good enough for you to move from
a our DBMS based solution to a super
solution no cases for wheels not really
for rings are talking to huh debates
historical data and analytics no
historical data analytics you do not
need have no sequel database you need a
hadoop waste you may not do you know the
difference between Hadoop and or sequel
right guys we have talked about it how
do versus no sequel there are a lot of
use cases where mando cannot be a
solution suffixes column based
operations is not on entire yeah but
mostly I would say when I need a
database I know that I need a database I
do not need analytical software I do not
mean how do how dope is used by
analytical software you know decision
making process I do not read the
Dianetics
I need a database but I did not need
that transactional based system I do not
I'm not doing a transactional operation
on the database for example your your
Facebook post
if posting something is not
transactional tweeting something you're
uploading an image you are doing some
operation these are not
transactions these are atomic operations
but not transactions so when you know
that you need a database but you also
know that a transactional data which is
not what you need you need a database
that can handle search queries inserts
updates
it's at a very very fast rate on huge
amount of data but you do not need
transaction those cases you would be
better off using our know simple
database so and all the new generation
of technologies Twitter or Facebook
LinkedIn anything in a matrix all of
them are actually replacing their
back-end database from Oracle to the no
sequel database because they do not do a
lot of transactions but if I am talking
about a banking sector if I am talking
about a bank and or or let's say if
you're talking about you know a movie
ticket where the movie database name of
the movie all the information on the
movie can happen in another database but
whenever you go and buy some tickets the
transaction that happens on the ticket
that database the transactional database
transaction DB it has to be ID BMS got
it so HBase you know Twitter you know
explora sees you know Trend Micro system
Yahoo Yahoo actually created no HBase in
certain ways so all of them are actually
using a trace
