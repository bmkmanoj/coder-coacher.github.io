today's session is going to be on AWS
certifications so why is a certification
important let's shed a light of that so
say you apply for a company and you're
looking for a job change right and the
other candidate which is competing with
you has the same experience as you and
now how will a company like me is so if
I am a company how will I decide that
you are better than them or he is better
than you so if any one of you is
certified as it gives more priority to
that person and that is the reason
certifications are important but
certifications are important just for
the stage one that is for getting
screened right they don't guarantee you
a job just because you're certified that
does not mean you will end up with a job
in the AWS sector you have to have
hands-on experience as well now why am I
saying this is because in my experience
I've seen a lot of people who have the
certification but they hardly know
anything about the subject right so if
you don't have the hands-on exposure it
is actually your certification is a
waste because no company will hire you
because the only reason they hire
certified people is because the thing
they okay so this guy knows a lot about
this subject and when we talk about AWS
it is all about implementing it is all
about hands-on right so if you have not
practiced hands-on and you have the
certification you might not get a job
finding a job will become very difficult
for you right so it is very important to
actually know what you are studying
rather than just studying it for the
sake of passing having said that let's
move ahead and see what certifications
are actually offered by AWS so AWS
basically offers you five kind of
certifications under which three are and
the associate level and two are in the
professional level right so these
certifications have actually been
divided into domains so you have the
architecting domain you have the
developing domain and
have the operations to me the most
famous certification of the boosts
sought after certification out of all
these certifications is the solution
architect certification right now I've
seen a lot of people without doing any
research just because the other person
is doing the solution architect
certification they also get in line and
become start preparing for that but you
have to understand your expertise right
so if you are a person who is from a
development background okay so you might
why not apply for the certified
developer certification if you are a
person who has been handling machines
who is a Linux administrator or
something like that why not apply for
the AWS certify this oxide mixed rater
certification it so it is very important
to choose the right certification
because that is how your career will
progress and that is and these
certifications will actually give you a
direction in your career moving on let's
discuss each of these certifications in
brief so talking about the first
certification that is the AWS certified
Solutions Architect
so basically in this certifications your
job will be to create highly available
and cost-efficient systems or
architectures and then ensuring that
they are the most cost efficient right
the second certifications that is the
certified developer certification is so
people who are from a development
background right so if you are from a
developer background you might or you
should apply for this certification and
because they test you more in terms of
the programming knowledge that does not
mean that you won't be tested on AWS you
will be tested on AWS but put the
programming also in mind right
the next certification is a Systems
Administrator certification so this
basically certification is for people
who are from administration background
right so if you are a Linux admin and
you have been working since 2 3 years in
the administration department it makes
sense for you to actually go for this
certification now talking about the
roles or the differences and the jobs
that these certifications are let's
discuss that
so on the top level you have the
certified Solutions Architect which
actually get in to interaction with the
customer and understand their needs
right once you understand their needs
you actually come up with an
architecture that is in line with the
requirements that they are put through
right and this is what the certified
Solutions Architect is all about you
might or might not implement that
architecture because it is actually the
job of the softs administrator but
usually when I see people they actually
implement it as well right so this is
about the certification then you have
the certified developer certification so
this certification is actually for
people or for developers will be making
their application on the AWS
infrastructure right so Solutions
Architect provides the developers with
the infrastructure and developers work
on that infrastructure and make
applications the third certification is
about the systems administrator so this
guy actually is responsible for
maintaining the servers once they are
made right so one solution architect has
implemented whatever architecture is
required it is the job of the systems
administrator to ensure that everything
is running fine this is the role of this
is ops administrator and these
certifications are the associate level
certifications if you want to go to the
next level of certifications the next
level certifications are actually called
professional certifications right now
the professional certifications can only
be applied when you have a prior
experience in the Association
certification for example if you are a
person who once or become a professional
certified in the solution architect role
you should actually be associate
certified in the solution architect role
before similarly if you are looking for
going on to the next level if you had a
developer certified person or your asses
off certified person and you are looking
on to go to the professional
certification you will actually become
the DevOps engineer professional right
so for DevOps engineer professional the
only two requirements are that you
should already be
solution architect a state certified
person or you should become sis ops
administered a certified post
so these are actually the certifications
which are offered by AWS like moving on
now how will you prepare or how will you
get certified we now know what all
certifications are offered by AWS but
how do you get certified so for getting
certified you actually have to pass an
exam which is conducted by AWS right now
how can you actually register for an
example like this when you click here
you will reach the screen right and over
here you have this option or this is
scheduled an exam right so once you
click on this you can actually schedule
a preferred date for you
and you can book a slot for your exam so
this is how you can actually apply for
that exam now let's talk about a little
more about the examination so the year
exam you are associate level the exam
will be for 150 US dollars and if you
want practice exams for by AWS actually
so for them that piece is 20 US dollars
right similarly for all the associate
certifications the fees is around 150 US
dollars and for the practice exam it's
20 US dollars right now the next
question which comes to your mind is
what to study exactly fourth passing
this exam right so for that AWS has
media life a lot easier because AWS has
a lot of services next but then you
should know which service to study
exactly for a particular exam right so
and that actually has been provided by
LMS as well let's talk about one
certification as of now let's talk about
the certified Solutions Architect
associate certification so this is the
exam guide for this certification guys
so basically they are provided the exam
under four domains right you have
designing highly scalable course
efficient domain you have implementation
domain data security domain and
troubleshooting to me and there are also
divided these domains in percentages
like if you talk about the
troubleshooting two means the whole
example I have only 10% of questions
which are related to troubleshooting if
you talk about the highly available
cause
fishing domain the whole of 60% of your
exam will actually be based on this
domain now these are domains now how
will you or what to learn in these
domains is actually mentioned further so
under the domain one you have these many
topics that you should be prepared for
while you are preparing for your AWS
exam similarly for the implementation
domain you have these many topics for
data security you have these many topics
and in the end for disaster data we have
these many topics right so your study
should actually be very focused you
should not study everything be smart
study what is important and that is the
reason because most of you guys are
working right and it becomes very
difficult for you guys to actually take
out time for these AWS example and that
is the reason there are a lot of online
trainers which are out there or online
companies elearning companies which
provide you with the course which is
suitable for passing your certifications
along with that they also offer you
hands-on practice wherein they might
give you an environment where you can
practice all you want for that
particular source how to prepare for
this certification so like I said you
actually have to be very focused on what
to study right moving on let's see how
you can actually practice whatever you
are learning so AWS has this amazing
free terrorise so under the free tier
you get 750 hours of free usage for your
AWS account you have some services which
are there under the feeder
so let me quickly show you guys what all
services are covered under the free tail
so the free tire is actually divided
between two parts one is called the
non-expiring feature and other one is
the introductory feature so the
non-expiring feature is where you get
all these sources for free for the whole
of your lifetime until a certain
threshold right if we talk about the
introductory feature so these services
are free for the first year and for
every month you get 750 hours of free
usage of each of these services right
for the first hole EUR now like I said
you have to have hands-on experience
right so this is where AWS has been very
generous and has actually given you this
opportunity so that you can actually
practice a lot on AWS using the free day
so this is the way you prepare guys the
other thing is like I told you guys
there are a lot of elearning companies
which are out there that provide you
with the structured training right now
this is typically how a structured
training or a syllabus for your AWS exam
would actually look like so this
actually is for a Solutions Architect
exam so our company offers sources for
the AWS certifications and this
structured training is actually for your
AWS solution architect role now this
training or this curriculum has actually
been prepared based on the exam guide
which has been given by the AWS right so
similarly so if you don't have the time
to actually make your curriculum or
understand what all has to be studied
why not go for a course wherein you will
have a certified instructor who will
share his experience and teach you and
how you can prepare for the
certification so guys this brings us to
the end of our today's session so we
have discussed all the certifications
I've told you guys what all exams are
they're how you can prepare for those
exams and this is it guys so remember
the part where I told you that don't
prepare for these certifications just
for the sake of preparing them you have
to be very thorough with all the
services which are there in AWS which
are element to your role in the
certifications and if you actually
prepare very well for any of those
certifications that you wanna master you
will definitely end up with a job
because if you see the job trends which
are there for AWS they are actually
rocketing right and if you have very
good knowledge and your subject you can
easily get a job so on that note let's
finish off today's session so thank you
