protocol sopes soup protocol is used to
access web services and soap stands for
simple object access protocol okay
the protocol is based on XML and the
soup was designed by in 1998 by David
winner done box
Bob attention and more seen ok this is
how the architecture of the soup works
that is the tight ok the client puts the
entire request that is if I want to have
a credit card transaction that is the
name credit card details cvv2
expiry date I'm a transaction it will be
put in the the request and it will be
sent on the web you okay to the service
provider okay it will reach the bank and
bank will check it and look at the soap
message and get the input what the
customer wants and process the required
details and responds back this is a
service ok and responds back again in
the soap format to the client okay so
the entire infinite request will be put
in an XML and it will be sent on web on
Internet to the service provider right
ok if you can look at the slide if you
want to get the approval or declined
status for credit card transaction from
the bank using soup ok so a simple
object access protocol that is the input
and output will be in the form of XML
okay
following steps to python or will be
executed in in client module write the
details for the customer details like
credit card account number expiry date
cvv2 in soap format as i said before
that you write all the details credit
card details into an XML file and in a
soup format the soap is a format in an
using
right so the soap message is sent on web
to web service which provides the
desired service for example if it's a
banking transaction then I will put all
the mail like you know the details of
the credit card and send it to the back
ok so the web server is unpacks the soap
message and convert into a command that
the application can understand
application will get that is application
here in our example application we'll
get the credit card information does the
required processing and generates the
response either approve or decline
status in soap message that is what
happens the the bank will get the soap
message as a request and it will see
it'll let you know convert back to a
command and understand what is the input
required what is the input given and
what output is required then it will
call the corresponding method the method
will perform the required operation and
generates a response back in soap format
and the soap message is sent back to the
client right again the soap message will
be sent back to the client and client
unpack the soap message and gets the
required information that is the client
gets the information in soap format and
take the leg output which is there in
the soap format ok and understands it so
if you look at the client and server
transaction is happening through you in
soap format that is all the details has
been put in XML in soap format and sent
to the server server looks at it
understands what the input is given
understands what what is expected by the
client looks processes it and responds
again back in the soap format and client
receives it right so this is one
architecture using web service soap is
one one protocol used on web services
it's the diagram right the client will
send in the soap format to the web on
the web to the web service and the
process ok the server processes it and
responds back again ok to the client
model
okay some of the files generated in soap
is whatever the service we have to write
it will be writing in the Java okay and
we have a visible file okay whistle
stands for web services description
language that says that file shows what
are the services provided in the Java
coding okay so what are the services
provided and what is the input required
what is the output required like this
and using this Delphi the client can
generate okay or write the web service
and connect to the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
