is concerned we will talk about few is
your interview questions so first of all
we need to understand more exactly as
zeros and what's the reason behind us
understanding and talking about these
interview questions so as there is a
pretty hot topic these days it's a part
of Microsoft cloud lot of people who are
listening to this particular webcast
having heard of might have heard of AWS
s then we talked about Google cloud is
there this one from Microsoft which we
are talking about so there's a huge
potential as far as cloud is concerned
and the market is huge the market is hot
these days and I will share my
experiences as far as the interview is
concerned and the question is relevant
to SEO so if we talk about this
particular interview session I mean the
question-and-answer session I would say
rather not interview so this covers two
major courses in s0 one is five thirty
three and one is five thirty four so 533
is for admins and by 34 is for
architects so when you talk about admins
the people who are responsible for
managing and doing the run and
maintained every day one is zero so the
questions in this particular slide would
focus on that and at the same time few
things related to the architected part
right so there is not a course also from
Microsoft itself which is PI 32 we will
not focus much in PI 32 because that
talks about I would say programming so
how do you use Azure I would say
services in order to put your services I
would say your applications on a server
so that basically focuses on that so we
would not come much in terms of that so
this will again focus on 533 and cutting
me for so give you a brief of myself my
name is Anna my total overall experience
is close to around 15 plus years and as
far as the training experience is
concerned it's around 10 years and I've
been helping a lot of different people
from different organizations
understanding technology and of course
preparing them for future may be in
consent right so as far as the
technology list I can talk about which I
trying on as Microsoft technologies set
ryx technologies
and then you have few other technologies
cloud is of course one of the most
important ones I take care of Azure
which is from Microsoft I do
Google cloud which is again as the name
says Google and then the last one which
we talk about is AWS which is the most I
would say used right but then people are
jumping onto Microsoft now the reason is
because when a soft when you compare it
with the AWS or Google is much more
cheaper right if you guys after seeing
this video would like to go ahead and
like to learn about Microsoft cloud you
can just log on to be as your website or
you can log on to the idea raker website
and there are a few courses over there
which you can enroll yourself in right
so let's just start with the interview
questions and we have close to around 72
slides and you'll be spending
approximately one up with me on these
and in the meanwhile you might have few
queries so probably neat it's not a
interaction webinar so you will not be
able to ask any questions as such but
then if you have any questions you can
always call the number which you see on
the idea maker website right and you'll
have someone to answer your questions so
let's just start with this now so now
when you talk about cloud computing a
lot of different people have different
definitions of cloud computing so now
I'll come computing is something which
is not very new technology I would say I
mean the terminology is mean but the
technology is not the first product I
would say which was talking about cloud
was my hotmail which was designed and
developed by a big party so I'm sure a
lot of people listen to this webinar
would be aware of that particular name
so what he did was he he design a main
server so in that particular main server
I used to point and access my nails
right so that mail server was in the
cloud and then I was connecting to the
mail server remotely to access my names
so that makes that a cloud product right
so now when you talk about cloud
computing these days the definition has
changed but as far as the working is
concerned it remains pretty much the
same so now when you talk about this we
talk about that we use and pay right so
paper uses be kind of more of what we
talked about so we basically use and
then pay only for very more if I would
not say data but I would say services
we use so there's explanation down there
in the slide it talks about is the use
of servers on the Internet to store
manage and process data differences
instead of using your own servers you're
using somebody else's server to do the
tasks and pay them for the amount of
time for which you use them right so
this is what the idea is
so paper uses the model which we focus
on when we talk about cloud computing
States right so this is what Club is
this is what a basic definition of
flowers if you search the internet you
will have more than I guess one hundred
hundred plus definitions on cloud now as
far as definition sunflower concern it
sets up to you which one you would like
to adapt and which one you would like to
go with but then it works with a single
model which is paper use so when you use
you pay if you don't you you don't pay
and end up there you're using somebody
else's resources no you're not using
your own resources and you're only
paying for their resources what you use
okay
now talking about different types of
services which we talked about as far as
my law is concerned so there are three
major things what we talked about which
is ISPs and SAS and there are the things
like somebody has talked about bas
database as a service then you talk
about SCS so that is for my mails but
then majorly we categorize these into
three types one is ISPs and SAS so is
talks about infrastructure as a service
and you get the hardware in that from
the cloud provider as a service so say
for example you will go ahead and deploy
a machine deploy a server so basically
when you talk about that particular
scenario you are basically putting a
server in IAS which is my infrastructure
as a service so you get complete control
on a virtual machine which is there in
the cloud hosted by Microsoft Google or
AWS and then you can just go ahead and
burn your resources onto that particular
machine so this is how it works right
simple enough then you talk about paas
platform as a service so in this you
don't get access to your machine or in
other words you can say you don't get
access to the underlying layer but you
get a complete access to the resources
or
services right so it's it's more like my
platform on which you publish your
applications or you put your application
there are a few examples so I talked
about my web apps my mobile apps brittle
and Ezard then talk about the last type
of service offered in cloud so this is
my SAS so when you talk about SAS you
get software as a service and easier so
you don't need to worry about
infrastructure you don't need to worry
about platform so you basically again
the end product which may be running on
the infrastructure which may be running
on the platform so for example when you
launch a VM on a 0 if you talk about OS
you're not buying the US and if you talk
about PS you're not buying the service
so you're just basically paying for the
software which is running on either is
or enthalpy yes so this is what we get
as far as my types of cloud is concerned
now let's just jump on to another
question now what are the different
cloud deployment models so explanation
talks about three models which we have
one is my public cloud one is my private
cloud and one is my high with shell so
let's just take this with examples so I
am a general user I am a home user I
want to go ahead and put a website so I
decide that my website will be hosted on
my cloud right so I won't go ahead and
deploy a BM on the cloud and I won't put
my website over there so I go to
Microsoft website as your website I sign
up there and then I maybe you can set
provision a machine once I provision the
machine I put is on top of it once I put
is on top of it I will just go ahead and
move my resources when I say move my
resources move my application of the
club so what I'm trying to say is a
general basic end-user who's sitting at
home can log into the cloud get a
machine and then use a machine right so
this is what my public cloud is so it's
it's available for the public right then
you talk about the private club now as
far as private cloud is concerned it's
owned by the enterprise ok
and only enterprise people will have
access to it so organizations like
Accenture or maybe the pro or maybe
catch M&amp;amp;I cognizant so these people own
a private cloud right so the idea is
the resources are owned by them and
hence their people are the ones who will
go ahead and access that but then at
times what happens is they give access
to their private cloud for their
customers also now you might have
questions that why do I build a private
cloud because end of day I am spending a
lot of money on infrastructure I am
spending large money on air conditioning
electricity I am spending money on
licensing also so why can't I just go
ahead and work on public cloud why do I
need to go ahead and implement a private
cloud now basically when you talk about
a private cloud private cloud is built
for automation so that is one of the
motion pointing and the second important
part one we talk about is that when you
talk about private cloud it gives me
more control over the resources whereas
when you talk about public cloud I do
not have control over the resources
because everything is owned by the
vendors right I'm talking about hybrid
clouds so I'll give you an example for
this also I go to Amazon and Amazon is
my public cloud provider I tell them
that I need a private cloud so would it
be possible for you host a private cloud
for me so Amazon says yes and they
dedicate a list of resources for me only
for me only from my organization so now
when you talk about Amazon Amazon is
hosting a public cloud but then they
also are capable enough of hosting a
private cloud for my organization so
that makes it a hybrid cloud so this is
what hyper cloud means so these are
three different ways of how I categorize
these cloud models now fear the
questions now the question says I have
some private servers on my premises also
I have distributed some of my workloads
on the public cloud what is the
architecture called when you talk about
this kind of scenario so we talked about
my virtual private network so these are
my choir options basically virtual
private network then we talk about
private cloud let me talk about my
virtual private cloud and then you have
I would cloud ok again so just read the
question carefully and then probably
I'll just jump onto the next slide and
we will talk about the answer and the
explanation so again I would say I have
some private servers on my premises also
have distributed some of my workloads on
up next what is this architecture bar
okay so now it says I would cloud so
when you talk about this this type of
architecture would be on a hybrid cloud
why because we use both public cloud and
the entre my server which is on the
private shrub let's just jump on to the
next question so we have few general SEO
questions now these are is your specific
the questions which we did talk about
previously were just general cloud
questions right so if you are giving an
interview for maybe a zero maybe AWS or
maybe Google so those four questions are
something which you I would say go with
any of these analysis any of you
interview which you would do okay now
these are specific general is your
question so when I say specific
generalize your questions so we talked
about only as your anything okay
so the first question talks about what
is Microsoft Azure and why is it used
okay so as I initially said that as is
my public cloud problem so let's see how
it works
so we have a definition on the next
slide okay so as I discussed above the
companies which provide cloud services
are killed called cloud providers and of
course I did explain you this in the
previous slide I mean the first slide
which we talked about so I explain you
about Google so that is a cloud provider
X maybe about AWS that is a cloud
provider and then I talked about SEO
which is a cloud provider so now a zero
as from Microsoft and the idea behind
this is it's it's more like my public
cloud so you can go to a zoo if you can
log on to is a create a machine and then
start working with that so this is one
of the cloud providers so Microsoft is
one of the cloud provider is one of the
major cloud providers these days right
so this is what my s0 is now talking
about with services the net 0 is used to
manage resources and SEO so we have few
options I have my application insight I
have my erm which is my SEO resource
manager then you have my Israel portal
then you have my log analytics ok so as
far as this is concerned so we talked
about my AR M so this is a service which
is basically
on the newer poker right so now when you
talk about these services which is on
the new portal so it is used to manage
the infrastructure which involves number
of zeros also it's basically my public
so I'm not sure how many people are
aware of words and as your fabric but
then the idea behind this is that when
you talk about my is your fabric is your
fabric now runs on something called VRA
previously in version one of Asia it was
using the service management model so
now this is a new thing right so when
you talk about managing the resources
and is zero should we basically talk
about that resource manager model and
then how services run on it how they
work and how they interact with each
other there are lot of things which you
need to work on and which you need to
learn as well as my hair and but for the
time being you just need to remember
that we talked about - your resource
manager so this is something which runs
everything and takes care of a lot of
different things as far as my user is
concerned so when a rmk more of the
front came a lot of different things
started coming in so tag was one of them
resource groups was another one so if
you have are familiar with resource
group great if you familiar with tag
straight if you not just go to google
and search for it and you'll find your
answers okay then you have few questions
which of the following there are
applications can be deployed with is oh
okay so we can of course put a speed or
Net Applications in easier now you might
have a question where exactly I can use
these applications or where exactly I
can deploy the applications so one so
that you can deploy it either an IAS so
you can deploy it either in paas right
so you can of course deploy a asp.net
you can deploy PHP you can deploy WCF so
the answer is all of the above but then
it's very important for you to
understand that if there is an
application which is on Java so that may
have few problems when you deploy it on
is there right because of course as your
as majorly
designed for Microsoft services okay
when you talk about these Microsoft
services Java is not a Microsoft product
so it's it's more like it's not that
friendly in compare it with other
services which we are running in the
cloud
okay special
to Microsoft cloud of course I would say
okay jumping on to the next one then few
other questions so these are my fill in
the blanks a - role is a virtual machine
instance running Microsoft is web
services that can accept and respond to
HTTP HTTP requests okay so we have four
options in here one is my web one is my
server one is my worker and what is next
like okay now when you talk about this
the answer to Paris web rule is
something which is basically posted on a
virtual machine and it's running on
Microsoft II's web server and that is
capable of accepting HTTP and HTTPS
requests so basically on the web role
what you do is you can upload your
website and your website runs on top of
it and then of course you know that my
website works on HTTP and HTTPS so hence
my web bill is the one which is capable
enough of running that particular the
application or software or web services
okay
the other question what we talk about is
what use of roles in Microsoft SEO so
when we talk about what is the use of
rows we talk about three roles one is my
web role one is my worker role and one
is my BMO
okay so now when you talk about my web
role web role basically is for hosting
and deploying my websites okay the
worker role is the one which basically
helps the web role to execute the
background processes the example I can
give you is my web jobs I'm not sure how
many people are aware of their jobs but
if you only can again search on the
Internet so my web role is residing on
the worker role worker role is the one
which supports my web role and the
worker role is the one which actually
resides on my VM oh okay so this would
be a one which talks to the underlying
layer it's it's more like a framework it
acts as a framework so that means on the
operating system I have my worker role
on top of it I have my web rule so my
web role is the one which will host fine
or services I would not say services but
the applications rather okay so jumping
onto the next one
now the question says is it possible to
create virtual machines using erm in a
virtual network that was created using
classic the
and of course I don't think so it's
possible so let's just see this is not
supported as I said because erm is
something different and previously the
classic poker was using a different
model of deployment so it used my
classic model of deployment which was
basically for service management and if
you see if you are aware of people poor
troops you you will see there is a huge
difference in how classic poker was and
how then the coconuts so there is a huge
difference in terms of tackles so it's
not possible jumping on to the next
question
what on virtual machine skillsets so
scaling up scaling down so if you're not
aware if I have more number of requests
coming in my virtual machines have the
capacity and capability to scale up and
scale down based upon schedule and
performance okay so in other words what
I can say is if my CPU is spiking 200
percent or 100 percent I would cap it to
nine so if my CPU is spiking to 90 and
my requests are still coming in for
accessing that portal the web poker
maybe you can say which is wrong on this
particular machine so my skin sent is
intelligent enough to scale one more
instance and then load balance the
traffic between the two instances which
are now deployed running the same setup
application okay so this is what my
skill set does it automatically Auto
scales I would say rather the workloads
right based upon the performance and the
schedule now how this schedule thing
works so say for example if Stein from
morning nine to evening 9:00 you have
more number of visitors on the website
so I can scale more number of extensions
for your website and after 9:00 p.m. at
night let then minimize the number of
instances right so this is how my screen
set works ok jumping onto the next
question our database support within
skill set so now first of all when you
talk about this yes of course my data
discs are supported and scale said okay
so when you talk about this a skill set
can be defined as attached data disk
configuration that applies to all VM
semi set so there are few types of their
disk examples which are given over there
so one is of course my l0 files which is
my SMB share disk and then you have my
OS x then you have my temp drives then
my SEO data sources like the blogs are
there and tables are there and cubes are
there and then you have my external
layer services such as your more
databases so all of these are supported
all of the discs are supported which you
see over there talking about
availability set so do skill sets work
with is your availability set now first
of all you need to understand what is an
availability set availability set is
basically grouping of servers so that I
can load balance the information among
those servers so that is done for high
availability and there is something
called fall domain and update domain as
far as high durability is concerned
so Paul domain says that if I have two
Lian's in same availability set all the
VMS will share the common power source
and common network okay as far as update
domain is concerned so update domain
talks about that if I have say for
example 10 viens and I would keep the
value of updates going to 2 so I will
have sex of 2 to each right so I'll have
a group of go to each right and at a
given point in time if Microsoft needs
to perform a plan maintenance only one
update domain will go down at a given
point so this is what my update domain
gets so now doesn't support my
availability set the scale set supports
my availability set yes the skin set
supports my availability set and look in
this curve and set some information
about the availability said if you're
not very much well-versed with
availability sets as far as my service
concern ok and there is a small
description also over that so I'll just
read that for you yes a skill set is and
intersect availability set with 5 fault
domains and 5 update domains ok skill
sets of more than hundred games span
multiple placement groups which are
equivalent to multiple availability sets
ok so this is what it means and then I
would just skip the other part because
I've given it enough explanation for
this and I would definitely recommend
that you read availability set ok now
the question is where is a break fix
issue break fix issue is a technical
problem which is like your environment
is running and then all of a sudden a
problem comes right that is a break and
then fixing that particular problem is
my fix right so
no problems are called break6 issues it
is the industry term which refers to
work involved in supporting a technology
when X fails in the normal course of
function which requires intervention by
a support organization to restore the
service ok so this is what breakfast is
now it's not specific to is your action
it's just a common term what we use as
far as my services are concerned so even
if I talk about on print onto the mice
networks so we still talk about brick
fixations right so I'm not sure how many
people have got a chance to call
Microsoft and open a support case in
case you have issues with any of these
things in your environment so those
issues are basically my break fix issues
jumping on to next question why is is
your active directory used okay now when
you talk about is your active directory
active directory is used for identity
and access management first of all and
it's a past based service is your active
directory the past space service and it
was used to grant access to employees to
specific products and services in your
network so there are lot of examples
salesforce.com Twitter right I can give
you few more examples office 365 into
which are two different products from
Microsoft so they work with Azure Active
Directory right now as your ad has some
in build support for applications in the
gallery which can be added directly ok
so there is a gallery and many of them
will just go ahead and add support for
Azure Active Directory to any
application which is available in the
gallery
ok talking about few other questions
regarding is already what happens when
you exhaust the maximum failed attempts
for authenticating yourself why is your
reading okay so we have a more
sophisticated strategy to account local
which is based on IP of the request and
the password enter ok so now when you
talk about on-prem we talk about
account blockers so if you enter
incorrect passwords more than three
times so your account is logged out and
it will be unlocked after maybe 15 when
also half an hour or one hour based upon
all your administrator has configured it
now the same thing happens in s0 ad but
then it happens based upon the IP
address ok so it
we'll go ahead and track the IP address
of the request and the password enter
and the duration of the lockout also
increases based upon the likelihood that
is in the attack so this is how it works
when we talk about maximum failed
attempts for authenticating yourself
okay jumping onto the next question
when can I find a list of applications
that are pre integrator that is your ad
and their capabilities so when you talk
about this my zero ad has around 2600
pre integrated applications and all pre
integrated application support single
sign-on single sign-on lets your
organization credentials to access your
apps some of the application roses for
automated provisioning and
de-provisioning you can just go to the
target and then you can get a list of
applications which are available for
using mine is your e but of course that
is not a complete list of applications
which are available which you can use as
far as this is concerned there are a
huge number of applications which are
supported by 0 ad ok of course single
sign-on is one of the components of is
really so probably in case you're not
aware of single sign-on
you can just go ahead and do some
research on that now talking about the
next question how can I use applications
with is your ad that I'm using on prep
of course you can do that now when
Israel Eddy gives you an easy and secure
way to connect to the web app that you
choose you can access these applications
in a way you can access your SAS based
applications and as your ad so you don't
need to have a VPN installed ok can just
go ahead and install a component and
then you are ready to go you can use the
applications which are there on Prem a
few examples I can give you this you can
use your SharePoint you can use your web
apps for which the servers are installed
on your premises and you would like to
use s 0 ad for authentication so ting do
that for sure now the question important
question very important question what is
where is your perfect service fabric so
when you talk about that - your own
service fabric is a distributed system
platform that makes it easy to package
deploy and manage
scalable and reliable micro services
so this'll be I which actually controls
your network your storage and your
computer okay which are basically the
most critical components of my cloud so
if my fabric will not be running in the
backend so nobody will be assigning IP
addresses nobody will be assigning the
resources and nobody will be assigning
the storage okay so this is the guy
which actually runs everything I would
say in the cloud infrastructure right
okay let's go for the service fabric
also addresses these significant
challenges in developing and managing
cloud applications developers and
administrator's can avoid complex
infrastructure problems and focus on
implementing mission-critical
demanding workloads that are scalable
reliable unmanageable now my service
fabric represents the next generation
middleware platform for building and
managing these enterprise class pr1
cloud-based application ok what is v-net
v-net is basically nothing but my
virtual network so v-net is a
representation of your own network in
the cloud it logically I isolates your
instances launched in the cloud from
rest of the resources which you have the
flow so this is my whole network based
on which my configuration of machines
depend on me the subnets the address
space depends on right talking about few
things what are the differences between
subscription administrator and directory
admin straight so when you talk about
the subscription administrator the
subscription administrator is the one
which is responsible for the complete
subscription now by default only one
subscription administrator role is
assigned in Israel a subscription
administrator can either be a Microsoft
account or either can be your work
account and that guy has control over
the complete as your portal and the
services which run on them ok if you
want you can just go ahead and sign up
more accounts which are basically in
subscription administrator and these
people are micro address now as far as
the Azure ad is concerned so the account
which we set up over there for Identity
and Access Management so we talked about
my is your ad administrator the
directory administrator so let's just
read this as your ad has a different set
of admin roles to manage
directory and identity related features
these admins will have access to various
features and Ezard portrait on the is
your classic focus and the admin rules
determine what they can do like create
or edit users assign administrative
roles to others and so on so this is
what my as your ad administrator does
are there any scale limits for customers
using manage disk manage disk eliminates
the limit associated with storage
accounts now first of all you need to
understand what is a managed disk right
when you create a machine now these
things you will have an option over
there that you want to use manage disk
or unbalanced disk right so when you
select manage this Microsoft managers I
would not say Microsoft by dendias your
fabric manages all your disk right so a
disk which is assigned to VM will be
managed by you okay so this is what my
manage this is now using my manage disk
I basically eliminate the limit
associated with my storage account
however the number of managed disk per
subscription is limited to two thousand
by eighty four okay so you can have two
thousand managed disk in a zero
subscription now talking about what is
the difference between service bus cues
and storage schemes now the azure
storage queue is simple and the
developer experience is quite good it
uses the local as your storage emulator
and debugging is made quite easy the
tool for is your own storage queue
allows you to easily peek at the top 32
messages and if the messages are in XML
or JSON you will be able to visualize
their content directly with the visual
studio furthermore these queues can be
purged of their content which is
especially useful during the development
process the queue efforts basically and
as far as my service buses concerned
so the a zero service bus queues are
evolved and surrounded by many useful
mechanisms that make it enterprise
working they are built into service bus
and are able to forward messages to
other queues and topics and they have
built-in header message queue and
messages that are time to live the rest
control hence messages don't
automatically disappear after seven days
so if you talk about this probably you
will have to go ahead and read about
what is a service pass queue and my
storage queues so I talked about my
storage views which
a part of my storage itself if you're
not aware of storage storage has four
types of storage one is my blog one is
my files one is my keys and what is my
tables like so you need to have more
information of what my storage queues is
okay now talking about what is easier
Redis cache so ready this is an open
source in memory data structure store
used as a database and then you talk
about cache and a message poker so when
you talk about my n0r a discussion that
is based on the popular open source
Redis cache it gives you access to
secure dedicated Redis cache managed by
Microsoft and accessible from any
application within Israel it supports
data structures such as strings hashes
lists sets sorted sets with a big range
of queries bitmaps hyper logs and
indexes with radius planes okay now the
question we talk about is why does not
Microsoft writer stats have an image dn+
library reference like some of the other
as your services now of course when you
talk about this this is an open source
one very important thing now my
Microsoft Redis cache is based on the
popular open source a discussion can be
accessible by a wide range of reddest
lines and that is the reason we cannot
just go ahead and pour it into NST okay
so simple enough just remember that
because each client is different there
is not one centralized class reference
on MSDN so we cannot just restrict it if
you can say right so this is the reason
we do not have any MSDN class library
for mine that is cash what is my Redis
databases so that is database are just a
logical separation of data within some
British instances the cache memory is
shared between all the databases and
actual memory consumption depends on the
key value stored in the database for
example a c6 cache as 53 GB of memory
and you can choose to put also key 3 GB
into one database or you can split it
into multiple set of databases then you
have another question why was my client
disconnected from the cache ok
when you talk about this the following
are some common reasons for cash
disconnect now my client-side causes the
client application was redeployed the
client application performed the scaling
operation in the case of cloud services
or web apps this may be due to auto
scaling the networking layer of the
client site changed then you have
transient errors occurred in the client
or in the network node which is of the
client on the server the bandwidth
threshold limits were reached CPU bound
operations took more long to complete
and then you have my server-side issues
also fear of the server citations also
understand cache offering is your Redis
cache service initiates a failover from
the primary node to the secondary mode
now as you was passing the instances
where the cache was deployed and this
can be the Redis server updates or
journal via maintenance then you have
what is this your search so simple
enough is your search is a cloud search
as a service solution that delegates
server and infrastructure management to
Microsoft leaving you with ready to use
servers that can populate with all your
data and then use to add search to your
web or the mobile application so it
works with REST API or dotnet SDKs of
course if you are the questions my web
app still uses an old docker container
image and I have updated the image on
docker hub which is basically the new
portal what we talked about so we are
basically talking about container
services do you support continuous
integration deployment of custom
containers now first of all for private
registries you can refresh the container
by stopping and starting the web app or
you can change or add a dummy
application setting to a force and
refresh of your container so this is
what it can do now talking about film
things what are the expected values for
startup file sections and I configure
the runtime stack now for Jace nodes you
specify a p.m. to configuration file or
your script file for dotnet code specify
your compiled dll name for Ruby you can
specify the Ruby script that you want to
initialize with your app okay how your
as your marketplace subscription is
priced so we have these
models one is monthly fee so
pay-as-you-go kind of thing usage based
then you have free software so Microsoft
gives you a free subscription so free
subscription is valid for period of one
month and you get approximately $200 in
that so you can use that then you have
the free so this is for the customers
who are not charge marketplace fee for
use of the offerings the Microsoft
offerings and you have byom bring your
own license ok so these are the
subscription models basically how these
are priced you can say so jumping onto
the next one
what is the difference between price
software price total price in the cost
structure for virtual machine offerings
in virtual machines let's just see price
refers to the cost of azure virtual
machine to run the software software for
is refers to the publisher software
running on the Virtual Machine total
price reference to the combined cost of
these two simple enough I don't think so
you need to get more details of this
because it's very simple price of VN
software price total price told price is
equal to price of VM plus software price
now the other question talks about what
are stateful and stateless micro
services for service fabric so service
fabric enables you to build applications
that consists of Microsoft sis so
stateless micro services such as
protocol gateway in web proxy do not
maintain mutual State outside a request
and its response from the service now my
n0 cloud service worker role is an
example of a stateless service and my
stateful micro services such as user
crowns databases devices shopping carts
and queues maintain a mutual
authoritative state beyond the request
and its response so this is how it works
now what is an application partition
okay now when you talk about the
application partition the application
partition are a part of Active Directory
system and having said so they are
directory partitions which are
replicated to domain controllers
so usually domain controllers that are
included in process of directory
partition holder attakathi
directory partition now maybe you can
read some more information my domain
controller has 4
types of partitions one is configuration
one is schema one is my domain partition
and then you have my application
partition so all the information related
to the application goes in the
application partition so it actually
again has nothing to do with the cloud
but then it's always good to know
because if you are designing and
developing an application on the cloud
you can just go ahead and put that
information in the application partition
on the Active Directory server but then
it's very important for you to
understand that we should have an Active
Directory server up and running spying
in the club ok so these were few of the
questions what we talked about as far as
my interview questions are and I would
recommend going of course you can
probably log on to the ad Rekha website
and run through the course they are
currently only one courses running which
is 5:32 and soon to be coming is 533 and
534 so it depends which one we would be
more frustrated right and with this I
thank you all for viewing this and if
you have any questions again I would
mention just just call the number ta da
car number for any of your answers if
you're looking for work thank you all
