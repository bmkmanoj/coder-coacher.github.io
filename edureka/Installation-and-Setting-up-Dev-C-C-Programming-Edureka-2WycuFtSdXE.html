hi in this chapter you're gonna have a
quick walkthrough of the C programming
language they're gonna walk through a
set of programs which will help you
understand how to write a C program you
may not understand everything that
you're being taught in this chapter but
even if you grasp 20% of the concepts it
should be more than enough for you to be
able to do the assignments at the end of
this chapter in this chapter we would
first learn on how to download and setup
the DEF C application this is the
application that we are going to use to
write our programs and finally compile
and execute them ok first thing we need
to talk about the tool that you're going
to use to write our programs and compile
them they're going to use the open
source IDE called
dev C++ from bloodshed for our
development an IDE is called an
integrated development environment and
that is because this application has a
text editor which is used for writing
your programs a compiler or debugger all
integrated in one environment you can
download this application from the link
provided here please make sure you
download the latest version which has
the mingw or the GCC compiler included
in the installation package finally once
you have downloaded the Installer bill
executed and follow the steps for the
installation process let's have a quick
walkthrough of the entire download and
the installation process when you click
on the link this is what you get to see
so if you go to the Downloads area you
will find the dev C++ Phi dot o beta
this is the latest version it does say
with mingw
slash GCC so we will go ahead and
download this once you download is
complete you can click on the package
and just follow the instructions as most
of them are just default values we have
nothing to worry about here you go next
next the installation is pretty
straightforward
once you finish with the installation
the application will launch itself just
pick the default selections you could
pick no for this say next I want to
disable all the tips now this is what
the application looks like you don't
have to worry too much about making any
changes or any more settings we are done
with the installation
let's move on to the next slide ok now
let's talk about the tool itself do you
need to get used to how to use the tool
so that it's very easy for you to start
writing programs and quickly executing
them so let me explain to you about the
various areas of the tool and how to use
the menus ok so if you have a project
open in dev C++ this is what your
application would look like the
rightmost or the largest white area is
your text editor this is where you will
write your programs generally projects
consist of multiple files and not just
one file so when you're working on large
projects all the files that belong to
the project will be shown on the left
hand side so you can easily click to go
to the particular file and start editing
that particular file and finally the
important menus that we would be
interested in right now is the file menu
where we can create a new project or a
new source file in most of our examples
here we're just going to create source
files as they do not have to really
create a project programs are just going
to consist of one file so we don't need
an entire project and once we have the
program ready we will be going to the
execute menu and compiling the program
first the compile step make sure there
are no errors in the programs and
finally creates a dot exe or an
executable
once the executable has been created you
can always call the run command or go to
the particular window and double click
that program to run it also if you don't
want to do these two steps of compile
and run you can directly press the f9
key or the compile and run option to do
both of them together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
