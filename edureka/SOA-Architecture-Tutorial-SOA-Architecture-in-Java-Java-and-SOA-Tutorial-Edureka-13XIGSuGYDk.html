and eswe mainly focusing on this way
sys stands for service-oriented
architecture it is a design pattern or
software architecture which provides
application functionality as a service
to other application eswe a
functionality is not depending on any
vendor product or application one of the
functionality provided by SOA is getting
online bank statement the functionality
can be combined with other features of
the application to provide the
full-fledged application the application
will use service provided by the vendor
or the network without human
intervention the simple meaning of SOA
functionality or functions provided by a
vendor or internet or network for a cost
or no cost eswe in a simple terms that
we will be using somebody will be
developing a component or a service
right and some other company will
connect to the service and make use of
the service in a very simple terms like
once somebody will develop the service
will be using the service for example a
bank will provide a service saying that
you give a credit card information and
the required details or the web without
human intervention through programming
you connect to me and I will tell you it
is the transaction is approved or
declined right so everything happens or
the internet and no human intervention
is required okay that is SOA a
service-oriented architecture right okay
if you look at the slide right so
service provider it's like for example
in a bank transaction right so any bank
will provide services for example credit
card approval debit card approval then
getting a bank statement like you know
from this duration to this duration all
the facilities functions will be
provided as methods
in a bank right they will publish it to
a common broker which is called as in
Web Services it is called udda when we
look into web services in detail we look
at you what is udda how it is to be
published and all then the consumer
right anybody who wants to access my
online bank statement through program
right not not through logging into the
bank and getting it that is also
possible but this is also without human
intervention is ways we move over here
without human intervention this consumer
will connect to the service provider
that is bank through service broker that
is okay then the consumer will directly
talk to the service it will interact
over here that is the bank will make set
of functions or a service okay and
register saying that these are the
facilities I have you provide the Latino
credit card number and all these details
I will tell you whether it is approve or
decline and you provide me the account
number name and when for which duration
you want the bank lines a bank online
statement bank statement and I will
provide you that all the features all
the facilities are provided by the bank
and kept as methods or functions okay
and as a consumer or a client can
connect to the bank account ok bank a
web bank and can use those services okay
this happens through SOA architecture if
you look at in detail right if you look
at like you know this is application one
about all the applications these are all
clients are a web application right this
is the security layer that is it crosses
through the security layer thing is it a
valid user or somebody is trying to hack
or something like that right and then
this is the actual service provided for
example if I can see a bank transaction
right so the credit card debit card then
like you know checkbook
request and monthly statement transfer
of French from one account to another
recorded all the services provided by
the bank one is I can do online another
one is I can do onions with like
manually I can do online otherwise I
need not through program I provide all
the details and say click on ok
supplement and it will do automatically
it will talk to the service layer of the
bank and crosses through the security
and then performs clicking and it uses
internally the database for providing
the information for example if I am
asking for the bank details there is
transaction details like for the last
one month it by providing the account
details definitely
I eat bank has to contact to the
database write its own database to see
the complete transactions then only it
can provide you if you look at the
architecture in detail on SOA right this
is the consumer layer that is the
customer the client it has to get
integrated with the SOA
this is the service provider right it
has mainly four components one is a
business process layer and a service
layer a component layer and operational
systems layer that is in a business
process layer it is it is meant for the
business that is the way the business
has to take care in the sense there is
certain way the business has to go for
example for credit card transaction I
need to provide name credit card details
cvv2 expiry date everything I need to
provide this is required first it has to
let you know check whether credit card
details if you look at the business
process layer service layer and a
component layer that is business layer
is a separate layer has been introduced
to take care of the business the way it
has to go the process the business layer
mainly process has taken care
first you have to get the details okay
then it has to be approved then it has
to check in the database then you can
respond back the process is laid out in
business layer okay turn the service Li
okay one more advantage of the business
layer is tomorrow if there is a niche
why exactly the first layer has been
introduced as tomorrow if there is any
change in the business process right
then it is easily accommodated in
business process layer okay that is only
the reason one mode layer has been
introduced otherwise if it is if it is
very tightly coupled it will be very
difficult okay then
service layer service layer is if it's
the component it's all the services put
together okay it becomes a service layer
it is like all the components in a java
file all the class files in a jar file
it's like a service layer that is I have
ten services even by the bank okay
all the ten services comes under service
layer if you go to the component layer
it is an individual service okay I have
ten services like you know getting a
checkbook getting it online transaction
like you know credit card details debit
card details approvals all these things
these are all the services you don't buy
given by the bank and it comes all these
put together in one service ok banking
it comes under service layer then so
individual transactions write individual
services credit card approval are
declining right so that comes under
component layer individual service is a
component layer the the operational
systems layer is a database okay oh so
if you look at the this architecture
again this the consumer and a consumer
layer is a client it gets integrated
with the business but the business
process layer and this entire process
like in a business process layer service
layer component like an operational
system layer all these are part of the
service provided ok business process
layer is for business right so it can
easily accommodate changes in the
business suddenly they want to introduce
something else
in between two processes right new
security has to be brought in so then it
is very easy in business process layer
the service layer is all the services
provided by that organization comes
under service layer right I may have 10
services I may have hundred services
right component layer is individual
service I may be looking at individual
service right so it comes under that
right and that service individual
service will talk to the database to
respond to the consumer right okay now
if you look at SOA a framework that's
what I have told in the previous
architecture program that is consumer
interface layer this layer is used for
the custom by the customers business
process layer provides the business
process flow also accommodates new
changes in the business easily
hence this layer is provided service
layer this layer comprises of all the
services in the enterprise component
layer this layer has the actual service
to be provided an operational system
layer this layer contains the data
models the data base it connects to the
CRM it connects the backend database to
fetch the data so that the client can
get the information right okay some of
the principles of eswe is it's like
loosely coupled abstraction like
object-oriented programming you have
abstraction that is what what actually
does what actually is done in the code
will be not shown to the client okay so
what the client will give the
information that what needs to be given
and he'll get the response that what is
the output like you know if I give the
credit card details it'll go and perform
you know it will reach the bank and bank
will process internally what has to be
done and it will just respond it is
approved or decline the reusability it's
not like once the code is written right
it can be reused not only by me any
other you know
company can use it right not only my
company hundreds of companies can
connect to the bank and get approval or
declining statements from for the credit
card statelessness the real they sway
architecture will not store the state
unless state of the user unless until it
is required the main purpose of this is
to to reduce the the resources usage
otherwise it will be huge like if I if I
get ten thousand transactions for
approval and decline if I start storing
everybody's details it will be difficult
if it is required it will be stored in
the database else it is not the service
discoverability as I said we will be
discussing this in the class you TDI
udda is for the service in the registry
ok
the services has to be registered and it
has to be accessed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
