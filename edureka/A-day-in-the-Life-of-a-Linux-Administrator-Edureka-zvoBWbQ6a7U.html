to welcome you all for today's webinar
from idea Rica the topic is a day in the
life of Linux administrator first of all
I would like to introduce myself I'm
sudden Kumar I have around 8 years of
experience teaching Linux administration
course and I also have a working
experience in different areas starting
from Linux administration automation
development design architecture etc
alright so I'll be taking up today's
webinar so in case if you have any
questions during the webinar feel free
to post your questions in the question
window I'm going to take a quick pause
every 10 minutes and I will try to
address your questions and again by the
end of the webinar we would also have
another question answer session all
right
so coming to the topic a day in the life
of a Linux administrator so today I'm
going to start start this topic by
providing some information some general
information about a Linux operating
system and I mean the importance of
Linux operating system the role it is
playing in today's technology-driven
world why is it considered so important
and then what are all the different
options that are available in the Linux
world specifically you know but all the
different roles that are being played
and where all the big corporates who are
funding it and some some basic
information in the beginning and
gradually will move into the actual
topic about the day-to-day tasks that
are being handled in just some
background in the beginning and
gradually we'll move on to the rest of
the topic our main topic all right so
feel free to post your questions in the
meanwhile if you have any so by the end
of this webinar so our objective is you
know to help
you gain some exposure about the
importance of the Linux and what are all
the different use cases that we have and
what all the different opportunities you
have and in general so what are all the
different things being a Linux
administrator person does as a part of
his daily job okay
so we will cover apart from the basics
we will also do a little deep dive into
each of the tasks you know some broad
categories which are displayed on the
screen like what all the different types
of installation and operation processes
that are being taken care of
alright and with respect to the
administration part taking it as a core
you would also have other concepts of
user administration list management and
then taking care of LVM storage
migrations configuring different types
of services array providing support like
that you know whenever there are issues
how they are being taken care of what
kind of problem shooting being done what
are the different kinds of issues that
an administrator faces alright so like
that we will slowly get into a list of
topics which are as a part of this
webinar okay so among the different
tasks that I am going to talk about all
right so just remember one important
thing that every administrator is not
responsible for all this range of tasks
all right so there are different
different categories under it alright so
the people are being given they are made
responsible for some portion of the
different types of tasks that I have
listed so far all right so we'll just
quickly go through the different types
of administrators we have and how these
responsibilities are being given to them
alright so first of all why Linux quick
introduction about the Linux operating
system
in
all right so why is Linux gaining so
much of popularity why is why is it
being considered you know the most
preferable one for at least some use
cases all right so the first important
thing as you can see here so it is Linux
is freely available okay so when I say
freely available so the operating system
you can install it without being even a
single penny and you can also pick the
operating system make changes to it add
additional utilities or existing or
additional applications to it or you can
also remove some of the features out of
it all right so like that you can make
any changes as per your requirement as
per the use case that you have so that
is the advantage of Linux operating
system in fact there are thousands of
developers across the world who are
spending their free time in order to
contribute to this operating system all
right so every every developer take we
are contributing back to the open source
society right open source community with
a single aim that this must be the
operating system must be available free
to every person and they should be able
to use it the way they wanted to make
use of it all right and some of the
other use cases as mentioned here I
would like to quickly start with the
second one which is multiple
distribution so if you see there are
around a as of today there are like more
than 600 distributions all right 600
disconnects distributions that are
available so let me just make this word
clear when I say distribution I have
started with Linux operating system now
I'm saying distribution right so if you
have a general understanding of Linux
architecture all right so the central
part is your kernel core or the heart of
the operating system on top of the
kernel
you have the utilities library
these applications and then you have
your desktop manager which is your
graphical part all these are integrated
to your kernel all right so this kernel
even if you go to website code
kernel.org so even there are relations
happening new releases that keep
happening to the kernel also so that is
considered as a separate entity so
always you have that flexibility you can
download that kernel get some utilities
from GNU and add your own applications
and desktop managers that you have
developed and come up with your own
Linux flavor of operating system so that
is what I refer to as a distribution all
right so like that we have more than 600
distributions that are available and
more are coming coming up ok so among
all this let's talk about a few of you
know widely used distributions today ok
so another important thing here that you
should remember is all the 600
distributions they are not intended for
a single purpose ok so basically there
are different flavors available which
are specifically targeted for a group of
audience or a group of users all right
so that is that is the second second
best thing apart from Linux being an
open source product available all right
so when I when I mean they are specific
for a bunch of users what I mean to say
is for example a lot of a lot of users
spread so they have started replacing
the windows instances with Ubuntu which
is one of the distribution available
because Reuben 2 is a very good
operating Linux operating system with a
bunch of features and it is really
targeted for the end users who want to
have it installed on their desktop it is
it is a very good distribution for the
desktop users you can replace and start
you can perform almost all operations
using that and then there are other
flavors similarly one that is are
targeted for
research and upcoming features all right
whatever all the new features that
you're going to see after a year or two
so those are already under testing stage
and it is available in the form of a
distribution cordless fedora okay
and similarly we have some distributions
which are mainly targeted for children
or educational purposes all right and
and some other distributions which you
can even install on old hardware if you
feel that you have a very old system
available which is not compatible with
any of the latest operating systems you
can go with elegant alright so that you
can install and start making use of your
hardware and similarly we have other
distributions targeted for gaming
applications or audio/video production
use cases etc so like that we have
different different flavors available
now out of all this I forgot to mention
another another one which is a threaded
Enterprise Linux alright or the Red Hat
flavor so this red version is mainly
targeted for enterprise customers ok so
they provide a commercial support so the
operating system is free but they only
charge for the commercial for the
support they provide so that's the main
reason why in most of the organizations
you might find Red Hat being used with
desktop as well as server configurations
because of the support they provide all
right so so this is pretty much about
the different flavors that are there and
going on to the next advantage here you
can see it's very easy to learn and use
so when compared to the what is a before
5 or 10 years the things were different
alright to go on and install a Linux
operating system you might have to
download it copy it to multiple CDs
alright and then burn the CDs you need
to have that software and then you need
to make sure that all CDs are working
fine install the software and sometimes
you might end up doing a text-based
installation alright but things are
totally different now
you can have a live USB using which you
can perform the installation you need
not have writing software or anything
even the size of the operating system as
has come down you can you can even have
some distributions which are less than
1gb of size you can have it on your USB
Drive and then you can simply perform
the installation just a bunch of steps
I'm going to show you some one of the
installation process as well it's very
easy and user-friendly also and at the
same time you can try a flavors like one
two which are very user friendly and the
graphical end is pretty much easy for
for anyone to start you know as a
desktop operating system and coming to
the next point why this free I will not
say that a Linux operating system is
completely virus free
but but it is worth mentioning that if
you are using a Linux operating system
then you need not really it's I mean you
just have to worry very little in terms
of viruses or any kind of other such
issues because the way in which the
Linux operating system works the kind of
security that is in place it will not
allow all of these viruses to start
infecting your system soon because you
need to explicitly give a permission in
order to make that thing happen all
right
so generally right what happens is
usually these viruses are spread to take
one example like in the form of emails
so if you just open an email
automatically it starts working right it
gets downloaded and starts working but
any Linux it doesn't work that way
so even if you open an email even if
there is a download that you have done
again you need to explicitly give
permissions for the software but for
anything that you have downloaded so
that it gets executed in the system
alright so there are a lot of other
things security measures in place so
that's one of the reason why Linux is
considered safe and not only I mean
these security measures but still we
also have
some antivirus softwares that are
available in the market like one of the
software is clam maybe which you can
install it as an additional security
measure all right so that's the extent
to which we can secure we can have a
security for our system okay and then
next comes fast and effective there is
always a kind of a debate in between so
I am NOT trying to point find out other
operating systems but I am just talking
about Linux so what I mean to say is
there is always a debate between whether
the Linux is comparatively faster or not
but when there is a debate it is clear
that a lot of people have already tested
a Linux operating system and they felt
that the Linux operating system is
faster so forget about the comparison
part but at least it is clear that the
system is faster okay
so like that these are some of the
advantages of Linux operating system ok
now let's go on so we have I mean the
name of the topic is a day in the life
of a Linux administrator but nowadays
you may find alright that there are lot
of designations that are usually being
given for Linux administrators ok so it
could start from a server admin or a
pure Linux administrator like said when
network administrator or you know some
of the profiles that we have displayed
here it would be a system engineer or a
software engineer
alright so the designation doesn't
matter all right so these are all these
different designations of the people
they will be involved in one or more of
the rules that are being played so we
have displayed those lists of things
here in this particular screen so
starting from installation installing
the operating system and then whenever
you have a new version new version
available you might want to do some uh
predation work all right
typically go through the different types
of installation processes that are there
that olynyk's Edna is responsible for
okay and then the second one the next
one is doing patching all right so
whenever you have a new patch available
you know that every operating system
would be made up of a lot of packages
and lot of libraries lot of things are
involved so the development keeps on
going you will be getting a lot of
patches there will be bugs in your
system all right that needs to be fixed
and we'll have a path in order to fix
that so this is also a continuous
process and then if you have observed a
lot of applications usually right
they'll be launched first with respect
to the Linux operating system so it is
personally I have observed that at least
it could be a new application new
database or some other software so
they'll quickly test the things out on a
Linux system and then they gradually
roll it out for I mean they come up with
the Windows version all right so so like
that we are next Edmund is also being
responsible for supporting the
applications which are posted on it and
then next comes storage migration so
generally if you have taken application
database all right
so whatever that is being hosted on your
the next instance so there will be a
need to continuously upgrade your system
or upgrade the capacity of the system
and you might want to move your storage
from one place to another or one system
to another system or one cluster to
another cluster all right so storage
migration is also part of a Linux admin
job so moving on to the next one user
administration taking care of all user
related activity starting from creating
the users you will have you might have
observed different groups in your
company each group responsible for a
different team or a project like that so
it's basically the Linux administer it
in case if the users are being created
in the next server all right
and then moving on we have installing
and configuring servers or services so
if you have heard about different kinds
of servers starting from web server or
an Apache server all right I am moving
on to a DNS domain name server DHCP
server dynamic host configuration
protocol FTP server and then you have
ntp server network time protocol like
that there we have lot of different
different server configurations in fact
there would be a dedicated team that
maintains each of these server
configurations mostly the application
support guys are dead main guys who are
responsible for application support they
also handle the web servers part which
are being hosted on top of it all right
so like that we also have a different
category where these are being taken
care of installations and configuring
services the next one comes is the
backup and restore which is one of the
most important category I should say
because you always need the backup of
the data right whatever you store data
is nothing but money for every
organization so you always need a backup
and restore plan in place and that will
be taken care of when the next
administrator there could be lot of
backup and restore tools that are
available in the market but at the end
of the day it all starts from the core
Linux operating system itself it's
always the back-up plan in case if it
all fails you have to do these things
manually ok and apart from taking care
of all this different kinds of
operations it is quite common that there
is a possibility of a bug there is a
possibility of a manual issue being
generated in the system or a lot of
other things that could possibly happen
and a system admin should always be
available in order to troubleshoot and
fix the things in an organization all
right so that's where the
troubleshooting comes the way it is in
the last notice it's one of the most
important thing as a part of Linux
Edmonds daily job ok
this is generally a quick list of
different categories that we have
moving discs we will go through will do
a deep dive of each of this categories
alright moving on
alright so we go about to start from
about each of the categories so before
starting that let's do a quick let us
see a quick overview all right at the
beginning of the day for example the
system admin how much to the office ok I
hope you all are aware that nowadays
every every kind of responsibility which
is there it is being tracked so any kind
of issue which which comes up all right
it is being tracked there will be a
dedicated system that is available all
right for example a kind of a ticketing
system all right so even with most of
the other services you might have seen
if you want if you have some problem if
you want to reach other people you need
to raise a ticket all right a system
even for a Linux administrator his day
starts you know looking at the ticket
queue all right the different kinds of
alerts there that get generated you know
with respect to servers that are being
configured or any kind of emergency that
comes up a system has gone down all
right different kinds of issues can come
up in a network so all these are and at
the same time whenever an issue comes we
have we already have some good
automation mechanisms that are available
in place some good scripts in place that
would quickly identify the problem and
sure the mail shoot out a request to the
administrator all right
so an admin job basically starts with
looking at the different kinds of issues
that has come up what are the priorities
it could be a severe one similar to two
or three all right he has to basically
go through the queue and prioritize the
issues and start fixing those issues so
that that basically comes as top one
priority and the beginning of the day
right now once those issues are being
sorted out
he is also should also make sure that
there are no more
issues that could possibly arise from
the system's right so for that he has to
monitor the system and again there comes
a monitoring Porterie we have a lot of
commercial and open source tools
available in the market so you need to
take a look fit before the monitoring
tool keep observing like how the systems
are performing what is the performance
of the system is it going down is it
consistent how is the disk case how is
an application performing all right
there would be lot of alerts in place
which which keep coming which keep
generating the numbers are telling that
tells us how the system is performing ok
so he a system admin that's his next job
to keep an eye on the monitoring system
to see how things are working and his
network right now apart from these two
you must have seen third use case which
is like a lock requests every time you
if you have an issue you quickly try to
call the admin area sting him because
it's a very small thing that that you
want to get fixed you may not want to
raise a ticket for it like that there
will be a bunch of things a addict
requests that Linux admin usually takes
care of right and some some
organizations way so apart from all
those bunch of things they also allocate
a an individual project for the people
it's not just specific to Linux Edwin
but since we are talking about Linux
Edwin I wanted to make that a point say
apart from all this set of tasks he is
also responsible to take care of an
individual project which could be like a
bunch of new servers coming up he's
responsible for doing the installation
end-to-end or it could be in terms of
setting up a separate network in the
organization all right it's an
individual project that is responsible
for and he has to at least spend some
40% of his time for that particular
project I
and throughout all this three or four
scenarios that we have seen one
important thing that we have to remember
is it keeps facing issues every day
because a network is always there is a
there's always a possibility for the
issues to come up all right
and every time you you start working on
an issue you fix an issue there is a
need to create a proper documentation of
what we have done so this way what you
can do is you can create some
information that would be useful for
others and at the same time that
information could be useful in order to
provide a long time fix or a complete
fix for the problem that has come up so
the documentation creating the top
creating and maintaining the
documentation forms another important
task in the day of a Linux administrator
right so and then apart from this we
almost covered four important things and
the last important part is as I've said
not only it is applicable when you are
configuring something it is also
applicable when you are troubleshooting
something so you need to maintain the
documentation when you're computing
services and at the same time when
you're troubleshooting the things so
troubleshooting fixing the problems all
right there are different kinds of
problems that might come up for system
admins like some additional problems
that I wanted to mention are reserve
requests that email is not being
properly delivered all right or there
might be an issue with an application or
a compatibility issue there might be a
need to upgrade the system alright or
there must be there might be a request
stating that the system is not
performing well there is a need to tweak
it click the performance write or some
some additional requests like please
increase the share box size or the
capacity or is that way group we had a
new distribution list all right so that
that that cube keep goes on right so
like that so throughout the day so these
are like
some broad categories like how or what a
system or in the next administrator is
responsible for starting from creating
the users taking care of the systems and
then taking care of the server part
right these are like there are a bunch
of things we'll go through again each of
these categories in subsequent sections
alright now before moving on to the next
section let me just quickly go through
the questions that that we have so far
which the first question is about which
Linux distribution is best
Ubuntu or Red Hat well I would say the
best the best way to answer this
question is you can try installing both
the sources see the applications differ
a lot of people they personal use a lot
of people prefer to use Ubuntu there are
also good communities available who can
help you with your queries and all with
respect to Red Hat the support is when
you need to pay for the support so
that's reason why mostly it is a good
fit for enterprises all right but but
both are having a good set of
applications and under good
distributions that you can make use of
for personal use I would suggest that
you go with Ubuntu whereas if you're
part if this question is related to
using Linux voice in and company I would
say that hat will be a good fit okay the
next question is name of the antivirus
software yes I have mentioned about an
anti-virus software it is called this
clam ABC L a m-v-c L AM a we clamp a V
okay you can search for it you can
download and you can install that in
your system and you can try it's a very
it's not difficult you will get an RPM
you can simply install it and run a few
commands so that it start generating the
matrix for you all right
the next
question is kindly let me know how we
use patching by um or redhead satellite
server so with respect to patching maybe
I can show you a small example all right
let me talk about this so we have with
every flavor all right with every flavor
let's take a sentence okay if you take
centers operating system there are a lot
of repositories available outside
alright so if you have installed a Linux
operating system and if you want to
upgrade a particular package
alright or if you want to install some
new utility which is not available by
default all right so usually what we do
is we try to install these packages from
repositories when I see a repository I
would like to show one example here okay
if you can look into my screen ok so
this is a website sent to s website
all right mirror dot center is dot orc
so from this website you can download
the ISO file you can download the
packages whatever you want you can
download it manually and at the same
time you can configure your system in
such a way that all the new packages
will automatically get downloaded from
this particular website here you can see
all the different versions that are
being listed here ok so send to s7 is
the latest version let's take 6.7 okay
so here you can see there is a folder
called
is voice and then OS so this is about
the packages so depending upon your
architecture you can choose one and then
packages there are a lot of mirrors
available all right out there specific
to the continent or specific to the
country you're living so it's just that
I mean if you have done the installation
automatically these are already con
figured Kiev system in a folder called
et Cie young dot proposed or be so
automatically you just have to run a few
commands in order to get the package
automatically installed in your system
this is applicable for general packages
which are available alright but if you
have come up with a new functionality or
a package of your own then you might
want to set up your own repository and
have that customized IPM package
available in that repository so that all
the users in your network will start
installing that package from your local
repository ok similarly with respect to
patching we have a section I will show
you how to have a very basic example
using which I can show you how patching
is performed alright we will also go
through how to install packages using
gem or rpm command alright so since I'm
using the same voice one I don't think
I'll be able to show the example with
Red Hat satellite so much
alright ok going to the next question
what are the things we need to know
before going for interview so as I have
mentioned before there can be different
different kinds of profiles all right
you need to have you need to go through
the Job Description first that is very
important so that could be related to an
application support or admin for
specific applications or a number of
applications or you might be into code
user administration or you might be into
server configurations all right there
are different different what he said
categories that are available so that's
the main reason why I have spoken about
the different job profiles in the
beginning so you need to have an
understanding in every category again
you can do a deep drive learn a lot and
then appear for them to be ok well there
is a question I don't want any support
for Red Hat and I could I get it for
free without support well till Fred at
5:00 you should be able to get it you
should be able to get the operating
system but I heard that
only for commercial users now that I
mean it has I think it has changed a bit
from where at 7 you can only get it if
you pay for pay for it paper the
operating system as it but you can
always go for the previous versions of
the operating system and and download it
for free we have another question can we
make modifications to kernel yes you can
I mean that is one of the main objective
of the open source one of the main goal
of the open source community here you
are always free to download the latest
version of the kernel from kernel dot R
and you can modify your kernel so
another important what is the job of
linux admins you know before upgrading
their systems or to the next version of
the operating system usually what they
do is they download the latest kernel
all right and it is possible to add that
kernel to the existing operating system
that means imagine imagine the operating
system already as ball with multiple
cores the central core is the kernel you
can remove that kernel and add the new
kernel and then start your operating
system that way they check whether the
applications are compared to being the
new kernel or not whether security so
there are a lot of security measures or
the scripts that are being implemented
so they'll check their compatibility
with the new kernel that is available so
absolutely yes you can make
modifications to the kernel you can
kernel is made up of modules ok so you
can remove the modules as and when
required you can add new modules so
whatever in case if you have created
some device driver for example all right
so you have that software you can load
that driver under the module and check
the compatibility you can do all sorts
of operations ok so next question is
what is the standard way to do patching
in production environment so for this
particular session I'm going to give you
a very small example on how to do
patching but again when it comes to
production it depends on say it's not
just that the Linux favours people will
also be using Solaris or
IBM Axl Rose alright so it varies the
methods that they follow would be a
little different but I would I can only
give you a very basic example to have a
quick understanding of how batching
works okay and final question which
display is best among red hats into is
Ubuntu for lending Linux system
administration well okay let me handle
this question this way all right as far
as I know a lot of organizations they
make use of Red Hat because of the
commercial support all right so so
thinking that way so CentOS is nothing
but red had operating system if you
simply remove all those what do you see
there
brand symbols and all if you simply
remove it it's nothing but you're sent
OS operating system okay so you can
quickly start with send voice I have
showed you some of the links you can
download is low and quickly start you
know learning about system attention
that way it would be also useful in case
if red odd is being used in your
organization yep that's that's pretty
much for desktops I would suggest that
you go you try ooo bun two ones both are
freely available CentOS and Ubuntu and
so ok the next question can we connect
Ubuntu desktop to Red Hat server
absolutely yes I mean you're always you
can have the connectivity there is no
issue as I've mentioned right it's just
that some of the applications that would
be some of the utilities will be a
little different the commands might be
there will be a small difference in the
naming convention but by the end of the
day these are all Linux instances and
you can always connect from one instance
to another so you can have you can I
mean as a part of the installation I
haven't mentioned you can have a VMware
installed and have multiple instances
like Red Hat and double bun too and then
you can try doing
an ssh that means connect for one system
to the another and you can test all the
utilities and features etc ok so let's
with this let's go on to each of the sub
categories that we have ok next one is
installation and upgrade ation so with
respect to installation i I just wanted
to show you a small document but I am
NOT going to go going to talk about this
entire documentation alright so it's
it's a quick reference guide that I
wanted to show you just to give you a
feel I mean for for the newbies required
very new to Linux alright just to show
you like how how easy it is to perform
the installation so I mean you all you
all would have done installation of
Windows Windows operating system Mac or
some flavor of Linux operating system so
by the end of the day the process would
more or less remains the same all right
I mean if you take Linux I would say
it's much easier ok
but the difference that I want to talk
about with respect to installation is
the type of installations ok so it's not
always like you said before a system and
you use a DVD or a CD and perform the
installation ok it's not the only option
that we have with Linux so we have
automated process in order to install
the operating system one hundreds of
servers alright so so that is called as
the kickstart installation all right so
the moment you complete the installation
process a configuration file gets
generated which in turn you can make use
of and perform and you can automate the
process of installation in your network
ok so quickly the process would remain
this game so this is the first screen in
case if you have if you have a CD or a
DVD if you have started this is % 2 is 5
alright so here you can see the
installation upgrade option
switcher common and then there is also
additional option called f2 you press f2
alright this is these are the additional
options you can quickly do a hardware
probe you can test the installation
media see the order disk that you have
you can enter into the rescue mode which
is useful in order to do some
troubleshooting and all ok and then you
can also in overwrite the installer or
update the installer and like that and
final one is memory test so these are
some of the additional options that are
available all right but by the end of
the leap so this option which is there
this is linux ask method usually in
organizations they prefer to keep the
source that is the DVD right that
contains your operating system they keep
it as a part of a network drive or
network folder usually the installation
is done from from the network so this is
the process that is followed Linux asked
method so it will ask you like what kind
of installation you want to do which
means that your operating system source
can be as a part of an NFS or a HTTP or
it can be something else so you can
directly request in order to get the
installation done from the source which
is located in the network ok so there
are two important things apart from the
manual installation process you can
perform network based in situation and
you can also automate the process of
installation alright so the different
different ways of performing
installation so that is important you
need to understand that similarly you
can also go with the upgradation part ok
and as a part of the installation also
remember that there is a progression in
order to add additional scripts at the
time of installation itself whether it
will be related to a security or some
kind of automation that you want to have
in place along with the installation
itself ok so
is the another advantage so these are
some of the instructions okay so that is
pretty much about installing the
operating system okay moving on if you
take a normal Linux system okay let me
show this system this is a scent i7
operating system okay so you can see the
g'way part so you have all the options
available we have all the applications
ok graphics for internet we have lot of
options available so similarly even for
Ubuntu you have we can see a very good
user interface available okay so this is
like a Linux instance I hope you know
that you can run it in graphical mode
and non graphical mode also but I just
wanted to show this that's why I have
started my instance usually for servers
and all they prefer a non graphical mode
because that would be much faster and
yeah even you can save lot of resources
if you do not have the graphics you know
started in your system and that way I
mean in Linux as you know right so it's
a command-line way of executing the
things you can perform more number of
operations using commands itself all
right so that's the reason why high end
servers even Google or Facebook you take
any company they maintain their high-end
servers on Linux systems okay so the
prefer a non graphical way everything is
done without the graphical mode but by
the end of the day the desktop users
they also have the graphics in place the
GUI in place so so we have tools in
order to install the packages in the
graphical way and also we can install
the packages using the command-line way
all right if you look at my screen I
just you can see how I'm alright
so I am a root user okay who is the sole
administrator for Linux system and you
can see here that there is a file called
anaconda I think a store to see if the
moment you complete your installation
that is the file that
generated which is useful in order to
automate your installation process now
here you can see there are two packages
that are available for Red Hat the
extension is rpm Red Hat package manager
if you take a Debian flavor of operating
system it's thought BEB all right as I
mentioned there are little differences
it's just that the command will be a
little different but the process would
remain the same okay so if I want to
install this so rpm is the command red
add package manager so these are some of
the odd Givens I wanted to mention is
for installing the software and we is to
display the word pose all right so if
you see here so it is installed that's
it we are done
so this is using the RPM command so
there is also another command called as
M why um I will show that you know why
so now that if you observe these two
packages right so one is teletype in
0.17 - 48 this is 17 - 59 ok these are
two different versions now what I'm
gonna do is so I am just trying to list
the package goes to installation and
then I am going to do an upgrade Asian
capital u in order to upgrade it so once
I have upgraded you can see the latest
version now that is currently installed
which is 0.17 - pi 9 so this is pretty
much about how you upgrade the packages
in your system so this is something
which I have done manually you can
consider this as an example for
third-party application alright a new
version of the application is available
so you download the package and then you
copy that and then you try to manually
upgrade the package or similarly we can
do this RPM - e so this is so once you
get some and some experience on on the
command straight so making so you can
you definitely enjoy working on a Linux
system that's it so the package has been
removed so just within a few seconds
i've installed upgraded and remove the
package from the system ok so this is
about installation using RPM ha
that is another utility called as iam
why um the difference between these two
is always with respect to packages there
is a possibility that there are some
other packages which are dependent on
this package
alright so dependencies must be resolved
so for this there are no dependencies
who have just tried taking this example
with respect to M for example let me see
whether Firefox package is installed or
not so as I have mentioned there are lot
of repositories available I need not
have to download the package so this one
I downloaded it just for an example so
now you can see my Firefox package 24.5
dot 0 - 1 ok now I want to upgrade this
package upgrade Firefox for iam you need
not have to provide the name of the
version and all you just say upgrade
Firefox it will check for the latest
version of the Firefox and if it is
higher than the existing version it will
also check for the dependencies and then
it will install everything in your
system so that is the best thing about
VM command ok so you can see here right
you can see it is looking for some
fastest mirror here so these are the
mirrors that I've mentioned so it will
look based on your location for the
nearest mirror and it will try to fetch
the package from that mirror and it will
also check the dependency and try to
fetch those packages see you can see
here it says that this particular
package will be updated and you can also
see processing dependencies you I asked
for Firefox and these are some of the
packages which seem to be related to it
so it is allowed to download all these
packages and it is asking me for
confirmation if I say yes it will
download all these packages and it will
install in your system similarly with a
single command which is yum space update
all you can completely upgrade your
system with all the latest packages just
one command alright so that is that is
how the packages are installed in case
if you have configured local repository
then Jung will go and fix the packages
from your
local repository okay so that that's
very interesting right so it's a very
easy process and you can also make sure
that you know before installing you can
quickly check whether you can whether
you want to install the dependencies or
not or whether you want to install the
packages are not even install an
installation process is very simple
coming to the next part I have just
included a very simple example of how
patches are created in the system okay
so this particular example if you see so
we have two C programs okay one is hello
dot C and the one is hello new dot C so
basically these are two different
versions one is the latest one having
new changes okay so what we are doing
here is we are trying to create a patch
right so patch file basically it
contains the difference between these
two programs so what was there before
what is going to happen post the patch
operation okay so you can see the output
here and between these two files and you
are passing this as an argument to the
patch itself is a command so we
basically pass the patch file to the
patch command which does the patching
part automatically host this operation
your existing file will get updated with
all the changes that you have requested
okay so along with this particular
operation we also have a provision that
means there are different types of other
features that are available additional
options that are available during
patching that means you can try taking a
backup of the file or doing the patching
rather than completely overwriting it
all right or you can just try to
validate the operation and like that we
have a lot of additional options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
