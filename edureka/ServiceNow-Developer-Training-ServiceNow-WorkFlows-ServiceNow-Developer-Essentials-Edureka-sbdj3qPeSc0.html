calm and I welcome you all to this
introductory series of ServiceNow
sessions today we are going to take a
look at ServiceNow from the developers
perspective and when I say that I mean
we would be understanding something
called as workflows in ServiceNow but
before we get into the details of
ServiceNow workflows let us quickly take
a look at today's agenda first well I'd
be starting things off with what is
ServiceNow and why it is so popular as
an ITSM tool then I would talk about
what our workflows and how to create
those using a workflow editor then I
would discuss workflow activities and
what are different types of workflow
activities then I would give you a demo
on the scripting part and how the
workflows work so this pretty much sums
up today's agenda so let us move further
and get into the nitty gritties of
ServiceNow so what is ServiceNow well
ServiceNow is a software platform that
supports IT Service Management and it
automates common business processes now
what does this mean well when you say
ITSM our IT Service Management it is an
umbrella of various activities there are
quite a few domains and those domains
cover different activities to name a few
we have change management service
management um we have process management
you also have incident management all
these activities they are very prone or
not prone or very central to the
company's working or a business's
working basically and all these
activities can be taken care by using IT
service management tools and one of the
most popular tools is service now why
because it lets you automate these
processes and hence it is so effective
now if you want to know more about
ServiceNow and these activities which I
just mentioned I would highly recommend
that you go through the other videos
that are there in this series because
those talk about ticketing tools and the
admin responsibilities which ServiceNow
has and that way you would be able to
relate more to this video not that you
cannot right now but that would actually
add in more value having said that let
us move back and continue with our
discussion it contains a number of
modular applications that can vary by
instance and user yes service now lets
you create applications of your own
those can be customized to meet your
particular needs
now who founded ServiceNow well it was
founded in 2004 by mr. Fred Lodi who is
the previous CTO of popular companies
like Peregrine systems and remedy
corporations so which companies do use
ServiceNow well they're quite a few
companies in the market that have
already incorporated ServiceNow to name
a few we have facebook we have twitter
we have um Dell we have Barclays and so
many others so what our workflow is
basically well workflows are nothing but
there are series of processes let me
give you an example say for example I
have to create particular records or I
have to go ahead and create employee
records in my company what happens here
is I would be having particular fields
that are common say for example I'll be
having name IDs and all those things
which would be repeating again and again
there would be some features or some
attributes say for example you are say
your own it might vary so what happens
is the fields that are common and which
are entered those can be actually
repeated or implemented automatically by
implementing automation so this is what
ServiceNow lets you do using workflows
you can automate a sequence of processes
and implement those quickly and better
now this workflow is sequential and it
has a start step and an end step
basically and the activities that get
implemented in series in it are
something that hold the workflow
together say for example when an
activity or a workflow starts it starts
with a begin condition then it goes
ahead and checks in for a particular
condition whether that condition has
been met or not and if that condition
hasn't been met it decides the further
flow of your workflow and accordingly it
finally terminates so when does a work
flow normally terminate it terminates
when it runs out of activities to
implement now we would be going ahead
and taking a look at how a workflow
basically works so you would be
understanding this
a little more once we start doing that
so let us go ahead and first take a look
at the editor with a service now has to
offer
basically an editor is nothing but an
interface that lets you implement or
create these workflows important point
which you need to remember is as well as
ServiceNow is concerned now there are
quite a few access laws that have been
implemented by ServiceNow say for
example there are few operations which
can be performed by particular users
only say for example an admin he
performs activities like elevating roles
or maybe impersonating a user now as far
as impersonation is concerned that is
something only an admin can do so when
it comes to workflows not all can create
a workflow it has to be the system admin
who creates the workflow or the workflow
admin basically so he's the person who
goes out and creates the workflow and
once it is published then it is
available for others to view or see but
once a workflow is published it cannot
be edited so once I get into the editor
I would be talking about this part as
well that is once we've created a
workflow I would talk about the
publishing part and the checkout part
but yeah this is more or less about the
editor as in it is used to create
workflows basically and it can be
created by using only an admin once it
has published it is available to other
users to use it and the last step I
believe you've already discussed that in
the previous slide so this is how a
ServiceNow workflow looks like or the
editor basically and what you see on the
canvas is your typical workflow what
I'll do is I'll just go ahead and switch
to the editor first and then I will talk
about all these points that way I feel
more connected with you people so there
you go this is how a ServiceNow instance
looks like now we have already talked
about this in the other videos but for
people who are completely new to
ServiceNow let me tell you that in order
to access or to work on the ServiceNow
interface you have to make sure that you
have an account on the ServiceNow
website and you have to go ahead and
request an instance so how does it work
is you have to go to the website on the
right hand side you have something
called as or developers portal and you
have to go
then login to that developers portal
first and then you have this page is
something that would appear or this tab
at least you have to come here click on
manage and request your instance and a
developer's instance would be granted to
you all they would ask you is they would
ask you for the version which you want
to select
now when I say version now you can see
the build here is Jakarta which is the
version of my service now and the quite
a few words and switch service now has
it's funny how they name it basically or
it's interesting not funny
what ServiceNow does is they named their
instances alphabetically starting from a
if the first instance is with a the
second would be with B so accordingly
they have instances till J and as as
Jakarta the latest one now these names
those are named behind some cities or in
reference to some cities so Jakarta is
also a name of a place basically and if
I am NOT wrong we also have the latest
version which is called as Kingston
which is again named after a place so
that is how ServiceNow names its
vergence are built so I would be going
ahead and using the Jakarta build
because I have been using it for a long
time and it is also the second most
recent so we shouldn't be having any
problem using Jakarta you are free to
choose the version you want to choose
this is the URL once you click on this
URL you would be taken to the page where
or the interface basically where you can
work on service now apart from that it
says the remaining in activities 10 days
now if I don't use my ServiceNow
instance for 10 straight days my
instance would be released and given
access to somebody else because there
are a lot of people who request for this
instance but don't worry if you just go
to the manage option and you request an
instance having an instance to use
having said that now let us move to the
interface yes so basically this is how
the ServiceNow interface looks like you
have your banners you have your filter
navigator you have your workplace and I
am logged in as a system admin basically
there is also a chat box that lets me
chat with other people but that
discussion is for some other time we are
not having a discussion on that for now
having said that we have this filter
navigator and I would be using this
filter navigator to go ahead and a
continue with our activities so let us
go out and just look for workflow so I
type here workflow and the workflow
editor comes in suggestions so I go
ahead and select the workflow editor
yeah so this is how your workflow editor
looks like these are your canvas tabs
only one is visible right now the other
tabs would be visible dynamically when
you open a workflow each time say
something like this right yeah and this
welcome tab it basically gives you the
names of by default workflows and also
these no documentation which is
available for your reference you have
something called as a new workflow tab
by which when you click on it you can go
ahead and create a new workflow there is
a plus sign here which does the same for
you and we have something called as
published checked out and help so what
are these as I've already mentioned
unless and until I publish a workflow it
cannot be accessed by other people say
for example users who cannot create a
workflow but they want to viewer they'll
have to wait for a workflow to be
published else it won't be visible for
them and once it is published the other
thing that happens is you cannot make
changes to a published workflow in order
to make changes to a workflow it has to
be in the check out State and to do that
what you have to do is you have to go to
the workflow and there would be a
particular tab which is available say
here now you don't see publisher but
once we create our own workflow you'll
be having that option there you can
publish a workflow and at the same time
you can also check it out but not
everybody has this access to checking
out a workflow there are access
specifiers as I've already mentioned so
people who have access to it can go
ahead and can check it out and then make
changes to a particular workflow having
said that this was about the tabs that
are there now you have the help option
where you can go ahead and search for
documents which would help you with the
ServiceNow concepts or some problems
which you're facing then you have your
workflow palette tabs now this is your
workflows which
you see details about the workflows like
this tab does and there's a code tab
which gives you the core activities now
these activities will only be visible to
you when you create a workflow or open a
workflow so we would be going ahead and
doing that so bear with me till then
these are called as palettes basically
are in simple words and these are just
lists of workflows so this was about the
workflow editor as in the tabs and all
that it has this thing on the other hand
is called as the title and this part is
a canvas where you go ahead and create
your workflows you go you canvas open
so let us now go ahead and create an
activity first what I'll be doing is
I'll be creating an activity or a
workflow not an activity sorry a
workflow what this workflow would do is
if we assign a particular group to a
particular record it would make sure
that this record is assigned to a
particular person now what is this
record what table are we going to use
and all those things I would be talking
about that once I give you the demo or
once I finish creating the workflow so
let us go ahead and first create the
workflow let me call it say Auto
acknowledge
I would be using a spelling with GG and
the reason I am doing this as what
ServiceNow does is when you have
instances which already have similar
values at times it goes into a redundant
state and does not make my workflow a
run so and I'm stuck without knowing
what has gone wrong and why my workflow
isn't working so to avoid that I
normally try to use names that I haven't
used already I might have used this name
somewhere so I'm just using this name to
avoid the ambiguity also make sure that
each time you log into your ServiceNow
or if you are already logged into your
service now make sure that you go ahead
and refresh your ServiceNow instance Y
again it does not get into redundancy
now I would be going ahead and using a
table here for records sake and that
table is called as incident table now
why am i using an incident table well
once we move further you would
understand that now I've been using this
term that you'd understand that let me
just finish this part I'm very sure that
all that I've taught till damn it would
be more relatable to you people so your
incident table description it auto
assigns a user to record and this is
something that is called as the
condition builder now when I say a
condition builder this is what we have
here now there's something called as
none that is if the none condition
matches or if there is no condition that
matches go ahead and do the following
task that is mentioned here now what
I've selected here is run the workflow
always that is no matter what happens
make sure that you always run the
workflow so I would be going ahead and
assigning a particular group here what
incident table does is it gives you
predefined records and there are lot of
records and tables that I created so you
have access to those so you don't have
to go ahead and create fields that is
one reason why I selected the incident
table here so when I say assign two I
would be selecting a group actually an
assignment group which is say cab
approval and I say submit
now as you can see my workflow has been
created it is a simple workflow which
begins with a begin step and an end step
now this is not a complete workflow
yes I've assigned a so-called group to
it but what activity do I need to
perform to do that I will have to go
ahead and set a value so how do we do
that we pick up the set values activity
and it is available in the core now as
you can see the core palette has these
activities available back when we saw it
there was nothing visible here why
because no workflow is open back then
now that a workflow is open yes all
these activities are here so I would be
needing the set values activity
basically now ServiceNow gives you a
drag-and-drop facility so you do not
have to worry about getting into tedious
tasks you just pick it and drop it and
there you go let us say I call it
acknowledge - just to avoid ambiguities
again and I set in particular values to
it this time I would be assigning it to
a user and the user would be saying what
are the options do I have
can I have someone with some name say
yep so I would be selecting a name
called as Ron catering you can go ahead
and select other names as well but for
now I have used this for reference and
let us add a work note it is always wise
to add note because that kind of gives
reference to other people
there you go and I say submit yeah now
we are lucky that this workflow has run
smoothly at times what happens is as
I've told you it goes into a redundant
state and even after doing everything
correctly it does not work properly
now this workflow is created by me and
it has been checked out by me so I can
make changes to it I can click on these
icons and edit the code if I want to I
can close it by clicking here so yes I
have these options and there you go you
have other options as well you can go
ahead and publish it you can delete it
you can enter inputs and all those
things this is the table which kind of
gives you the properties
yeah so as you can see we have the
general properties now these general
properties kind of go ahead and taking
the input values as in what is the name
of the table checked out state checked
out by whom and all those things
conditions now we have talked about the
condition builder as in you have to
specify your conditions that have to be
implemented this is what this tab does
basically then you have the input taps
as in what it does is it kind of lets
you define optional workflow level input
parameters now that is a discussion for
some other time let's skip that for now
we have something called as activities
where you can go ahead and pin in free
activities or define new activities and
given details about those activities you
have something called as your
applications where it talks about the
scope of your applications where it is
accessible and all those things
scheduled this deals with the timer
activities we would be talking about
time activities in the future slide
estimated run time and all the details
about your work flow so this is what it
does so yep thus pretty much is about
the properties so this is your work flow
let us go ahead and then just test this
workflow whether it's working or not so
I come here and in my filter navigator
what I do is I go ahead and I type
something called as incident and I have
this option here create new I click on
it
let us go ahead and select the name
Seiya Brom Lincoln maybe who is the
color okay and I have some software
issues I say the issuance a mill and
I say please look into it
I would be adding an assignment group
saying say cob approval now it is not
assigned to anyone as yet but when I
just submitted yeah
now as I submitted you can see that this
Abram linkle query cob approval it has
been assigned to Ron Keating so we did
not have to assign it to him it got
assigned by default let us go ahead and
create one more activity say this time
it is I will tutor and he has some
hardware shoes CPU problems
a Zen group against a cab approval and I
say submit so please fix my device by a
bail tutor it has been assigned to Ron
Keating so what is happening here is
when I say an incident table what
incident table does is it kind of acts
as a table which records all the
incidents and what are incidents say for
example my system isn't working or I
have some problem which needs to be
communicated to a particular team in my
company so what I do is I just go ahead
and type in an incident and this
incident it gets kind of allocated to
the respective team so the workflow
which we just created it kind of helped
us control this allocation or assignment
basically so what I did was if there was
some issue related to your so called cab
approval group now the queries which I
put in for cab a floral group weren't
relevant because a software person or a
software issue person won't contact the
assigned group called as the kebap rule
but just for the reference I imagine
that if a person who has some issues
with the cab approval or cab duties an
if he puts in an incident and he selects
the corporal group now that activity
would by default be assigned to a
particular person and say for example
the cab authorities they have someone
named Ron catering who takes care of all
those duties so by default these
activities would be assigned to him so
this is what your workflow is doing here
what it is doing is it begins when it
does it makes sure that if a new
incident comes which is assigned to a
particular group it can be assigned to
some other group so yep that pretty much
sums up the process of how workflows
work I hope you all have understood what
workflows are if that is the case then
we can just move further and try to
understand the next topic of discussion
which is activities in ServiceNow so
yeah now let us go ahead and try to
understand what our activities in
ServiceNow or workflow activity is
basically now these activities they are
nothing but they hold instructions
processed by a workflow you can take a
means you can imagine this as more of
containers which kind of hold few
instructions and what do these
instructions do now they let you
manipulate records and also perform
scripts so why do we basically need
scripts
servicenow now ServiceNow is more of a
click and point kind of an interface but
there are a few accents which need to be
triggered externally and to do that we
use scripts so now these activities they
can be added removed or rearranged you
would be seeing this example don't worry
once I create the workflow I would give
you a demonstration that is once we are
done with it and workflow conditions
determine whether the activity is
performed or not this is something that
we've already seen so these are the
types of activities that are there we
have something called as approval and
rollback
now these activities let you basically
approve a user or a group for a
particular assignment now we have seen
that already in the previous example and
listen until but this can vary a little
say for example I want a particular
workflow to only work when it has been
approved by a particular group or a user
and I can assign those kind of
activities to my workflow this can be
done by using a parole and rollback
activities now few of these activities
they basically have some limitations as
in they're implemented on a particular
table only now as far as a parole and
rollback activities are concerned they
can work only for those tables that
extend the task table now if you take a
look at this task table you can imagine
it as something of a parent table when
it comes to Java or any object-oriented
programming language now we have
something called as inheritance where a
particular table is inherited from a
particular parent table now in this case
your task table would be appear in table
and only the child tables of your task
table can implement the approval and
rollback activities then we have
something called as the condition
activities this again can be related to
your oops or object-oriented concept say
for example we have these basically
control structures say for example if
else while for look and all those things
similar functionality can be implemented
in ServiceNow by using your conditional
activities say for example it has
something called as and if activity now
we would be going ahead and taking a
look at one of these activities once we
start the demo part so bear
meanwhile we have something called as
notification activities now these
activities notify your users with
messages and emails so that they can be
given notifications as in this has
happened or that has happened
notify activities are similar to your
notification activities but you can
actually go ahead and make calls as well
and you have to make sure that it always
corresponds to a table called as notify
underscore call basically so that is the
only difference between these two
activities we have other activities like
the sub flow activities and tasks
activities
now some flow activities basically are
those activities that are created by
some other workflow now say for example
a workflow is creating another workflow
or an activity and what it does is it
waits till the implementation of that
particular workflow activity gets
completed and then it goes back to its
initial functioning so this is what
software activities are they can be
accommodated in a particular flow you
have tasks activities these activities
help you in creation of tasks and
activities related to it basically then
we have something called as a time
activity time activity basically help
you control the time or the duration
between one or more activities you can
add in more gaps or delays between two
activities say for example I want a
particular activity to execute only
after a delay of two minutes after
activity B has been implemented so this
is something that can be done using your
time activities and then you have
something called as utility activities
now these are the activities that
provide you with control over the path
of the workflow and also they provide
you with some other useful tools which
can be used to edit your so-called
activities better so this was more or
less about the theory part about the
activities let me tell you one thing
that these activities have subtypes and
each of these have quite a few subtypes
but we won't be taking a look at all
those activities what I would do is I
would just introduce you to a couple of
activities or scripts which actually
implement these activities and those
activity scripts
basically our most widely-used or more
commonly used activities is what I
should say so we have something called
as types of activity scripting and those
types are we have if now if is a
conditional activity which I have
already mentioned and what it does is it
lets you select a particular flow for
your workflow say for example if
condition is met
take this flow else take the other flow
then you have something called as wait
for condition as in wait for this
condition to occur and then proceed with
your workflow you also have something
called as create task which helps you
creating tasks while you're implementing
your workflow you have something called
as a run script if we would be
implementing a run script it basically
helps you to initialize a particular
workflow or a particular activity
approval group unless and until you have
an approval of this group you cannot
proceed probably same is with the user
and we have something called as the
timer activity now as far as a timer
activity is concerned what it does is it
again goes back to the thing which we
discussed as in it helps you schedule
your so-called activities or add in the
values in the interim or the time delays
in the interim so this was about the
types of activity scripting let us move
further and take a look at a demo that
would talk about these activities in
detail are at least one or two of these
activities in detail so I would be
quickly switching to my return now and
then we can continue with the demo part
now what I've done is I've just gone
ahead and just opened my so-called
editor let this just go ahead and create
a workflow now so what I'll be doing is
I would be referring one of the I would
be taking reference from one of the
sessions taken by mr. Bell in the
ServiceNow community
and I would be using his reference to go
ahead and create an if activity that
actually helps you kind of distinguish
or I would say create paths for your so
called workflow based on the color
inputs which I given once I start coding
you'll understand this part so I will
walk you through with the coding part
and also the the flow of the so called
application or the workflow so let us go
ahead and do that so let us start by
giving it some name say demo
or if condition maybe yep
and I would be going ahead and selecting
a global table now why do I do that is
when you go ahead and select a global
table what it does is it lets you create
a workflow and see its output in the
same interface or the canvas so that is
why I would be going out and using the
global table sample I won't be putting
in too much values you and I would be
seeing none here why because I would be
going ahead and scrapping so since I'm
using a script externally I do not need
to set in a particular condition and I
say submit and there you go a basic
workflow is created now I would be
needing to have little more space
because we would be having more than one
activities today so yep now let us go
ahead and use something called as a run
script yeah so I would be using a
variable to initialize my so called
workflow let this be say in it and in
order to initialize that I would be
using this piece of code which says
workflow dot scratch pad dot trigger and
I would be passing in a value say red
because this is the by default color
input for which I want my so-called
system to react or my workflow to react
and that pretty much does it you do not
have to type anything more now one more
thing you need to understand is you need
to have some basic prerequisites or some
basic understanding of scripting or Java
scripting in particular because all the
scripts and ServiceNow they work in
JavaScript and I say submit and there
you go Myron activity has been
successfully added now I'm going to go
ahead and add an if condition which
comes under the conditions work crew or
the condition activities here it is I
just pick it up and I drag and drop it
here and there you go so let us call it
say say demo reference I'm trying to use
different names again to avoid ambiguity
if there are similar activities that are
running behind and now I click on this
thing called as advanced what it does is
it
Smith Script so this is how the basic F
script looks like to a particular
variable you pass in your script and you
encapsulate your script in a function so
let us go ahead and create a script of
own so I say workflow dot scratchpad dot
result this is the variable which I
would be using dot and the name of the
script which or the function which I
would be using so it is if script there
you go now I would go ahead and create a
function to encapsulate these values say
yep there you go and first I would be
going either in declaring a variable
which I have just used already or I have
already used it
so it's result equal to in curly braces
I say I pass in my values so you read is
equal to false comma are the colors
would be blue which is equal to say
false again we have green again equal to
false and I have say an unconditioned
which deals with the values that haven't
been used yet so they come now I would
be assigning a global scope to all these
values and how do I do that
I say global again I'm using a package
called as jsut till which is a utility
package in Jas gsutil and if it's not
nil
just go ahead and use my so-called work
robot scratchpad
there you go
yep now we go ahead and enter
so-called if conditions so the first if
condition says if workflow dot
scratchpad dot trigger and index office
kind of a method basically now what
ServiceNow does is it invokes something
called as a glide form which lets you do
servers basically standard scripting so
what it does is it lets you in work
quite a few methods and those methods
perform a lot of tasks for you
index off is one of those methods what
it does is it returns the index value
for you now in this case if the index
value is red then go ahead and display a
value for me and what that value should
be it should be display the value for
the red trigger so it should be result
dot red is equal to true do you have it
now I go ahead and I enter the scripts
for the remaining part
again I pass in the result this time it
has to be blue
you can actually go ahead and copy this
code and reacts acute it again and again
but I avoid doing that normally I like
typing the code
this time it has green
again drizzle dot
there you have it now we need to go
ahead and put in a condition that would
kind of work when all of these
conditions aren't working so that would
be our nun condition there you go
which is equal to say these values which
is not equal to result at read
result out blue and
result dot green so in this case return
result
they have it and my script is done this
is submit there you go so I have a
workflow already so if I just go ahead
and run it as I've told you it gives me
output here and here that is why I've
used the global table
oh it says there's some error let me
just quickly take a look at what the
error is
get here and open this piece of Court
there has to be some mirrors on there
mistake here let me have data turn let
me see whether it works perfectly not if
not again we'll debug it okay there is
some problem in the flow but let us just
go ahead and do other activities I can
just go ahead and do this now this is
basically yes but I want a different
value say red and I want this piece of
code to look little different one this
has to be skipped during generate always
never kind of forget to take this
because as your code would go into a
loop and it won't give you the desired
output so say workflow dot scratchpad
rego dot result dot red equal to equal
to true I'm going to copy this piece of
code control a control C and update my
set accordingly so this now becomes red
similarly I'll go ahead and make this
known as blue as in when the value is no
go through the so called blue flow
control V and it is already ticked blue
update now I need more activities how do
I add more activities for my other
colors I right-click on this place and
if I wait for two seconds this is what I
get ad condition I say green I come here
I take this part I add this and I say
Green and then I go ahead and I say none
take this again control V and here I say
none
but they want all these activities to
correspond severe
so there you go this color is glowing
now why because that is the by default
value which I've said to it so can I
just go ahead and make other colors glow
yes if I say that my run script should
have some other value say for example
should go through the blue channel I
updated and then I say run
there you go my blue channel is showing
an input so based on the input
conditions you can actually go ahead and
make changes to the script that you have
say for example I can have multiple
conditions here I can go ahead I can
give a space and I can add read
condition here or I can just go ahead
and say copy paste and change these
values and change their values as well
so I can do that as well so what it
would do is depending upon the condition
which you pass to this so-called
workflow it would take in a particular
path now when my script runs water does
it trigger a particular variable and if
that variable is corresponding to any
one of these values which matches with
the initial condition then that flow
would be taken by a so called workflow
so this was more or less about the if
condition and how the if condition works
now if you come here there quite a few
other predefined workflows which are
available to you say for example you
have something or less now these are
random so I'm just going to go ahead and
click you have your run script you have
your if script here your run workflow
you have approve action which comes
under rule means rollback activities and
the approval activities you have your
approval action again and the end
condition now there's a script here
basically which you have
but I cannot edit it can you tell me why
because these have been published so if
I have to use it allowed to check it out
first
and yeah then I'm good to go ahead and
use these activities now can I make a
change here I can let's not do that
yep so you have these activities and if
you just go ahead and take a look at the
other workflows you will actually be
able to see how these scripting works
for all these activities and how to
actually go ahead and script for these
activities there would be sample scripts
available and all those for your
references so I believe that you all
would be good enough to go ahead and
take a look at those scripts as well one
by one as far as this session goes I
believe we've talked about what
workflows are and how to create simple
workflows and how to add script to a
workflow as well however one important
point which I would like to state here
is you have to always make sure one
thing use script only whenever it is
required yes we have condition builders
and you can build conditions normally as
well you do not have to script always
whenever a script is required you can go
ahead and can use script as well so I
would suggest that you go ahead and kind
of practice these things we also have
other videos on service not developer
and I suggest that you go through those
videos as well those talked about client
scripts and all those things where you
learn to make basic applications and all
those things so probably those videos
would also help you to be in a better
State so if you did like this video make
sure you like the video and leave a
comment if you have any questions or you
just feel like appreciating the video so
this probably is the end of this session
from my end I would be around and I
would be creating another videos as well
and if you do get to see those do let me
know in the comment section how you felt
those videos were so this ends this
session yeah I would be taking gonna do
or I would be saying bye here bye bye
thank you
I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
and you can comment any of your doubts
and queries and we will reply to them at
the earliest do look out for more videos
