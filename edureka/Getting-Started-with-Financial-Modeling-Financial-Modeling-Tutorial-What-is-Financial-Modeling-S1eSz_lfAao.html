I'm uncle Kapoor and I'll be with you
for 45 minutes I worked with the variety
of companies like American Express
McKinsey and company valuations team
onsen young finance and strategy team
has spent time in India and in the u.s.
split between you know it was split
across geographies and I've pretty much
worked with you know most of 40-plus
nationalities in my career for the last
three years so this was around you know
ten years combined with all these three
firms and after that for the last three
years I've been running my own portfolio
management company where I manage
people's money I manage family money I
manage individual ultra hni money and my
main focus is primarily on traditional
assets equity and bonds futures and
options fixed income is bond only and
portfolio management regarding my
qualification I have my bachelor's and
master's from Dell University CFA from
CFA Institute us and certified financial
planning from financial planning
Standards Board of India so for the last
five years or so I have trained 500 plus
participants and I have traveled
extensively even outside India to train
these candidates so my candidates have
varied from the background was as less
as you know without any experience
garage
it's when I say graduates as in
bachelors under graduation and in global
terminology and you know I've my last
trip to Middle East was training private
equity players private equity analysts
of a sovereign fund and I've also
trained you know lot of CFOs and CEOs on
this matter depending upon you know
whatever situation flavor
they had different requirements but yes
the course was around valuations around
financial modeling so this is about me
so let me just talk about you know what
you will learn today so we learn about
why financial modeling is important why
you should be doing that and what is the
objective of this course what are the
benefits whether this course is suitable
for you and also will discuss one small
case on beta calculation well this
course is primarily focused on you know
on one side you will be learning Excel
modeling and on the other side you will
deepen your understanding on valuation
aspects we will also cover was in an
acquisition in this and it will be an
online live training program for which
later on you will also get access to the
recordings at times people are not able
to attend all the sessions for them they
will have the recordings and you will
have assignments as well so in case you
have any questions anything there is you
know I will have all the discussions in
the class and otherwise you know you
will have access to the recordings by
chance in case you miss out on any class
so by attending this course what you
will do you know you will be able to
keep in your understanding on valuations
to begin with you will get some detailed
understanding of Excel modelling then
you will deepen your understanding on
valuation concept
as well as accounting to a certain
extent you will understand not to do
with the corporate finance or financial
analysis how financial analysis is done
when I say accounting I was basically
referring to the financial analysis
financial analysis you can do when you
have some basic understanding of
accounting so that will be right
like refocusing on financial theory how
the valuations work and you know some of
the common practices mistakes and you
know the the main agenda here would be
on practical understanding of how to
value a company how you know to
construct a model right so these kind of
skills you know what what I have
observed is usually you get to learn all
this on the job after few years however
when we have seen you know when you go
for any employment or change your job
this is something which is expected out
of you so in your college in your you
know finance courses you don't land up
doing this so even CFA charterholders
don't land up by default doing this
because they have some basic knowledge
but practically how to do it is
something you know for which you need
guidance or on the job so frankly
speaking when I joined McKenzie when I
was trained on valuations I was trained
on modeling there was you know they have
their boot camps for two three weeks and
these trainings are given so that people
when they start dealing with clients or
on the job they have some basic
understanding off from where to start so
they are not completely blank or you
know experimenting on on the job right
so there was no room of experimenting so
that is the main thing when you're
basically being interviewed or you're
planning to shift maybe this is an
internal discussion or in
you whatever that is people expect you
to have some basic understanding of how
things are done and then you can not
just show that basic understanding but
lot more in terms of you know
practically how it is done so this
becomes very handy and your chances
actually improve a lot so who should
attend this course
well commerce graduates and BA students
financial controllers as I said you know
CFO's CEOs you know at times they are in
funding round you know some private
equity player is investing in the
company so if they need to know how
valuations are done you know how
financial modeling is done well you may
be a CFO but if if you just know
accounting that's not good enough right
you need to know how funds are raised
and how to value the company so lot of
chartered accountants attend this course
risk managers attend treasury managers
attend and I've seen lot of PE analyst
if and managers would also land up
attending this course and it will be
very relevant for them to understand how
things really work well so far any
question you guys have please please
feel free to just pour in as many
questions as you have so
for an IT person or a software developer
well firstly you know your understanding
should be very clear in terms of why you
want to do this so what is the purpose
of doing this course so if you are
changing jobs or if you are internally
being transferred into financial
analysis kind of role then definitely it
will be of immense help there so I am
getting this question that you know for
a software developer whether this will
be useful or not
well if software developer is moving
into financial analytics team or you
know Finance domain then definitely it
will be very useful or maybe have has
aspirations of getting into that then
also it will be very useful any question
you guys have any more questions yes for
that you know anyone who has done MBA
usually them here these practical you
know ways of doing valuations M&amp;amp;A is not
taught so yes we will be focusing a lot
on that yeah so I don't see that as a
problem there so it is a very good fit
in fact it is a very good fit for people
who do not have any basic knowledge so
this is a good question
you know what are the prerequisites for
this course
well the prerequisites are basically you
should have basic understanding of Excel
when I say basic understanding as in I
will not teach that you know this is an
Excel icon you need to click this to
open these are cells and everything I
want you to be at least at a basic level
when it comes to Excel although we will
be covering you know some basic
functions of Excel
as well but the purpose is you know
moving beyond that so I do it lot faster
and regarding you know accounting and
finance
well financial analysis is much beyond
accounting so we will be you know I'll
be giving lot of tools in terms of those
who are not on same page for example
someone from the IT background may not
be at par with someone who is from a
finance background so I will be giving
lot of tools lot of material to read and
if you are with the pace of the class
you will get exactly even if you don't
have basic understanding of accounting
because I strongly feel that you know
you need you may be a good accountant
but you may not be a good financial
analyst and to become a good financial
analyst you need to have some basic
understanding of accounting but that
accounting is not typically what people
actually think people think accounting
as you know book entry to be very honest
I don't know book entry but I know that
you know if there is an operating lease
mention in in books of accounts what
needs to be done with that that is more
important and trust me know chartered
accountant would also know that so I am
asked what is the market demand for this
kind of course well it's very very
important and it's very critical from a
job requirement point of view so this is
one skill which will differentiate you
from others so you may be a CFA
charterholders spiring to be in equity
analysis but if you don't know exactly
how it has done then probably you're not
a good candidate you're not a good fit
so what this does is basically gives you
a hands-on you know hands-on experience
in terms of how to value a company
obviously we'll be discussing
cases real examples of companies and
real valuations however you know
different companies will have a
different risk profile everything is
different you know the analysis is
different but the key underlying thing
or the aspects would be common so you
know that is a very practical
orientation which is required and you
know as I said no academic platform can
provide you that so that is why it's
more like a very focused kind of
approach which is used in this program
you know oriented towards you know
getting into the right job or improving
into whatever you are doing right now
you know at times people are into equity
analysis people are into lot of research
but they just want to improvise have a
lot of students who have done this
program and you know who have gained
immense understanding of exactly how it
is done
well financial math modeling and SAS
would be little different reason being
SAS has more on the tab and data
analytics kind of profile and financial
modeling does not really require that of
that level of data analytics what it
really requires is you should be
comfortable with Excel in terms of you
know applying or creating a model and
that creation of model requires a lot of
conceptual understanding lot of
practical understanding in terms of how
to make all the linkages happen so SAS
may not be you know linked with
financial modeling as such and I'm not
even sure why you would want to do that
well to be very honest interviewers do
ask you to create models and they do ask
you to do valuations at times they may
give you a scenario to do the analysis
or well usually that will be the case
50% of the case and 50% of the time
we'll grow you to that level that they
exactly know that you have a good hold
on the subject and you can actually make
lot of sense so I kind of don't agree
that you know all the modeling jobs are
through network because to be very
honest it's not a portfolio manager job
you know a portfolio manager or a fund
manager you become after lot of years of
experience we are actually talking about
analyst kind of roles and for analyst
kind of role these are expected you know
the skill is expected out of you and
yeah absolutely so that is what I am
actually referring to out of our eight
modules only one module is devoted on
exit modeling rs7 mode you know modules
are actually focused on concept building
so my focus is basically once I am
through with the Excel modelling we just
apply that knowledge on other things
because unless and until you are very
good with the concept you'll never be
able to create a good model so excel on
its own is of no use unless and until
it's attached with the knowledge so
sector and company well we understand
exactly you know how to understand an
industry how to understand a company
what exactly to look into a company into
a company in terms of forming your views
in terms of forecasting as well as how
to do the historical analysis all those
kind of things are done in a detail form
keep pouring
the questions and I'll just
well whatever questions come in your
mind just keep pouring I will just have
a look at it as soon as they come so
what we'll be covering here is you know
we cover all the Excel basic to advanced
features will understand how financial
analysis is done on the financial
statements will understand how cost of
capital is calculated what kind of
valuation models exist we do DCF
modeling we'll also do private company
valuation and we'll end the course on
mergers and acquisition
so this mergers and acquisition is also
a man a motley I think we should be
writing here any more
Rowen I can
must have you know gotten some
perspective yes what you have mentioned
is absolutely right it will be very
detailed in terms of looking into the
financials of a company coming up with
the historical analysis forecasting all
the levers applying those key drivers to
calculate intrinsic value of a company
so all this future cash flow everything
is part of this valuation so it will be
covered from it's basically you know all
these four elements basically well I'm
sure better you know in the US or
anywhere they focus on certifications I
kind of don't agree with that because
it's not an MBA application where they
say okay you have interest in finance
OERs what you have done it's like you
know people will be checking you on your
knowledge so this course will help you
back up your claims in terms of you know
practically you know how it is done and
trust me whatever you study here in the
course if you practice it you know there
is no way anyone should question your
you know understanding these this topic
well Robin can you just elaborate what
do you mean by cost of ownership are you
referring to cost of capital futures in
options are not part of this so futures
and options are usually part of trading
courses not financial modeling
yes enterprise value you know how to
calculate will be part of DCF modeling
you calculate enterprise value you
deduct death and that equivalent you get
to the equity and then the intrinsic
value and then on then you do relative
valuations also it's not mentioned here
but it's part of the course which is you
know price ratios as well as evie ratios
you know how to calculate and what kind
of comparisons to do okay so all these
are covered here well Rwanda you know we
do not have that much time you know what
kind of levers and moreover you need to
study a company just by solar sector or
wind sector what are the levels well you
actually have to read a lot of material
before you actually say that these are
the levers or drivers it may not be that
straightforward
you need to arrive at at those key
ratios and what are what is the impact
on the valuation of a company so it's
not that straightforward so as an
example let me just tell you you know
when we calculate cost of capital
especially cost of equity we use capital
asset pricing model and even if you
don't understand gapless and pricing
model it's fine we'll cover that in much
more detail what it requires is a beta
component so basically a capital asset
pricing model basically says a required
cost of equity is the risk-free rate in
an economy plus beta multiplied by
equity risk premium right
also in that there is a component called
beta although you calculate each and
every aspect of it but let me just
quickly calculate you know how beta is
calculated so theoretically you would be
aware that you know there is something
called beta which you know even in if
you have passed out some exams on
Finance that beta is usually a given
number you never expected to calculate
that because in any exam they know that
you will not have tools to calculate it
so that is why you know you are given
you know whether it's a 1 meter or 1.5
beta you just apply and get the number
so here we need to study if you are
valuing a company and if you are
arriving at cost of equity of that
company how do you exactly do that
so firstly what is beta
well beta is basically a measure of how
your company stock moves visibly
the market ok so it is basically
comparing the moment of your stock price
with the market moment so more is the
movement of your stock price that
basically means the volatility is more
the risk is more in a way right and if
the movement of stock is less we are
basically saying the volatility is rest
less risk is less why it is important
because it is part of cost of equity
calculation through capital asset
pricing model how it is calculated what
we have learned is you know beta is
calculated by regressing a company's
stock against an index ok so far is
something anyone in the finance field
would be aware that this is beta and
even if you're not aware you know by
reading this sheet you would be aware
that ok beta is basically a comparison
of Company stock movement with market
movement to assess what is D which is
more volatile so that one number you
will get after regressing these two so
how do we exactly
that yes expect so Rohan just answering
your question beta is basically a risk
measure so it it is just a component of
arriving at what should be the required
rate of return so cost of equity is the
required rate of return so beta is just
one component of it which basically
assessing systemic risk of a company so
in a very simple way it is just
assessing what is the volatility which
is more volatile and if this just
assessing systemic risk it is not
telling you whether its expected return
or not so it will be just one measure so
if it exactly matches with the market
beta will be one that is you know the
moment is exactly matches with the
market it is one if it is less than the
market it will be less than one if you
know the stock price is more volatile it
will be more than one as simple as that
so if it matches the market it will be
one and usually you will find beta to
vary from 0.5 to 1.5 most of the
companies would be in that component so
how do we arrive at this well what you
need to do is basically you need to
regress at least 60 data points that is
60 monthly data points against relevant
stock index so let's say if it is a US
company you will regress it against US
stock market index let's say S&amp;amp;P 500 and
once you regress that you know you will
apply one formula which I'll tell you in
a bit
you will exactly get what the Vita is
that is basically known as regressed
beta okay so don't confuse this
regressed beta with something called
asset beta and the course we discussed
lot more into detail out wherever
you know has said beta from regressed
beta but this you know this demo is
basically restricted towards just
arriving at the refreshed beta so let's
say I want to arrive at beta of a
company called Apple everyone is aware
of that so let's do this thing
so Apple know beta of a company doesn't
change on a daily basis well
theoretically it does but practically
doesn't so we are basically arriving at
you know firstly we need to get down to
what of the historical prices because
it's comparison of stock returns we need
to arrive at stock prices so similarly
we
S&amp;amp;P 500 okay right so here we have let's
say 2010 - and we want it monthly so we
get the price again here we want to get
hysterical numbers we go on historical
tab again we say 2010 let's say from
this symbol first and we want monthly
data points so here if you scroll down
so Yahoo Finance's one option there is
Google Finance these are publicly
available data so you need not actually
pay for this so the entire course will
be a you know focusing on lot of places
from where you get free data and what
level of detail also you can expect
although these are all these can be paid
forms as well for example Bloomberg and
Reuters you get lot of detailed data in
fact you can get beta directly from
Bloomberg in case you have ever seen
Bloomberg but those are paid platforms
so the focus will be at what level in
that at a free level how much
information you can get from various
places tracking error volatility is a
concept of portfolio management not
financial modeling so once you download
this sheet you will get something like
this so in this you need to just delete
this yet only the closing number
adjusted closed and this is basically
Apple
similarly you will download this
information for SMB 500 S&amp;amp;P 500 so we
need to start from lowest to highest all
right let's get rid of these gray lines
so lay out the clients we call this beta
I would say regressed beta this is
basically you know the price of Apple
and S&amp;amp;P if you regress these you will
not get the number we need to
standardize it first so let me just call
this you know prices price price so this
is basically return so we start from
here some calculating monthly return
that is what you need to regress you
need to regress 60 data points on
monthly return okay
how many are these all right perfect
so we have 60 data points all right
let's do some basic formatting here so
in the course I explain step by step all
these formatting in the excel class so
we need to calculate beta which is
request beta which is slope all right so
we get here beta for Apple
we should also write here Apple Apple
request beta so what this really
indicates is what is the regress beat of
Apple which is less than 1 volatility of
apples return is little less than the
market return that is S&amp;amp;P 500 this is
not something which is used as part of
cost of equity calculation something
called acid beta is used which is you
know couple of steps on this we we take
to reach acid beta which I'll not be
covering here but you know even if you
have read something about beta this is
exactly how a regressed beta is
calculated so whether you have done it
in any finance course corporate finance
course you must have come across beta
calculate beta is a terminology they
never talk about the calculation this is
exactly how a beta is calculated or
so this was just to give you a
perspective in terms of you know how
practically you know a bita calculation
is done well a very very small part of
the entire scheme of things but just a
flavor in case you have any question
just ask me well this may not be exactly
matching the bloomberg beta but it will
be kind of close to Bloomberg beta so
what we need to do is basically you know
compare this beta along with Bloomberg
beta and bara beta you know in case you
have access to all these different tools
however in case you do not have this
tool you know these paid tools then this
is sufficient well in the course I also
discussed couple of other platforms from
where you can extract the information
directly you don't have to even go
through various steps of forming pure
sets and then coming down to what should
be the regressed beta and all those kind
of steps so we can skip that and we can
directly get acid beta there are
platforms from where you can get that
yes bara beta be a double re so all the
ah calculations would be different so
depending upon what methodology these
are using which is mentioned so
Bloomberg beta is something which is
very close bara beta they have their
proprietary thing so bara is basically
SNP so Standard &amp;amp; Poor's has issues bara
beta 4 come so you may not find all
these information on burger bar and
company is not but usually Bloomberg
would cover it Bloomberg has mostly all
the companies all over the globe but
there may be you know companies so even
for them you can calculate that because
you have so there is a way of even doing
that so guys in case you have any
questions you can ask me please well the
course is starting this December 19th
which is coming Saturday and the timings
would be from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. it
will have 8 modules and you will be
spending 16 hours with me plus they'll
be lot of assignments
guys any questions please ask me okay
well someone is asking me about myself
well I have over 12 years of experience
into financial space I work with
American Express McKinsey &amp;amp; Company and
Ernst &amp;amp; Young in India and the u.s.
primarily we start off you know I
learned about valuations I learned about
you know modeling in McKinsey in Amex I
was part of the portfolio management
team which later on became Ameriprise
Financial in the u.s. in McKinsey I was
part of you know my partner was Timothy
cooler Tim Kohler
who has written one of the most famous
books in valuation McKinsey and company
valuation book it is a recommended
valuation book in Howard Business School
he was my partner so whatever I have
learnt is basically you know from demco
directly and yeah that's about me and
currently I run a portfolio management
company and I do this pain in my yeah so
this is the way I value companies
well the goal is basically simple you
know lot of people have you know spoken
about beta whether you're aware of beta
or not but you know beta is one small
element which is used in the calculation
of cost of equity so whosoever in
finance or otherwise you know this term
is used as beta you know for PETA for a
company in Thales or it's a highly
Takamine or a low beta company so the
purpose was basically to understand how
to practically calculate beta or a
company right so this method no book
will actually talk about because this is
a very practical way of doing things and
that is you know what most of the books
will actually not talk about unless and
until you know you're reading a very
detailed books a McKinsey book or
Hamadan book we talked about this but
they also talked about that you need to
calculate in this way they will not tell
you those resources so what we will be
covering in the course is exactly a hold
of the resources from where this you
know calculation can be done but this is
just as I said very small aspect of
entire scheme of things DCF modeling
when we talk about so specie of modeling
will include a lot more let me just show
you one quick example
this is one company we discuss so this
is a DCF valuation so basically you know
we start with historical analysis then
we just the financials the forecast
drivers we do duties here so these are
all the drivers then we do calculate you
know what is the valuation we calculate
what is the cost of capital we do all
the return analysis so there are a lot
of steps involved this is basically you
know in in back there is something
called beta here so this is this part of
the calculation in the entire sheet if I
may just put it in a simple way this is
also asset beta what we calculated was
the request Peter so even this requires
lot of refinement but even if I have to
just use it as a proxy then probably you
know this is a small number which we
will calculate well I have no clue what
he shared but this is a proprietary
Mackenzie in company model so I doubt
whether he assured that and moreover the
madryn philosophy is not focused on this
kind of valuation aspect I don't agree
with lot of his philosophy in fact most
of the academicians in the world don't
agree with country this premium in oil
which he is recommended well I am a big
fan he is he's one person I respect and
I meet him quite often also but there
are few things I don't agree and this
model is not this model in fact this
model I created on my own when I was in
McKinsey
so this more
I think is a paid model by Wiley you can
buy this model at a price of $200 or
something okay so it's one hundred and
sixty-five dollars well this is not
exactly the same model but yes kind of
very similar but I've made a few changes
so this is the book I was talking about
and Tim Koehler was back on all right
guys
in case you have any question please ask
me or else you can actually log off in
case you do not have any question I have
completed you know today's webinar can
you just elaborate your question a
little more skills and valuation well
this course will be a basic foundation
in terms of how to value a company you
know what I have learned from my
experience is you have to read a lot so
this course is not a replacement of
reading you know the more you read
better it is also although I might have
spoken that you know you know the motrin
I am NOT a big fan but does does not
mean that you should not be reading his
book you should definitely read his book
so there is no replacement of reading
more books on valuations in case you
want to just you know improve or sharpen
skills but this course gives you that
platform to think and in terms of the
direction you know which you need to
really take it for example let me just
give you an example here after many
years of lot of reading you know from
Warren Buffett books to Benjamin Graham
books and all I figured out that you
know in today's time probably security
analysis by Benjamin Graham is is a
relevant book I'll not say it's not a
relevant book but you know you need to
be current in today's time and that is
like from a value investing point of
view it's relevant but there is lot more
you need to add on to it so something
like valuations book by Tim Koehler or
CFA books in particular how to do
valuation the investment series these
are all helpful books to add to the to
your skills but it requires a lot of
reading I mean I need to just see this
well you need to
no I
actually say these are financial
modeling books I am basically actually
referring to lot of you know books which
are which can actually shape your
thinking in terms of what should be your
you know build a sense in terms of so
few days back only I just wrote this
article so definitely a book by you know
Benjamin Graham the intelligent investor
was written in 1949 but is still
relevant security analysis by Wayne
Graham again an amazing book essays of
Warren Buffett awesome book you know
evaluations by McKinsey and company in
my personal favorite this does not have
the motrin because there are few things
which are quite which conflict with you
know with the right way of doing it like
country is premium so so for mergers and
acquisition you know the underlying for
even in M&amp;amp;A would be the same scope of
work it's just that from a many point of
view it stretches more on the you know
EPS side as well so we'll do the Bahji
modeling as well which is part of M&amp;amp;A
but the foundation will be same you know
you need to know how the analysis is
done from a valuation standpoint and
then you just move forward in terms of
whether a particular t what kind of
capital structure will impact and so on
and so forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
