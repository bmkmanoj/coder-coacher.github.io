management framework this clearly gives
you a graphical X idea of what we said
on the top we have the strategic
objective of the organization of which
you create the portfolio of projects and
programs and the portfolio will have
project and programs each program again
will have a related set of projects
now let us understand concepts so
program sub project and portfolio so
what is a portfolio we start up it vote
for you what is a portfolio what does
the word portfolio bring to your mind
let's let's take an example of ourselves
the finance part of it when we say
portfolio I think one of the common
answers that I get its portfolio of
investment now why do we invest we
invest maybe for securing our future
that is our after retirement or we
invest so that we can have a big
vacation going somewhere in Europe or
some other country we invest because we
want to buy something big like land or
house or something so there is some kind
of an objective which we want to meet
and for that what we do is we in this
and when we invest we invest in we keep
something in cash we keep something in
maybe fixed deposits something in mutual
funds shares and gets all those kind of
investments we make and from town from
time to time you also change those
investments we moved from one pick one
particular mutual fund towards something
else we move we sell some shares and buy
some new shares we keep doing this why
are we doing this to ensure we
constantly monitor our progress and see
that whether it is achieving our
objective
for a company also it is the same thing
a company also has a limited set of only
that limited said like for us as an
individual our earning is our monthly
income my either of my personal income
or my family income whatever for company
also whatever their sales and turnover
and rock profit after tax that is their
income that is the income which needs to
be spanked that needs to be spent on two
things that needs to be spent on new
projects on one part and that needs to
be spent on the ongoing running of the
organization that is operations so if
you give
much to operation you have nests for new
projects if you have too much to new
projects you don't have operations
portfolio management is that where you
will try to balance between the two and
hence that is a particular process by
which number one you identify the new
initiations or ideas that comes for
projects justify them and finally decide
which are the ones which will go into
the project
so you know how much of budget it gets
allocated to these projects and
obviously that will go to the next stage
now as I say for example IT manager
wants to change all the windows to
Windows 8 because Windows 8 is the
latest does that justify your project
maybe not but Microsoft has declared
that by a by the end of this year they
will stop support of Windows XP
if the organization has a lot of XP
machines in with them then definitely
this is one mandatory requirement of
operations or mandatory requirement for
IT manager to decide on a project of
changing all the particular experience
to something new maybe whether it will
be 8 or 7 that's a different issue that
can be part of an activity in a product
so there can be various such reasons
because of which operations needs to
continue or new projects needs to come
and you have to balance both portfolio
management what also does is once it is
the project is life and is executed for
each project we are all used to a term
called business case we create a nice
presentation where people talks and
presents the business case saying that
this is what we will benefit out of by
getting this project some wood
to check whether those benefits are
getting realized that benefit
realization can be tracked only once the
project is completed and is handed over
to operations so operations will then
start feeding for each of the project
whether it is meeting the business
objectives there for which it has been
done and there is a third part that is
today there are certain business
objectives of the organization based on
which certain projects are going on so
certain products can be in execution
certain products can be in the pipeline
between and certain new projects which
are new idea which has come in there
needs to be a constant evaluation of
these projects in execution and pipeline
to see if they are still relevant to the
business objective of the organization
maybe the organization had a plan of
opening up a new office or branch in a
particular country but in the next six
months because of the current political
and economic situation of the countries
the basic objective of the organization
has changed does it still
necessary or does it still make sense to
still carry on with the project of
opening up the branch and do all the
things that is required under the
various heads of projects for that
opening up in that country No
so those projects if they have started
will be put on hold or even killed
years of
manager should not feel bad about it
that my project is skinny knob
my project is put on hold it is
basically for that purpose like to to
link to your business objectives the
other part is to look at the risk and
resource constraints there may be a
particular project which requires to be
completed because of the business
objectives which needs a particular
critical resource but the resource at
this point of time is planned for
another project it is through portfolio
management you will move that resource
justify and move that resource into the
new project put the current project on
hold till that part is complete and
bring back the resource now those are
different kind of activities which it
happens in portfolio management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
