now let's look at another concept that
makes use of arrays in C which is called
strings we already covered the basic
data types in C and we never saw a data
type called string so if I want to
represent a set of characters or a word
or a sentence there is no basic data
type and C but the most basic data type
that we have is cat we can represent one
particular character and we know that a
word or a sentence is nothing but a
array of characters with multiple
characters put together so phoner
represent a single string I can do that
using an array of characters so a string
in C is represented as an array of
characters ending with the null
character which is a backslash 0 the
reason we need to end a string with a
backslash 0 is because like I said
earlier the C program does not know
where your array ends so if you have a
character a 2 and we have five letters
stored in it it does not know they're
only five letters stored in it so if it
starts printing the entire string he
does not know where to stop so the best
way to do that is to have some kind of a
terminating character to say this is the
end of my array or this is the end of my
string so if you have a backslash zero
in the end we know that's where the
string ends we shall explain that better
with an example also now because we have
a backslash 0 the space occupied by a
string is always one more than the
number of characters so like in the
example here I have a cat STR equal to
hello world the string takes up actually
11 pipes because it has only 11
characters but in memory it's gonna take
up 12 bytes because the last character
is going to be the terminating null
character let's try a few programs just
to see what we're talking about is right
or wrong the hash include stdio.h you
know say int main
so we're gonna have a character array or
a string cat STR you can always define
and add it like this - without a value
inside in such a case what happens is
you have to initialize it to some
particular value so if I say hello it
knows that there are five characters
plus the terminating null character at
six so automatically the C compiler will
make the size of STRs 6 so he's going to
allocate six contiguous bytes in memory
and store the word hello and the
backslash 0 so I do not need to really
specify 6 because it depends on the
string here so first let's see in a
memory diagram as to what happens when I
define STR like this so if I have a -
STR
equal to hello in memory each character
takes up 1 byte and it requires 6 bytes
she's going to allocate 6 objects each
of 1 by 2 total 6 bytes call this STR so
now the first one which is STR of 0 will
I have a CH then you laugh e then you'll
have L then you'll have the other L then
you'll have the O and then finally
you'll have the backslash 0 which is the
terminating character so you'll have
these 6 bytes for these 6 characters
this is what it looks like in memory so
because it's an array just like the
integer array if I one access the third
letter I can easily access it by saying
STR off - that's simple so nothing's
changed
it's an airing
let's write the entire thing hello world
it's supposed to be one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven so
totally twelve now if I want to print a
string I can do it using printf I don't
have to write a for loop to plain every
character separately so to print a
string you can say printf you have
something called the percentage s and
then I can give them add a name or the
string name so as you can see here the
printf does not take the size of the
string like in the previous example to
the function largest we had to pass a
number to know how many elements are
there in the array but if you look at
printf the function printf just takes
percentage s which means the variable we
are passing is a string so if he has to
print the entire string he has to know
where the string ends and this is done
by the terminating null character this
is why in C we have a terminating null
character to know the end of the string
so you can say printf percentage s now
along with this I also want to know how
many characters are there in the string
and what is the size is taking up in
memory so to pin the number of
characters we have a library function
called string length or STR Len so I can
say printf length % h t /n and the other
thing i want to know is the size it
takes up so I'm going to say size % HD n
and we forgot the double quotes here
finally the function is STR le n which
will give us a length of the string STR
and to get the size of the string we say
size of STR size of will give us the
size of that particular variable finally
system pause return 0 let's save this
compile and run no errors or warnings
there you go it printed hello world into
the length is 11 but the size is 12
that's because it included final
backslash 0 so you can finish string by
using a simple printf and you don't need
a for loop you are the percentage s to
print strings but of course if you want
to access a particular character you can
easily do that by saying STR of the
particular index number I can say STR in
brackets I can say to it lacks is the
third letter you can show you that too I
can say percentage see when I say STR
off
- he's gonna print only the third letter
not the entire string take or throw a
little L deep into that so we have now
seen how to declare multiple objects of
the same type and we've also seen how to
declare and use strings in c</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
