Eureka and today's video is on what is
Tablo this is going to be a really good
video to get started with Tablo so let's
get started with this session so this is
what we're going to cover in today's
session we will start by understanding
what is Tablo just a brief definition of
it and what are the Tablo trends and the
different products in the tableau
software suite and moving on we'll
understand the need of data
visualization with Tablo and how Tablo
visualizations look like so what is
Tablo well Tablo is known to be a
groundbreaking data visualization
software created by tableau software so
at Tablo you can easily visualize your
data now your data mostly lies in form
of spreadsheets and rows and columns
with numbers and text so it is hard to
just identify problems and come up with
solutions just by viewing numbers and
text on a spreadsheet and that is why
you need to visualize that data in order
to understand how your business is going
what are the problems and how can it be
solved and also identify the
interdependencies as well what Tablo
does is that at the back end it writes
optimized sequel queries in order to
fetch your data from the database and
then present it to you in a visual form
which is very attractive and also very
insightful so in order to summarize it's
a data visualization software that makes
our work very very easy and plus it is
also very easy to use for example let me
connect to the superstore data in table
so there are measures and dimensions in
tableau which are nothing but different
fields that you can use to create your
visualizations measures are usually
numeric entities or numbers and
dimensions are text so let us see in our
superstore which is the customer segment
that makes the huge or most purchases so
just drag and drop the segment's to the
columns and we want sales in rows and
you can see here directly that the
consumers are individual buyers are the
ones who purchase most of the product
as compared to corporate or home office
customers now let us see what are the
products that they purchase and there
you go it has listed out different
products they buy so these are the items
that are purchased on the superstore
with the bar chart indicating their
number of sales well you can also sort
it according to your own convenience and
this is how you do it now if we just
hover on a bar you can see the details
as well now let's just find out which
are the most profitable items just drag
and drop the profit to colors and the
color legend over here indicates the
darker the orange the more is the loss
and darker the blue the more is the
profit and here we have phones with the
darkest blue and if you see in this case
tables which is one of the highest
selling products is under loss now these
are the things that you can understand
by visualizing and tableau is a very
good tool for that moving on tableau is
also a leader among all the BI tools now
this is tableaus fifth year to be on the
leaders chart or in the leaders quadrant
in the gardeners Magic Quadrant not this
among the leaders and it has beaten
other BI tools like Microsoft click
Salesforce etc now let us take a look at
the tableau product family now the main
development tool in this tableau
software suite is the tableau desktop so
the tableau desktop you can connect to
numerous amount of data sources you can
connect to your data in your local
system you can connect to cloud
databases you can connect to cloud
applications you can even connect a big
data with tableau desktop and this is a
very good development tool this is where
you create all your visualizations and
your dashboards that you want to share
across your organization or with your
friends then we have got tableau reader
this is again just for viewing purpose
if someone has created a dashboard or a
workbook in tableau desktop you can view
it in the tableau reader now you can
interact with the visualization
with filters but you cannot make any
changes to it then we have got tableau
public well tableau public is also used
for creating dashboards and worksheets
the only difference is that you cannot
save your workbooks in your system you
have to publish it in the tableau server
where it will be available publicly and
it has also limitations to connect to
data sources unlike that of tableau
desktop then we have got tableau server
which is an enterprise level sharing
tool so if you want to share all the
dashboards across your enterprise or
organization you can use tableau server
for that it is secure and reliable then
we've got tableau online now this is
just tableau hosted in cloud so you
could view your workbooks and your
projects that you have created in
tableau desktop in your tableau online
moving on let us understand the need of
data visualization so there is a very
good example to make you understand why
do we need to visualize this data and
this is the ants kombis quatrain now
these are the X and white points that
you can plot on a graph and it is there
for four different quadrants now if we
take a look here the numbers are almost
the same the sum average and standard
deviation are completely equal so you
might be thinking that when we plot this
points on a graph the graph will look
pretty much the same but when you
actually plot it you can see it is
completely different the lines formed by
these points are completely different
from each other and you wouldn't have
known that unless you have plotted it
and visualized it and that is why you
actually need to visualize your data in
order to understand the differences in
situations and that is how you come up
with different insights and solutions to
your business problems and that is how
tableau exactly helps you now let me
show you a sample workbook and I will
let you know what ways you can make
visualizations with tableau so here is a
workbook on the world indicators so
before making the workbooks first thing
you need to do is connect to your data
source now this is a world indicator
data set in the first
to worksheet we're going to find the
relationship among the population and
birth rate you can create a new sheet
from over here you can click here and it
will open a new worksheet for you now I
have dragged and dropped latitude and
longitude over here these measures help
you to plot an actual map in a tableau
worksheet if your data set contains any
geographical location tableau detects it
and it can plot a map just like this for
example we have country here well this
is just a simple visualization like a
simple scatter plot with varying colors
and sizes but it gives you a lot of
information here bigger the circle means
bigger the population and the color
legend description is over here so if
the birthrate is above 3% it is red if
it's between 1.5 to 3% it is gray and
similarly the description is over here
so clearly we can find out here that
even if China has a huge population the
birth rate is quite low because it's
blue you can see in countries in Africa
that even though the size of the circle
is quite small it is red which means
birth rate is quite high
over here here you can get an indication
that the population is low even though
the birth rate is high and this could
only lead to the fact that the mortality
rate in this countries is very high so
you can identify threats just by
visualizing the data and you can
conclude here that there might be fatal
epidemics or family and spreaded in the
countries because of which the
population is less but birth rate is
high similarly if you want to view the
infant mortality rate in different
countries in Africa you can visualize it
like this the color legends are over
here for birth rate it is blue for
infant mortality rate it's orange for
health at this yellowish and for life
expectancy it is purple similarly you
also want to see that care spends so if
you want to check which countries spend
more than 14% of GDP on health care you
can edit this part edit the text of the
question here you can even add filters
to adjust the threshold value which is
14% in this case let's drag it to 8% you
can see that the text also gets changed
here because I have included the
variable in the question
and it looks like every country spends
at least 8% just leaving the African
countries which explains the health
situation now let's check the technology
worksheet you can use filters to drill
down a single country view this is for
Argentina now you can make dashboards to
combine all the worksheets together just
drag and drop sheets to create your
dashboard dashboards in tableau are
interactive as well you can make changes
directly in your dashboard which will
reflect in your worksheet too
finally you can also sum up everything
in the form of a story just the way we
found out that there was an imbalance
among birth rate and population in
Africa and the best part in tableau is
that in order to tell a story you don't
need a storyteller you can view the
story just by clicking ahead and stories
are also interactive but let me tell you
even if you make any changes here it
will not reflect in your actual
worksheets like that of dashboards so
these are the kind of things that you
can do with tableau thank you for
