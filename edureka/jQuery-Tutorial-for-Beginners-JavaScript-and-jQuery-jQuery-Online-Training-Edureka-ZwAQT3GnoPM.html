because self-paced learning module on
jQuery UI development I will be your
instructor for this course
my name is Warren and before we begin I
would like to share a short introduction
about myself I've been doing development
for about six years now I have done
development in several languages
these include by 2 and JavaScript PHP
Ruby Java Android and for the past two
years or so I've also been working on
angular 1 dot X JavaScript continues to
be one of my favorite go-to languages
for its ease of use and jQuery is
something that I used extensively in the
past and I believe that it's a very
important stepping stone when you're
learning about front-end development it
is one of the key stepping stones that
every developer needs to know a little
bit of at least before they go on to
things like angularjs or react.js and
bouge so that's about me so what are the
objectives with with this module the
first one would be an introduction to
jQuery and its history we are going to
then talk about the jQuery object which
is also represented by the dollar symbol
you're going to talk about Dom what does
it mean you're going to talk about CSS
selectors a small mention about IDs for
jQuery as well jQuery CDN and its
installation so just a quick refresher
on what HTML CSS and JavaScript is for
so hTML is basically the structure of
your website in terms of the
architecture ok this in the sense that
ok I want a box here where I want a
round shape here and this is the layout
write CSS ads any sort of styling to
that structure whether it's from color
or shadowing or font size or font weight
multiple multiple things javascript
house' brings your website to life right
so of course you can make a pretty HTML
and CSS web page but then if it doesn't
do anything
and by doing I mean then you click on a
button or when you hover over something
or something else it doesn't really do
anything it kind of becomes boring after
a while
right I mean on Facebook how interesting
would Facebook me if you could not
really like anything you could just read
information JavaScript ads into
activity or to your webpages how you
might have experienced that a little bit
already by if you have done JavaScript
but otherwise you going to see now how
it does that and what are the ways in
terms of how you can add interactivity
to your web page and as image goes right
hTML is so structure CSS is for
presentation in JavaScript is so
behavior so let's look at the basic Dom
structure so this is just a simple HTML
document here and they have laid it out
in a tree sort of pattern okay there is
the document it is the parent of
everything else the document tag within
the document tag then you have HTML tag
which further contains head and body and
then head contains title and title
contains some text over here if you if
you look at this right and then you have
h1 tag which contains some text and then
you have the P tag which contains some
text the Dom really refers to - whenever
you're writing HTML what is really
happening is that you write certain
directions to a browser so a browser is
a software right through writing HTML
you are writing certain directions to
the browser that hey paint my web page
in a certain way so it's like if you had
a friend and he had a canvas that canvas
and that friend together are the browser
and you as a developer are the person
who's instructing this browser or person
and you're telling this person hey draw
a box for me make it this wide make it
like this make it have this shadow
effect print or display a message like
box one over it the font size the font
weight multiple multiple thing right or
if it's a document like let's suppose
you're dictating a document to somebody
okay the heading should be jQuery
training start with the subheading
jQuery intro then start with the
paragraphs plan your jQuery training now
so it's that is sort of the way that the
browser's work this HTML is essentially
directions they are essentially
directions to the browser okay what the
browser does is that it takes those
directions and creates something called
as add-ons a document object models
artifact now why does it create a dog
because it needs to apply the styles
that you have provided from the CSS it
needs to do several things to it so it
converts it into something called as a
DOM and makes it available to you and to
itself for manipulation and a large part
of JavaScript or jQuery has to deal with
Dom manipulation and you're going to
figure that out as you go along so when
it comes to Dom manipulation right if
you look at this example some of you
might be familiar with this right so
let's talk about this particular line
let's suppose that there is a div tag
with the ID results this particular line
basically gets that element gets that
Dom element to you in this variable in
this JavaScript variable and the
following lines are setting the HTML
inside it so basically you are setting
HTML or you're setting text inside an
HTML using javascript now that's a very
very powerful concept right right there
that you can deliver of a page to a user
with a certain look and feel and then
based on how the user decides to
interact with it you will make changes
to that web page you can literally
change this entire web page right there
and then because you have JavaScript
helping you out because it has access it
can read that HTML document that Dom it
can read the Dom and pick out the nodes
in the dorm so think of these as nodes
and think of jQuery having access to
each of these nodes and having the
ability to modify each of these nodes
whether it is the content of the node or
it is something else that it can do to a
node now one thing about the Dom is that
every browser behaves a little
differently so if you have ever felt
that your website doesn't look the same
on Chrome or versus Mozilla versus
Internet Explorer versus opera about
Safari and I'm sure you must have
experienced this with even very very
good websites like they tend to default
quite a bit depending on how careful the
developers were so the reason is that
it's not broken it's just that every
browser behaves differently so it's like
this consider each of the browser as a
right this is train day this is friend
be the friend see you are giving
directions to paint the door so you want
something called as a document to be
painted or printed on a canvas and
you're giving instructions to each
browser but each browser behaves
differently each like a person the
browser behaves differently two
instructions now 90 to 95 percent of the
behavior is similar but that 10% 15%
depending on what kind of instructions
you are giving might change so the
websites don't look massively different
but they are still a little different
right so that comes from who developed
that browser what did they want to build
it for what is the main purpose so
Internet Explorer for example is built
primarily for security it is supposed to
be very secure chrome is built for
something else
Firefox is built for speed Safari is
built for something else opera it for
something else and based on those
decisions sometimes these behaviors
change where they might not react to a
CSS property or they might not perceive
a certain directive in a certain way so
this is a problem this is a huge problem
for developers who have to build quickly
and they have to build websites which
would sort of at least 90 to 99 percent
of the time behave in a similar way
across browsers because if you were to
build four different browsers it or if
you were to write separate cool say
doing the same thing for different
browsers it would be just too much work
and developers are supposed to be lazy
right so jQuery helps us out jQuery
really helps us out so think of jQuery
like a manager okay
who knows each of the workers so if if
these are my friends
he knows the behavior of each and every
friend he knows Firefox requires more
directions than Chrome or chrome is a
bit slower than Internet Explorer or
Internet Explorer needs to be given the
instruction slowly now these are not the
actual differences but I'm just giving
you an example now as a manager jQuery
knows how to deal with the different
behavior of different routers so it
eliminates the need for us to write code
specific to browsers instead it takes
care of it for us that is a
and the most fundamental reason why
jQuery is so so popular then it removes
a dependency to write code for each and
every individual browser makes it very
very easy for people like you and me to
build websites really really quickly
okay
so what is jQuery then so jQuery is
essentially a JavaScript library so a
tester JavaScript please don't be
confused about this
I see people early on being a little
confused in terms of what is the
difference between javascript and jquery
javascript is a language jQuery is a
library built using JavaScript so jQuery
fundamentally is nothing but a lot of
JavaScript code that has been written by
developers who are very experienced who
have 25 years of experience developing
and programming and so on and so forth
so jQuery is just a library now it was
first released in 2006 it's one of the
most popular libraries with cross
browser support it is lightweight
lightweight being that the file isn't
too much and improves developer
efficiency of course easy to learn
because it relies on a lot of CSS based
syntax we'll come across this soon and
the current latest releases are 1.9 or
2.1 you can use either both are sort of
the latest releases now the next
question is why jQuery
so jQuery is a JavaScript library
designed to simplify the client-side
scripting naturally because of the
syntax being similar to CSS cross
browser support it helps in creating
dynamic web pages now dynamic in terms
of whenever you are able to manipulate
the Dom that is what adds a dynamic
nature to your web page and your web
application so that is one of the
fundamentals again that it creates
dynamic web pages which respond to user
input it is intuitive and easy to learn
you'll figure that as we go along it
integrates with ID so IDs have
out-of-the-box support for it it helps
in pages loading faster so because the
size is small the download time of the
library in itself is small which helps
out
generally when you find websites to be
slow either it's your internet
connection and if that's not the case
then the website is heavy heavy being
that the size of the code that you're
downloading to run the website is a lot
next is that it helps in creating
animated pages like flash
so before JavaScript or jQuery or even
jQuery became really popular one of the
typical ways to animate a web page was
using flash however that means that is a
front-end developer you have to learn
HTML CSS JavaScript and flash further
flash is not I think it would be sort of
sufficient to say that it's not the most
elegant of things to deal with when it
comes to browsers okay
a lot of problems across browsers and
across OS as well so what happens is
that jQuery because it's so easy to use
there are so many functions already
built in it provides us with a lot of
functionality to create animation which
is similar to flash but without using
flash so in terms of you learning newer
things it reduces the number of newer
things that you have to learn you don't
have to learn / and you're still able to
create beautiful animations using jQuery
which is also a part of a dynamic web
page right of a page which can sort of
animate based on user input or based on
certain sections being loaded and so on
so HTML document type it informs the
browser word document type it is and
again it has to do with the
interpretation of the document so again
the document the HTML document just
contains directions to paint a web page
and the doctype basically tells the
browser of which version of directions
these are and so it is very important
till HTML 4 this was the way that you
would mention the HTML document type and
from HTML file it's just very simple you
just type this and that's it this would
be sufficient
now CSS selectors so I'm pretty sure
that you guys must have come across this
by now there are various ways so
whenever you give directions in terms of
hey I want the box to be of red color or
I want the font to be for 14 pixel or I
want
to divide up the page and columns of 20%
20% and 40% right you write that code as
CSS but then how do you link the HTML
and CSS together in terms of what style
is to be applied on what element that
happens through selectors now there are
multiple ways to select or identify
attack so imagine it in this way that
there are eight boxes that you told your
friend to paint on the canvas now you
want one of the boxes to be afraid'
color naturally the friend will ask hey
which box now if the boxes were numbered
that they were identified as 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 you would tell your friend here box
number 3 needs to be of red color now
when you're doing this this is an
identifier and selector is I think a
synonym you can consider it as a synonym
for an identifier so there are various
ways to identify HTML tag one of them is
the tag name in itself that is a P tag
or a div tag or a span tag and these are
then universally applied so if I apply a
span tag with font size of 14 pixels
that will be applied across anywhere in
my HTML document that I use a span tag
then there are ID selectors which you
set by setting the ID on the HTML
document then you can of course said
this last selector as well now tag ID in
class tend to be the most popular ones
but then there are more there are a lot
of ways in which you can set selectors
there are pseudo-class selectors
there are selectors based on
relationships that is the parent-child
relationship then there are attribute
based selectors and then there are
multiple selectors as well so for now I
think he can focus on the top three that
is tag ID in class but I think even
selectors Basin relationships tend to be
commonly used as compared to the other
ones
so the jQuery object if you have studied
JavaScript you must have studied the
object so just a quick refresher in case
company is forgotten
let's say I open my localhost
okay so this is an empty web page right
now but just to quickly show you what I
mean is that this is an object in
JavaScript right curly brace is open and
curly brace is closed and it essentially
contains key value pairs so if I had to
count the number of fruits I could store
it like this and then if I do a dot
Apple it's print one a dot banana
I put paint two and a dot guava the
print three so similarly what you have
is something called as a jQuery object
now there are two ways to use the jQuery
object one is the dollar symbol and the
other one is jQuery written in this
particular casing that is J small and Q
capital and the rest of them small again
you can use either it is fine if you use
dollar or if you jQuery but a lot of
times the examples that you will find on
the internet will be using dollar so I
think for those course you will stick to
dollar now dollar is essentially a
function okay you need to really look at
it like JavaScript syntax so its dollar
is nothing but for you a variable so if
I was to show it to you again
you can consider it like this where
dollar is equal to right now I can say
dollar dot a equal to three and if I
type in dollar then it is an object so
dollar is a valid identifier or a
variable name in JavaScript in
javascript in general but what jQuery
does is that adopted the dollar as a
symbol for itself that all jQuery needs
to be accessed through the dollar and if
you look at it it's not just a variable
actually it's a function jquery this
parenthesis right in javascript
functions are called by the parentheses
the
opening at the closing other brackets
and then code inside it so this is
essentially the jQuery function which
has a lot of things inside it a lot of
things as we will discover but you
really need to visualize it in that
particular way that I'm just calling a
function that's it okay
so a jQuery object is like an array
which contains zero or more indexes it
also contains object methods like length
context and selector so I think as you
go along we will figure out how all of
this is true so it's a jQuery object
contains a lot of things right and I
will just show it to you in a few
moments what all it contains but keep in
mind that it is nothing but JavaScript
at the end of the day so we are not
going to lose sight of the fundamentals
very very important so some ID so jQuery
so I'm going to be using Adam there is
sublime text again one of the very good
ones lightweight but there is
Dreamweaver you can also use it in the
browser console like I was just
demonstrating through only editor such
as jsfiddle J's pin cloud 9 and then
there are debuggers so I just use a
chrome web inspector in Mozilla Firefox
there is a Firebug and you can use hito
depending on what you're familiar with
what you have installed all of them are
good
so jQuery CDN and installation so there
are two ways of installing jQuery in the
web project one is to download jQuery
and half the file like just like a
JavaScript file stored on your laptop or
in your project and give the path to it
so that is what I have done I have the
jQuery you draw a gs5 here if you can
see this is a lot of scary JavaScript
don't be confused by it no you don't
have to read through all of this but I
just included it like this I just added
it it's over here it will find it and
I'll be able to use it okay and the
other way is through the CDN which is
for there's a content delivery network
so just a small node I'll not go into
the depth of CDN but CDN are basically
hosted by big companies such as
CloudFlare such as Google's Amazon
jQuery in itself might have its own CDN
which are basically localized servers so
servers which are close to your specific
location respond to your request the
benefit of a CDN is that the server is
physically close to you physically
meaning that it's not sitting in the US
if you are in India it's sitting in
Singapore but if you are in US it's not
serving your file from India or UK or
Europe it is serving your files from us
itself so physical proximity plays a
role of course in transfer rate as well
as the fact that the file version is
being maintained and you don't have to
maintain a copy of the file on your own
machine that also plays a role then
there are certain other benefits in with
being a standard file so on and so forth
versus you choosing it from you know
something that poor developer downloaded
to you I sure that it is the original
jQuery and it's not been modified it's
not even messed around with so because
if you think about this right there is
this file I might accidentally edit it I
just edited it now something might break
if I have another developers on this
project but if you're downloading it
from the CD and I can't really
accidentally change something so that is
why the Sirian helps out by
if you're developing a local I usually
prefer local being if you just in
development mode I usually prefer having
the files on my machine because that's
much faster because it's just serving
the files from my machine to my machine
and I don't have to wait for it to
download from a server so development I
would suggest that govind downloading
the file okay
so before we start with this let me show
you something now notice that I've
already loaded the JavaScript file the
jQuery files and I'm doing a console dot
log of dollar I have not defined dollar
anywhere
I like the browser okay and I'm going to
reload this page I'm going to reload
this page on my browser I'm going to
just get rid of this and if you'd notice
it has jQuery HTML 936 line 36 and has
done a console dot log it has returned a
function so jQuery dollar is a is a
function essentially which can be a
little head spinning but in JavaScript
even functions or objects okay when it
said that dollar is an object it is
correct
and when it says dollar is a function is
correct because functions are also
objects in JavaScript now if I do jQuery
I'll get the result as the same function
and for comparison sake let me do it
like this so if you notice both of these
are returning the same thing right
they're the same function let me just
remove these for a second yeah let's
also try something else
let's see if they are same and they are
so as I say jQuery or dollar it is the
same thing okay so now talking about
what we are doing here so I have a
simple HTML file which has a div tag now
notice that there is nothing inside this
div tag so even when I'm loading this
page right there is nothing to be
displayed it's an empty HTML page with
nothing inside it everything is
basically I have commented out
everything there is only one div tag but
it has nothing inside it now let's
suppose I wanted to display
something after the page was just loaded
how does that work so let's break it
apart piece by piece
so I have dollar it takes something
called as a document when I pass in
document over here
jQuery understands that I am referring
to the entire HTML document right from
the very top and then I'm going to use
something called is ready ready is a
function again it's a function so this
is a function the one that I've
highlighted which has another function
on top of it
JavaScript allows us to do this okay
that there are functions defined on top
of each other it is also called as
chaining ref function top done another
function so I am calling a function
which takes in a parameter the parameter
is another function so I am basically
telling the browser that hey when the
document is ready execute this function
the one that I've just selected just run
whatever is inside of it so I'm not
setting a timer here because I don't
know when the page would be loaded or
when the page would be ready right I'm
just saying that hey if I never the
document is ready to whatever is inside
this function so let's try it out let's
do a simple console dot log document is
ready let me actually also comment out
all of this now let me reload the page
so this prints and let's see if we had
this outside let's set it on the line
number on line number 36 and then on
line number 42 so if you see write line
number 36 is executed line number 42 is
executed but the document got ready
later on it executed this it said this
instruction it moved on to this
instruction and when everything was done
and when the page was ready so the page
the document was not ready until in
unless it comes down to this one unless
it goes through everything the document
is not considered to be ready by the
browser so this function does not get
triggered
but then internally JavaScript triggers
this function once everything is ready
so this is really the first snippet of
code I think that most people go through
they're writing jQuery that when the
document is ready do something and the
next thing is that you want to display
something on the webpage
now jQuery allows us to select an object
or select a element in the dorm or to
break it down it allows us to select a
particular HTML tab now selection can
happen through multiple ways it can
happen by saying tips so it will select
all the divs available in the document
all that is even if there are like
thousand ten thousand days it will
select all that it's not recommended
that you do this because naturally it
causes a lot of problems so like CSS if
you wanted to set the style on all divs
that is what you would do then the next
option is to select it by ID so if you
look at this over here
the ID is ready demo so I can just set
the hash tag like I would do in CSS so
CSS would be something like this right
or let's reduce it a little bit right so
hash tag ready demo in a similar way I
can do hash tag ready them over here
which tells you query that or the
browser in fact that this is what we are
referring to this is what we want
something to be done on you want to set
the text inside it because it's empty
and what it takes to be document is
ready so we were doing a console dot log
but now we want to show the user that
hey mat that page is ready so notice
your web page is ready now let's reload
the page as you can see it appeared it
wasn't there it is my code which put it
there so anything I print over here it
will show over here and this happens
after to a low document dot ready so
when the document got ready then this
function was executed and the function
execution wanted this to happen first
select the tag that you want to make
changes to so I want this node to be
modified manipulated I want that takes
inside it to be webpages ready and
that's what I ended up doing going back
to the slides so it is executed as soon
as the document is ready for Dom
manipulation and we assign a function
right so moving on now another thing
that jQuery allows us to do which I was
talking about is chaining or even
actually javascript allows us to do is
functions on each other where functions
are executed one after the other
so let's suppose I want you to set the
color after it loaded jQuery provides me
with a method called as dot CSS and
whenever you're kind of searching for
these things online you have to refer to
them as dot CSS in jQuery and you will
immediately open the documentation on
Google or jQuery website Sociedad CSS in
jQuery this is a method which takes two
parameters the first parameter has to be
the CSS property and the second
parameter has to be the value okay so
let's run this for a second and see the
result if it works or not okay it
already did right web page is ready we
can also chain another one to this or
let's try a different one
let's try it as something like font
weight and let's set it to 700 now it
becomes bold if I make it as a hundred
it is not bold if I make it as one
thousand it is okay it's not pooled yeah
one thousand is not a valid property
yeah seven hundred is so it becomes bold
and I can even change the color again so
I can make it blue now oh ho I think the
color if you look at it it's a sequence
first do this set the text then color
than this so again I'm giving directions
like to a frame but this time the canvas
is ready and probably it's a second
frame which is my JavaScript and jQuery
frame which I'm telling that hey now do
this now do this now do this and to try
the last thing that is given on the
slide deck which is fade in which
basically tells it to fade in sort of an
animation let's look at how to make it
slower so this is a jQuery documentation
I'm just going to try and figure out how
to make it slower okay so it takes a
number I can give it a number I think
it's in milliseconds so I can say that
hey show it in two thousand milliseconds
or 100 milliseconds okay let me set it
to 5,000 which should be five seconds
which is pretty slow
okay right I think my live reload is
enabled and that's why it's kind of not
doing really it's not truly showing that
effect let me try it out like this
okay yeah
you
moving on so jQuery also allows us to
declare functions of our own on the
dollar object now this again goes back
to the fact that functions are also
objects and objects can contain
functions on top of them right so an
object in JavaScript can have like when
the keys be corresponding to the value
which is a function so to define a
custom function on JavaScript this is
sort of the way we would do it where we
would call dollar dot F n dot my custom
function and then define a function
which would do something and then we can
do further things to it so if you have
to define your own jQuery functions
there is a possibility to do that as
well without you know rewriting the
entire library however whatever it
suggests is that just keep it as a
mental note for now because it is
preferred that you are a more advanced
user of sorts who has done this who has
sort of familiarity with jQuery and
JavaScript quite a bit to be attempting
this but it's a good to know thing that
you can extend the library and one of
the most beautiful things about jQuery
you can extend the library to your own
means and fashion okay coming to
querying the Dom or selecting various
parts of the Dom object using jQuery and
JavaScript okay so I have an example for
you it is nothing but a simple list okay
and what is happening in this list is
that there are three items
wait let me actually just show you the
HTML right so this is a list there are
three items in the list that is outside
its an a tag not referring to anything
but probably we can just refer it to
google the
the div tag inside it which has another
a tag inside it it's a demonstration
purpose not necessarily that you will
build something like this but it could
help me demonstrate a certain amount of
concepts and then it has other elements
inside it okay as I just showed you that
we queried the dorm using the ID
selector but we can also use other CSS
selectors as well but let's take to the
ID selector for now now over here the
example that we have is that if there is
an ID called as fruits and we have to
take that text out of it it would return
the entire li all of this inside of it
if we then go to again this is a
separate way of referring to it this is
another way and this is another way
neither one of these is right or wrong
use the one which you're most
comfortable with so I think a lot of you
might be comfortable with the first
option this one is a more generic one
and this one would only select the li
inside it okay so as I have told you
that jQuery would relies on CSS
selectors it uses the same power of them
now there's the ID selector it looks for
a unique ID and selects it and sets the
text inside it we've already done this
demonstration right moving on to the
next one then there is of course the
class selector as well so if I were to
let's suppose go to the document and
change the class to read e1 and change
this to read e1 as well and change this
to read e1 and then go and then reload
the page it still works
because now it's a class so instead of
the hash it's a dot now the question
might be when to use which really
depends on you and really depends on
your let's suppose if you are making the
project I would typically say stick to
one but in case you don't want to define
extra ID so let's suppose you have a div
tag right and you defined a class on it
now you don't want to add extra HTML to
it by adding an ID tag and you know
referring to as something else in
JavaScript and forgetting the reference
again and again so it might be
convenient to use classes wherever they
are applicable in case a certain element
of your HTML does not have classes then
you can probably define now I
on it and use those and then there is
naturally the element selector so let's
suppose I will add a heading over here
and I'll say heading h1 close it and
once the page is loaded we're gonna say
dollar h1 dot CSS color I'm gonna say
red and we're going to then go ahead and
rewrote that page right so if you solve
every second it is black but then it
quickly transitions to red
so even by using the h1 tag that is
pretty much like how it would work in
your in your CSS you can set it up or
you can change the text entirely
and we can do this we come to this and
we change I shouldn't ask you Tina - one
text okay moving on then of course there
are the attribute selectors which is by
saying that let's suppose there is an a
tag and it has the target set as self or
it has a H ref which is said to
google.com and I want to select it and I
want to modify the color of it so the
way this would work is that let me just
add a tag over here
and the target is so it is an attribute
set on it and then there is another one
okay
so what jQuery allows me to do is go
over here say select an e-tag which has
target equal to self and you change the
CSS color from blue that it would
typically be to green okay I forgot the
quotes quotes need to come here and I'll
change this to double quotes okay let's
try it out
so if you notice the color has changed
let me mute all of these out so that you
can see clearly the color has changed if
I were to change it from self to plank
the other one the Google blank one gets
colored let's see if I change this to
yahoo.com okay
let's suppose you made a mistake both of
them say Google inside it like to the
user but actually one is for Yahoo so
what you want to do now is you want to
select the one which says yahoo.com and
we want to change the text to say Yahoo
right
so if you notice earlier in the HTML
this is being set as Google cells but
then we changed it we selected on the
basis of the attribute and then we
change the text inside it okay so this
is how you will basically select based
on the attribute so attribute refers to
so I know ID and class are also
attribute so it might be a little
confusing in terms of because I think
when you've read CSS put refer to class
and ideas attributes as well and it is
they are attributes rightly so
but then what we are referring to here
is kind of attributes which are not ID
or class okay next is universal
selectors which is basically a star
symbol which will select everything in
your document not recommended that you
do this it will eat up a lot of memory
you probably crash a website on the
user's browser but the star symbol will
essentially select everything next is
position selectors and pseudo-class
selectors right so let's try this out
actually on the on this particular one
now if I had to select the Li let's
suppose I to select the item list item
list and then I had to select the
a lie and I to do the CSS color as red
let's see what the result is
so what happened is that this is the way
that you can select the children inside
of parent so what yeah what I said is
that he select the item list the element
with item list and then go to the first
one inside it and said all Li as with
the CSS as rate of color now what if I
had to do this only on the first one so
if I had to do it only in the first one
this is how I would do it
what is how the difference is only the
first one is colored red so I'll just
remove this
it's a CSS precedence which is playing
here so let's suppose first from this
coffee so first when he set his coffee
if I have to select the second one I
would go a second okay
I'd have made a mistake let's look at
yeah
let's try bit to
this works only with first and not with
second but if you have to just select
the first one I think it also works with
the last yeah it works is the last one
as well but okay right so it works with
first in last but not with second third
or fourth so it's more about personal
asset easier but if you think about
logically the number of items in a list
can be hundred as well so it would not
be possible to kind of name the middle
ones the second third because different
people will refer to them in different
ways and that would be unmaintainable so
you can see the first or the last of her
thing as well using first or last and
then of course the pseudo-classes so the
other option here was that if I suppose
knew that everything else had to be
turned away I could do it like this so I
said the not
and then yeah so here is what I did
I said a which does not have href as
google.com said that takes to Yahoo
which does not so not is also available
as an option next is traversing the dorm
so traversing is basically walking
through the dorm it's like walking the
path walking element by element by
element by element and with query
selectors which is the first part you
can make the first selection but then if
you want to keep going down a particular
nested set of tags in your HTML that is
where traversing the dorm will help you
out and then there are some common
functions available to us fine finds all
matching elements child children if same
is fine but moves only one level down
closest moves up the Dom tree so it
doesn't move down it doesn't move inside
moves up the Dom tree until it finds the
matching parent moves up the Dom tree
but up to a single level so closest will
find that closest match even if its way
up parent will just move to the next
immediate single level okay it will find
the parent of this particular nodes next
moves down and targets the immediate
falling sibling now what is important to
notice here is the sibling part it will
notice it will go to the sibling it will
not go to a child so if there is a li
tag right so Li tag if you call it on an
li tag it will move to the next li tab
it will not go to anything inside it any
HTML inside it previous is just like
next but moves up so it moves to the
preceding sibling and siblings it
targets moving up and down so if I
select it on an li tag it will select
all the other siblings first gets the
first element from the selected side and
last gets the last so I think that kind
of shows where I am in Tehran Collier so
first and last basically first goes on
the first one and the last only on the
last one not on the middle ones but if
you have to traverse the middle ones
then probably something like next or
previous or closes that's something that
will come to help so let's see a couple
of examples of each one of them okay so
let's mute this out and mute this out as
well
okay
so what I've done is that I've added a
simple button here and I've added a
click function on it now what I have
done here is that if whenever I click on
this button which is present on the
webpage here something will happen
now what that something will be is being
defined by me here so what this is going
to do is going to go to item list this
you will that you have created is going
to find the a tag it's going to make
them of red color so let's try this out
right let me click on the button so all
the a tags went red coffee was not an EA
tag in fact let me
so that we can remember and we can say
this is yahoo.com and it can say this is
and if I click on click me see how it
found only the a tags and not coffee and
not milk and not tea and it said them to
read so potentially item list find a set
the color to rate next one is the
children example so if I was to do this
let me try and do this or let me first
show you this example so we did find
right we did it on item list but let's
do it on the first li instead which will
select this particular Li tag let's see
what the result is pretty much like the
same one I selected the Li the list item
first instead this time and I set the
color to red
now what if I change it to be children
what will happen only google.com gets
colored red why is this because children
goes to the next immediate one which is
this one it will not go inside
it will not go more than one level deep
if this was outside the div tag here
this div tag contains this right this
was outside it would have worked but
then it is not so this doesn't work out
so children goes to the next immediate
one let's go to the closest one they see
what the outcome is try to guess the
four I demonstrate closest goes to the
immediate closest one let's look at the
definition once moves up the Dom tree
until it finds the matching element in
Dom it moves up the Dom tree actually
okay so nothing is happening the reason
is that it is moving up it is not moving
down it is not moving down so we need to
find something up here so if we added a
tag over here which is outside of ul so
it's no longer about being inside ul
outside ul a tag okay wait
you
so I think it would be better if he so
inside
what closes does is that it tries to
look for the closest parent of a
particular type so what I've done
instead is that I've selected this
particular attack which is inside a life
and have said hey find the closest ally
and set the color to red this is what
this is going to do it's going to go to
the closest ally and it's going to set
the color to red the page is reloaded
let's click on this button and if you
noticed the Allied this time the Li gets
turned color to red so there has to be a
relationship what I was trying out
earlier was that there was no
relationship between the daylight AG and
the e-tag outside it but now we know
that it has to be a parent-child
relationship there it tries to find the
closest parent up the chain now going to
the parent example fear again I'm going
to select the inside a div a tag and
we're going to find the parent and we
need to give it a border of one pixel so
just right out okay
so the div tag containing yahoo.com gets
a border of one pixel over here okay
next is so you're going to go to the
first Ally we're going to go to next and
we are going to give it a CSS border of
one pixel first Li and it gives it to
milk because it is going to move to a
sibling not a child not a parent but to
a sibling so at the same hierarchical
level as it self let's go to the
previous one
okay so in fact let me make it a little
simpler so it will go to the last Li and
then it will go to the previous sibling
so it will go to T and but from T it
will go to milk so this till this it is
at T then it goes to milk and then it
said so CSS next to siblings so first
you lie then the siblings and sets them
to the border okay
we could also do it like this where we
select this and
right instead of love you can do first
and then it will say to both of these or
last way to do it to both above once
okay next is first so let's see what
this does for us we'll select
Li and we'll select the first one so we
select Li and we select the very first a
lie that we find and this one will
select the last one I thought there was
another way to do it so there are
multiple ways to do the same thing my
recommendation would be to select the
one that you're most comfortable with
that you remember the top of your mind
and just use it this really take little
right or wrong here 4:54 big nose and
eventually you will get into the mood of
using these functions in a way which
makes sense twitch is sort of convenient
for you at the given moment so they come
in handy when you are dealing with a lot
of complicated Dom manipulations for
beginning purposes keep your focus on
the first part that is just selecting an
element using class identifier or the
idea identifiers or the tag identifier
