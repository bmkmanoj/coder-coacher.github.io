the landing page for the VLSI design
essentials training program developed by
logo sent and delivered to the 80-acre
platform in this video I'm going to talk
a little bit about the VLSI learning
process and also provide a glimpse of
the material used in the course I spent
more than 20 years in the VLSI field and
if I learn one thing that one thing is
that learning and sharing never stops
for a good engineer in the VLSI arena
the job specific learning starts with
the familiarization of the work
environment and the tools optimum usage
of language constructs and good
practices that result in robust designs
and that is just for starters the
journey gets more thrilling as a rubber
hits the road when your first designs
are put to the test or your first test
hit the design this is usually when the
tricks of the trade start revealing
themselves there's a long list of
essential skills and techniques meet how
the clocks and resets need be
implemented and control beat the
significance of power management in
modern designs beat awareness of the
overall VLSI development flow and
various dependencies beat building the
expertise in specific domains like
multimedia I can testify first and that
concepts like this become thorough only
through OJT that's on the job training
that usually takes several months if not
years and a few hands on projects guided
by the industry experts this course
provides an opportunity to get a head
start with the OJT this is a sample
theory slide from the course this one
introduces the most common
used to stage synchronizer and this is a
lab guidance slide this particular one
is from the schematic analysis lab the
takeaway materials and the tools
including the standalone Linux virtual
machine environment help the trainees
become self-sufficient for continued
learning beyond the course completion I
welcome you to join an exciting journey
with us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
