range is here you see I have defined the
range of five list list one just trying
and convert it to list and then it gives
me it gives me this output okay let me
say range let me just show you as to
what the range is if I give you a range
of ten what what will be the output it
will give me 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 that
means it is giving me a range of 0 to 9
let's say if I do a range of 5 to 10
what does it give me it gives me 5 6 7 8
9 see I'm trying to explain you range it
beta okay let me say I say 1 to 10 and
then does this make sense to you guys
now see you if I just give range if I
just give range it will give me starting
from 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp;amp; 9 if I say a
range of 5 to 10 it will give me
starting from 5 6 7 8 9
if I say the range between 1 to 10 and
you know the spacing between every two
letters of whatever it is is 2 here
right so in say 1 3 5 7 9 so basically
that is what it has been explained yet
so you know what a range stop is range
start and stop and then a range start
stop step cannot be 0 before this one
right this step it has to be 1 all the
ways of them 1 as the name suggests a
sequence is a succession of values bound
together by container that reflects the
type so almost every string that you put
in in Python is is a sequence ID it can
be the list tuple string right they are
all a sequence basically at the end of
the day and an x range Python supports
several of these strings lace tuples and
exchange these are the type of see
that bites and supports fightin has a
pattern a lot of methods for firm for
and formatting operations that we can
perform on these ok so let's see one by
one as to what each get one does so list
is something right let me go here this
is sequence so if I say you know just
wave your 5 right let's say for example
here you see this a list is in a square
braces okay if you see an output of
something like this it is called as list
if I say just range of 5 it is it
becomes a list but then if I say tuple
or
range of 5 then you see this it's inside
parentheses okay
then it's not a list it becomes a tuple
in that case but for now let's
understand list list is anything that is
inside square braces
and it can be accessed individually by
its index number let's say for example
in my list 1 which is list of 5 right if
I say list 1 here you have 0 1 2 3 or 5
and then I can say list 1 off the zero
will give me the first element list 1 of
1 will give me the second element list 1
of 2 will give me a third element so on
and so forth okay that's that's about
list now let's see what it says the list
type is a container which holds a number
of other objects in a given order right
you have 0 1 2 3 4 index the list type
implements the sequence protocol and it
allows you to add or remove objects from
the sequence okay so we'll see as to how
do you add and remove from list a list
is an ordered set of elements inclusive
square basis that that's what I told you
right
when you see when you do a list if you
get something within square braces that
is a list okay and you can
but any other evil you can convert a
string into list as well let's say for
example I have a equal to some example
and then if I say a it's an example so
if I if I want to convert this to list I
did that successfully like I can convert
it I can convert a string to a list I
can convert a tuple to a list I I can
convert everything to a list okay
and that's how simple it is in Python
okay so if you if you can access each of
this item individually you know look at
the amount of operations that you have
no amount of code that you are saving
when you actually have to you know slice
it and dice it and then maybe only find
out L if there is L in this you know the
whole example right in this whole
sentence if you are trying to find a
word look at the amount of effort you
are saving there now you have seen this
list list if you have all you know let
me take a nice example so that I'll
explain to you as to what you know some
more operations on on list now if I do
this and then I say list 3 it gives me
everything now I can also you know there
are some more other thing that I can do
I can say list off ok
what will this give me ok just
understand this I have not given
anything ok here the end is empty right
the end is empty it says true to
infinity it will just say 0 1 2 and it
will just pull the data to whatever is
there right now if I say 2 2 3
what does it give them it just gives me
later sign yes you're right for some
yeah right listener so when I say 2 to 3
because the way this list work is right
from two and you just take one more
write 0 1 2 that that's about it if I
say 2 to 4
one two three four right it will just
say data signs and P if I say two to
five it will give me data science big
and high right there total five items
and it starts with 0 1 2 right 2 to 5
will give me 2 3 2 and plus 3 which is 5
ok so that's how you know list are
structured list is very powerful you can
access the items individually from list
you can also use operators like you know
you can use : and then find out the
range of data in between the two data
inside your list
so the lot of things that you can do in
using lists and then now let's say it
gives me the length is 5 right you can
even find out the length of the list you
can you can find out the index by you
know you just you can find you can give
start/stop and then find out the value
like what what I did you know 2 2 4 3 2
5 etc you can say list of and I've been
doing this over and over again this 3 of
you give the index and then you get the
value right that's also done this index
and this is slicing list index again
here list I will return the value of
pain index where I see an integer right
whatever so you know this when you say
missed
list of 1 or 2 you get that value it
negative lists you see this is also one
important thing ok let's say I want to
access from start right how do you do
that you first say you want to access
the last element so how would you do
that you say list of 3 and then and then
on top of that I would say length of
list 3 and then minus 1 right so it
gives me my last element say instead of
writing so big a code right here just
finding the length minus 1
yes Ragavendra that's that's true so all
you have to do is instead of all this I
say list minus 1 ok I want to find last
but - at least - OH last but three lists
- three right so that's how I'll be able
to pull out the data from list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
