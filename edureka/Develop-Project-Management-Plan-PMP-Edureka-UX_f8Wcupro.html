key point now you guys should start
taking a note off the output from the
previous process is actually being fed
as an input to this process the output
of the previous process was project
charter now you know now you need to
know and correlate of the understanding
what I was sharing with you yesterday
saying a developer project charter
results into a project charter so the
output of a double project Charter was
project charter and then we have to
develop a project management plan
remember we have not completed many of
the other activities and if I see it
from the process group perspective we
are now moving on to a second stage the
double project Charter was the stage one
wherever which was the initiating
process phase in initiating that was the
first thing now once we are on to the
develop project management plan we are
on to the planning portion of our
project because the develop project
management plan is part of the planning
process group and what are the inputs
available for us stills
till this stage the first input you know
which is a project Charter which is
basically an output of the previous
process the third and fourth input I
told you that the enterprise environment
factors which is EEF and the second is
an organizational process a set Opa
these two items would continue to be the
inputs to most of the processes going
forward so this is there by default and
the second input is something what you
pay attention to is known as output from
other processes so what is what is that
we meant by the output from other
processes I would cover up shortly for
you the tools and
techniques they remain the same saying
you have the expert judgment and you
have facilitation techniques what would
be the output very easy to correlate
project management plan remember I was
talking to you on the other nine
processes the knowledge areas as well
very clearly telling you that a project
communic project communication plan
management results into an output of
communication management plan
similarly the wealth project management
plan a results into an output of project
management plan and why I am giving an
emphasis on the various inputs and
outputs is actually to give you a fair
understanding so that once you know
various inputs and outputs it will be
easy for you to correlate why that
process is needed and what is that
process is all about and you may be
given some questions very clearly to
know that whether you know of various
inputs and outputs of the different
processes so the way I would like to
propose is that we need to understand
the various inputs and outputs rather
than cramming it I would avoid cramming
those things because cramming would not
stay in your mind for long but the PMP
is one such exam which you can clear
only if you have absorbed various
concepts and you have got a good
understanding of the topics cramming
would not yield into a positive outcome
for you very clearly so I would avoid to
the extent possible
please do not cram please try to
understand wherever you can
so very clear we are into the devel
project management plan which is the
part of planning process group we have
taken the output from the previous
process which is project charter as an
input we have taken EEF we have taken
OPA we have tools and techniques eggs
expert judgment facilitation technique
and output is NaN the project management
plan so what are the project what are
the project management plan the project
management plan very clearly defines how
we are gonna execute this project it
also defines how the project is executed
monitor and control and this is going to
be a plan which will be helping us to
manage coordinate and integrate at
different knowledge areas and processes
within the project
so the process of creating the project
management plan what are the other plans
what we are going to talk about you
remember in the input sections there was
something called as an output from other
processes so this is what I am
explaining this to you on slide number
19 1 9 the output from other processes
means let me start with the project
scope management first the first is the
scope management plan that is the output
from the fifth knowledge area of the
fifth module which is the second
knowledge area the scope management plan
would be one of the outputs requirements
management plan would be the second
output from the scope process then comes
your schedule management plan which will
be an output of your project time
management process the output from
project cost management process is gonna
be a cost management plan then similarly
the quality management plan the process
improvement plan human resource plan the
communication management plan risk
management plan procurement management
plan change management plan
configuration management plan staffing
management plan risk response plan
milestone list resource calendar cost
base line quality baseline scope
baseline risk resistor various logs
change locks let me explain these terms
one by one now let me start with the
scope management plan the scope
management plan defines how a scope is
gonna be planned manage and monitor
across the project a requirement
plan very clearly indicates how our
gonna be the project requirements
defined how would you gather those
requirements and how you do manage those
requirements very clearly so for you to
understand these management plan
remember what each of this plan is going
to be doing is that dealing with the
respective area planning how that area
can be planned manage and control these
are gonna be the three key words for you
to know what is going to be meant by the
respective management plan cost
management plan means how the cost is
gonna be planned estimated busted
monitor controlled quality management
plan will tell you how do you plan for
the quality how do you actually see
various quality assurance coming into
the play and what is gonna be the
control measures for you from the
quality perspective and this would also
result into a process improvement plan
if you if you look at from a quality
process in the end if the process is not
resulting into a the quality what has
been benchmarked or the standards what
have been defined in the beginning a
process improvement plan comes into the
play for the improvement on the quality
as such human the sauce plan very
clearly helps us to define how are we
gonna bring in the project member
members into the project how would you
take care how will we take care of their
training needs their roles and
responsibilities their roles and the
rewards in the cognition communication
would very clearly define in how the
communication is gonna be done in the
various with the various stakeholders
risk manager
plan will very clearly helps us to
identify and manage the various risks
procurement management plan will help us
to control the procurement change
management plan will help us to bring in
a change once the changes are initiated
and approved by the change Control Board
we would follow the change management
plan configuration management plan is a
kind of
of our input to the control scope
process it very clearly defines on how
to change various features and functions
to suit the final output staffing
management plan gives us an indication
of how we are going to be meeting these
staffing requirements in case we need to
negotiate with an outside the supplier
on the manpower or we should we'll do
manage it within the team and stuff so
this is all what is being taken up as an
input from the perspective of the
developer project management plan risk
response plan is very clearly a strategy
to deal with various risks which are
identified milestone we already covered
that what are the different milestones
we are all set
resource calendar is a kind of calendar
of the people who are going to be
working in the project and resource
calendar would also mean that it's a
human resource calendar or a timings
availability you need to consider in
your mind that the people who are
working into the project those people
may be located at one single place maybe
in one organization maybe in one office
they could be working in from different
geographies they could be working in
different countries all together so from
that perspective you must know the
availability of each of the resources
and you also know by the region's that
since it is gonna be multiple regions or
multiple cities there would be some kind
of non availability of the respective
people either because of their own
schedule or because of maybe various
cultural cultural festival or maybe a
government holidays and stuff you know
keep all those activities in the mind
and three main items which are cost
based line quality baseline and a scope
baseline these are the three items which
are again the input back to the
developed
project management plan remember we
discussed on these three plan yesterday
with a message very clearly that once
these plans are approved the cost
baseline the quality baseline and this
core baseline any changes to these three
baselines after their freeze can only be
done by the change request management
process that means we need to bring back
the issue to the change control board
which is C C B and then only those
changes can happen next terms comes as a
risk register risk register is nothing
but a sheet of paper which would help us
to document what are wrong with it's
different risks and this is also called
as a database of all the possible risk
what you can encounter
and those risks are actually taken care
of in a risk response plan wherein you
will define a strategy to deal with that
kind of risk then comes an issue lock
all the issues are identified and there
is a numbering system so there is a log
which is maintained and there is an
assumption log also like once you
execute a project you take various
assumptions into the play see when those
assumptions are documented then comes in
a change lock all the changes which we
are entering into a project there is a
change log which gets created and these
are also pretty much related with your
change management plan as such so this
is what is various may be the indication
for us for the various terms which would
be used in and out once we talk about on
the processes as such so you need to
remember those those terms very clearly
from the perspective of the terms
getting used again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
