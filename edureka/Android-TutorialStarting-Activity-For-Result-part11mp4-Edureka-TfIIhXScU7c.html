activity for result is one of the
concept which we use to access the data
from other activity to first one here
what happens is actually use that first
activity like suppose the first activity
is activity which is giving you a option
the button is there with a name called
choose now when you click on this choose
button you suddenly go on to second
activity now here in this activity what
happens there is two option first option
is like are you interested in sports are
you interested in music are you
interested in XYZ three options now when
you select any one of these when you
click any of one of these these are in
the list view pattern it means that they
are showing one by the other when you
click any of these setting you comes
back to the first activity and then you
access this data the one which you have
selected on the second activity you
access this data on the first activity
now this is somewhat sounds like passing
the data but actually here we are
passing the data in different manner we
are trying to access the data from the
start of an activity and then
automatically the activity will close
like a activity is there on a activity
we are trying to access the data of B so
for the time being ani activity when you
click the button be activity will start
you do perform something like you click
on an option and then again a B activity
will close and you come back on any
activity and the result will populate
this result has came after accessing
some part of B activity this is what is
the concept of a startactivityforresult
so start activity for result at then me
as the name itself suggests you start be
activity for result you start the
activity you get the result oniony again
you come back to active EA is it clear
conceptually so far they start activity
results the concept
is it clear for all okay sure i will
explain again the concept is like on one
activity if you can see this example i
have activity getting a response first
we're witches countries showing data and
then second part is ranked i clicked on
countries i claim to second activity
where you can see India Australia
England etc etc you clicked on this
activity and again you return back to
first activity and in the first activity
you can see the toast which is showing
you that which activity you have clicked
on this is what we are doing here is we
are accessing the result from the second
activity and showing it on the first
activity so we are is starting the
activity second for result purpose to
obtain the result out of it is it clear
now okay now let's see it how does it
work actually as an example
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
