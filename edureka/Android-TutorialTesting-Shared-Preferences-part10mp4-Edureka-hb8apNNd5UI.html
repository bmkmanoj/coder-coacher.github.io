the string then just save it now let's
run the application
you
ok now let's write something inside this
loop and click on this button you can
see that the value you have accessed
from the first you can retrieve in the
second this time I am you are choosing
the bundle concept but I am trying to
access the data from where from my
shared preference file so I am using the
shared reference file for restoring the
data this data which i have restored is
the first the first idea text within the
first screen wherever writing something
I was touring the data inside my shared
reference and then I am accessing the
same shared preference to retrieve the
data on my second screen this concept is
clear is it clear so far
okay is it clear for Nikita is a clear
for metalliche everyone is a clear
follow you all if you have any questions
please do ask okay negative wants to go
to the previous quote fine you can just
have a look at the core you can
understand it have been a very simple
thing i have created a shared preference
at the top here then after creating the
shared reference i came down a in the
shared reference i write a file name
with which i want to i wanted to create
this shared preference and then i have
kept some of the values inside it
like I have kept the edit text value
which I was retrieving from the first
activity inside my share preference once
that is done i pass the intent just to
move over
I've got a question from methyl methyl

calculator after two is definitely with
Ollie you can develop a simple
calculator obviously with their help
after this class as you have already
seen that how you can transact the data
from one activity to other and how you
can use the click listener actually
everything you can definitely create it

difficulty do get in touch with our
