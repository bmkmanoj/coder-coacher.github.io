your instructor for today so on Bradford
rekha I welcome you all to this webinar
on Linux tutorial and in today's session
I'm going to give you a complete
overview of flux okay so it doesn't
matter if you're a beginner or if you
have good knowledge about your nuts but
I'm going to teach you concepts that you
can take away home and you can execute
for yourself so guys before I get
started let me just take up with
confirmation from you people I hope you
can hear my voice and see my screen if
that's the case please put that in the
chat box and I'll get started ok so I'm
getting a couple of acknowledgement here
where we said you can hear my voice and
see my screen and so does our cache I'm
the same can be said for even now a
month alright so guys it seems like it's
all fine let's get started with the
session all right now before I er get
start with the first topic let me just
show you the agenda and tell you what
we're going to cover trip okay so this
is the agenda and I'll be covering the
topics in this flow okay first I'll talk
about the birth of Linux and tell you
why they became popular all right and
then I talked with Willie's
distributions of Linux
okay so Linux is basically a kernel most
of the people think that next is an
operating system in itself well that's
not the case so I'll talk about the
various versions of Linux
okay the way the operating systems of
fallenness I will talk about those
things and then we'll get started with
the hands-on right after that topic okay
so in the hands-on we have I've
categorized this into different tough
phases where you know I will talk about
the basic Linux commands first and then
I will show you how to work with files
and directories and then I will show you
how to add and delete users you know you
will learn all those administration
aspects and finally there will be one
networking aspect which I will cover in
Linux okay so there is something called
as SSH okay
SSH stands for secure shell and this is
used for communication
supposing you want to communicate with
the remote host right when I say remote
host it means a system that's located
remotely which you don't have the
physical access to so that can run
between how will you access that machine
with an SSH so I will talk about all
these things and yes so if you guys have
any doubt or any problems during the
session please put that in the chat box
and I'll answer them right away all
right guys cool Robbie is it fine all
right great
Robbie
says that he's neutral nuts or greater
be no problem that's exactly the target
audience for this webinar right so you
know this is going to be a complete
basic tutorial and you know for anyone
that's going to get start with the nuts
for little bit college students or
professionals who are absolutely new
right so we're all used to using Windows
or Mac right so most of the people in
here would have just use Windows because
it's cheaper and it's better but Linux
is something that is a software
developers favorite operating system
right so that's why you know there is so
much hype and so much demand for inerts
professionals and Linux administrators
and if you want in order to get started
with a career in that domain then we can
get started from this tutorial from
today all right guys
okay so without wasting much time let's
go to the first topic and that is why
the deluxe becomes popular well before I
talk about you know where is it became
popular let's look at the birth of nuts
how things start off okay so back in
1969 there was this person called you
know in fact they were two people
dentistry and Ken Thompson right so
they're working in the AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs
and what they did was they created this
C programming right so we're all aware
of programming right so we are all aware
of these basic programming languages
right so C is one of the most basic and
one of the most effective and the root
of all the other programming languages
so that is C and it was them that
developed C and the UNIX operating
system so that was what happened in 1969
okay and then in the decade that
followed okay so basically in the 1970s
people started developing or
contributing to the development of these
two things it's okay so they started
contributing to the development of the C
programming language and the UNIX
operating system so in our session we'll
discuss more on UNIX operating system
and since it's about Linux right so UNIX
is basically the mother of pearl Linux
because
Linux is based on UNIX operating system
okay I'll tell you how that's the case
in some more time but that's why they
are starting off with your operating
system okay so I am NOT going to cover
about C and getting back to our slides
so it says growth of X because of open
source collaboration and there was
commercial sale of Unix
now what this meant is that you know the
product that Dennis Ritchie and Ken
Thompson created right that those were
you know something really attractive
they were some amazing software and
operating systems that would you know
power machines and
Computers now what this meant was you
know they had to be developed to become
even better right so they made it
open-source it was when we say open so
that means I was freely available to use
by anyone so anybody any person any
scientist or any engineer or anybody
could just get access to the source code
and start improving that source code and
if they feel that they have improved the
software in any way then they can just
you know give that code back to the
developers so basically it was all about
collaborated development so that's what
happened with UNIX operating systems in
the 70s many hippies the scientists they
all collaborated together wrote their
own code their own version of UNIX
operating system and contributed to the
development of UNIX operating system and
since AT&amp;amp;T they were the ones who built
UNIX or the ones they were responsible
for founding UNIX they were the ones
that again out of benefit they got help
from other people for you know
developing the operating system and what
they didn't own was they made it a
business right so they made money of
that by you know sodding commercial sale
of UNIX and this was something that did
not go down well with many people and
this did not go down well with the other
developers and scientists because it was
their effort which contributed to the
growth of UNIX but however they are not
getting any benefit so you know UNIX
because ideally there was making money
out of somebody else's work so that's
what happened in the 1970s okay and then
came the 1980s which was it is more
different
so instead of you know buying you know
UNIX on AT&amp;amp;T and you know having two
different versions of Unix
one was the FreeBSD and the other one
was the PDA TNT version of UNIX so
enough for you to go for them company
started developing their own UNIX so IBM
came up with their own UNIX version
called the AIX Solaris came up with
their own version called the Sun
operating system and HP came up with
their own version of Ewing scoring hp-ux
so there are other versions also like
POSIX and all these things now since
there are many versions right many
flavors and many dialects of the same
UNIX operating system it was becoming a
little problematic because each of the
dialects would be a little different so
the IBM's UNIX would be different from
HP's UNIX and Solaris UNIX or it would
be different from POSIX okay so each of
them would be different but however
they're all based on the same thing so
it was unnecessary or you know confusion
there with so many versions of Unix so
that is when this
person called Richard Stallman came up
with something called as the GNU project
okay so I told you earlier that the
nurse is just a colonel and not an
operating system on its own so what this
person did was you know he came up with
something called as a free software
movement so he wanted something like you
know back in families when everyone
could collaborate and work on the same
one single operating system like that he
tried to bring back that era and this
free software movement office this idea
led to the GNU project so the GNU
project was all about people being able
to access an operating system for free
and you know developing the operating
system so that's what this led to and
that's what we call even today right so
GNU is basically the operating system
and the deluxe is the kernel that powers
the operating system so a combination of
these two is what results in one of the
distributions of Linux so we have
multiple distributions like Ubuntu cent
OS read at debian fedora all these
things so all these things are flavors a
combination of one of the operating
systems and B you know a Linux kernel
okay so that's what they are so this is
what happened in the 1980s and then you
know mid to late nineteen eighties was
when research solvent came into the
picture and he came up with the junior
project where people could develop and
use three operating system so that's
what happened here and the event that
happened after this is wrote as a result
of today's world ok so after that then
in the 1990s
so probably 1991 or 1992 that was when
this person caught in a store was was
still back in college at that time he
put the next kernel source code online
so he was trying to used the POSIX
version with one hardware called 386 and
he thought that it's compatible only
with that hardware and so he put the
source code online for anyone to use and
later they found out that it could be
used with the GNU and that's when the
whole thing gained popularity so that's
when we you know came up with something
called as the Linux plus GNU this whole
term of having a kernel plus this
operating system and you have to work
together so that's what happened here
all right so guys are that's how Linux
was born okay
now without wasting any more time let me
go to the next slide and talk about the
various distributions of Linux so I told
you that there are many versions like
Ubuntu Centaurus also let's talk about
those and
when we talk about distributions the
most important and the most famous ones
are those of red hat enterprise linux
fedora and debian okay so these three
are primarily different companies and on
the prices well debian is basically not
one company it's kind of you know let's
say a group of developers developing
this version of Linux okay this version
of Linux and the Ubuntu version so that
is what Debian is and the Red Hat has
basically an author prize it's a company
that is commercially selling the Linux
distribution okay and it's probably the
most used and most popular of them all
why because they are very stable they
are very reliable and as it's written
your servers and workstations right so
it's the preferred Linux distribution
for servers and workstations there at
that Enterprise Linux so they have a
free version so that's called the
Centaurs and today's demonstration I'll
be showing it to you on send to SMB ok
so they have that and they have various
other distributions in fact even fedora
right that which we are going to talk
about next even in Federer is a company
that's funded by e Red Hat itself so
it's again one of the variations of Red
Hat and Federer has its own set of you
know distributions around it and that's
about the federal distribution then
comes the Debian so this again I spoke
about Debian so Debian is you know the
Linux distribution that is developed
with the help of many developers so this
is not developed for commercial purpose
it's basically free and open source
software and anybody with the skills can
start contributing to this software and
you have many other distributions okay
so these are among the important and the
commercial ones and if you are talking
about some of the free distribution
which people can use then they are able
to linux mint
sent OS open SUSE gen 2 and many more
okay so there are almost hundred Linux
distributions today and you can use any
of them you know if you're getting start
with the nuts then I would suggest you
to either start off with Ubuntu or
CentOS because
CentOS is you know something that's
really reliable and that's really fast
ok and Ubuntu is the most popular Linux
distribution out there ok and so I read
somewhere that you bulldoze a third most
used operating system okay so that's
what we'll two is all about
of course it's not as fast as sent to us
but still able to is you know a very
popular and very handy tool and the Knox
mint is the other
version which can be used for playing
movies and listening to music because
this gives you more of Windows like
interface so that's what Linux Mint is
so we have various distributions like
this and yeah so guys are any doubts I
mean some of you told me that they know
you people are newcomers and haven't
started with Alena so you can start off
with one of these distributions mention
your you can either go for the Red Hat
Enterprise nuts or the fedora or the
Debian or the other operating systems
which are based on them ok so the center
is here it is based on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux okay so the red right
we call them red so they have the free
version that they provide for enterprise
users or is that of centaurs and fedora
again for that matter of fact you know
they have multiple distributions under
them under their name and Debian other
people who are the founders of opal - ok
so open to is a distribution that is
based on Debian and since open - is so
popular there are different versions of
Google - itself right there are other
distributions like X equal to or add one
to all these things and they are the
other versions of Ubuntu so that's about
the different Linux distributions and
you guys can probably you know if you're
newcomers then I would suggest you to go
for a 0.2% OS like I said earlier so it
seems like people are all good okay so
I'm getting a couple of four comments
from people all right great so let me go
to the next slide then ok so now we are
in this light and let's talk about the
features of Lenexa okay so the linux
features you know when we say features
it's basically those compared to the
other operating systems compared to
Windows and compared to Mac okay so
compare to them how does the next
perform and you know what are the
benefits with Linux and first of all we
have this feature of you know the
updates being very easy to be performed
if you have any software in your
operating system or if it's the
operating system itself which you want
to update then it's really easier than
us it's just going to be one command
that you need to run and you know you
can run that command from the terminal
okay for those guys who don't know what
a terminal is so let me just open my
Linux version for you what a terminal is
okay so this is my Centaurs version of
linux alright and then you have
different options here right so the
terminal that you see at this is what I
was talking about
so when you open the terminal there is
no other window that opens okay now this
is the command-line interface so when I
say command-line interface this is where
I cannot put in my commands and I can
get my software or my kernel to listen
to those commands and perform actions by
creating a process for those commands so
the whole benefit of Linux is this CLI
because the CLI is really helpful if you
are going for Windows or something you
have a very good GUI all right so even
in deluxe you have a GUI so let me show
you the GUI aspect so similar to Windows
you can just go to the computer and you
can go to file system you can open
various other folders and directories so
you have multiple directories and
folders you are right
so I mean that trees are basically
folders folders is what you call in
Windows and here you call them
directories so I can go into any of
these you know directories and I can
close them like this I can access any of
these directories I can access any
software or anything that's installed
anywhere so the not basically provides a
GUI - ok but the thing with Linux is
that you also have a terminal right this
terminal is basically a command and
interface where you can you know put in
your commands and you can get the
software to behave the way you want to
you can run certain commands you can
install software you can run programs
you can run codes so that's what we
advantage with the CLI is and this base
the reason why it's very popular among
all these software developers ok so I
told you earlier that software
developers the favorite tool right on us
so that's because Linux is the free
version of UNIX and it's also you know
possible to develop and create so many
programs so that's the thing with the
nuts so that's why it's so popular so
back in the flight I told you that it
was very easy to perform updates right
so those updates can be you know easily
performed by just running a few commands
here you know by writing one single
command I can update a particular
software
supposing I have Java installed in my
system then I can just write a command
for updating that I can just say sudo
yum
update and the package negative Java I
can just put the Java version if it's
any other language or if it's any other
software then I can put that software
name over here and update the
application so that's how simple and
that's how easy you know it is to update
software's over here so I was talking
about this aspect so let me go back to
the slides and talk about the other
features okay
so that was how updates can be easily
performed and then another feature is
that the software is free you don't have
to pay for Linux so because Windows of
course you all know that Windows is paid
you can't you know have a pirated
version if you're caught having a pirate
version you will be fined of course home
you know desktop users and home users
don't really have that problem because
there are no routine checks but
companies cannot use a pirated version
of Windows because if there are audits
they can come and seize the computers
and put our heavy fine on the company so
that's what we save and the free
software licensing is there and then ask
because you don't have to have any
license you can just you know get all
the folks in your company to work on
Linux for free so that's the free
software licensing aspect and then you
have the access to source code right so
when we say access to source code I told
you that back in the seventies people
could just collaborate together and
develop the operating system so that is
what I am talking about here so then at
the source code for running this OS the
basically the Ubuntu or the Centaurs the
source code is available to you and you
can customize it and you can you know
change it the way you want you can make
it behave the way you want to and if
it's really good be sure that you've
added then you can also share your
discoveries and your you know features
with other people with other fellow
developers you can do all these things
so you have complete you know access to
the source code and you have complete
freedom with what your OS can do and how
it behaves but the same thing cannot be
set for Windows right so Windows you
cannot change it completely you don't
get access to the source code at all and
you can't change all the features the
way you want to because that's
proprietary tool and though it's a
program to behave in one way and if you
try changing too many things then your
you know windows will report so that's
what is going to happen so that's about
the access to source code feature and
then we have another feature that has
multiple distributions so I spoke about
the different distribution in the
previous slide
the basic distributions are those of Red
Hat Debian or Fedora right so you have
various versions of them itself you have
different flavors in the Red Hat and we
have different ones in the Debian and
again Fedora has a lot of other
distributions further many distributions
are based on them so you have so many
options and if you don't like we want B
distributions then you can work on
another distribution right so if you
don't like Center is because you know
you don't get support for everything
then you can use Ubuntu okay it is the
most popular operating system and it has
support for almost every application and
every software so you can use that but
if you are unhappy with the speed of
Ubuntu then you can probably switch to
send to s so you have all that
flexibility and all this flexibly
without any cost
okay no cost with respect to energy or
having to learn something new because
all these are the nuts at the end of the
day the commands will be the same almost
98% of commands will be the same there
are just going to be minor differences
in the commands that will be executed in
the different distributions but yeah 98%
of them would be the same you want our
tough for transition time also you will
have you know you can gain so many
benefits by using Linux and the last but
not the least right so this feature is
probably the highlight of Linux so it is
better malware protection
so when we say better malla protection
we say that it's the ultimate okay in
Windows if you people would have noticed
that you need an anti-virus because it's
prone to viruses and attacks and bugs
and all these things so people can
easily hack in your system right so the
same thing cannot you know happen within
the nuts you don't need an anti-virus at
all Genesis completely antivirus free
okay 100 persons you don't need an
anti-virus and in fact you don't even
have an anti-virus but of course it
doesn't mean that you know it's
completely secure also security
something that's really good but it's
developing in Linux but it's definitely
better than Windows right so you can be
sure that no one's going to hack your
system so easily so that's what
Linux is all about so guys that brings
us to the end of this light of nice
features okay and if you guys have you
know any doubts even now about Linux and
how good Knox is then that should have
been clarified and put to rest by now
okay so I am NOT got any question from
Department and if you get have any
doubts please put them in the chat box
and I'll answer them all right okay so
moving on so enough with the theory now
let's read a big let's start with our
hands on okay so I'm going to show you
how to run commands and how to do
various other things with the send to
its operating system okay so first of
all the first part of this hands-on
session is going to be about you know an
introduction to the terminal and the
various commands and the basic commands
and how to browse through the different
directories okay so we use come on like
PWD clear LS and CD commands okay now
let me go to my sent OS okay in case I
forgot to mention it earlier then guys I
am using a VM here okay so I'm running
my Windows operating system on my laptop
and I have a ghost box installed and in
the VirtualBox have instantiated my
Linux virtual machine okay so my Linux
distribution here is centaurs let me
just show you another thing okay so this
is the VirtualBox that I was talking
about this is what I'm running in my
Windows and I have you know multiple
options so I can choose any VM that I
want to so this is the VirtualBox and
all these are the different VMs that we
have in my ghost box so currently I'm
running this VM called master ok and
later on I'll be running on even this VM
called sleep now I'll be doing these two
for showing you how SSH works so I told
you in the agenda slide that I'll you
know get to remote machines to access
each other right so for that purpose I
need these two beams and of course both
are sent to us and yeah as you can see
the information it says that it a little
bit sent over system I've called it or
named it master and this one is named it
as safe so similarly I have the Ubuntu
also so the window 64-bit is this so let
me just turn on Ubuntu and show you how
cool to looks like okay so let this wait
for some time
okay so let me just enter the past for
the user
and here we are this is my boon to OS
right so even this is being hosted on
the same VirtualBox so I am kind of
running to different virtual machines at
the same time okay so we have options to
browse the Internet and I can open the
terminal or the terminal option is right
here in my to operating system okay so I
just want to show you the Ubuntu
operating system so let me just quickly
turn it off and go back to my centaurs
and start running a couple of commands
okay so I was showing you the Centaurs
right so Logan okay so this is my
terminal and first of all the main
difference that you people need to
understand between Windows and Linux is
that in Windows because you know the
storing files or folders it was all in
drives okay so we had C Drive we had a D
Drive we had many more drives like that
and we could store our documents all in
those folders okay but in Linux it's a
little different from how Windows works
in Linux we have something called as the
root directory okay so we have file
system here right so basically whatever
folders or documents or directories you
have everything can be accessed from the
filesystem when I click go on a
filesystem then you have notice that I
got a /ur okay so this forward slash
basically means root okay this means I
am in the root directory and in the root
directory every document and every
folder is present in this root directory
okay
now whether it is mean storing some kind
of you know important files or mp3s or
videos then everything can be accessed
from the root so you can think of this
something like a tree hierarchical
structure okay so you have one root and
all the other branches and all the
leaves and all those things you can
convert them to be the different
directories and the files inside so they
can all be accessed from the root and if
you want me to show you where one not
okay so now this is your desktop right
so you have the different icons here on
each of these icon are four different
operation so you have it records home
and then you have a terminal and you
have an LMS so this is a folder and this
is a document okay so reading is a
document so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to browse to the desktop
folder so from root directory if you go
to this folder called our home right so
under home directory you have other
option you have a trick on using okay so
now if I go to the add record directory
then you have other options of desktop
documents downloads music and all these
things so if I go to desktop then in
this directory you have the files and
the different things are apparent on my
desktop so LMS was a folder that was
present readme this is a file that was
present the terminal was present my
desktop so that is available here so
Eclipse IDE is present here so all this
was present on my desktop so I get the
same thing accessed from here and
similarly if you are downloading
something from the internet then that
can get downloaded to this folder the
Downloads folder right so we have a
Documents folder similarly you have a
videos folder music folder so all these
files or folders will be stored in some
place right so they will be stored in
your slash home slash ed Rekha okay if
you are downloading them and if not if
it's going to be soft as what you're
gonna install then you can install them
in any other dietary or in fact most of
the software's are you install they'll
be by default that get installed in this
directory in the bin directory right so
you have the bin directory you have the
Lib directory which lab will list of all
the different libraries that the OS
would use and then you have the s then
we have all these things right so they
can all be accessed from here and that's
about accessing them from the GUI aspect
okay in the same thing can be done
through the terminal okay now let me go
to my terminal and show you how that is
done
so this is my terminal okay this is a
command-line interface where I cannot
put in my commands and when those
commands are executed by the kernel or
by the shell then program will get a
Twitter and some kind of features will
run all right okay guys so before I get
started let me go back to my slides and
show you what are the different basic
commands that I want to run first of all
okay so as you can see it has nice
provides the C alight to communicate
with the operating system right so that
is a terminal that I showed you the CLI
is called the terminal and the CLI is
basically it's better for tasks which
cannot be performed with the GUI you
know I showed you the concept of for
going to different directories and
different folders right so it was little
stuff I had to go to go through multiple
directories so through the GUI that's
one kind of drawback
you will have to spend a lot of time uh
navigating but with the CLI if you it's
just one command and you can access the
directory that you want to that's the
advantage with the CLI
okay and this is just one basic example
that I am giving you there are many more
advanced concepts and topics which is
not very easy to perform with the help
of a GUI so in those places you can just
use the CLI to perform those tasks and
the CI is also much faster in quite a
few ways okay so that's the advantage
with the CLI and running the commands
basically the first and foremost you
have the PWD okay now this stands for
print working directory okay and what it
does is it displays the current working
directory of the terminal okay then
there is this forward slash and I told
you that the four slash represents the
root directory okay
now let me go to the terminal and show
you these two things so right now we are
in the home directory okay now let me
just type it down let me just put PWD
and when I put PW it prints the current
working directory okay the presently
working directory so that is home slash
ed Rekha now if I go to the computer and
the file system and home and inside this
ed Rekha then what you see here right so
this is the folder that are mastering
through my terminal because the present
working directory is set to this folder
okay now if I want to we know say I want
to change the directory it means I want
to change from this particular
folder to a different folder so there
are other options like desktop folder
and Documents folder right if I want to
move to one of these folders then how
will I do it using the terminal so I'm
just going to show you how that is done
you want to minimize this a little bit
yeah the command for that is CD space
the name of the folder supposing I want
to go to the desktop folder then I can
just put the SK t.o.p alright and when I
put enter then I'm inside this folder so
earlier you had you saw this option
right so this represent the directory
Amin okay I was in fact in the home
directory and right now amoled desktop
directory so desktop is the directory
inside bomb and if I want to you know
let's down the contents in the desktop
then I can run the LS command okay so
when I put LS it basically lists down
the different folders and the different
files are appended and that directory
okay so we have the eclipse we have LMS
which is a folder we have grid me which
is another file we have all these things
okay so let me just go to the Desktop
folder and show you the same okay we
have the terminal we have the LMS which
is a folder and similarly going back to
the terminal if I want to enter this
Linux folder then I can again you know
just say CD and space LMS okay when I do
the Sam inside this folder okay now if I
put LS then I have the list of the
folders or documents are present in this
LMS folder okay
so LS is basically the command to list
down the folders or files in that
directory and yeah CD space the file
name or the directory name would move
you to that particular directory now
that is the same thing that I have
discussed in this slide here also okay
so I spoke about the present working
directory which displays the current
directory that your terminal is in and
then you have the root directory from
where all your directories or folders
are marked right so everything can be
accessed from the root directory so that
is this and then you have something
called as the echo command you have the
su and the sudo commands okay
Adi does something a little advanced so
before I show this let me show you the
clear command let me explain the clear
command okay
now getting back to my terminal when I
type clear the whole
CLI is cleared right my terminal is
clear so whatever command around
previously those are not present anymore
but what happens is those commands they
don't get deleted or something
they are just cool down so as you can
see they are still present here so when
I scroll down what happens is I know it
just makes sure that the other documents
or the other Commander specified earlier
those are all hidden and showed
something new so that's what happens
here okay so that is this now I told you
that you know by giving CD you can go to
the directory or the photo that's the
present working directory right but how
about going back to the previous
directory so basically from arica folder
to go desktop we click on this and then
we entered this folder right so from
this directory by clicking on my lms you
go to a different directory right so you
go in here but using the gy you can just
click on the cross mark here and you can
exit that directory but how about you're
doing that with help of the terminal how
do you do it here so to do that we have
the option called CD space to period
marks period marks for a full stop so
that's what we call it right dot so if
you have two dots after CD this means
you want to navigate to the previous
directory so we are currently in the LMS
and when I have enter and back to the
desktop folder right the desktop
directory now again if I give the same
command again then from a desktop I need
to go back to this at the record
directory correct so there we go
tilde symbol here it represents that we
are in the your home directory okay so
the home directory is basically I can
also access the home directory by just
giving a ceiling and enter okay that I
can do it from any other directory so
let's say I am just doing an LS and I'm
saying directory to downloads ok do WN l
o 80s ok so just you gotta remember to
give the exact name of the folder or the
directory that you want to travel to so
only then it will work otherwise we just
give do W it won't really work ok so
after this if you give enter then you go
to the Downloads folder and do we have
anything inside downloads no we don't
have any other folder or directory under
download so now let's try going to the
home directory from here straight away
ok so I initially told you that by
having two period Damas after you know
CD you go to the previous directory in
that path right so ended of that if I
just give a CD ok and if I go Banta then
I will straight away go to the home
directory and this
with respect to any directory no matter
in which I am in so if I just give CD
then we go to the home directory okay so
that's what the benefit with CD
commander's you can give Siri to move to
any directory okay so I have a question
here from Shashikant and Sasha kaun is
asking me should be absolute CD and LS
every time it seems really complicated
so sure she can't you don't need to
really do that because I was just about
to get to that point okay if you want to
go to a different directory or a
different folder you don't need to give
CD and LS every time okay so L is
basically only for you to figure out or
understand what are the different
directories inside a particular
directory okay so if I know the path
then I can just feed it right away in
one command and enter that directory now
let's say I am currently in the CD
directory so this is CD so this is my
home directory okay now if I click on
desktop and if I click on LMS and then
you have another folder here okay you
have HBase okay now supposing I want to
go to any of these directories from my
terminal then I don't have to put CD
three different times and followed by LS
and then go to those directories I can
just specify this thing in this one
command so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say CD space or since right now
we are in the home directory I need to
give desktop ok now one more thing which
I want to show your people is there is
this option of a tab on your keyboard
right when you give tap then the command
here will be auto filled right the
option will be auto filled so let me
explain that again
so I'm just going to go back so in the
your home directory right so you have
got different options you have desktop
and documents so what I'm going to show
you is by clicking on Siri and space and
then if I just type three or four
characters of desc
okay I want to go to this directory but
I've just typed the SK okay now if I
click on tab then the remaining
characters of that particular option is
already filled okay it gets Auto filled
so that is what the tap would do
budgeting on tap will get out of it so
similarly under desktop you have the
option of elements right so I'll just
put L and if I press tab the remaining
will get out of it correct and inside
the elements you have different that we
saw that the average base we have hive
and all these things
so let me go there and show you what are
the different directories are there so
we have HBase hive MapReduce and Uzi
okay now let's go the terminal again
suppose you want to go to Uzis directory
okay now when I just click on capital oh
and if I click on tab then it kind of
auto fills the directory okay but in
case let's take the example of hi our
HBase over here okay now since both
start with hedge I'm going to type hedge
and if I click on tab that doesn't work
okay it gives me further options of
HBase and I so that is because there are
more than one options for you know
starting with heads right the more than
one folders or directories that start
with it so that's why you're getting
further options that's why it's on
auto-filling but if you see the second
title here is sub B and the second
tackle here is I so if you either give B
and now if you press tab then HBase is
what is going to be picked up okay
because after H and B there's only the
only option is off edge base there is no
other folder that has H B as the first
letters of the name so similarly if i
just type IV and if I do tab then I get
out of it so things like that so since
our drum machine moves towards the HBase
directory I'm just going to say HBase
okay
now inside the HBase I want to go to one
of the deities in here so let's say we
go to advantage based practice okay now
for that if you want to go there then
you just go to give this okay so this is
your complete path to access that
particular folder
I'm gonna go enter then I am in the
advanced HBase practicals module nine
okay so I'm in this particular folder or
this particular directory so that is
what you can do with the help of feeding
of path after see so she can't this was
your doubt right so is it clear okay so
she can says yes all right so see this
was the issue that you had right you had
concerns that you had to put in commands
multiple times multiple times you have
to put CD and LS so that's not needed
right so you can just feed the path if
you know what you can just feed the path
in just one command and you can execute
that so similar to this you have
software's and other you know other
things which can be installed other
programs so they can be executed and run
with just one skill command and it
eliminates a lot of confusion
you eye is really complicated in that
way try to take sort of time and lot of
sexuality and permission is needed but
with the help of the CLI and be terminal
then this job is simpler okay so now if
I want to go back to my home directory
I'm just going to click on CD and put
enter okay so that is this now let me go
back to my slides you just want to close
all these folders okay now going back to
my slides I showed you the print working
directory command and I show you the
route directory and actually the clear
okay so the echo and the pseudo commands
is something that I do not show you but
I also spoke about the LS and the CD
commands right so what I'm going to do
is before I go into details of CD and LS
right I'm going to show you the echo
command and the pseudo user okay now
going back to my terminal the echo
command right so what is the echo
command so what is the echo command echo
command is something that writes its
arguments to standard output so when we
say arguments it means whatever we type
after echo we'll type echo space and
forward by that whatever we write so
that will be specified to standard
output and when you say standard output
it is the output will be displayed by
the CLI so in your terminal whatever
output you get so we'll get specified to
that particular output okay now let me
show you a practical example only then
you will be able to understand that so
let's just clear the screen so another
shortcut to clear the screen is ctrl L
okay if not you can just give the clear
command like this okay this will show
your screen otherwise you can just give
ctrl + L which will again and I'll just
clear the screen keep the keyboard
shortcut okay so I told you that I was
talking about the echo command so when I
say echo and if I go enter then there is
nothing that is displayed
but if I say echo and say hi see what
the output talking so when we execute
this command this was the output that
came back it is high and if I say echo
hi my name is
bargain when I say this then whatever
was specified as arguments right so this
was basically specified as arguments to
this come
so the argument is specified as the
output this is a takeaway from the
definition definition was basically that
whatever the argument is that is a
specified to standard output so that's
what it happens so that's what comes
here so this is one thing and in fact
there is another functionality also now
we were all aware of the concept of four
variables right so we can assign some
kind of value to a variable and we can
also print that without the echo command
now let's say that we have a variable X
okay and let's give it a value 100 okay
so now if I just say echo dollar X then
the value that is stored in this
variable right that we printed because
echo something that is going to print
the argument to standard output okay it
will display the value that is present
over here so if it's just a string then
that will be printed and if it's a
variable that I am specifying then even
that we printed so the difference
between the variable and the string is
this dollar okay now if I just give echo
dollar X then I've set 100 value to X
right so that 100 would be printed here
so I can audio hundred is printed but
the same thing if I give echo X without
the dollar then see what's printed it is
X which is predicted so that is the
difference between the string and a
variable okay so you can now have again
a variable called name or you can have a
variable called garden and you can store
the value of 10 okay but if you want the
batter to be displayed then you go to
append dollar before the variable name
okay so that is about the echo command
and in fact there are lot of advantages
with this command and I will talk about
the other features and the other places
where this is used later during the
session but till then this kind of
introduction is enough for now okay so
going back to the slides what else do I
have
okay so we have the su command correct
so as a test su it is used to switch to
the root user okay so that use Super
User permissions can be used to execute
commands all right and then you have su
username used to switch to a different
user and then you have sudo command
which excuse only that particular
command with the root or superuser
privileges now what these three what
they essentially mean is that you get
what permissions so if I go back to my
terminal so if you guys remember then I
logged into ascend doors with the adraka
user right so that is displayed here
also so it has the edrick act localhost
right so as is the user name of this
account and similarly you have something
called as the root user okay this is my
user and then you have the root user and
what the root user is is the root user
gives you a lot of permissions so that's
like the ultimate super user of this
particular system so basically if there
is any folder that cannot be accessed by
my user ok my user name is Ed Rekha and
if I do not have the pump shion's to
access that particular directory or that
particular folder then we can use the
root user because root has the ultimate
privileges so any command that is
executed with the root user then that
will be executed
ok so because root has all the
privileges it has all the permissions so
that's what the root user is and you
know there are certain functionalities
which need the su user or the root users
or Commission and I will show you all
those things later but for now what we
need to understand is by just giving su
then you can switch to the root user
okay and it ask you the password of
course you want to know what is the
password for your root user and when you
give the password you will be logged in
as a root user so you are not at Eureka
anymore okay and as you can see here you
are root at the rate low close so this
is the hostname and this is my username
okay root so earlier you may notice that
there was a dollar symbol okay but now
it is the hash
so this basically this hash tag
represents that we are inside the root
user and we are accessing they are you
know executing commands as a root user
so that's what it means and if you want
to get out or exit the root user then
you can just type exit and give enter so
now we are back as yourself now we are
going to be executing commands as a
trigger user okay and another thing that
you can do is if you have multiple users
again if you want to switch to one on
the other users then you can also give
the su command and bor switch to the
user supposing the user name is let's
say ABC is the user name then I can just
give su space ABC okay now since I don't
have any user you know a user account
called ABC it will probably throw me an
error or tell me that it does not exist
okay but the point
that you need to notice that if you have
any user then you can just switch to
that user from the terminal by using the
s you cannot okay s your space the name
of the user out so again later during
the section there is a topic about
creating and deleting user so at that
time I will show you how you can switch
to another user from the terminal okay
so let's park the personal for later
because it's a little complicated if I
tell you that right now
so I think I've covered pretty much
everything about su and there is one
other command called pseudo okay so sudo
basically lets you execute a particular
command as a root user so when I give a
sudo and LS then what happens is this
particular command LS command which will
list down all the other directories or
folders in the current working directory
right so this will be executed as a root
user okay
so similarly so earlier I excluded the
su command and I give a password for
that the difference between the two is
that with the help of sudo then only
that particular command will be executed
as a root user but whereas with su then
the entire set of commands after that
will be executed as the root user as you
will be logged in as root user itself so
let me just show to you again so this
was the LS command which are executed as
a pseudo user okay as a pseudo user or
as a root user
but if I just give su and if I give the
password then I enter and I can enter
the same details okay I can put the same
command LS as a root user so basically
the kind of result I get will be the
same okay but it's just the difference
is that the user that will be executing
that particular command so I hope this
clears your doubt okay so I'm just going
to say exit and knock cure the screen
and if I go back to my slides I have
this read out the definition so sudo
basically execute only that particular
command with the root or the superuser
privileges okay and when you give photo
user name you can switch to a different
user and when you give su you can switch
to the root user so that's what I showed
you the differences between the three
you first give su and then it'll ask you
for the password you specify the
password and then you'll be logged in as
root user and then you can execute your
commands you can dispute any numbers
come as you want to and then you can
exit
that particular root access and then
come come out of it and if you want to
execute another command with the root
permission okay and if it's just one
comment which you want execute then you
can just give sudo and then you can put
your command that right so I will talk
about these things later but for now
going into understand is the basics and
these are the basics okay the pvw d the
echo the su commands because all these
things come in handy when you go to the
advanced concepts so going on to the
next slide we have the LS commands here
okay I showed you one command that is
what happens when you just put the LS
command so now there are different
options that you can use along with the
LS right so basically a let's stand for
listing all the contents in the current
working directory
okay and if I go back to my slides right
now we are in the home directory and if
I give Alice here it lists down all the
directories that are present in my home
directory okay so let me scroll the
screen and execute that again LS so
right now we have desktop downloads and
music so these three are some folders we
have document with another folder all
these things are folders and these are
documents okay documents and files so
these are the directories or folders
these are the document or files
so this is what you get when you execute
the LS command now if you go to the
slides then you will notice that you
have certain options that you can type
along with the LS so when you say LS
path then you can now you know probably
list down the list of contents that is
there in that particular path okay let
me go back to the terminal if I say LS
and if I say the path where I want to
listen the contents okay right now I
might be in the home directory okay but
what if I want to list down the contents
that are present in the here desktop
directory then at that time I can use LS
path so what I'll do is I can just put
desktop okay and inside desktop there
are many other photos if you remember
there was one folder called LM s so if I
put LM s okay this is the path right so
I have given LS followed by the path
desktop slash LMS now if I go and talk
then the folders or the directories are
to be present in the
particular directory or this folder will
be displayed to me that is the HBase
hive Map Reduce
you see and ping so that is what LS and
path does now if you go to the slides
there are other options right so these
options they can be also referred to as
Flags
so there is a - followed by one letter
character okay there's one character
here that is L there is a quatre called
a there is another set of scatters your
author so all these are called options
or they are also called as flag we refer
to them as L flag or a flag or author
flag all these things okay now if you
give the L slag what happens is it lists
down all the contents similar to just
giving LS but along with its owner
settings its permissions and the
timestamp so when we say owner settings
permissions and time stamp it is with
respect to the particular folder inside
that directory so let me show you an
example of that so by your giving LS you
have all the different folders that are
present in this root directory okay now
if I give LS - L through the same
directories or same documents are listed
down here but we have additional options
right so we have additional information
so these are the set of permissions that
a particular user has we have different
we have user name and we have the host
name we have the memory size we have the
date the timestamp and all these things
followed by the name of the file so if
you see desktop desktop or something it
was created on this day and this is the
size of it and all these things okay so
it is called the long format I will
explain each of these permissions and
what each of these stands for what one
stands for what is a Drakkar here and
what is it Rekha here I'll explain the
all these things in some more time
because before I explain those things
there are other commands which I want to
show with respect to LS right so in LS
other than LS minus L you have the LS
minus a you have LS also okay so let's
see what happens when we give the a flag
it should ideally show you the list of
all the hidden contents in the specified
directory okay and then if it saw if
you're using the author flag then it
will list down all the contents in that
directory along with its owner correct
so let's try executing LS - a first so
when we give a all the hidden
directories also should be displayed so
as you can see these were
the other folders which were not visible
when I gave this LS because LS this
shows the list of contents that are
available in the GUI right so in the GUI
if you go to network and if you go to
desktop from the GUI aspect you only get
to see these okay so these are the
regular files are not hidden but of
course there are going to be many hidden
and those can be accessed by the
terminal by giving the LS - a command
okay so that is what this help in doing
now if I girls LS and if I use the
author flag now see what happens you
have the author also so instead of
having the user name and the host name
here you have the author of that
particular document so if this is the
particular folder or file order document
then who is the author for that it is a
Drake up because I am the user right so
the author name will be present over
here followed by the size and the
timestamp it was created and all these
things and we get the list of contents
for all the directories or folders which
are present in that particular directory
so that's what LS does okay so guys that
is about the author flag and in case we
want to use a compilation of these flags
and even that as possible so I showed
you earlier that there is this LS - L
flag and then there is the LS - a flag
right so - a displays all the hidden
contents in that directory so I let me
use a combination of them so let me say
LS - L and a since there are two flags
which I want to use then I am just going
to use one - symbol for - two flags so
when I do this then all the hidden
contents will also be displayed along
with their extended long format okay so
those are the different folders or
directories happens in this home
directory of mine okay so that is the
compilation of LS - Ln LS - a so we saw
a combination and again so similarly if
either of those flags if I use the
hyphen s flag then it will sort that
entire list by the size okay and let me
show you an example of that so we use
the LS - la right now if I use s over
here it will sort this entire list of
for directories with the size the higher
the the follow the larger size will be
on top and the one
the smallest size will be at the bottom
so as you can see here it was all
jumbled with this is basically the size
lock right so this is basically for this
size block you are if you see the
previous M and I just ran LS - la then
it was in a different order but since I
ran LS - la and capital S this has
sorted the result in as per the size of
the blocks of the folders
the folder is size is a displayed first
and one with the lowest is a spread last
so that about the LS - s so there is one
more command that I want to show you
which can be executed with the help of
CLS command okay we executed the LS - L
a and s flags right so we executed this
one previously now what if you want to
store these details so whatever the
output here was if you want to store it
into another file how will you do that
we have an option for that okay and that
is this symbol greater than symbol okay
it's called the Direction flag input
output Direction flag and by using this
flag whatever the result or the output
of the command that comes right prior to
this symbol those will be stored in the
file that precedes this symbol so let's
say that you know I want to create a new
file I'm going to create that okay I am
currently in the home directory right so
let's not execute it here what I'm going
to say is that means first change
directory to documents okay now in here
of course I don't think there are any
hidden document 0 so there are no photos
or so what I'm going to do is LS minus l
KS ok and I'm going to run the this
command at the home slash ed rekha
directory ok I'm going to basically run
the same LS so basically the same
results I will run them by you're
specifying this directory and I will be
storing this file inside my new file ok
now let me name that file file1 dot txt
okay now the reason I moved to this
directory is because I can store the
files in this directory okay
had I not moved to the veteran her I
guess executed this LS minor delay s
followed by this direction then what
would have happened is it has created
this new file in my home directory
itself okay so if I give an enter here
there is a new file that would have been
created under my your documents directly
okay now when I run LS inside documents
there was no folder but now let's run LS
so now you can see that there's a new
file is created and that is called file
one dot txt now that is because I used
this direction symbol nothing but the
greater than symbol and when I do this
whatever result that gets generated from
this command right from these options on
these flags those will be stored in a
new file and the file a needs to be
specified over here
okay so that was a wrong commander I
used it's not LS so what I'm going to do
is let me just view that file okay so to
view this particular file or any file we
have to use the VI editor or we have to
use a G edit editor or we can use the
cat command okay
now the most common one is the VI editor
so let's just execute the VI and open
this file from here okay and the reason
that this LS what file did not execute
us because it lists down the files right
and this is a wrong dosage PI did a
mistake by saying LS and by not doing a
directory so I have used VI instead
that's why I did not come but anyways if
I give VI and file name then that file
opens right so the files are created and
this file has the output that was
displayed earlier okay so basically
whatever was generated by the LS and a
Flags of LS so that result instead of
coming in the terminal it got stored in
a different file okay now let's just
exit this VI file and explain the same
thing so what you saw inside this file
file1 dot exe the content is the same as
this one okay so we're on the same
command LS - LS but it is that instead
of getting the output in the terminal we
gave a direction command over here to
save it in a different file and we
stored this file in the home slash at a
record directory okay now supposing if I
want to store this file in the same
directory then even that can be done
okay it's not a big deal so this is the
command right so if I remove the path
over here then what happens is what are
the output gets that gets generated from
this option and this command that will
be sued in the file on dot txt inside my
home directory okay if I am inside the
documents directory right so let me just
go back one part so right now I am
inside the home directory right so here
if I execute that command okay then a
new file will be created with the name
file 1 dot exe and it will have the same
details so I've done that and let's see
what are the contents of that file ok so
it's nice right so you can now bow in
this way whatever output that you have
that you can directly store it into
another file so it's very handy your
command anybody
and the option and I'll talk about more
such advantages like this later okay so
for now I just wanted to show you how
the direction works so getting back to
my slides I think I've shown you how to
work with the LS command and in the
previous slide I showed you the basic
commands with respect to present working
directory and clear directory and the
sudo and the echo commands so I've done
with LS also and now I'm going to show
you how to work with the CD directory so
some of the city directories I showed
you earlier also I showed you how to
switch to a new directory so when you
type CD it will just change the
directory to the home directory okay so
the slash home slash a Drakkar okay note
that is my home directory my home
directory is set to that path so if I go
free it will go to that particular home
directory and similarly if I you know
give even CD and space tilde symbol as
you can see your there even this command
will change the directory to the home
directory okay but however if you give
CD space this slash this will change it
to the root directory so change the
current directly to the root directory
that is because the forward slash here
it represents the route I told you this
number of times earlier okay and if
there's any other path or any other
folder which you want to move to then
you start from the root so you specify
the absolute address right
you start from the root you say slash
and then you put the folder name you
again say slash and then you put the
next folder name so it is similar to
that the first four slash represents the
root directory and the subsequent
slashes are to differentiate between the
different parent and the subdirectories
so that's what they are so this will
change you to the root directory and
then you have the CD - double period
marks okay - period symbols and when you
give the CD space dot right if you give
two dots CD space dot dot then will
change to parent directory so supposing
I'm inside the desktop directory so
desktops parent is home directory right
so it will change me to the home
directory but supposing if I was inside
let's say the family site or that record
or that receipt and if c-span was B then
by running see
space dot dot from the C directory then
it will switch me to the pan directory
which is B so that's what this does and
then we have one row command here that
is CD within me quotation marks we have
some kind of path now this is the useful
at times when your folder name or your
dietary name has two words okay so if
you have towards then if you have a
space in between then the space will be
considered as an argument
okay so terminal reconsider that has an
argument so if you want to switch to a
document in that kind of situation you
know or if you want to switch to a
directory which has a space or a
document which has a space in the middle
so in that situation you can use a
single quotation mark or double
quotation mark okay so it's you know you
also have to comfort to switch to double
quotation marks so I'll explore all
these things and show you okay so first
I will show you the the series tilde
then with the forward slash then with
the dot mark this of course I showed you
earlier also and then I'll show you how
to switch to another folder with gnome
it is having two different names with a
space in the middle so going back to my
route so right now we are inside the
home directory itself so if I give CD -
desktop okay now when here we have my
other directories and if I do CD and LMS
I am inside the LMS directory okay now
from here if I go CD and if I use the
tilde option right then it will switch
me to the root directory so C so the
tilde symbol earlier okay so the circle
a symbol represents a root and since I
set the change directory to traditional
this which implies a root it basically
decodes it as a change directory to the
root directory so when I did that I have
automatically switched to root directory
while over here it was LMS so similarly
if you are in the elements directory and
if you also just press serine right if
you just give this command even this
will switch you to the root directory
so basically CD and CD space tilde they
are both the same but however if you
give CD with the forward slash then it
will switch you to the root directory so
when I just enter as you can see I am in
the root directory so if I go LS over
here I have a list of
directories which I showed you earlier
so in India file system right so yeah
and so inside your file system if you
open this folder then you have the root
directory so inside this directory you
have a home monitor icon this is where
desktop and documents are all pressed as
a subdirectory of for this parent
directory okay so this is the root
directory where everything is stored so
any document or any folder in your in
operating system they can be referred or
they can be accessed from this root
directory okay now going back to the
terminal let me show you an example of
that I've already moved to the root
directory now let me say CD then and
okay we have this so now when I give CD
space belt then it moved me to the bin
folder inside my root directory so I ran
the root directory edit an LS which
listed down the list of folders inside
my root directory these were the options
been boot depth these are all the
different folders and when I said to
change directory to build it shifted me
or it moved me to this particular folder
okay inside the root directory so right
now I am in the bin directory and inside
the bin directory
I ran the LS command which basically
means listening down all the contents
whether its documents or whether it's
folders or directories all those would
be listed down ok so these are the list
of all those contents in the bin
directory okay now that we're in bin let
me go back to my root directory by
giving double dot okay so from bin it
again I go back to my root directory
okay so this four slash represents root
directory like I told you earlier and if
I two LS then I am back to this
directory where we have been boot dev
and EDC home and all these things so now
what I'm going to do is so now that I'm
in the root directory now let me say
change directory to home and inside home
there is a trick I want to go to add
record and edit record let's go to
desktop and then there is LMS okay and
in here if I do LS then lead up the list
of folders here okay now I am going to
change directory to HBase and if I do an
LS over here then you can see that there
one particular folder called advantage
based practicals module nine okay if I
now just say Siri and if I put adv space
HBase then I will not be able to
autofill the option okay
that's because the terminal or the CLI
is not able to recognize this particular
command because it is a space over here
okay so it treats adv as a separate
folder but since it's not able to find
any folder here as a TV that is the
problem okay let me show you where the
GUI what it looks like so we are in the
desktop and inside LMS we have HBase
internet HBase we have advanced database
practical so this was what I was talking
about this particular folder correct
so let me minimize this for you okay
now this is a classic situation of when
you need to use the double quotation
mark or single quotation mark okay now
if I just put the same name like say adv
and edge base then it can auto filter
automatically right so even the addition
mark ends over here so that indicates
that this is another folder that's
present so if I you know just put enter
then it will change my directory to this
particular folder so that is what the
quotation mark does so when I do enter
then I am inside this folder and 2ls I
have the list of photos and directories
inside this are ones edgeways practicals
photo alright guys so now I'm just going
to do a CD to my home directory and I'm
here and that was about the different CD
commands that are available which I want
to show you okay so let me just go back
to my slides now and go to the next
slide I showed you all the different
commands here okay so the next set of
commands I'm going to talk about are
those of for cat grep sort and pipe
commands okay
so let's first go to the next slide and
start off with chat command okay
so when would we use the cat command
nice so it's pretty obvious right from
what it's written here it says when you
are working with files that time you can
use the cat command so the cat command
it is basically used to display the
content of the text files and
net several files into one so what this
means is if I have a particular you know
I our text file so earlier we created
one text file having all the file
permissions right so if I have that kind
of a text file and if I want to display
the content of that extra and then I can
use the cat command I can say cat and if
I give the file name then that content
would be displayed so when I use only
the cat command with one file name it's
very similar to how the VI command works
or how the Nano command books right so
it will display the content in the
terminal itself correct but the
difference with cat command is that with
cat I can listen the content of multiple
files so it's not just one okay I can
have I can even display I can specify
your three different file names and if I
put enter then the content of falls
three five to be displayed in my
terminal the same thing won't happen
with VI so if I say VI then only that
particular files
kourin will be displayed so same thing
with our nano right so let me just go to
the terminal and show you an example of
the cat command
so right now we are in the CD directory
let me just maximize this okay
now clear the screen present working
directory is the home slash head record
directory this is the rome directory and
from here let me go to documents okay if
I do an LS there is this file one dot
txt which I created earlier correct so
this was where the different file
permissions were present right so if I
do cat - file name and if I could enter
then I get the list of the contents of
that particular file so in that file
there are only these three rows because
it was the latest updated the functions
that I specified in the file one dot exe
okay so guys I told you that you can
enter details were filed by using the
direction command right so that is the
greater than symbol so I'm going to use
that kind of a symbol over here and I'll
create a new file by adding details by
using that command okay so initially it
was I use the SS - L but the same I'll
use the chat command itself and say I'm
going to give the direction symbol here
and I've done with that let me give the
remember new file let's save file - dot
txt now when I hit enter the command is
not executed
completely okay so I'm inside this place
where I can enter the text so it's
basically going to create a new file
okay now whatever text I enter here that
will be sold inside this file so let's
say hi my name is warden and if I can't
I can go to the next line and here let's
say
welcome to
the next
tutorial by
Rekha okay now if I want to you know
just add these two lines to this
particular file called file 2 or txt
then I can press control D now okay by
pressing ctrl D I come back to my
command line so what this command
basically does is in this cat command
would Allah created a new file file dot
txt and the text that we entered below
it right this will be entered inside
this text so if I do that file - dot txt
then whatever I typed earlier that got
saved in this file now similarly if you
see the file 1 dot txt the contents are
these ok so this is the content of for
this one and this is the content of this
file now I told you that with the help
of cat command you can display the
content of two different files so let me
show you that option ok I'm going to say
file owned or txt and then I'm going to
say it twice - dot txt so in this way I
am going to basically display two files
cat I am going to display file1 and
file2 when I go enter first the file to
content will be displayed and then the
file to contents or the lines and file
to dot txt will be displayed right so
first these are the permission that are
there in the first file and then this
was what was there in the second file
alright guys now this brings us to
another important concept of how to
append files so c80 basically stands for
concatenated right so that's the most
important option so if you want to
concatenate a particular file with you
know some kind of lines then I show you
how that is done by creating a new file
what I did was I I create a new file
file - dot exe and I concatenated these
lines they took this particular file so
if I just give cat and if I give file 1
dot txt and if I give double marks okay
so double direction marks which is
nothing but the greater than symbol okay
we also call it direction knots so if
you give 500 T X Y and followed by this
if you give file to dot txt then what's
going to happen is whatever contents are
there and file one those will get
appended or can
cata needed to this file to dot txt okay
so in my file dot txt we have these two
lines okay hi my name is Relkin and
welcome to nut stroll by Erica and file
one has these three lines
so basically when I enter now there will
be a file to in which there will be
extra lines okay so let me do a cat file
to rot txt so as you can see initially
when I ran my cat five who got txt over
here
I had only these two lines right but now
after using the bi-directional symbol
okay the direction symbol what has
happened is I have three extra lines so
it says hi my name is Wharton welcome to
Linux tutorial by Rekha after that I
have the permissions which was present
in the previous file okay so that's what
happens here okay in fact exactly four
other nice thanks for pointing that out
human
so Haman you know who's another person
or section he said that there are four
lines in the 500x see actually he is
correct so total eight so this is the
first line and these are the other three
lines so you can also see that from here
okay so the first time when I ran cat
500 txt right I first got total eight
this was the first line and after that I
got the functions okay so this is the
first line and then you have the list of
the other content so when we ran the LS
minus L the total number of entries were
right so that was what the total eight
stands for so these are the four lines
I've got appended to my file - dot txt
okay but however there won't be any
changes to my file one dot txt because I
don't make any changes there so let me
anyway show you that also if you see
here again the contents here are the
same it's only that the file - has got
these four lines extra so that is what
the direction symbol does so these are
the advantages with the cat command
alright so what I'm going to do now is
let me go back to my slides and show you
some more options
okay so we have flags like we have the B
flag the N flag s flag and if I let's
see what each of those stand for okay so
when we use the B flag it's going to add
line numbers to the non blank lines
okay so whichever line there is some X
so those lines are going to be numbered
and when you say minus n then it is used
to add the line numbers to all lines it
doesn't matter with black lines or non
black lines it's just going to add
numbers everywhere line numbers okay and
when you give the s like it is basically
to squeeze all the black lines supposing
you have three blank lines one after the
other then it will squeeze all those
blank lines and it will reduce it okay
so that's what the S does and then the e
flag is going to show you a dollar at
the end of each line so let me go back
to my terminal and show you this option
so first of all let's see the cat file -
dot txt and let me use the flag - n so
this will list the number of lines right
so there are basically four lines from
file 1 and these were the two I had
earlier present so these are the six
lines and total we have in this file -
dot txt okay let me just clear the
screen because it's a little tough to
see everything right so yeah so when I
ran the - n command the file - dot txt
the lines and they're well numbered okay
106 and then we have another black cord
- B flag right - B flag we'll add
numbers to also the non blank lines so
but for that we need to first have
glance lines over here so what we will
do is I'm going to do a chat and do this
and file - dot txt so when I do this I
will be adding lines to this file - dot
txt
okay I'll be appending lines over here
so let me just give one blank line enter
some random text and then under no blank
line and then random text okay so this
is what I am going to just enter or
append to my file - got txt okay you
press ctrl D to exit this and now these
would have been saved to my file - dot
txt so let me just run the same command
again oh sorry I should have ran this
cat file do dot txt okay when I do this
as you can see it starts from here and
these are the other lines that were
appended okay and now if I use the chat
- B flags okay see what happens
only the non blank lines are numbered
right so these lines are not numbered
but if I use the minus end which are
used earlier what it would do is it will
number
in every line so that's the difference
between minus B and the minus n flat
case so n numbers all the lines with
respect to of it being empty or not but
whereas minus B numbers only lines which
are non blank ok so that is this one and
there is another flag which is the - s
flag okay so it's not capital S it is
small s right so when I say minus s then
you get the list of the documents so as
you can see here all the spaces are
squeezed into one seems like there are
no multiple spaces right no multiple
blank lines so what we'll do is let's
edit the file to dot DX C again ok or in
fact let me open it why are the editor
VI editor ok so when I do this these are
the existing ones so when you press
insert or when you press a button or
insert button you can start entering
text details inside this file ok now
right now I'm here let me add multiple
blank lines here ok so as you can see
there are around three blank lines here
one two three four there are four lands
lines and here there are three blank
lines ok now let me press escape ok now
if I go escape ok so now we are an
insert mode so what I do is I'm going to
press escape and then followed by that
if you give : + WQ this would save this
file ok so i have matron is write a
valid line here so it would save that
changes and it would quit the VI editor
mode so if I go vendor so I'm outside
that file so now if you see the cat file
- dot txt then it has additional lines
right so now I'm going to run the
command that I ran earlier cat - a flag
s and then file name so when I do this
all the multiple plans lines are
squeezed into one so as you can see here
there are there have been multiple lines
when I ran the file - dot txt but here
when I ran the cat - not with the S flag
then there are all these multiple
lancing the squeezed into one again so
that is the the
with the cat command okay so I think
with that I think I've covered all the
different options okay there is one left
there is no - the option right so okay
now let me show you what that does so
when you use the capital e flag okay
there's a dollar sign that is appended
after every line so the first line is
total eight or let's say the first line
is this one so there's a dollar sign
here and after this line there's a
dollar sign
after this there's a dollar sign and
still you have land lines you'll only
find the dollar sign here and again
after this one you have a dollar sign
and you know blank lines have dollar
signs and yeah so that's how the 'flag
works okay so every at the end of the
line is appended with the dollar symbol
okay so with this I'm done with all the
chat commands so going back to my slides
now let's go to the next command that is
grip okay so grep command working with
grep command so what does the grep
command do you guys have any idea okay
well I don't expect you people do but
yeah so if people if any of you know if
you have an interruption to Linux then
you can answer it but it's fine if you
don't because I'm going to explain that
it's my duty and the grip command is
basically used to search for a
particular string or a word in a text
file right we have a file document like
the one which we created now like we
have two documents like file 1 dot txt
and fire - row txt and what if you want
to search for a particular string right
or a particular board so in this case
it's pretty simple because you can
easily find them but what if you want to
do it to you know a very big file
documents curve which has like millions
of lines right so supposing you have any
document then you will have multiple
lines right and if you want to find one
particular word or if you want to go to
one particular string then how will it
do it so in Windows you have the control
left option right but via a CLI if you
can't use it writes over a CLI you use
the grep command ok and the format for
executing the command is this so you
specify grep and then you specify the
string that you want to search for so
option is the string that I have surged
in this command and then the file name
ok and this is written the result of the
matching string options so similarly if
you use the I flag then it will return
the results for even case instead
strings so basically if you do not use
the I flag then it is it's case
sensitive right so it will only search
for options with these letters but if
there is a word called options with a
capital o where the first letter is
capitalized then in that case only when
you use ie will even that particular
result be shown okay so that is the
advantage with the I flag and then you
have the N flag which is the grep - n
which will again return the matching
strings along with that line number in
which line was that praying or that word
found so that's what end us and when you
give - V flag then what happens is you
will not be shown the list of lines
where the results were present but
instead you will be shown the list of
four lines where the results were not
found where there was no matching string
right so those lines will be printed
with the help of V flag and then with
the C flag it returns the number of
lines in which the results match the
search ring so supposing you have like
four words okay you have a big document
and your reward your string mult four
times then if you use a minus C flag
then it will display the number four
instead of four displaying the search
string okay so let me go to the VM let
me go to my centers and show you how to
execute these commands okay so right now
we are in the Documents folder if I want
to execute that then we need to edit
this in a different way okay we need to
have a different text and this directory
has these documents right so let me just
quickly go to the Documents folder and
here are if I do an LS we have the two
files which we created we have file dot
txt and file one dot txt so what I'm
going to do is I'm gonna see what's
there in file one dot txt
okay so let me edit this file okay or
let's say let us create a new file what
you say we can create a new file by
doing this right by giving the direction
symbol followed by the name of the file
let's say automobiles Auto Mobile's this
is the name of my file automobile dot
txt and I can start listing down the
automobiles that I want so let's say
car or let's say motorbikes okay we can
say trained well trained staff in order
automobiles but still or let's go into
details of the companies okay let's say
multi let's say Ferrari Lamborghini
these are some of the most famous
companies right so when it comes to by
triopia maja then you have Honda right
you have Sasaki you have
the Korea and name a few more we can add
some older companies like BMW you can
add already we can add Fox Rogen to this
list okay now if I do ctrl D then this
will be the list of content in my
automobile dot txt okay I'll let me a
more clear the screen now and if I do
cat command here then it displays the
list of contents here right
okay now let's use the grep command to
search the content that is present in
this text so i'm going to do a grep and
the string that i want to search for is
let's say 'i am because in lamborghini
we have the search ring GN and even in
yamaha we have the e/m right we are
supposed to get two results for this so
in this case so if I just say grep JM
and if I specify the file name
automobiles or DXE and if I go enter
then I get the two different words right
the two names where this was parent
where am was present okay now if I use
the same thing with the I flag then it
will display the list of files in a case
insensitive fashion but in my file there
is no upper case file I'm going to say
so your thumb will rot dot exe I'm going
to append I'm going to append this word
called amber okay
so amber is another automobile company
and when I do this and if I run the chat
command now okay you will see that along
with these names were there initially
there is Amber has been appended okay
and this time when I search for JM right
so it should not show me this because
even though there is am here
the a is capital here but I am searching
for small it so it's not show me this
result okay I should get the same result
that I got previously so if I do a grip
in like earlier I got the Lamborghini
and Yamaha theory options okay but now
if I
upend this with - I or the I flag so
what happens is I'll get the option of
even amber along with this because it
would search for the string in a case
insensitive fashion okay so this time as
you can see amber is added to this list
because you did not consider case
insensitive words letters okay so that
is about the I fly and there is another
N flag right so let's see what the N
flag does so every time you use the - n
flag then it will list down the line in
which the word was the present so that's
what I mentioned earlier so over here in
line number 6 and 9 number 7 we have
Lamborghini and Yamaha right so the line
number is measured okay now so that's
what the N flag does ok so we have the V
flag and the C flag left so let's
execute them and see what happens so
when I remove N and when I execute V as
you can see all the results except for
Yamaha and for Lamborghini would be
present here ok but if I give - I be ok
which indicates IV flag then even amber
would not be present in the output I
will get now ok when I go to enter as
you can see amber is not present because
amber is part of the case-insensitive
option right Wendy included right this
would be chosen either the source result
and since it's conjured as a search
result we will display only the result
the set of results which were not found
so the other lines which Tex was not
found where these and that's why we got
these options ok now we have one more
flag between you to see and that is the
C flag
and when you enter the sea flag then it
displays the list of the number of times
that string was found so a.m. was found
two times in one sandal a bogey in one
cinema so that's why we got the answer
as to now if I use C with the
combination of I all right I'm going to
get three that's because even Amber will
be considered in this case okay guys so
this is what is there with respect to
the grep command okay so guys do you all
have any doubts okay and if you do have
any doubts please put them in the chat
box because I'll be going to the next
slide then alright and I don't think you
should be having any because of explain
each and every outcome each and every
flag that can be used with grip okay so
if you do have any any other confusion
please put them in the chat box in the
meanwhile let me get back to my
presentation and continue with my next
slide okay so I spoke about the grep
command okay
and now in the next slide let me talk
about the sort command okay so we use
the sort command to sort the results of
a search either alphabetically or
numerically all right and we can sort
either files or file contents or
directories so what this means is
whatever results you get right or I mean
not just results or even if it's the
list of items that is present in
particular electrum when you run an LS
command right you will have a list of
files and the list of folders are there
in that particular directory so we can
sort even those things okay now that
result can be sorted and also we can
sort anything else we can sort the
contents of a file right we can sort the
contents of the file or you know all
these things so that's what this means
so without wasting much time let me just
show you how that is done so you can
just sort and the file that you want to
search alternatively you can also search
two files at the same time by doing 500
txc and Phi 2 dot txt okay so under
under syntax for that is the sort and
the file name okay when you say sort on
the file name then the contents of this
file will be returned in the
alphabetical order okay if you want to
sort two files at the same time then you
can in argument you can just give both
the file names and
we'll sort the contents for both file
one tour txt and 500 th see okay and
again if you want to display them in the
reverse order then you can specify the
our flag and for case-insensitive
sorting you can do the - f flag and then
if you want to sort the results based on
the number in a numerical order then you
can now use the n flag
okay guys so let me first for go to my
terminal and start executing them okay
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
clear my screen and currently let me
just return the contents of this
directory so we have automobiles file we
have file 1 and we have file - when I
just give the sword and press ENTER then
I enter the interactive mode ok so here
I can type all the second type random
words ok I can say JB CD or I can say BC
da or I can say e f e d FG all these
things ok and then when I press control
D it gets me out of the interactive mode
I'm going to exit the interactive mode
the texture I tagged and write the input
that has been sorted so this up till
this line was what I entered as input if
you remember and up till EDF G right so
basically this text has been ordered as
per Raj medical order and since a comes
first natural particular ecology this is
first the BCD a is second and then you
have the other lines ok
this happens all in alphabetical order
now if I give salt with the file name ok
that is a automobiles not exe and if I
go enter then this particular file will
be ordered in the alphabetical order ok
the contents will be listed down in an
alphabetical order let me clear the
screen and show that again so let me
first just do a chat and show you how
the order is ok now let me run the sort
with the filename okay so now if you see
it was in this order initially right so
car was the first option motorbike was
the second train was the next marthy and
then came Ferrari and Lamborghini but if
you look at the sorted result then it's
in the sorted manner right so first con
number then comes April yeah then comes
Rory and then the others so that's what
sorting does okay and the same thing can
be done for two different files at the
same time so this was the automobiles or
txt pulling I want to list down even my
files to contents then I can just type
file to dot txt here and the results of
both the files will be in my terminal
okay but before that let me just clear
the screen so that could be easier for
you to view the results okay so now
clear the screen let me sort these two
files okay so let's the commander sort
and this is what I add previously and
let me add file two to it okay fire two
dot txt now what this would do is the
results of both these files right
automobiles and the file to the results
of those would be sorted in the a
spectacle Nano okay now if I give an
enter as you can see here first
initially you have blank space okay now
what that is because blanks are a head
of sea capital a right this is the as
medical order correct so first comes
blank space then comes a white space and
then come to the characters so once we
are done with those things then we have
amber April yeah already this is the
order in which the files were listed in
the automobiles and right after C D
comes okay now this line is part of the
file one well these are part of
automobiles this was part of file two
dot txt so yeah these results were a
part of the automobiles or txt file the
blank lines here these are part of the
file dot txt and again these two lines
right these are part of file two dot txt
okay so this is what happens when you
give two files as arguments now there
are other options that I want to show
you though so I they were flag like our
flag right so our flag lifts the results
in the reverse order okay
and we want to clear the screen and yeah
for clearly the screen the shortcut is
ctrl L alright guys so let's say sort
automobiles dot txt okay it's cat right
I don't want to do cat I want to do sort
automobile dot txt and I want to use the
flag minus R so when you use my nail art
it will display the result in the
reverse order so we have the reverse
order in which Emma comes first and the
amber comes last
so that is the year reverse order and we
have another flag here the other flag is
the F flag which will return the results
in the case insensitive fashion okay so
that is the minors s and then if you go
back to the slides there is a n option
right so n will return the results in
the numerical order now let me go to my
terminal and let me use the N flag now
but of course I don't think it will sort
anything because there are no numerical
jur so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to use the file to dot txt here okay
file to dot txt okay so there are no
numerical here either what I can do is I
can edit these details so let me go VI
and save file
- dot exe and I'm going to enter the
insert mode I'm going to remove all
these unwanted lines okay so I promote
all the black lines now I'm going to put
one here and I'm going to put two here
I'm going to add three to this line I'm
going to add four to this line okay
all right guys or let's say let's give
the order seven here okay you have two
here okay so there are some kind of
numericals ahead of you know it before
every line starts right so when we run
the - n command now the sort command
with the N flag now then it would sort
these lines with respect to the lines
with the numerical order okay so first
this line would be shown the black line
okay then you would be shown the you
know the total line then you would be
shown the third line and like that so
let me just escape : and save and quit
okay now let me run that same sort
command sort - and five - dot txt so as
you can see the alphabets are first
sorted okay so the lines where there are
text characters or alphabetical letters
so those are displayed and after that
the lines that are formatted after that
are in numerological fashion okay so if
I don't give the N it would be a
different fashion altogether so earlier
the file was just displayed in the
regular numerical order okay so where
one two three four five the numbers came
first and then came the text but since
we ran the - and the vertical letters or
the characters came first okay after
that it was sorted by or numerical
letters so that's what the ends lock
does and that brings us to the end of
the short commands okay so after the
sort command
the next one that we have in line is
that of pipe command okay
so this is referred to as the pipe so
you will find this in your rock in your
keyboards right above the enter button
okay where you have the backward slash
so in that button if you press shift and
if you press a button you will get this
pipe command and what the pipe command
helps you does is it lets you perform
two operations in the same command like
it'll let me search let's take the
example that's specified you're okay we
are using the grip to search for a
particular string from a file and we are
using that and then we are sorting that
result okay so since there are two
operations involved okay one is the sort
and one is the ER search since there are
two operators involved in the same
command we separate the two operations
with the help of the pipe command so
that's what Todd is and as the
definition says the pipe command is used
to output the result of one command as
input to another command okay
the same thing can be said over here
also so we'll first search the file for
a particular string and whatever result
you get that would be given as input to
the sort command over here right so this
saves us time in are not having to
mention the file name after sort again
so we will just be performing one grep
search and then we just whatever result
comes that result will go to the
operation that's performed over here
right so let me just go to the terminal
and show you an example of this I am
going to clear the screen and let's run
the grep command to search for JM from
the automobiles dot txt okay I'm going
to use the pipe command and sort this so
these were the two results right so when
you do a cat command or when you do when
you just run the grep command with a.m.
right so what would happen as we get
these two results because these two
lines or these two words have the a.m.
characters inside right now when you
give the sort it would sort it
alphabetically right and if I if I want
to sort on the other way then I can just
run the same command with the ArcLight
so when I do R then this result will be
sorted in the reverse fashion so iam how
comes first and Lamborghini comes first
so that's how the five command can be
used to get the output from one
operation and read that output as the
input to the next operation
so this is relatively smaller topic okay
and we quite often we be using the pipe
command when you want to use multiple
operations in the same command so that's
about the pipe command okay so let me
just clear the screen and get back to my
presentation and see what's my next
layer all about okay so now that I've
shown you how to sort the content of the
file let's go to the next slide right so
the next section of this tutorial is
going to be about the copy move make
directory remove remove directory and
the user permissions alright so let's
get started with this section okay CP
stands for copy that will be the first
slide that we're gonna talk a lot okay
so as you know copy is basically used to
copy files or directories okay the point
notice files and directories so in
Windows you have the option of
right-clicking on any file or any folder
and you know saying copy or copy paste
or cut paste right that's in Windows and
you can do that even for the GUI in
Linux but how will you do it through the
CLI right to the terminal you specify
this command you specify CP and if you
have any flag you enter the flag and
then you specify the source and the
destination okay so the source is
basically this will be the path of the
folder that you want to copy and this is
the place where you want to copy it to
all right so let's get back to executing
and ensuring your demonstration of this
so I'm going to go back to my terminal
so first of all we're in the documents
directory and let's see what is there in
this directory
okay there are the three files that we
created right there is automobiles or
txt there is a file 1 dot txt and file
who got txt now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to copy the automobile dot txt
and paste it in my desktop ok so let me
just minimize this so this is my desktop
right so right now I don't have the
automobiles or txt but to the terminal
I'm going to run a command which will
copy the automobiles or txt to this
folder ok so I'm just going to minimize
the terminal now or to show you that it
happens ok real time so what I'm going
to do is LS I'm gonna say copy
automobiles what txt this is the source
and the
nationís route home ed Rekha and Enid
Rekha
it's the desk of folder right when I hit
the enter there will be a new
automobiles dot txt file that we traded
over here so as you can see the new file
got created over here and yeah so it's a
very simple command that you can now
execute so you can do the same thing to
even directories and files alright so
what I'm going to do is I'll go to the
home directory and from the home
directory I'm going to go to the desktop
directory and copy the LNS folder right
so the LMS folder is again you know it's
it's a folder this time it's not a file
so last time we copy a file this time I
want to show you how to copy the folder
itself ok I'm going to copy this folder
and paste it somewhere else so let me go
to the terminal CD and I'm going to go
to the desktop here alright so we have
for LMS here so I'm going to say copy
LMS alright so I'm going to remove the
slash from here because I'm going to
copy this folder now and this would make
it the source that would make element
the source and the destination is we
have to put the absolute path you're
right so we got to start from the root
directory and go to Home ed Rekha and
let's say I want to put it in the
documents directory okay so something
that is present in the desktop directory
that is being copied and pasted inside
the documents directory ok so when we go
enter so guys are we are getting an
error here right so it says copy CP
omitting directory LMS can you only
guess why that is the case can all like
understand the meaning of this error
omitting directory don't break a sweat
too much because the meaning is simple
your exists it has is omitted the
directory ok not the reason is so that
is because the CP command
it by default it copies only files ok if
you want to copy directories also then
you go to add another flag called our
flag so let me just quickly go to the
slides and show you the functionality
there ok as you can see here we have the
our flag right so CP minus R it is for
recursive copy and that's for copying
directories also okay and it copies also
hidden files if there are any hidden
files or if you have directories which
you want to copy inside that directory
then it'll it will copy that data itself
so that is the thing because you cannot
copy your directories without the are
flag you can only copy files so that is
the meaning here and we have another
flag called the V flag and that is
verbose well what verbose means is it
print informaiton messages supposing
you're executing a command ok and
supposing the command is going to take
times like it's going to take a good 5
10 seconds then during that time it
would print the status of the system
like supposing it has completed like
step one to step three ok and it's stuck
except for then it would print that
message and as in when staffers
completed you will get a message saying
that's completed and yeah similarly it's
like progress wise it tells you what is
the progress and what are the action
that some is taking and what step is
performing so it just prints such
information messages - we ok ok let's
first start off with the I flag
ok so we have something called as a CP
flag I okay so when you give the I slag
it enters the interactive mode so when
you say interactive mode it is because
at times you might have the files which
will all be already be present in a
particular directory ok
you saw me copy automobiles dot txt once
from documents to desktop ok now if I do
the same operation again if I run the
same command again at that time it will
automatically overwrite the file right
because the file name is the same the
automobiles or TX C's was the one that
is there in My Documents folder and
again even over here on my desktop it is
documents sorry it's automobiles when I
copy then what would happen is that file
would be replaced
ok now in that kind of situation when
you're copying multiple files you might
want to be notified before something
happens right so if you specify
something like the I flag then you will
get an interactive mode so the system
will not take the decision on its own
but instead it will not use any defaults
ok that's what we mean by your on its
own ok so it would you know ask you it
would prompt you for an answer it will
tell you that ok this file already
exists in this directory and do you want
to replace it and then it will give you
an option Y or n Y stands for s en
stands for No
so that's what the CPF and I flagged us
and when you give the N flag it will not
overwrite the file okay because by
default it overrides the file and if you
specify the N flag it will not overwrite
the file but the whole concept here is
it is based on the file name what do the
file name is the same and the file
contents are different okay at that
situation you might want something like
the flag you okay now what the flag do
does is it will update the destination
file only when the source file is
different from the destination file so
by using the n flag you will make sure
that the file is not overwritten okay
but then if you use the u flag you will
have another benefit okay what will
happen when you use the u flag is so
first it would check the file name if
the file names are different then it
would create a new file if in case there
is another file by the same name then it
will check the contents of that file if
the contents of that file and the files
are being copied if they are the same
then it would not get copied and it
would only get copied when the content
is different so at that time we'll have
got two different files with the same
name so that we advantage with the CP
and u flag okay so let's try executing
these options all right so I'm just
going to go back to my terminal here so
first and foremost let's execute the our
flag its capital R so do note that and
then you say enter so the item is copied
so if you go back to your Documents
folder you can see that as a new folder
called elements has been created so this
was initially not present and it's
present now okay now what we'll do is I
will delete this okay I'm going to
minimize this execute the same command
along with the virgo is slide alright so
as you can see the status of the system
was also displayed in the meanwhile even
though I entered my your text somewhere
here
yup it's right here correct so this was
the earlier command that I executed
without the verbose okay here at this
traitor it copied the file ok the LMS
sorry the LMS folder to My Documents
folder modern angles be the information
message also came right so it the
step-by-step process of what all is
being copied can so first this was the
first photo
this was the first subfolder being
copied and after that all the other
files that are being copied each and
every document step by step it is all
let's sit down and we get all those
details here if you give a minus V in
your command so that's what the minus V
does okay so I'm left to show you the I
and ru flags right so what I'm going to
do is let's say I didn't want to clear
the screen now okay I'm gonna remove
this command here and go back to the
Documents folder and show you that the
LMS has been copied okay with the
verbose when I created this folder okay
now what I want to show you is I'm going
to show you copy with the interactive
mode so earlier if you see the desktop
there's already an automobile dot txt
right so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to copy automobiles or txt I'm
going to copy this one again to the
desktop at this time it would you know
I'm going to use an AI flag and it will
not overwrite the existing flag so now
I'm going to say CP automobiles dot txt
to destination is home slash ed rekha
slash all right now I think I'm in the
wrong directories right now okay so I
need to go one path back switch to
documents all right now here I need to
copy the automobiles from here right and
put it in the desktop so
home slash a breakup slash
Desktop okay so I'm going to copy the
automobiles or TXE over here so when I
go enter the automobiles or taxi has
been copied your again so let me just go
back to my desktop and see that even
though I've run the round this comment
two times one now one one earlier and
one now just a couple of seconds back
there has been no duplicate has been
created that's because this file has
been overwritten okay but the one with
the name automobiles has been
overwritten with the latest command so
what I'm going to show you now is I'm
gonna use a nice flag here like I told
you I flag is what gets you into
interactive mode so you will start
interacting with the Linux kernel or the
UNIX shell over here so as it says the
home a Drake our desktop automobile dot
txt it says overwrite do you want to
overwrite this particular file this is
already present if you want to overwrite
if you say why and if you enter then the
file would be overwritten okay but if
you give N and enter then that file
would not be overwritten so if I say and
no and if I enter then that copy would
have failed okay but if I do the same
thing again and if I press Y it would
have over it and the file robin
overwritten so that is what the I flag
is and then you have another option okay
off the ends lag so the N flag what it
does is it does not overwrite the file
by default so for that option I told you
that by default it overrides right so I
also showed you earlier that no
duplicate was created and the existing
file is overwritten supposing you don't
want to do that then you can just use
the N flag which would automatically
indicate and tell the deluxe runtime
engine that not to overwrite this
particular file ok
so you can have any number of files
there so even if the contents are
different here ok so even in case the
new file that's being copied has a
different content ok but it has the same
name then even in that case by
specifying the N file it will not be
overwritten because there is a good
chance that you might have made changes
to the latest file and by copying
another file with the same name to that
same directory then there's a good
chance that you'll be losing out on the
changes that you made right so at that
time you can use the N flag so in fact
let me show you that with an example
what I'm going to do is
right now we are in the documents
directory so I'm going to do a chat and
automobiles ok so these are the contents
here and let me update this ok what I'm
going to add is I'm going to add another
company of another Rob Pike ok let's say
we are adding KTM to that list ok so
when I do ctrl D and exit the
interactive mode and if I do chat
automobiles txt then KTM would be added
over here
okay now this automobiles files in the
documents right now this is the updated
one ok but in the desktop the updated
file is not present ok in the desktop
the file with only this much of content
is there now I'm going to execute the
command with the N flag ok so with the N
flag it's basically indicating that
you're not supposed to overwrite the
file ok so when it says that when it
finds out that automobiles dot txt is a
present over there also in the desktop
also it would turn not copy the file at
all ok so when I go enter and of course
so there is nothing here now if I go to
the desktop ok if I click on automobiles
or txt or you can see that I am KDM is
not present all right but however when I
close it and if I er remove the N flag
right so I remove the slag and execute
it and if I go back to the automobiles
or TX you will find that km is updated
awesome right so that's the power of
this n slide ok so that is the end of
for all the different flags that I was
about to show you from my DVD ok so
additionally there is one other thing
that I want to show you ok now I show
you how to copy from source to
destination okay now you know whatever
you know the path or something and you
want to copy it to your present
directory to where you are currently so
this is basically I'm just teaching you
this option to you know say sometime you
know at times you might want some
shortcuts or some hacks I do not want to
provide the complete path everywhere so
at that situations at that scenarios you
can use this hack and let me explain
that
before I ER execute it in my ear
terminal so what I'm saying is right now
I'm in my desktop and I have only my
automobiles and my readme text files ok
now but in My Documents folder I have
got three other Tech's a 500 X C and Phi
- dot txt okay let's say I just want to
copy the file to a txt what will I do if
I want to copy my file dot txt into my
desktop I'll have to go through my
documents folder then put the CP command
and then enter the file name and then
copy it to this folder right I have to
specify the path of this desktop so
instead of that there is under hike over
there
okay now instead of doing that what I
can do is I can just go to my terminal I
need a first go to the desktop folder
but okay so I'm going to go and step
back I'm going to say it change to
desktop and here yes there is only
automobiles or TXE and there is readme
dot txt now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to run the CP command such that I
copy file from this particular directory
to the current directory okay so the
file - tor txt if you remember that is
present in my document directory right
so I'm going to specify the path to the
document directory and the path to
documents a curious / boom Arica and
documents okay and the file name is r5 -
dot txt okay I want to copy this file
which is under this path to my current
directory
okay in Java having to specify my
complete current directory I can just
give one dot so this one dot represents
the current working directory
okay I'm currently in my desktop and
what this command would do is it would
copy this file into this current
directory okay now when I give enter and
if I go back to my desktop you'll see
that the file - dot txt has been created
okay that's what is it it went to this
path picked up this file and pasted it
in my current director so that's what
this is about
alright so this is what I want to show
you guys this was something additional
which was not there on the slides so I'm
done with that so moving on to the next
slide okay
so next up we have is the move command
okay so the MV like CP stands for copy
the MDEs and so moved
okay and this is the user times when you
want to cut paste something okay this
would when we use copy then the original
copy of that file was also present in
the existing directory and it was
created in another directory right but
if you use the MV command then
so I'm going to basically work like cut
phase where it will remove the content
from the so directory and the only copy
would be present in that destination
directory alright so that means straight
away get started it's not too much of an
explanation needed over here because
it's self-explanatory if you use the I
flag it basically enters into
interactive mode again like before so
the u flag is again the same as what it
was in the copy command it updates the
destination file only when the source
file is different from the destination
file and the mb- V again it would you
know move it would print the system
state ok print the source and the
destination files gets into the
interactive mode where the ok not in
track remote it basically means the
system status will be displayed over
here ok that's what the verbose is all
about so let me go back to my terminal
and show you how this copy is done
alright so let me clear the screen and
currently I'm in my your desktop folder
ok and here I have these files I have
automobiles or txt and read me and file2
ok now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
use the Move command to move file to dot
txt to another destination I'm going to
move it to the LMS right so when I give
the LMS ok this means that this move
command will work such that this file
will be moved to LMS folder ok let me go
enter and go back to my desktop and find
that it's not missing that's because I
run a command over there if I go to LMS
however I will find the file to dot txt
over here all right awesome right so
that's what the MV file does and
supposing I want to you know similar to
copy yeah you can move multiple files at
the same time alright so I can move you
know supposing I go back to my desktop
ok and I will find that there is
automobiles and really suppose I want to
move both of these to the LMS directory
then I can do that also I can just
simply go move I can give automobiles or
TFC and read me dot txt and specify the
destination I can move any other folder
or I can move to any folder is are
moving into LMS folder then I just need
to give
okay but however if I am moving to
another folder then I got to start from
the root say home a Drakkar and from
your let's see I want to go to downloads
okay so downloads if I want to go I'll
give this path algorithm enter and if
you notice both are missing from my
desktop and if I go to my a trake and if
I go to downloads I can find the two
files over here so that's how Simulator
guys so that's the move command and if
you want to see the system status then
you can use the V flag like we use for
CP so a similar log will be generated
and shown if you want to enter
interactive mode then you can use the I
flag alright if you're moving like two
files right at that time you might need
the interactive interactive fight so
similar to copy where if we are moving
to the destinations folder where there's
an already another file with the same
name then at that time you might want to
use the I flag it would ask you whether
you want to override it or not if you
don't want to override it at all then
you can just give the N slack but there
again if you don't want to use the N
flag either then you can use the minus u
flag which would update the destination
file only when the source and the
destination files are different okay so
these are the different flags that can
be used with mV so the basically the
flags that can we use your are the same
as the flag that can be used with the
copy command so guys that's it with the
move command and we can go to the next
slide ok we can go to the next topic but
before that there is one more
functionality that I want to show you
with respect to both copy and move I
actually forgot to show you this aspect
okay now for this let me first show you
the GUI aspect okay all right
I go to my edge Rekha and if you were by
documents you'll find all these three
text files and also my LMS folder right
now whether beat copy or whether beat
move commands I'll show you how to copy
like one file or two files or three
files okay but what do we have like 25
files right so what we have like I mean
just think about this what if you're a
proper Linux user and you and you want
to just transfer all your files of some
particular format right you want to just
transfer it to another folder you want
to take a backup or something of that
what would you do in so if you know you
can do a ctrl K over here and - is all
the files okay or you can choose one off
the other like this but to the CLI how
we do it correct so you have such
problems right so for that you know we
have options also for CLI and those
booked with both CP and move commands so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
show you how that is done so for that
purpose I'm going to first go to my
documents directory I want to make that
my PWD so I just go one back and Here I
am
good documents okay now I'm here so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to clear
the screen so of course for clearing the
screen the shortcut is ctrl L okay if
you guys are forgotten that and I also
mentioned that earlier so ctrl L is the
shortcut for that so yeah we have
automobiles or TX say file1 and file2
and LMS so we have these four files and
one folder there okay now if I want to
move this one of the directory then
there is another option so what I can do
is I can use something for as regular
expressions okay regular expressions is
one topic which I'm going to cover in
detail later during the session but just
because we're in the CP or in the Move
command stage of this demonstration I
wanna continue now I want to show you
this also okay I want to just get
finished with this part so you will get
an idea of what I'm saying when you see
me do this so here we have these four
files so first let's use the copy
command so if I want to copy all the
files you extend the form of a file okay
so they are all in the dot txt format
right so what I can do is I can just do
a CP I can click on dot or rather
astrick dot txt
now what this essentially does is
instead of searching for the txt file by
its name this is fantastic it searches
for all the files with the dot txt okay
which is ending with a dot txt so that's
what this would do and when we say CP
followed by asterisk dot txt it means
copy all the files that are ending with
dot txt so in our case we have
automobiles or txt file 1 dot txt and
file 2 dot txt right so what this
command would do is it would copy these
things and put it in the path where I
suggest you so let's say I want to put
it in another folder ok let me start up
from the root home Arica then here i
think we have you know we have these
options right ok this is the documents
so in the ED rekha we have ok we have
the music folder we have downloads
pictures ok downloads of course I've
already copied something in there so
what I'll do is I'll move that to the
music folder ok so the music directory
so I'm going to say this and give enter
so you're copying has been successful so
if you go back to the music directory
you see that there are three new files
- automobiles the other one is file1 and
the other one is five - okay now the
same thing can be done for even move
right the same way we execute a copy we
can also execute the move command move
is going to completely move it it's more
like cut pacing okay similar to how you
remember from Windows let's move it to
pictures
okay so currently in pictures there is
nothing and then music we have these
three so when I execute the move command
this photo should become empty and they
should all go to the pictures folder all
right so move okay but we have a problem
for that what we need to do is we go to
move to our music folder right so it
would this would probably show an error
so I'm going to first go back or rather
go to music folder okay we are in
documents right so what we're going to
do is a CD music alright and I have my
commands here right so here I'll execute
that move command so it was this one I'm
just going to replace CB with mV okay so
from my music directory if you want to
move all the folders or files which will
have the dot txt format okay all the
files not folders it'll move all the
files with the dot txt format and it
will move it to home slash ed rekha
slash let's move it to pictures what do
you say okay so when I give enter that
would have moved so let's go back to our
folders music there's nothing here this
has been cut pasted to the pictures
directory
alright this is what I'm going to show
you okay this is what I missed showing
you earlier while executing the CD
command but yeah here we are
I have done this and similarly if you
want to go also you know if you are from
the music director and if you want to
move something to the current working
directory even that is possible okay so
another possibility which I would like
to show you is that of going back going
to pictures and then we have all this
year and I'm gonna clear the screen LS
again we have automobiles file one dot
txt and file two dot txt right so we can
do a move command and
so right now we are in the so let me
clear the screen again so I'm going to
do a CD I'm going to clear the screen
and currently I'm going to do an LS so
some of our items are present in
pictures so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move back to music
if I do an LS there's nothing over here
so what I'll do is I say move slash home
slash ed rekha slash pictures dot okay a
strike first dot txt and I want to move
it to the current directory so when I do
this again from the pictures everything
we have moved back to music alright so
that is the other thing that I want to
show you okay so similarly it works for
even the copy command I'm pretty sure
you will understand how it works so I'm
not gonna waste too much time on that
okay I've cured my screen and now let's
start with the next topic okay I'm going
to go back to my slides and yeah the
next topic is make directory commands
okay so the next topic is make directory
okay that's what mkdir stands for make
directory alright
so it's simple again if it's all about
creating a new directory or creating a
new folder okay so to create a new
directory you just specify mkdir and the
path ok the directory path ok that would
create a new subdirectory in that path
ok guys
so currently we are in the documents
right so I'm going to do an LS I have
these many things so I'm going to do a
mkdir and create a new folder over here
so that folder name is going to be lets
say folder 1 ok when I do this on your
folders created so when I do the LS
command again so you can see that the
folder 1 is extra ok it was not there
the previous end that we executed the LS
command ok so that's how you create a
new folder so it's pretty simple now
comes the other question ok I can go
into the folder 1 ok
of course it be nothing inside now what
if I want to create multiple folders ok
and
parent directories let's say something
like I want to create folder one instead
which I want to create a folder to and
Peter for the three is that possible
okay so I'm going to try doing that and
show you if it's possible or not okay so
I'm going to say make directory folder 1
slash folder - ok this would be folder
because I'm already inside folder 1 this
will be 4 2 3 and
4.4 okay so this basically will run the
military command inside folder one and
it will make a retrieve two three and
four now when I give enter these folder
should be created ideally they should be
created okay ideally speaking so let me
just verify everything once and showed
you so it was documents this is a new
folder I created folder one there is
nothing inside okay now from the
terminal if I click enter it says make
directory cannot create dietary folder
two three and four okay because there is
no such file or directory okay do you
all know why that is areas or
specifically can we do it that is
because when we try to enter one
directory it's possible okay then like
in this case we specify just one one
directly right this folder one so it
created the directory once but in this
case there are too many directories that
we need to create okay it's like two
three and four
how can make the rhetoric create so many
folders because this is going to be in
the form of a parent child or a
subdirectory right we are creating 402
inside which there's a folder three
inside which there's a folder for so in
this case mkdir is not enough so this is
when we need to use another flag called
V - V flag that stands for parent okay
let me go to my slides and discover that
aspect once so as you can see here let's
flag called - P ok and what it does is
it creates both a new parent directory
and a subdirectory and it's essentially
used only when you're creating like two
three territories and I mean you're
creating one directory and a couple of
subdirectories under that directory okay
so that's when you use this
alternatively you can also use this - -
patterns all right and if you want to
create one parent directory and multiple
subdirectories inside that directory
then you can use these flower brackets
okay inside the flower brackets you can
have the different folder names okay so
let me just quickly go to the terminal
and show you that aspect so make
directory these were there and now I'm
going to give - P and when I execute
this everything would have been created
so let me do a CD folder - now do an LS
there is a folder three now let me do
this and enter and let me do an LS again
there's a folder for of course here
there would be nothing right so let me
enter this
for the four and here there will be
nothing for the four so that's what I
was talking about okay let me also
verify that once from the download for
the one we created a folder to inside
which is a folder three and there's a
folder for okay guys so this is what we
just created so what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna just go back to my folder one
here okay in fact yeah okay folder one
should be good now I want to show you
executing the same command with the
flower bracket right I told you that
creating a flower bracket will let you
create multiple directories inside that
directory so if I am going to say make
directory folder because it's inside
folder one I can create one here folder
too I can say comma four to three coma
folder for okay and if I close this
flower bracket then these three sub
directories or folders would be created
inside my folder one alright so give an
enter here so I go back to my Gy so I go
inside folder one so initially there was
one folder - okay
that was the photo to which I created
earlier okay now I created photo - all
in small smallest smaller and smaller
here so 4 - 4 - 3 photo was created now
folder this one was created earlier ok
guys so that's how you know you make
directories in fact you can even append
this with a parent say you are supposing
you're now in folder one right you can
say make directory you can say s to put
a slash and then inside this sq folder
these subtitles will be created okay now
if I give enter I know what the problem
here is it is because F 2 is not created
right now correct this is the time when
you go to use the - P command parents
command right so which I showed you
earlier so now that I've used of minus P
so the parent is created and the
children are also created so if I go
back to folder 1 this was F 2 is what I
created recently alright so inside F -
there's be for the twofold threefold for
alright so this is what we can do with
respect to make directory commands
alright so let me close this and go back
to my slides ok and go to the next topic
ok so next up is the rmdir and the RM
commands ok so this is the remove and
this stands for remove directory now
there is a subtle difference between the
two ok now when you say ok the basic
difference between the two is that when
you say remove directory it you only
remove that particular directory but
when you say remove it can also remove
the sub directories or the child
directories inside that one so let me
just go to my terminal and show you how
these are executed
ok
yep I'm on over my terminal so currently
I am in my folder one right so let's go
to folder 2 and then the one LS CD
folder 3 LS CD folder folder for okay of
course is nothing here so what I can do
is come in for the 3 now okay let's
again yes I'm in folder 3 and like if I
want to remove this folder then I can do
a remove directory folder for all right
so when I do this this particular folder
would have been deleted now from folder
to I can again remove photo 3 ok similar
to Hawaii our remote folder for but how
about I go one more path back ok so
right now I'm an LS ok so if I drop PWD
you'll find an amen' folder 1 ok and
when I do an LS I have f2 photo to have
a capital folder - this is where my
photo 3 and folder or 4 is pressed ok so
I have that and then I have 4 - 3 and I
have 4 and 4 now however if I try doing
a remove directory and if I try to
remove folder - right it will not work
it fails because the folder to which
were trying to delete right from inside
folder 1 we are trying to delete the
folder - this is that photo - and inside
this folder - there is another folder
that is folder
3 let me just show it to you once so
that I can remove your confusion so
inside this folder - I have photo 3 ok
and because I am trying to delete this
folder - its own able to delete because
there is already a folder 3 inside this
folder that is the problem with remove
directory so guys I just clear the
screen and now let me just do an LS
again so now I'm going to show you how
to remove these folders I showed you
removing folder for ok so inside this
folder 3 I meant and I removed folder
for ok now I'm going to show you how to
remove multiple folders ok at the same
time now let's say I'm running the same
remove that tree again so I'm going to
say remove folder 2 and when I just
enter it
failed to remove folder 2 because the
directory is not empty
ok do you know what the problem is it's
telling right because the data tree is
not empty not able to delete so because
folder 3 is contained inside folder -
it's not able to delete this folder so
if I want to delete a folder to also
then what I gotta do is you know I got
to first delete the folder 3 and then
delete the folder for so I have to
provide the absolute path of the child
directory ok so I'm going to say remove
directory ok
same like before I'm going to say it
folder 2 / 4 - 3 when I run this command
then my folder 3 will get deleted okay
the child will get deleted but the
parent will still be active folder 2
will be active ok because when I use the
rmdir with folder 2 and photo 3 only for
the 3 will get deleted let me show you
why that's the case now you have enter
when I do an LS for the 2 should be
available see it's photo tool available
but when I do a folder - there is
nothing in here
ok there's nothing in here so if you
want to do that if you want to delete
both the parent and the tiles at the
same time you got to use a - P flag so
let me show you to use a - free PFLAG ok
so I'm just going to make the photo 3
now and I'm going to show you how to use
a P flag so similar to how we use while
creating a folder we got to use the same
remove directory ok rmdir with the - P
and photo - and folder 3 folder 2/3 so
in this case both the folder 2 and the
parent and the child will get deleted
ok enter when I do an LS I don't have a
folder - here ok this one is also
deleted so that's what a - P flag does
now let me just create make a new
directory and what I want to show you is
the verbose okay so I'm going to make
directory so again the the ones which I
deleted to have come up again would have
been created again so I want to show you
the usage of the verbose directory when
I had of be here as for the slides it
said write the verbose so when I add a
we here and when I hit enter okay
awkward and immediately again so as to
actually remove the directory now ok now
when I say removed
Factory and when I try to print the
verbose - PD so it says first it's
deleted the folder 3 okay which is
answer and inside folder - after
deleting that it has come and deleted
folder - ok so that's what this is all
about this is what you know you need to
know about the remove directory commands
now let me just clear the screen so guys
are now let's see how the RM command
works ok now your arm command here and
it says from the slides it can be used
to remove even non empty directories ok
if you use the RM with dr slack and if
we use the R and P flags together then
it removes the non empty you're
decreased including the parent and the
sub directories okay so the one
limitation that we had with the rmdir
command was that we could not remove non
HEPA directories we at first empty them
and then only delete them
ok otherwise we had to specify the
entire path and then you know use the
b-flat to remove all the parents and all
the child subdirectories in that path
right that was the limitation that we
had with remove directory button RM we
don't have a problem because uh let's
see ok in LS we have so many folders ok
so if I try going to f2 ok and I do an
LS your than app three different photos
photo 2 4 3 4 4
ok now if it's an rmdir command it
cannot technically delete this folder
called f2 f2 is basically a non empty
directory inside f2 there are other
directories like folder 2 3 and 4 so let
me just show to you once
so inside f2 we have 3 folders folder 2
4 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 4 so with the are dir command
we cannot definitely remove but with f2
we have a chance removing it ok
that's because we can make use of the
our flag here okay
but however this will also it would read
f2 and its subfolders ok so let me do an
LS and if you can see your initially
under photo 1 we had F 2 and these 3
okay but now we don't have that under F
2 because that will F 2 photo is missing
if I go back to my folder 1 here you
will see that the F 2 is missing over
here - that's because in the remove
right it removed the whole F 2 folder in
spite of
it containing some folders okay and
that's what the our flag does that's the
advantage of using the our flag okay so
if the same thing is we use the art
slack with the V flag then it will print
the status also it's like the verb was
ready to print it will tell you what all
as will delete it and how it has been
deleted so that's the advantage with
using RM / rmdir okay at times this is
more beneficial so I'm going to clear
the screen and getting back to my
presentation I'm done with all the
concepts in this light so let me go on
to the next topic okay so the next topic
is going to be that of working with user
permissions okay it's very important for
a Linux administrator to know what these
user permissions are okay because the
different files will be their different
directories will be there and he has to
determine what kind of access will be
available for which user right so that's
what is the control here so the
different permissions are basically read
write and execute okay R stands for read
W stands for write and execute is X okay
so initially you get this kind of an
output okay you know what
let me go to my terminal and show you
what happens when you run an LS LS LS
minus L command because user permissions
is something which will appear in which
you can control via the LS - L command
right because when you do that all the
different file contents whether it's a
directory or whether it's another file
all those things along with their
permissions will be visible and long
format right so let me go to my terminal
first and go to CD alright now when I do
an LS I have a list of all these
documents okay but however when I do an
LS - L I get it in long format okay so I
get it something like this
so for each folder I have the permission
set so for desktop I have the permission
sets and then I have the other
components okay I'm going to explain
what this entire component what the
entire row means so do not let you get
too complicated first I'm going to
explain only this part okay the first 10
characters if you see here the first 10
chapters of these and I will explain
this part first and then I will explain
this set these three blocks and then
Alex
the remaining blocks okay so getting
back to this first block in my slides
you can see that the first block it
determines what is the file type okay it
is a file or directory type in fact if
that is a directory then it would be
represented by the okay if you have a D
as the first character over here then
that's a directory okay as it says but
it can also be any other thing such a -
like this then it means that it's a
normal file okay but in the first letter
if it's a C then it means that's the
character special file and if there is B
over here in this part of the first
letter and then it's a binary special
file so basically there can be four
different letters over here it can be
either a - or D B or C representing four
different aspects okay
so that is the first information that
you have about that particular file and
then you have three different blocks
okay so the next nine letters I want to
determine the user permissions okay and
those nine are divided into three three
three okay so the first three represent
the user permissions okay the second
block having three rwx
representatives are those of group
permissions and the final block
represents other permissions okay this
means other users now this user is the
actual user who is logged into the
system okay that particular user so this
is the user permissions this is the
group permissions which the user belong
to and what the other group can view and
this is with respect to the other users
okay that's what is meant by this others
so if we have the and the order always
goes by RW x + RW X and here also it BR
W and X okay
so that is the order read write and
execute so if the first three blocks are
all our W and X then it means that the
user has all the three permissions or
the owner of the file or the user as the
read/write and the execute permissions
okay and in this place if there are
three characters right RW and X in this
order it means that the owner or the
user has the permissions to read write
and execute that particular file okay
and if there is RW and X in the next
block then it means that the group has
the read write and execute permissions
on that particular raw file so every
file that's created write it will have a
and it will also have a default group
that it will be assigned to so all the
users a part of that group will have
that read write and execute functions
okay but whereas the last three here it
stands for other user sumption so they
can be multiple users right the same
system can have multiple users one of
course will be the root user the other
will be the owner or you and besides you
there can be any number of future it can
be your friends your colleagues or you
know other people so this others
represents that and if you have a blank
in any place okay so in this case there
is a blank over here in state of W
there's a blank it means that this
others they don't have the right access
they only add the read access and the
execute access all right and similarly
if you go back to the terminal
okay and if you see your take the
example of this particular file desktop
okay Desktop folder is where we were
executing a lot of commands right it is
under the editorial folder so yeah this
was the folder that we are talking about
the desktop right now it's our directory
basically okay that you all agree with
then these three characters represent
that the person who's using it okay
right now the person who is using it
because I am logged in right now and
I've logged in with this username right
sorry for that guys yeah and have logged
in with this username right at raiga
so me being the owner and me being the
user I have the read write and execute
permissions okay but the group that I
belong to okay that group does not have
the read write and execute functions and
the group that this file belongs to now
because this file is either owned or
used by me okay now because I am the
user I have this access and then this
file will also belong to a group right
so whenever you create this file it will
be assigned to that particular user
creating it and it will be assigned to a
default group so we are talking about
that group here okay and that particular
group does not have all three right it
has only the read function and the
execute function it doesn't have the
write permission okay and the same thing
can be said for even the other users so
the other users in that system will be
using that system they will only have
the read and execute access on the
desktop okay but whereas if you take the
example of this file one dot txt
right which I created sometime back
during this session this one if you see
the functions are such that the first
one is a - okay what - technically means
is it's a normal file okay I explained
that - is normal B stands for binary
special file and T stands for character
special file so of course we don't have
those options here we don't have the BNC
options but what you go to understand
this is that this is a normal file and
this is a directory okay whether there
is D so since this is a file the access
for the user is such that I have the
read and write access okay but I can't
execute it the user can't execute it and
when it comes to the group even the
group has the read and write access but
it cannot execute it the other users
however they have only the real axis and
they cannot execute this particular file
right so they cannot execute or they
cannot write this particular file so
that's what these group permissions me
and if you go forward from group
permissions there are more other blocks
right so let's go back to the slides and
see what they stand for so in this slide
let's talk about the next three blocks
okay so the next block is data phone
number okay you have a number over here
and that represents a symbolic links all
right the block after that is the one
that represents the owner name and the 1
followed by that represents the group
name okay so that is with respect to D 3
blocks all right and then after that
comes the file size of the particular
file and then you have the timestamp the
time when the file was created the file
or the folder was created this is the
actual file size of the blocks okay now
that's what the user permissions here
represent so if I quickly go back to the
terminal and show you this is basic the
symbolic link this is the owner name
this is the group name of the file this
is the block size okay and this is all
in kilobytes okay and this is the
timestamp and this is of course the name
of the file right so we have the name of
the file and that file will have first
with the file type then user permissions
then symbolic links then the owner name
then group name then the file size
then comes the timestamp at the end so
that's what the difference file
permissions are the read write and
execute and if you want to modify any of
these file functions then it's also
possible okay now let me go to my slides
and show you how that's possible
let me show you some theory for
okay so first of all if you want to
train the permissions then you can use
the chmod command okay you can use the
chmod command as shown over here and in
order to change the access permission of
both the files and the directories if
you want to change the owner of the
particular file okay since the owner of
that particular file or directory then
you can use the CH own command and then
if you want to change the group
ownership of that file there you can use
the chgrp okay so when you use the chmod
command you got to specify whom are you
referring to are you referring to the
the user are you referring for the group
or are you referring to the other people
okay the other users you got to say that
and then you got to use either a plus
symbol or a minus symbol okay when you
use plus it means that you are adding
these two rights so in this case when
you're saying g plus WX so G stands for
group right so as you can see from this
particular slide G stands for group u
stands for users and others stands for
oh okay
and all stands for a okay so ask for
this if you're using G over here then it
means that you're talking about the
group and you are adding the W that is a
right and the execute function you know
that means you're giving them the W and
the right and the extra functions okay
and after you are specify the file name
so this means it will modify the
functions to this for this particular
file and similarly you can use the equal
to symbol and also the minus symbol so
when you use the equal to symbol then
whatever rights you have industry that
will be overwritten
so when you say chmod u is equal to r WX
and then it doesn't matter what the
previous set of functions we're then the
the previous of afformations will be
replaced by whatever you specify here so
you will be setting that particular user
to have the read write and execute
access for that file okay and then you
can in fact specify if you know you can
set access control for multiple people
you can set it for groups users all at
the same time so in this place this
command will set it for the usual here
we are setting it read write and execute
for users and then after that we are
setting it for the other people okay for
the other users we are removing the
right and the execute axis okay
there are execute permissions so let me
just quickly go to my terminal and show
you that so currently
let's take the example of
pictures okay let's take an example of
this particular folder the user that is
me I have the read write and execute
functions
the group has read and execute only okay
and they of course the other users they
also have only the read and execute now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
chmod I don't want to change my
permissions okay so I would rather
change the permissions that my group has
so I would say it g is equal to read and
W okay so if you see here right now
the group has read and execute okay I
don't want to give them execute so if I
want to remove X it would have to do G
minus R and then have to give comma G
plus W okay but those are two different
arguments right so integers using two
different arguments I can just give an
equal to which would replace this entire
list with the current arguments so
instead of having our own X and replace
ad with R and W read and write okay I'll
give a command and then now we have
others here the other users they have
read and execute again so what I'll do
is I will say Oh - execute because I
want to give others only the read access
okay so in this case when I do this the
X over here that will become - and the -
will become W okay I'll be enabling the
W for them and removing the execute and
for these people I will be removing the
execute and now that I've specified what
are the permissions and what the your
recipients Amaral give the file name so
let's say pictures okay
so I'm going to group the LS minus del
command again and now you can see that
if you go to pictures it's been reset so
the others have only the read access the
others are blank
okay and the group have the read and
write access
and this execute has been taken away
from them so that is with respect to the
read write and execute permissions that
users can have all right so I'm just
going to clear the screen and go back to
my slides so similarly you can change
you in the ownership of certain files
and certain groups okay so if you use a
CH own okay CH change ownership with
that's what it stands for and when I
followed that with the username and the
file name then this particular file will
have a new user or will have a new
and this would be the username okay and
similarly even the group command works
in the same fashion so this is something
that you can always work on and you can
figure it out
alright guys so that brings us to the
end of the third part of our
demonstration okay so we still have a
couple of more topics left but
unfortunately I don't think we'll be

already exceeded the time limit so what
we do is we'll continue the remaining
topics in tomorrow's session okay so in
tomorrow's session we'll talk about
Linux repositories tar files and Raman
variables regular expressions processes
adding users and networking ok
management working it's about SSH so
