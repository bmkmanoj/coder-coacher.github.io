gentlemen my name is Verdun and I'm
super excited to be here on a Drakkar
life with you guys so based on several
requests from various participants in my
previous session we have come up with
this session on DevOps and I have an
exciting project to showcase to you
people today and as evident from the
topic of today's discussion the project
that I'm going to show you is that of an
angular application which is created by
my team and what I'll be doing is I'll
be deploying this angular application by
implementing the develops strategy but
before I go any further I wanna first of
all ask you people a couple of questions
and the first question is do people know
what angular is
you
okay I've got a couple of responses here
everyone who says yes we do and they I
also have a couple of no from a couple
of people I cope in Ryan couple more so
it seems like we have a mixed response
and for some of you who know what it is
and no for the guys who know what it is
don't worry there's gonna be a good
revision what angular is and for the
guys who don't know what that is
then just stick around because I'll give
you a brief introduction to what angular
is and then I'll get started with my
session on DevOps because DevOps is the
highlight right so I'll show you how to
deploy that angular application using
the DevOps strategy so that's what I'm
going to do and yeah if that's the case
I can get started but before I get
started I want to ask one more question
I are you people all aware of for which
DevOps tools to use before deploying any
application or software or you know
probably wonder box tool or the
combination of the different developer
tools that we use for deploying the
application or the software well you
have a hint right in your screen right
so you can see the options that you have
on you know what's displayed your screen
on you can tell me
you
okay so here again have a good number of
responses yeah so it's most of the
answers are Jenkins and then I have
couple of answers saying it's docker
well for deploying we use Jenkins to
build the jobs okay but the actual
deployment can be we can use docker for
the actual deployment right and what I'm
going to do in today's session is I'm
going to use a combination of both these
right so I'm going to use docker for
deploying my application and I'm going
to use Jenkins to automate this whole
process of continuously deploying the
application so it's going to be a
combination of both Jenkins and docker
for country's deployment and I'm going
to use git to basically pull my code
from my repository right so I'm going to
pull it from there and my Jenkins is
going to be the person that is going to
get that they get they get the code from
the gate and it's gonna build docker
containers right it's going to build the
ocker images and spin containers out of
that so yeah these would be the two most
popular tools that I'm going to talk
about and that's what I'm going to show
you in today's project of mine and guys
if you get any doubts during the session
you can raise them by putting them in
the comment box and either my team or I
will myself answer that for you so just
sit back relax and enjoy your drink
alive for the next thirty minutes to
learn how the different DevOps tools are
orchestrated together to achieve
continuous automation and how that is
implemented in the industry right so the
first topic that I'm going to talk about
today is what is angular and after I
talk about angular and give you an
introduction I'm going to talk about
what is DevOps right so this is gonna be
very brief I'll quickly talk about these
two things and then I'm going to go to
the third topic which is the different
DevOps tools and techniques to achieve
continuous deployment because this is
the highlight of today's session I will
be spending a lot of time on this slide
and on the final slide which is
continued rising an angular application
that DevOps wave and the devoxx wave
basically includes a combination of
these three tools get Jenkins and docker
alright guys so enough talk let me get
started with my first topic and that is
what is angular so angular is an open
source client-side framework for
deploying single page web applications
right and
the key word that you need to note here
is single page applications and that's
acronym as SP a there are quite a few
technologies for developing single page
applications so anger is a very popular
one react.js is another popular
technology similarly vue.js and we have
a couple more and well the thing that
you gotta ask me here is why single page
applications right so you might ask why
are we why am I having a demo on single
page applications right well the answer
for that is because single page
applications are the way forward they
are more effective and they are raw
easier to build and they come with a lot
of other benefits that that I of course
can't mention in today's session because
they'll get too detailed but I do have a
couple of been a benefit you have that
I've mentioned on the slide and you can
see that on a screen now and the biggest
reason though and the most important
factor is single page applications which
are you know created by technologies
like angular and the other JavaScript
technologies these applications are
really fast and they are fast because
while accessing any web page which is
developed in angular or such
technologies that time your browser will
fully render the entire do em in one
single time and later on it only
modifies that view or the content
displayed to you when you interact with
that web page right and even these
modifications will be done by the
JavaScript which runs in the background
and yeah you can see an example of an SP
architecture over here right so you have
so any anywhere basically any web
application which is developed you know
with the help of angle alright so they
will be called single page applications
and they'll have three different
components first of all or well let's
not say three components in my example
it's three conference but general
they'll have different components and
the competence that you can expect there
to be or those of a navigation bar where
you can switch from one one tab to
another tab then you'll have a side bar
right again you can filter down to
different options that you want to be
your displayed and then of course you'll
have content you'll have a content bar
right so similar to how we have a
sidebar you'll have another component
called the content which will be the
actual display so whatever you're
actually viewing on your you know on
your web page that will be displayed
over here and
what is displayed here can be controlled
from here by clicking on the different
information or you can also control that
by switching or clicking on a different
option in the navigation bar or in the
sidebar so you can switch you can switch
the view like that and when when you do
it this way your browser will not take
too much time to fetch the information
from the server because the entire dawn
will be finished at one go so that's the
big benefit with single page
applications and especially angular
implements you know angled is used for
developing single page applications
that's why it's the way forward and it's
really popular and it's so you know the
technology is really coming up so my
team has developed developed a single
page application using angular and
that's what I'm going to deploy to it
right now let me quickly go to the next
slide and talk about what is DevOps
you're right I'm sure everyone here
knows what DevOps is it's a software
development approach which involves
continuous development continuous
testing continuous integration
continuous deployment and continuous
monitoring of the software throughout
its development lifecycle
well I've mentioned this numerous times
in my various sessions and I expected to
know this ok but what I what you might
not know is which of these tools are
used for continuous deployment right so
on a higher level I can see that docker
is the most important tool for achieving
continuous deployment ok but as you can
see on the screen I will also be showing
the act of continuous development and
continuous integration in today's
session so continuous development is
achieved with the implementation of git
and github continuous integration is
achieved with the implementation of
jenkins and continuous deployment is
achieved with the implementation of
docker well using github you can pull
the code from the repository right and
then using jenkins we can deploy that
code to the production environment or
the servers or virtual machines
whichever suits you and then finally we
can make use of docker to continue rise
those deployments so that's how the
different the ops tools are you see here
you get Jenkins and docker that's how
they can be orchestrated to achieve you
know automation and you know for
software development so that's how
things go and in my angular application
I'm going to use these three tools right
these three drops tools now moving onto
the next slide
now this slide which is all about
deploying an angular application this is
the most interesting slide and today's
is our session and you can ask me why
and the reason for that is you know the
reason it's interesting is because we
are using docker majorly right we are
putting all the code from gate and then
we are using Jenkins were integrated
into docker and we are creating multiple
containers by using docker but you know
at this point of N I would also ask
another question I want to ask you
people if you know what docker does what
are its benefits and how it solves the
developer and the operations problem
right so how it eliminates the salos
between the developers and the operation
engineers can anyone tell me that
because I want to know first of all if
people know what it is cause it'd be
easier for you to relate to what I'm
saying and that would also be easier for
me to you know explain it
you
very good I have got a couple of posts
Sparta's yeah and you know I'm glad you
will know what Daka does because
basically docker container Isis
application along with all its
dependencies right and on misuk
container Isis it means that we are
packaging the code of the application
along with all the required packages and
dependencies in a lightweight manner
which is not too heavy on the server on
which we are deploying the application
tool right so and the best part with
these docker containers are that they
can be run on any operating system
irrespective of the one it was built on
well what that means is I can
containerize any application in my case
well let's say in my case I have the
angular application right but before I
okay now tell me what kind of
dependencies will my angular application
up for those of you who told me that you
know you've you know what angular is and
you vote on angler so you people can
tell me what kind of dependencies my
angular application will have can I get
an answer
you
okay no response yet but anyways guys
you see the dependency that your angular
application would primarily need are
those of node.js node package manager
with this again sync you know acronym
does NPM and of course the package dot
JSON file right so node.js is basically
going to be the back end for your
angular application NPM is going to
install an angular application and
maintain all its dependencies and the
versions of those dependencies and the
package dot JSON file is again the most
important file right because it's going
to contain details about your project
about what what dependencies
dependencies are needed and what
versions of dependencies are needed all
these things will be present in your
package dot JSON file so basically these
three files will be the dependencies and
in my case what I can do with help of
container is that you know I can have a
container I can install all these
dependencies I can place them all
together and I can simply you know you
know without having an operating system
that's actually powering it you know I
can package all these things into this
particular container and I can just you
know share it with other people and what
the other people have to do is there is
have to you know run the container and
they can just boot it with the help of
any operating system right so that's the
benefit with containers so developers
can containerize any app that's created
in a Mac operating system and probably
they can upload that container or image
to docker hub and someone in a remote
location can download that docker image
and you know spin a container out of it
while the the person who that's remotely
located while he is having a different
operating system so the guy who built
the application right who sorry who
built the docker image he could have
been he could have done it using a
different operating system and the guy
who was actually running the container
at you know a remote location he can
have a different operating system so
that's the big benefit so you guys are
getting the advantage that lies here
right with help of docker and with the
help of continue rising all your
applications and dependencies - the
actual operating system
you
okay so anyways I think it's time to
move on and now I've reached my
demonstration aspect right so now that
I've told you what exactly is what I'm
gonna do right that's gonna be the
architecture of how I'm going to deploy
my angular application now that you know
it I'm gonna start with my demonstration
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do it
with the help of continuous deployment
using Jenkins and docker and we will
also use github from there we will be
pulling the code right so let me first
of all open my virtual machine for that
so guys please tell me if you can hear
my if you can see my screen yo this is
my virtual machine that I've opened now
you
okay fine great so first of all to
achieve this continuous deployment like
I told you
Jenkins is the broker right so Jenkins
is the one that pulls the Gir the code
from the repository and that is what
which is going to help us build docker
images and spin containers out of those
images so what have to do is have to
first of all open my web browser and
launch my Jenkins Jenkins is a dashboard
right so Jenkins is by default hosted on
port number 80 ad so let me just launch
that particular web you know launch that
port number on my localhost
sorry for the delay guys it's you know
lagging a little bit right so this is
the port number where Jenkins is hosted
now in the meanwhile let me just quickly
go to my your terminal and to my project
folder where my actual application is
present so here's the terminal and my
project is present in this folder I've
created a demo folder inside which
there's a top movies right so the top
movies is the project which I created
the project folder and what you see here
these are the different files and
folders present inside this project
folder
let me also open it to my file explorer
here and explain what these different
packages files and folders are for so
this is the project that I created and
as you can see there are a number of
files oh and the number one file that I
want to talk about is that of a docker
file right now the docker file is
basically used to build your docker
images and spend containers or of those
docker images right and to build your
docker images you specify the commands
inside the docker file right and then
you just you know execute that docker
image which is built by issuing the
drunk command that time your docker
container would be spun and that time
your container would be ready and your
application would be hosted on a
particular port number and then it would
be put to a it would be mapped to a
particular port on your localhost
so all these functionalities are done
with the help of docker file ok now but
that is only with respect to docker and
the other things your the other folders
and the files are you see here these are
with respect to my angular application
so we have different files like the
packaged or decent file we have no
underscore modules we have we have SRC
folder so all these things well first of
all let me talk about the package dot
JSON file right now this package or
decent file is a very important file
which contains all the details about my
project it contains which version of
which dependent which dependencies my
project needs words the name of my
project what versions of dependencies my
your project needs to implement all
these details will be present inside my
package dot Jason file so without the
package or jason file your application
cannot get also it's you know for those
of you who are new you can conjure this
to be like the metadata right if we will
know what is a metadata so package or
Jason does a similar role right
but here comes the question how will the
package.json file be initiated right
from how do you execute the package or
JSON file what's the first step and
that's where this whole node underscore
modules folder comes into the picture
right so you have a command called NPM
install right so NPM install is nothing
but the NPM stands for node package
manager right so it installs all the
dependencies that your project needs and
when you were run the command NPM
install through your terminal so at that
time it will look for the package to a
JSON file in that particular directory
so I have to execute the NPM install
from the directory where my package or
JSON file is present from here if I
execute that command that time it would
first fall initiate the package or JSON
file and whatever dependencies are
present over here for my project for my
code all those would be installed and
downloaded and install from from the
node repository right in my case would
be no no repository but yeah otherwise
you just download it from the internet
and you would have it already and all
those dependencies would be present
inside this folder called node
underscore modules right and this this
folder node underscore modules is going
to be a very heavy folder right there's
going to be a lot of contents here so
it's ideal that you know you don't place
it in the github if you want to share
your project with someone else you add
you in the real world environment what
happens is you just share the package or
JSON file and when they do the NPM
install that time they would you know
automatically get all the dependencies
installed as per the package or JSON
file whatever specified you so that's
what it does and then you have other
files here right now the configuration
files like protractor or configuration
file you have the typescript
configuration file the typescript lint
configuration file and you have the
other other files or so
all these so you know excuse me one or
advice yeah so guys all these
configuration files are the
configuration for your angular
applications right beat the typescript
configuration or the linting
configuration of the protractor all
these can be considered you know
basically these are of the boiler plates
that come with the act
angular application so that's so these
are dependencies right so you needed
with your project and the folder SRC so
this is where your actual project will
be present so whatever code you've
written for your angular application
that would be present here so yeah these
are basically the contents of my
repository and these are what is needed
for container izing my your angular
application and maybe you would find you
know you i've not explained this folder
right eetu e so this one basically you
know is used for you know the end-to-end
testing so whatever is needed for that
its present in this package of but yeah
on a high level this is what you need to
know these are the packages and the
first thing that I got to do is to to to
containerize this application the first
thing after do is I have to pull the
code from my github repository and I
will do that with the help of Jenkins
alright so even though I have it locally
in a real world environment developers
or you know engineers would we would
pull this code from github right so I
will show you how that happens by first
of all going through my Jenkins
dashboard here this is my dashboard I
already have a project called demo so
this is the one that I want to show you
a demonstration of so this contains I
have already pre-built the environment
so that I don't waste much time and you
know downloading everything and you know
because downloading everything and
installing everything would take a lot
of time so if I have the uh Naaman ready
I can just show to you straight away so
I have it over here and if I go to
configure I can show you what are the
elements that have defined already so
let's just wait for this to come up for
a minute
you
okay San is asking where can I get this
software San if you're talking about
Jenkins then you can just it's it's open
tools right so even if it's docker or
get all three are open source so you can
just download from download them from
the internet and in fact I can I will
give you a couple of links of you know
blog links which people from Edo Rica
have written for you to install these
for you to install these so all these
technologies right so we have an
installation Paris for each of these and
do wait till the end of the sessions
where I can share that playlist the blog
list with you right so we also have a
video playlist of the installation and
we also have a blog playlist so I will
do that but please bear till the bear
with me until the end of the session and
do it then but getting back well yeah
first of all we have to go under the
source code management right so this is
where you need to first of all enter the
github repository from where you want to
pull your code right now let me just
open this repository and show you what
I'm going to pull it's basically the
same content that is there in my local
host in my in my host system right so
whatever whatever you saw here at the
file explorer most of the contents over
here are there in my github repository
except for the node modules because this
gets installed automatically when you
run the package or JSON file
yeah so you guys see this right so we
had the same e to e folder we have the
SRC folder and then we have various
other files like the angular CLI Jason
we have the docker ignore we have the
docker file that's present and I'm
surprised I didn't get any question from
any people asking why the docker file is
present inside the github repository
well I found it strange because the
moment you people would have seen it
I expected you people to ask me a
question but anyways the reason I have
the docker file inside the the get up
repository is because wherever my code
is present right so that's where my
execution should ideally happen and if I
have my talk--i file present in the same
directory then I can run my daugher file
I can use my daugher file to build my
docker image inside that repository and
it will also look for the dependencies
on the angular code for my application
all these things from the same
repository so that's why I have the daka
file in the same repository right so
that's what doc file is used for and
then suddenly we have the other
dependencies like the package dot jason
the UTS conflict goat or jason the other
things which i spoke about which was
there or here so the same thing we have
in our github repository so getting back
to our raw jenkins we first of all
specify that we want to pull the code
from here and what we do next is we can
go down to the build option so under
build we have our shell here right so
whatever commands you specify here they
would be executed on your shell so since
I am using a Linux system have chosen to
execute these commands on my exit on my
shell well in case you guys are
executing it at your end you know if
you're using a Windows system you might
probably want to choose windows batch
commander and then specify the commands
that you want to run in your windows CLI
right so that's the only difference but
yeah whatever commands I specify here
they will be run on my inner shell and
the command and I'm first of all running
is that of docker build and I'm building
the image called the demo app one so
right now I'm using the talkable - tea
black tea command to build a new image
called a demo app one and it would build
this application based on the docker
file which is present in this folder so
this is the fold of M into aquifers
present right so
I can you know in case I do a CD and if
I give this folder then I would move to
that particular directory and then I can
just simply replace this path with a dot
so that's another alternative but yeah
otherwise you can specify the entire
absolute path also here and so I've done
that and it's basically creating a new
image based on the dockerfile
and the instructions present inside the
docker file in this command and then in
the second command is the docker run
command okay so the imager was created
your demo app one so that that image is
basically being run okay you spin down
an image into a container by running
this command docker run and you specify
other options while doing this you know
we specify your flat flag RM we specify
single flag copy and then we specify the
port numbers so the the P flag is used
for mapping your docker containers are
put to your host machines port so over
here the photo double zero that you see
here this is the port number of my yaar
host machine on which the subsequent or
the equivalent port on which meant of a
container right so whatever is basically
President might offer container with the
port number whatever is hosted there
that would be visible inside my photo
double zero port in my your host system
okay so yeah it's an angular application
right it's a web application so what you
have to do is you have to host that and
one of the ports and I have C by default
and your applications are hosted on port
number photo double zero and I've also
specified the same in the package dot
Dixon file so that's where you specify
the power the port number and what I'm
saying here is whatever is running
inside my docker container in port
number four to double zero that should
also be visible or available in the pod
number four root of zero of my host
machine so that's what the flag ER
stands for and then we have the name of
giving I'm giving this you know
container which I'm building I'm giving
it a name top movies one and yeah this
basically the image same image that we
are first of all spinning with a helper
for block a file so these are the two
commands that I'll be running and at
this point of time if there are any any
of you who are new to Jenkins or you are
if you're new docker if you execute the
same commands from your you know execute
shell you might have a problem
so can you can anyone can any of you
guess what that problem might be right
so I can give you a hint the problem
would lie over here okay so it would lie
right at the beginning of this command
you
oh well no problem of see the thing is
any darker command that has to be run it
has to be run with the pseudo axis right
only a root user can only the root can
execute any doctor come and especially
the build and the run command okay but
there are some few commands which can be
executed without the pseudo but these
two commands especially neat pseudo
access if you are excluding the cm2
commands from your terminal then you can
just simply you know prefix this whole
command with pseudo here and then the
shell would prompt you for the password
and then you can enter the password but
what would you do in case of Jenkins
right so this is Jenkins you cannot you
know put sudo here because Jenkins
cannot manually enter the password for
root access right
so root credentials Jenkins doesn't have
so in this case what you need to do is
you have to give the slow credentials or
the you know root credentials to Jenkins
itself so Jenkins is actually a user if
you guys notice if you go under you know
if you if you you know or let me just
tell you this Jenkins is a separate user
because it's a web server right and any
commands that you execute through
Jenkins it would be executed as the user
Jenkins so what you have to do is
similar to how you I know users you know
you execute doctor commands without sudo
how you create a new docker group and
you add your user the user from which
you're executing you add that user to
the group similar to that you have to
add your Jenkins user to the docker
group and you should give the docker
group the root access
so the docker group would basically be
on par with root in terms of the access
that it has over the system so that's
the important step that you need to do
because otherwise if you don't enable
this axis then your current your command
as I'm gonna get executed it would say
failure permission denied so that's the
thing and yeah if you have these two
already then it's pretty much ready
right your docker file would be your you
know used to build the image and then
that image should be used to get the
container out so I'm just going to save
this and quickly show you how to build
this application okay so to build the
application we can simply go to build
now right you can see the build history
or these are the previous times I ran
the same command and if I do it again
bill now
just build a sherry old and you would
see a new build pop up over here but
number two dwell right so if I click on
this and if I go to console output over
here you would get to see what is the
status of this build so let me just go
here yeah if you go to contour output
you will get to see what's happening so
similar to the output that you get on
your terminal something that that you
will get over here okay we're here
already so let me just quickly go up as
you can see the faucet of commands have
started executing using your you know by
Jenkins and you know the first of course
the first one was to pull the data the
code from get right and there from the
git repository so whatever was there is
being fetched over here and then the
first command that we are executing on
the shell can be differentiated with
this command the plus symbol basically
indicates that it's command that's being
executed on the on the command prompt
so the comma the docker build - T demo
app is the command that's being built
and when you build it you can see that
there are various steps being performed
so for each line in your docker file
there will be your step that will be
performed now let me quickly go to the
daka file and explain what are the
different steps that are going to be
performed okay so at this point of time
I'm going to go back here and let me
open the door file and explain the
different steps because if we want to
host a node you know if you want to host
an angular application we have to first
of all build a pull a node image write
your angular application would be
present or you know it would be a hosted
to only with only when there's a node
application which is running at the back
end so the first command that is from
it's gonna pull the node image which has
the tag six right so version number six
of fir node so probably this is what is
going to get pulled with the help of
from node six and when it pulls then
what are you going to do is you have to
use a run command to make a directory
inside this particular image so you use
the - P flat to specify the path that
you want to create slash user slash
SRC / app so you're creating this
particular path inside your docker image
which you've pulled and
you're training the working directory to
the path that you created by using this
command working walk dir and this and
the first thing that you got to do that
you need to notice here is is the
package or jacent file which this is are
present in my local system that I'm
moving to my path which I created inside
my pocket image now that is because this
is the file that contains all the
dependencies or uh needed to to to
basically download all the node under
node node modules right so whatever
dependencies are are there inside the
node modules they will be downloaded
with the help of package for Jason so
right now it's present in my local
system I'm specifying that I'm
specifying docker to copy this file into
the directory path here and then when
you're when once you've done that it
asked me to run the NPM cache clean now
with your you know running the NPM
install for the first time or if you are
using NPM with first time you might not
need it but since I've run this command
earlier and using it because I want to
avoid any version conflicts between the
different dependencies right so
dependencies can be offered of different
versions of angular 2 version or angular
version and all those so I'm just using
this two different to work to you know
keep myself healthy there and then i'm
using the run npm install so this is the
most important command which would
basically start everything so the NPM is
the node package manager and when I the
moment I in issued this command my
package dot JSON file would be surged
for and when it's located the commands
there the dependencies which are there
inside those will be created inside a
docker raw modules right
sorry node modules inside that folder
everything would be created so that's
what this command does and the next
command is all about copying every
single fired folder which is present
inside my you know instead of my host
directory that I'm copying it into my
host folder so the other you know files
that are are those of configuration
files which I spoke about earlier the
the typescript configuration file the
typescript lint file so all those
applications that will also be copied to
this image inside my talk you know to
this path and said my docker image and
then I'm finally saying expose for for
to double zero because this is the port
on which my
application would be hosted and then I'm
finishing it off with by your specifying
this command of NPM start so you do the
NPM install here so at this point of
time your dependencies are ready
everything is ready to be your
application is ready to be deployed and
hosted and the start is what is going to
actually do the hosting on to this port
number four to double zero right so
that's what that the dockerfile
instructions are and the same
instructions have been running on my
Jenkins so it says step one of nine it's
pulling from here and it's moving to
this directory and it's you know
creating a new directory moving the
working directory to this and then
copying the package so each and every
step is being executed one after the
other if any of them fail then you would
have a notification saying this step
failed and the check your command so all
those videos but anyways since Oz's are
successfully built this is the ID of my
image which was generated right and yeah
this is the tag has been added to it and
the next command that's being run from
my shell is the docker run command with
the - - RM flag and the P flag right the
same command which I explained earlier
and when this command is executed it
says that your ng server is being hosted
so this is the local host for which I'm
mentioning on which I wanted to run and
you can see the status your right it
says zero percent 10 percent here you
have again you know 10 percent here and
yeah basically it keeps increasing so
you have 11 percent so it's a big
process so there's a lot of dependencies
that gets downloaded and in the
meanwhile that we saw the docker file
that I was explaining the docker file we
have all our packages downloaded and
installed and your application is
actually hosted so it says the PAC
compiled successfully right so this is
the success message if I now open the
localhost four root of zero then you
would see that my angular application is
running up and running right so you can
see that the application name is movie
rating system and this is something that
I tell you this was the application
which my team created for me and this
Apple this project is all about you know
the top 250 movies that you have to
watch before you die right some of the
you know the biggest blockbuster hits of
Hollywood so all those are present here
now you know the it's it's the Anna you
will get the angular feel over here by
looking at the different components so
the logout option that you see here this
is a different component right if I log
out then I will I do not get to see the
list of movies but if you log in only
then you will get to see that right and
then you have the navigation bar here
where you can switch to different tabs
you can hold the entry car Home tab you
can go to the you know the About tab
where again we have other details and
then if you login successfully then you
know you will get to see the the movie
list that we have so let's just wait for
this to log in and I can show you the
movie list that we have yeah so you have
the movie list here right so in the
navigation bar let me just click on this
movie list and you can see the 250
movies that beaches are you know happen
the best ever Hollywood movies
yeah so the number one movie that you
have to watch is the Shawshank
Redemption right and then we have other
movies like Godfather the part 2 of
Godfather Dark Knight well Angry Men
which again is my favorite movie
we have Schindler's List we have a
number of movies easier which you know
which is our favorite of course and
we've created an application this way
and this is a simple web application a
single page web application that we
created and you can create all these
things if you know you know how to work
with node.js and how if you know how to
work with angularjs right similarly
similarly if I go to the etiquette app
we already reported Rick over here so
you know we believe in take off your
skills or rediscover learning so we have
that you know live classes in expert
instruction so these are the this is the
interface that we built that we created
in our application and that's what I
want to show you and in the movies list
again I mean of course we have the list
of movies and if you click on any of the
movies you can look at the details of
that movie as when it was released what
is the genre of the movie who was a
director writer who are the actors in
the movie and what readings it has got
so whatever data we have here with
respect to ratings and writer on stars
these were basically you know you know
basically got from IMDB right so it was
those I'm gonna be ratings that you know
we are using as we decide so that's
that's about our angular application and
it's a simple application which you know
you mean you could uh you know create
one if you have expertise in angular but
Derek and I realize there lies the
problem right so if you don't know how
to build such an application for
yourself using angular then you can
probably get yourself trained and
certified an angular from the codes that
we have and you can alternatively even
check out the the DevOps course that'd
be a tad Eureka have right so let me
just quickly go to my web browser and
show you the landing page of our course
so first of all this is our DevOps
landing page and here you will find a
lot of details about our you'll find the
reels about our course right so what
when is the bat starting so we have a
batch starting on the 5th of August
that's the coming weekend and you have
the prime serials you can change it as
per your as per the currency you can
choose the currency as two US dollars or
even the timezone
so you can change that you can check out
what are the features that you will get
when you buy a course from Ed Rekha and
then you can also check out the
curriculum and find out what are the
technologies that you would be trained
on and see what you will learn when you
buy a course from an Rekha you can see
all these your similarly you can do the
same for even the you know the angular
course right so we have angular course
and you can check out the radials over
there but in the meanwhile let me show
you that we also have a blockchain on
dev ops right so we have a blockchain on
what is the need for the devups and what
exactly is DevOps and what it does and
what are the different tools what are
the most popular tools how to achieve
the DevOps life cycle so we have a
detailed explanation of each of these
blogs over here at this URL you can
access them over here at Ricker dot
Khosla slash blog slash what is DevOps
and yeah I would request you to go
through these blogs if you do not know
what DevOps is right so because San
earlier Azmi that shouldn't know how to
get the software so we have got
different installation guides so if you
want to download then and so I get you
can go to this blog office what is get
and then over here you have the gate
installation right install gate
similarly we have different tools like
puppet we have chef and for each of
these tools we have the installation
blog also write for ansible for docker
for Jenkins especially for these two
which you people wanted if you do that
and also we have an interview questions
blog which would help you prepare for
any day option to view that you are
appearing for so that's this that's what
you want to get here and you can also
check out our YouTube playlist on DevOps
right so we have a number of videos here
on various tools of DevOps and you will
get a you know you remind blown by what
you will get to learn and what
opportunities that you have in the
software industry in the IT industry so
do give it a read you can just search
for DevOps training videos and Google
and you can just put a trick and we get
this playlist right and these are the
two important things that I want to show
you but most importantly I want to show
you how to subscribe to Ed Rekha right
so you just in any of our video you can
just click this
Bob jr. and when you do that you have a
bail option here right the bail I can
click on the bell icon if you want to be
notified of future live sessions like
this
so today's was a live session and if you
want to be notified you know of this
that we're going to have in the future
then you can please do this otherwise
you don't want to get any notification
because subscribe is not going to help
you it's the belacan which makes the
actual difference and yeah that's it
guys so that's what I want to show you
so that brings us to the end of the
session today lemme just quickly revise
what we covered right so let me just go
here this is where I left off earlier
and I first fault spoke about what is
angular right what is the benefit of a
single page application why it's being
developed and then I spoke about the
different DevOps tools and techniques
which would be which we would be using
to deploy an angular application I told
you I spoke about get Jenkins and docker
and then I spoke about what exactly
happens what's the architecture and that
goes about for deploying an angular
application the DevOps way and then I
finally give you a demonstration of the
same so yeah that's that brings us to
the end of the session for today and you
guys can put any of any question that
you have you can put that in the chat
box and I can take them up now and even
my team can finally answer those
questions
so guys yeah I totally enjoyed this live
session guys I thank you for being ever
so patient and on being such good
audience and we will come up with more
live sessions like this and like I said
earlier if you want to be informed do
subscribe to our channel and like our
videos comment share our videos and it
will be a pleasure to have you on board
with us right so thanks guys
and happy learning okay so creme Panda
is asking for the code frame
unfortunately the code is not something
that we can share with you right so we
cannot share the code with you but of
course if you go to our if you subscribe
to our course if you buy the course from
us then we would not provide you with
better project details right we would
give you a better sample set you know a
better project that you can work on
we'll teach you will train you on that
aspect in fact in the same get up
repository that I assure you earlier I
will avail apply I'll upload a new
project which you can probably implement
okay but of course this project is
something that we cannot share it with
you so I'll be taking it off in some
time right so so yeah prim don't worry
we will give you a good project on which
you can practice but unfortunately this
will be taken off in some time alright
so yeah I think that's it so no other
questions and thank you guys thanks
again and happy learning right see you
until next time
