dad in a rented house goes to office
every day he works for a company but
mostly he is fascinated by web designing
he visits new web sites and he keeps on
looking and scrolling as the page Rosen
and pictures pop out he goes through all
the websites to figure out what
possibilities are there in web designing
so he decides to learn how to create one
he researches and goes through different
ideas and comes across angularjs one of
the hot and trending JavaScript
framework for web development and it
contains more number of advanced
features like data binding and
dependency injection everything in the
MVVM pattern is communicated
automatically across the UI whenever
anything changes this eliminates the
need for wrappers setters or class
declarations angularjs handles all of
this since everything happens
automatically you can ask for your
dependencies as parameters in angularjs
service functions full testing
environment angularjs requires no
additional frameworks or plugins
including testing deep linking for
dynamic pages deep linking allows you to
encode the state of application in the
URL so that it can be bookmarked
the application can then be restored
from the URL to the same state
directives directives can be used to
create custom HTML tags that serve as
new custom widgets they can also be used
to decorate elements with behavior and
manipulate GOM attributes in interesting
ways mvvm to the rescue model stock to
view model objects through something
called the scope object which listens
for changes to the mode
these can then be delivered and rendered
by the views which is the HTML that
expresses your code views can be routed
using the route provider object so you
can deep link and organize your views
and controllers turning them into
navigable URLs angularjs also provides
stateless controllers which initializes
and controls the scope object by
implementing what he learned through
angularjs he created a web application
it was a huge accomplishment and he
started getting calls from clients he is
now a busy man and has his own house
which he visits quite often
