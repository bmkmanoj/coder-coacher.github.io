to define all Mon line arguments let me
go here now command line arguments okay
you can you can also execute your Python
like this you know Anoop I think remind
I know reminded me as to whether we can
use this or not command line I will do
when the Python sis module provides
access to command line arguments by via
sister
ERG me right argument ok sister
argv is the list of command line
arguments I'm going to show this to you
length will give you the number of you
know command line arguments as to how
many arguments that you have in a
command line i'll 0 is the program
program that the script name I mean if
you have used Java or a sorry any other
programming language they're all say
it's it's pretty similar let me explain
this to you
now the monster py and I have my command
store py here Python
monkey
just give me a second CD you see this in
in this I'm just importing sis okay and
then I say number of arguments I'm
taking I'm trying I'm printing the
length of arguments here and argument
list is string of argument list okay let
me pass this data here command-line
argument here this is already written
here okay this program is already
written here now okay I'll have to copy
this once again I am very lazy in typing
in so all I do is I am calling this now
now that I am already inside this
particular folder I do not a
particularly I do not need this so I say
Python command start py which is this
one and I've given one input 2 input and
3 input now if I press and enter it says
number of arguments 2 arguments so what
what is the possible error here guys can
you see any other here it is just taking
this is one argument and it is taking
this is another argument how do I fix
this
any idea guys so I'm I'm I'm waiting for
a response single course okay I soaks is
single course no problem any other code
individually let's see okay
let's see I mean because you guys are
saying so I'll try it okay
but it still says to argument it does
not see it's not going in error but it's
it's giving okay why go and remove comma
Hagen let give space sesame okay okay
and think you guys are there oops
fix it I'll meet and Ragavendra give it
without comma okay this is how you have
to exceed indentation spacing etc is
extremely important here okay now
because I have to give a space here from
one input to another input after comma
that's that's how it takes so
indentation is extremely important in
Python okay I'll keep on repeating
myself many times over a classes but
you'll have to remember that if you do
not be proper it in addition this is
what it can happen okay instead of poor
argument it might think it has two
argument okay so let's move on to the
next one and now you got it right I mean
what we were trying to now okay let's
you see this right in this case I am
just printing the length of the number
of arguments the number of arguments
here is zero okay
one two three four so when it counts it
is one two three four but this is you
know zero zero element first second and
third right here print argument list a
string of string arguments here and then
it gives me all the arguments here now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
