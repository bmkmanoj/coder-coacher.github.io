welcome to this live session on AWS
training guys this is my first time live
on YouTube and I'm very excited to be
here our session today is going to be
full-on practical that is we will learn
about a few services from scratch and
then use them to build our in use case
all right so guys just a quick chat can
I know the experience that I'm teaching
today can I know the background from
which you guys belong to
okay I can see that magenta is from
network security momentum Network backup
finishes system admin all right Java
already required awesome so I see people
are from mixed background over there
awesome guys so I I hope this session is
going to be useful for you today all
right we are basically going to focus on
architects you will learn how to
architect solutions in AWS all right so
all right guys enough talk let's go
ahead and discuss waters our agenda for
today
we will start with a problem statement
that is a use case and move on to
discuss its architecture once you are
clear with the architecture we will see
how we can fit AWS into it and discuss
the services that we'll be using with it
and then we will start with a hands-on
ok guys so this is our agenda I hope
it's clear to you guys so let's move on
to the problem statement now and see
what we are going to architect today
alright guys so this is a problem
statement basically we will be making an
e-commerce website in which you'll be
entering your name your email address
your location and then you'll be
selecting a product which you wish to
buy and then you'll be clicking on
submit when you click on submit you will
be getting a confirmation email on the
email that you specified all right
and hence we will move forward and
understand how we can architect this
website all right let me quickly show
you the website that we have created and
we have deployed on AWS
as of now alright guys so this is the
website that I'm talking about this is
the website that we have created all
right you can enter your name your email
address your location here now the
selection of the course that you want to
buy and click on submit once you click
on submit you will get a confirmation
mail on your whatever email you have
specified here and that is it guys
okay guys I feel you guys won't be
seeing the website can you see it now
all right so guys this was the website
that I'm talking about you have to enter
your name your email address here then
your location then you'll be selecting
the courses from here and then clicking
on submit once you click on submit you
will get it you'll be getting an email
confirmation on that right and hence
we'll be taking this forward all right
so what I want to do what I expect you
guys to do right now is go to
www.hsn.com submit all right so let me
do it for you as of now I click on name
enter a month I'll enter my email ID
that is a month other a deadiy record
code right I'll enter the location as
Bangalore select a course which is
DevOps and click on submit all right so
it says your order has been successfully
placed now this is the confirmation page
guys if i refresh it I can see okay so a
lot of you people have entered awesome
guys okay so keep entering guys while I
come back to my slide alright so just
think is how will this how has this site
be in architecture what are the
resources which we might have installed
in this website right if you see the
problem statement you might be thinking
or when you have used the website you
might be thinking this is a very simple
website there's nothing in it
but when you actually imagine what kind
of architecture is behind it you will
get to know that there are a lot of
things that you have to consider alright
so let me move on to the architecture so
that you guys understand what is
actually behind this website so guys our
website is basically interacting with
three resources all right
our website is first interacting with
the database is interacting with a Q it
is also interacting with a back-end
server all right how let me explain
so the database is basically used to
enter your details like that you name
your email address your location etc
right then you have the Q so Q basically
acts as an external memory to stateless
systems right so our back-end server
which I'll be explaining in a in a few
minutes is basically a stateless system
it doesn't have a memory of its own
right so it has to rely on a queue to
get its shops so what is the what are
the jobs here
the jobs are basically to send the
emails right so whatever email that you
have mentioned in your text box over
there that email will be sent to the
queue right and then back and server
will fetch those emails one by one and
we'll be sending you the respective
emails all right
so Q like I said it acts as an external
memory back in several fetches from the
external memory and executes so now what
the backing server will do is it will
forward this request it will assemble
the email and forward this request to
the email server and the email server
win hence deploy the emails to you right
guys so this is the architecture are we
clear about this architecture has any
doubts in this architecture
moving forward I'll be telling you guys
how to replace these many these
resources that is how do we place the
database with the AWS servers which a SS
service is equivalent to a database or
which database service is equal into a
queue which database which a SS service
is equal in to a back-end server right
okay so I can see that at Leon is saying
is clear others guys let's make this
session as interactive as possible
because it will be in the benefit of
both of us right
okay so Anton says it's perfect
Santos says he's clear alright guys
since most of you are clear let's move
ahead so now what I'll be doing is I'll
be telling you guys which AWS services
to substitute for these particular
resources that we have mentioned all
right
so for the website we'll be using two
EWS services that is elastic Beanstalk
and route 53 right so first of all when
we talk about hosting a website so you
need a server to host right so that
server is basically elastic Beanstalk
the other thing is you have to get the
URL you have you have to link the URL to
your website when you host a website you
basically get an IP address of that
server but how will you link that URL
that you purchased or that you
registered for with your IP address so
that is done using route 53 okay so our
database is basically RDS so RDS is a
database management service it's not a
database guys it's a database management
service and then what are the difference
that it manages these databases for you
there are a few databases that RDA
supports it manages the databases for
you I'll be explaining you in detail in
the next slide right for now just keep
calm let's move on to the next resource
that is Q so for Q we are using SQS so
SQS is a service which is which which
offers the service of a queue from AWS
so you have the option of fee for that
is first and first out in this and you
have the option of a standard queue
right so based on your preference you
can choose a queue then we have the
service or so for email so we had the
SES service from EWS which we'll be
using then we have back-end server for
back-end service we are using a SS
lambda so now let's understand what each
of these service are all about all right
moving ahead let's discuss these
services in detail ok so first let's
discuss about elastic beanstalk so in
compute when you look at the compute
section of AWS there are basically three
kinds of services you have ec2 you have
elastic beanstalk and then you have
lambda all right
so easy to is basically the most basic
service in your compute section so easy
easy to is just like a server that you
have bought on your own when you launch
an ec2 instance in AWS they provide you
with an IP address and they provide you
with the password so you can remote
desktop connection to that easy do and
you can view the screen and it you can
do anything you want with that server as
if it was your own computer you can
install any kind of software's you can
build a workout environment you can
build a web server you can make it as a
background processing task so anything
right but when you talk about elastic
beanstalk or wind talk about lambda what
elastic beanstalk is it's actually an
automated version of ec2 all right so if
you were to host say a PHP website on
ec2 you would have to install a lot of
things you have to install a PHP file
your raft means you have to configure
the firewall so that a lot of
connections can come to your solve
servers and everything right but with
the thing with elastic beanstalk is you
don't have to configure anything you
just have to specify that I need a PHP
website all right
click on create and it will create the
environment for you and all you have to
do is upload your code nothing else I
will show you how it is right then you
have lambda so let's discuss lambda
later let me show you guys how you can
actually deploy elastic beanstalk on AWS
so let me give me a minute
let me go back to my AWS console alright
guys so this is how your AWS console
looks like I have to deploy an elastic
beanstalk environment so I click on
elastic Beanstalk
all right so I have already deployed one
so so this is where my website right now
is hosted right so let me create one
more application so for that you will
click on create new application you will
come here you have to name the
application now so you name it I'll say
Eddie Eureka - 0:01 all right you'll
click on next
and now you have to choose between web
server environment or worker environment
so I'll select web server environment
because I have to host a website right
so I click on web server now this is the
path that I was saying that you have to
select a platform or a language in which
your website will be created all right
so you have these many options here
my web site is created in PHP so I'll
select PHP over here right and then
there's an option for load balancing or
scaling or single instance so single
instance is when you have a very limited
kind of workload you don't want two or
three servers to support your website
but when you are in the production
environment basically there you can't
predict what kind of traffic will be
coming on to your side right so say you
have two servers running right now for
who can support only 40 users and
tomorrow say 70 users come up so you
have to manually go and deploy one more
server but when you opt for load
balancing and order scaling what happens
is that it automatically sees the needs
of your website if you if your website
is going slow
it automatically deploys one more server
so that the website is now running in
three servers alright so load balancer
on the other hand it is used to equally
distribute your traffic among the equal
number of servers that have launched say
there were two servers before so your
traffic were distributed among two
servers but now when you have three
servers so what load balancer will do is
it will distribute the traffic among
three servers all right so this is about
load balancing and auto scaling moving
on guys so we selected PHP and load
balancing here we'll click on next now
and now you have to upload your code but
for the sake of simplicity let's not
upload a code right now I'll upload it
later so that you can understand what
I'm how you can upload your code or how
you can version update your website
alright
so for now we'll be clicking on sample
application will be going down we will
see the deployment preferences so don't
worry about this guys just leave it at
default and click on next
all right now it is asking us to specify
a URL
alright so URL has to be unique right so
you have to check the availability for
the URL you will click on check
availability so it is available right
we'll click on next and now it is asking
us whether we want whether we want to
create a Ras DB instance and a V PC so I
don't need an RDS in instance I will be
doing that separately what I can do is I
can create this particular application
inside of V PC Y inside of e PC but V PC
is basically a virtual private cloud
alright it's a virtual network now why
are we creating it inside a virtual
network is because say I'll be deploying
an RDS server that is a database server
as well right so if both of them are
inside the same network it becomes
easier for them to talk otherwise you
have to do a lot of configuration right
so that's why I'll be including this
inside of e PC and clicking on next all
right so now it is asking me the
instance type so instance type is
basically the configuration that you
want for your server alright so you can
see there are a lot of configurations
available right so we'll be selecting
the t1 micro configuration which is the
least of them all you can cut if you
have a website you have a prodding
moment website which will be dealing
with a lot a lot of users you can go
ahead and choose a better configuration
but since ours is the demo via thousand
T 1 dot micro alright then we have you
don't have to fill all that this guy is
just ignore this and leave everything a
default the only thing to matter here is
one is the easy to keep air in case you
want to SSH into your elastic beam stuff
but that wood won't be required because
everything is automatic alright so just
select your instance type and click on
next alright environment tags guys leave
it at default nothing needs to be added
here click on the next and now this is
the thing that you have to focus on guys
so over here
you have to notice that what is the
security group in which your elastic
beanstalk is being deployed so it's s G
0 to 4 all right so when you'll be
creating your RDS instance you have to
mention the security group so that the
IDS instance can interact with the
elastic beanstalk all right so as of now
let me like copy this it's s G 0 to 4 so
let me write it here
it's s G - 0 to 4 and we are set all
right excuse me yeah so now I'll be
clicking on next bike while I have to
check all of these alright okay let's
click on next now
and now permissions leave it a default
click on next and this is it guys now
this is the review page you'll be ravine
or reviewing all your settings over here
right review all the settings and click
on launch alright so while my website is
being or my vine my elastic Beanstalk is
being ready let us go back to a slide
and discuss the next service all right
so the next service is AWS lambda so
like I told you guys it is again an
automated version of easy to but the
difference what will be the difference
between last B so you may ask me that
elastic beanstalk was also an automated
version right so why aren't we not using
logic Beanstalk again for the background
tasks so the thing is the elastic
Beanstalk can only be used to deploy an
application or host a website right it
cannot be used to do background tasks as
in the case with lambda it cannot be
used to deploy a website right it it can
only be used to do background tasks and
this is the main difference between the
two so you have to identify what is a
use case what is your what I trying to
do and then you choose a service and
this is what an architect's job is all
about guys you should know all the
services and based on your use case you
should choose the best service all right
so since ours is a background task we
have to send emails right so it's better
to do it on separate server so that the
latency is less and that's why we are
doing it on lambda
all right so how do you create lambda is
something like this so one way of doing
it is actually going to your console and
deploying it and uploading your code but
there's a hack there's a better way of
doing it what you can do is you can
install eclipse Kepler all right when
you do that once you do that you have to
include an SDK in it which is called the
AWS SDK so how you can install is this
is the SDA this is your eclipse right so
you'll go to help you'll click on
install new software and over here you
will type in AWS right so you have to
type in aws.amazon.com slash eclipse and
it will load all these tools for you
select all these tools and click on
finish and it will install the SDK
automatically now why did I do it why is
it easy is because of this so when
you'll be this is my project this is the
code of my lambda my lambda is basically
fetching the details from the cube right
so let me show you all right yeah here
it is so it is this is the URL for make
you guys alright so it it fetches from
this particular queue and then it starts
assembling the email right once it
assembles the email in the ED it sends
the email so don't worry this code will
be available for you alright so for now
let me tell you how to deploy this code
on lambda right so this is my project
guys it's set it's called life I'll
right-click on the sport project and
I'll go to this icon which says Amazon
Web Services right I go here I click on
upload function to AWS lambda and once I
do that it will show me this window
right and over here I have to select
which lambda function I want to deploy
to right if you want to create a new
lambda function you can create a new
lambda function I have like two
functions defined right now my function
is empty I can deploy it here you can
deploy it anywhere right so my primary
lambda function is hello one two three
this is where my website is functioning
as a
now and my function is empty alright so
once you click here like I'll upload it
to my function click on next and then
you will see this window wherein it'll
damp your code on to s3 bucket
all right so s3 is nothing but a file
system on AWS so what will do is it will
copy the code from whatever code is
available in your clips and save it over
there alright so you can choose the
bucket from here and the handler
whatever handler you want so you can
check the code guys I have commented
everything if you have doubts this video
will be as a recording on our YouTube
channel you can comment in and we will
be happy to serve your requests alright
and once you click on finish it will
upload your code to the AWS table
alright guys so let me come back to my
slides this was about lambda next is the
RDS service so RDS service like a troll
previously it's a database management
service alright it's not a database so
what happens in RDS is you have quite a
few databases you have minus QR you have
MongoDB etc right so you select the
database you want you configure you
choose the server configuration as your
desire but and you deploy it right but
what is the difference between a normal
database server and RDS
is that with RDS it automates the tasks
that were done manually before like for
example applying the security patches to
your database right or doing something
else everything is automated or
upgrading your particular database
instance so say it was five point six
before and now five point seven has been
there you can upgrade your database
automatically there's an option in RDS
to do that alright so this is how RDS is
important let me show you how you can
deploy RDS in AWS so you will go to your
management console alright so we'll go
to our es here we have the DB instances
so you click here you will click on
launch DB instance you'll select what
database you want so for example I chose
MySQL which
the simplest of them all and then I
clicked select now then you'll have an
option between production or dev
environment so I chose the test
environment because - the demo I don't
need that much power in my server I'll
click on next step
alright and then I can choose the DB
engine version over here it's 5.6 which
is OK for me the DB instance class so
this is basically the configuration that
you want for your server so mine is like
I said demo so I'll choose the minimum
one right and then the multi easy
deployment so multi easy deployment is
basically when you want to deploy your
servers in different regions all right
in the sense if you say my server is
right now in North Virginia say suppose
all right and I want my server to be
deployed in some other region as well
because there has to be a disaster
recovery standby so for that particular
reason we have this option but since
like I said it's a demo I'll choose no
and then this is the main thing guys so
we identify it as say demo one master
user name for your database it could be
a eureka password i'll give in so this
password is basically something that you
have to specify when you're trying to
connect to your database so this is a
click on next step and we'll create a
new security group and then the database
name you can also put in the database
name here so say you don't want to go
there and type in the create database
command you can do it from here
and I think that is it guys nothing else
to be configured we'll click on launch
TB instance and this is it guys so now
my database will take some time to
deploy leavitt let us give it that time
and let me show you this MySQL right so
this is the instance which is running
right now which is actually hosting the
data which you guys are entering here
all right so whatever data I can see
here it has actually been sent by you so
I can see quite a few of you who have
entered it thanks for your response
all of
that stored in this particular database
alright so while this database is being
created let us go back to our slide and
understand the other services so we are
done with IDs let's go on to sqs so sqs
like I told you guys it's a it's a
queueing service by Amazon right you use
it as an external memory to your
back-end server my back-end server is
lambda so what my lambda will be doing
is it will be fetching emails from
somewhere right and that is what sqs was
all about now let's go ahead and see how
we can deploy a queueing service in AWS
all right I will type in AWS here SQS
one sec SQS and click here alright so
this is the queuing service and I have
configured it to basically get all the
emails that available so as you can see
there is one message available that is
still to be processed by lambda so it
processes messages one by one and sends
you the email so guys all of you got
those emails right can you please
confirm on the chat box that you got the
emails in your respective email ids
all right so like I said okay I'm
waiting for your reply guys please reply
so like I said so this queue is
basically used to get all your email ids
right and this is the URL for that Q so
this URL has to be specified in your
code so if you can see in the Eclipse
IDE I have mentioned this particular URL
let me show you so here it is so it says
live D EMP and if you go here it says
like the EMP and the Q is 2 4 5 3 7 6 9
double 6 2 4 5 3 7 6 9 double set so
it's the same URL so this is the URL
that this is the Q that I'm sending my
message is to all right and it's
basically pretty simple you click on
create new Q and like I said there are
two options you have a standard Q and
then you have the FIFO queue if your
requirement is to get the first messages
first you can select FIFO queue but mine
is not so I slick on standard queue and
once I do that I'll have to give a name
first so let me give a name say Eddie
Rica - 0 1 right I click on create quick
create queue and this is it guys it's
already done it's there right so it's
pretty fast it's very very elegant and
you can use it it's very useful as well
all right so this was about sqs the next
service is SES so SES like I told you
guys it's an email server which so the
email that you guys are getting in a
Gmail that is from your SES now this is
a very cool service that I find that I
specified my email address here and you
got the email but did you guys notice
that there was a different domain it was
not our usual domain our usual domine is
Eddy record Co but the me that you guys
got was Eddie ray Carter mmm all right
so that domain is actually not a real
domain it was a domain that I just
registered on a free domain side all
right so all of that has to be
configured and mine you guys if you
reply to that email you will get a
secondary email that the all of the
process is automated so
get a secondary email which has been
replied from a different address right
so you can do all of those cool things
with SES let me show you how so I'll go
back to my management console so this is
SES so first you have to verify a domain
right
so if you guys noticed the domain from
which I sent you was Eddie raker dot ml
all right so I've verified that domain
here how can you do that I'll be
explaining you in a little while all
right so you'll be registering the
domain here and then you will go to
rulesets Andrew says I will be
specifying a rule that whenever somebody
replies to that email I will be replying
back as 550 the error code will be 550
right so a 550 means basically a message
would not delivered play a particular
mailbox right and I can type in a custom
reply over here all right so let me show
you how it is done so this is the email
that I got guys right so now what I'll
do is I'll click on reply and then reply
something like hey alright so when I do
that I get a message back from a
different email address so this is my
email address guys this is him another a
dairy rekha raatko
right and the email address that I was
receiving from before was hello at the
rate 80 record ml right so let me see
this message let me show you guys what
it tells it says that the message could
not be delivered and this is the reply
that I wrote over there right please
reply to the following address which is
a month after a dairy recorded coup or
you can reply directly as well now
because the sandy has scenes the sandy
has been changed from Hello at the rate
at Eureka dot ml to Hemant at the rate
re-record ko right
so this is a very cool thing that you
can do with SES so these are the rule
says this is how you specify a rule set
and obviously first you have to register
a domain now how you can register a
domain is like this so I got my domain
from over here guys so this is a website
which is called free NomCom all right
you can get a free domain registry from
here and you can use it for free for
like three months
all right so I registered a domain
called Eddie raker dot ml all right
I can go to services I'll go to my
domains so here it is Eddie record or ml
all right so I'll go to manage domain
and I go to management tools name
service so over here I've specified four
servers that I'll be using right so
where did I get these four servers from
right so that brings us to our next
service which is route 53 so route of
III like I told you guys it's a DNS
server it is used to route traffic to
different instances right so it is if
you type in area record ml in your
browser you are redirected to my
instance in the elastic Beanstalk but if
you mail to where you record ml you are
redirected to my mailbox right so all of
those settings can be done in route 53
let's understand how so let me go back
to my irritability on soul so these are
the servers that we have to enter and
we'll enter it in this fashion so we'll
go to our a WS management console I'll
go to route 53 all right this is my
route 53 now I'll go to hosted zones and
here it is so my editor cut out so
you'll click on create hosted zone okay
let me show you first how to create one
will click on the create hosted zones
and say I create a versus own called
Eddie Ricardo GA right I'll click on
create alright so these
the nameservers that I got right now all
right so these name servers have to be
copied and pasted here in your client
from which you're getting the domain
name all right so when you'll enter the
name servers here and when you save it
this domain name will now point to route
53 now from route 53 you have to point
it to your elastic beanstalk or your
email server right so how you will do
that let me tell you now so first I
click on verify a new domain so let me
enter the domain has any record say AC K
which is not domain I'm just telling you
how to do it right I click on verify
this domain and then it will give me two
records so one will be the txt record
and one will be the MX record
now these records now have to be added
in your route 53 all right so I'll go to
route 53 I click on create record set
all right and then as you can see the
type is txt so I'll select the type here
as txt and then I will enter the value
over here the value can be pasted copied
from here this is the value guys you'll
copy the value from here paste it here
copy the name from here paste it here
and that is it you will click on create
so your txt record is done and similarly
you will be doing your MX record as well
so once you have entered both these
records and you have clipped them close
this pending verification notification
will change to verified all right so
Eddy do karate caracal your GA all of
this will change to your verified domain
message all right so this is how you do
it now your route 53 it will identify
what kind of traffic is coming on to me
if it sees that it's a mail mail kind of
traffic it will point it to your mailbox
that is your SES if it sees if it's a
website kind of traffic it will point it
to your instance now let me go back and
let me show you the elastic Beanstalk
thing right so SES is done guys and
there's nothing much to configure now
I'll go to my elastic beanstalk all
right
so this is the server that we deployed
so as you can see it's a green tech over
here now right if I click on the URL it
will point you to the website that is
currently deployed right so this is a
sample application by your EWS now I
want that I should deploy my website my
own website that I have deployed on the
other is a second Beanstalk instance so
what I'll do is I click on upload and
deploy right I'll choose a file and the
file is this AWS so what you have to do
is whatever code that you'll be whatever
code that is there for your website you
will have to select all of your files
and your folders you'll have to zip it
and then you have to upload that
particular zip over here right so the
zip has to be in dot said IP that zip
format it cannot take a Corral format it
cannot take any other format but only
zip format all right so what I've done
is I've selected all the files I have
right clicked here and I have compressed
it all right so I'll be selecting this
file now and I'll click on open
right and I'll specify a version number
so that it doesn't clash and click on
deploy
so it will take some time to deploy
let's give it that time all right let me
show you the RDS instance so RDS there
are some settings that you have to do in
your RDS instance the security groups
thing that I was telling you about so
let's go to RDS right okay so this is
demo one is the instance that are just
launched alright so we'll go here click
on the particular instance we'll click
on tags right now this is the security
group that will be configuring we'll be
clicking here ok now I'll be clicking on
inbound connections so as you can see
there are no inbound connections only my
IP address is configured over here so
I'll be adding one more IP or one more
one more connection over there which is
that of my elastic Beanstalk alright so
how will I do that I click on it it now
I will add a rule right so I will go
here and select my school Aurora all
right and then I have to mention the
security group so like I said we have to
remember the initials of a security
group so it's s G - 0 - 4 so we'll go
here we enter SC - 0 - 4 here does this
is the security group of my elastic
Beanstalk I think this I click on save
and now my elastic Beanstalk can
interact with this particular RDS
instance alright this is Ed guys let's
see if our elastic beanstalk is deployed
it is still deploying all right it's
done so I click on the URL now so this
is the URL that has been provided by
elastic beanstalk alright so I click on
this URL and as you can see this website
has been successfully being the
loyd on this instance alright now this
is the URL that is by default given by
AWS but like I said if you want this
kind of URL right you have to register a
new domain which can be done from here
right you can register a new domain here
for the demo purpose right and then you
can go to route 53 configure let me show
you how you can connect your route 53 so
we'll go to route 53 right so I told you
guys how you can connect your email to
your route 53 but let me show you how we
can connect your instance now so the way
you connect your instance is like this
you will create a record set alright now
this is the email address that you have
registered okay so I'm not registered it
yet so I will not be entering anything
here so when you are say deploying the
server from which you have an elastic IP
address sorry from this you have an IP
address right in that case you'll be
specifying the IP address where but if
you have deployed your instance on
elastic Beanstalk in that case you'll
click on alias alright you go here and
your elastic Beanstalk instance will be
mentioned over here right so you will
click on that and you will click on
create all right so now your instance is
connected to your ID record ga record in
route 53 and route 53 is record you have
already mentioned in your domains domain
names website which is handling that
domain name and you have mentioned the
name servers over there so your website
will be redirected from there to route
53 and drop by route 53 it will first
understand what kind of traffic it is
right so it will see if it's a website
traffic it will redirect it to the
instance if it's an email traffic it
will redirect to the email alright so
guys this is it this is about I think we
have covered all these services we are
done with route 53 we are done with SES
we are done with sqs we are done with
audio
went down with lambda and we're done
with elastic beanstalk all right so this
is how you configure when you want to
host your own website and if you want if
