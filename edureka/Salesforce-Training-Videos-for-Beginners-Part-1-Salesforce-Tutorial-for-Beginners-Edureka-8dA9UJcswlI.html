today i'll be your presenter through
this session where we will talk about
Salesforce and some of the features that
Salesforce provides before we start let
me ask you guys to quickly tell me if
you guys are hearing my voice clearly
quickly you can either raise your hands
or rapping through the chat window that
you guys are getting my voice clearly
just want to ensure that before I start
discussing about Salesforce and its
features okay I see confirmation from
almost six seven of you okay okay guys
so let's start without without waiting
for anything let's actually start and
hope the next half an hour will really
help all of us to understand in a brief
four things Moe's provides now my
introduction first so I am wrong giant a
priority I am currently working with an
IE MNC firm and in terms of my
Salesforce experience I have almost five
years I have almost been working with
Salesforce for the last five years now
total up around nine and a half years of
work experience and prior to that I have
done my engineering and my MBA from I am
that's about me in brief now what are my
hobbies typically in terms of whenever I
talk of hobbies salesforce.com pitches
high on those as well who is it being
very simply I came back to Salesforce
after a very different set of experience
it the prior experience was extremely
lucrative but just for the love of
Salesforce I came back at a point in
time where I had to describe my career
path I hope with today's today's session
I'll be able to encourage a few of you
to look at sales further the career
option okay with that let's get to
Salesforce and understand what it
provides a meanwhile I'm sure
you guys are posting your details in
terms of your name current the current
domain you are working on and your
number of years of experience if you
could put it in the chat window that
would really help as we keep discussing
things about salesforce.com as well that
will help me to understand where you are
coming from ok guys so here we go so
what will basically start with today is
have a quick look at overall CRM and
worked-out computing means getting
specifically into Salesforce we will
look at what are the three different
aspects of Salesforce namely the sales
cloud marketing cloud and service cloud
and then within Salesforce we'll look at
three aspects one is Business Objects
which is like the backbone of this
entire salesforce.com second is some of
the Salesforce tools that are available
in the market in terms of what is it
that can be done with Salesforce to
achieve CRM related CRM related
expertise and third is how the
Salesforce helps in the analytics piece
these are the things that we'll cover
today in say the next 25 minutes - 30
minutes and of course after that we'll
have an open question and answer session
where you can put your questions in the
chat window at the end of the session
we'll discuss each of those questions in
detail starting with CRM very simply CRM
stands for customer relationship
management it's all about how a company
manages its interactions with its
clients and sales prospects so the thing
is very clear look for any cusp for any
company its clients are the most
important set of assets based on how a
company interacts with its clients and
its sales prospects a company's future
in terms of revenue the company's future
in terms of the line of business and so
on that gets decided as a result if you
can't connect to your system to your
clients in a proper way your business is
really at stake and so if I have to
summarize all of this customer
relationship man
three broad points I'll have to look at
three things one I will have to know how
do I engage my existing clients when I
say engage you have to think about what
do I talk about so that the clients
remain with me
that's retaining my existing customers
second there are obviously a lot of
clients where the clients are there yes
there is there may be a steady business
from those clients but then we don't see
any growth or the business may be
gradually tapering down how do we
energize those kind of accounts how do
we get those accounts to think more
about us that second in terms of
energizing dormant accounts and finally
of course the main thing about any
business finding new clients that's
always something which everyone is
looking for right so these are the three
main purposes what with CRM we'll always
try and sustain you can see a couple of
examples at the bulb at the bottom of
the screen so basically let's look at it
in this way you see a lot of
advertisements coming up in different
websites right and let's take an example
you log in to clear trip today you try
and see a couple of flights and a couple
of details that you have seen around in
your that you want to check and then
what happens say you want to then go
into some other side and you still see
the small bit of window coming up which
is an advertisement from Pier trip that
the fair has actually gone down now it's
a different thing how is this entire
thing captured that's something which
Google does rather a lot of websites do
and by placing their own set of
identifiers that's a different thing but
the basic premise that I'm trying to
explain here is you are as a company
clear trip is trying to engage you and
showing you the right path ensuring that
yes if you book today the fares have
come down please
look at us as an option because we will
give you the most important subjects in
terms of reduced fares
that's what CRM is all about it's about
engaging your customers in a meaningful
in a meaningful dialogue now one
the important question is why is it that
CRM has really really come up in the
last maybe say 10 15 years before that I
don't think CRM nor something which was
even talked about yes it was a concept
which was there in a lot of MBA books it
was a concept with a lot of big
universities spoke about but why is it
that it suddenly gained a lot of
prominence first and foremost duties
companies always have had the data about
customers yes it may have been that it
would have been in different shape and
form some companies would have had it in
say excel sheet some would have had it
in let's take an example some would have
have had their sales people to maintain
Diaries or with customer data but then
the data was always there
the important thing has been how is it
that that data is used to find out where
is it that my next focus should be
second when I gradually as companies
increased when people started looking at
or rather when company started looking
at implementing systems a lot of the
data started residing in different
fragments different shape and form
across systems but the D that never got
connected together so you might have
something like a customer details which
is something which is in one of your
systems you might have your product
related details in some other system say
like an HCP which maintains products in
a very beautiful fashion the customer
and the product never really merged to
fire to give them importance to the fact
that there are some customers who are
looking at certain set of products in a
certain fashion that is their business
requires those products and that's the
way analytics and basic CRM information
should be structured so generally if we
look at the overall orientation in which
customers and organizations have looked
at any organization always wants the
fact that I don't want to spend a lot of
money in terms of
cause I do want to employ too many
people doing the same thing and not
being able to give me revenues I want to
reduce task force give me more revenues
next I don't want to spend a lot of time
in terms of maintaining systems
maintaining people to do lot of manual
stuff and finally for an organization
the end result is always around revenue
generation whatever it may be whatever
sector that organization may work may
work in it's always around revenues it's
always around how do we get more out of
whatever we do on the other side of
things or rather the other side when
moving to flip the coin you'll see
customers speaking a different language
customers do want to indulge in too many
big talk too much of big Tom they just
want quick and the specific response
they weren't flexible resolutions to
their problems they don't want people to
talk about look in the next five years
this is sorry in the next five years
this is how your systems will pan out
this is how your world will pan out so
look at us from a change management
point of view and things like that
customers want quick things it's like
yes I want these solutions can you come
back to me with these answers if not I
will move on to someone else that's how
short attention spans of customers lives
and this is the reason if you look at it
in this way that customers and
organizations are facing in two
different directions its CRM actually
which comes in between and tries to gel
the two together so if I have to now
answer how is it that CRM gels these two
aspects together of customer versus
organisations it's one it will help you
to continuously exchange information
across all customer touch points and
when I speak of patch points it's
basically every single mode of
communication with the customer maybe
through a social media something like
say a Facebook or a Lincoln against can
you just hold on
just give me a minute - yep okay sorry
sorry for that noise which was coming in
between okay the first part I talked
about in terms of exchange of
information across customer touch points
second one is basically around providing
personalized set of details in terms of
products and services generally you have
multiple groups of customers multiple
types of demands and so on as a company
now it is you will generally try and
formulate different types of products
aimed at different segments you cannot
go back to that fold mentality and say
that you can have it in any color only
if it's black you can't say that to the
to today's customers they'll go away
they'll go away to your competitors
they'll go away to maybe say other
products that your company wants and you
will lose a high-value customer their
third what is it that CRM system
provides it's a mode of real-time access
to all information real-time access is
something which is really really
important right now in the market
real-time access is something which
everyone is really craving for it's what
organizations crave for it's what a lot
of customers crave for and so on and
finally something which is really
important you cannot give a different
kind of experience to a customer across
different touchpoints it's not like
someone's coming in through social media
gets a different viewpoint about a
product and then when the person
actually goes and meets your company
representatives say at one of your
brick-and-mortar shops the experience is
completely different you can't do that
you need to give the same value
proposition across different formats CRM
systems help you to ensure that the user
experience is generally consistent now
when we look at CRM systems and how
things have evolved they generally have
been three broad classifications in
there or rather three broad phases in
doing CRM systems have evolved and
as a result of which two broad types of
CRM systems one is called on-premise or
traditional CRM systems in the bracket
you see the name Siebel so C will CRM or
something which was really really
prevalent in say that around the
nineteen only 1980s early early 1990s or
so on
what was the features of this system any
company which wanted to look at CRM as a
solution would have to have in-house
servers would have to have its own set
of networks it would have to allow
people from different countries
different business units to log in to
this kind of system the other type of
system which has gained provenance made
mostly in the lead in either the late
nineties or in the early 2000s is what
we now term as an on-demand or
cloud-based systems different from
traditional systems or on-premise
systems is all that you need for a
cloud-based system is a laptop and a
good connectivity a desktop and a good
connectivity a tablet with good
connectivity a mobile phone with good
connectivity basically with traditional
systems you needed to have separate
infrastructure in terms of servers
networks god-knows-what not with cloud
systems all you need is a simple laptop
and up and a internet connection and
that's it you have a CRM system running
for you it's now your choice in terms of
how is it that you want to look at CRM
systems now typically SF DC is what
really drove the thing about the out
basis - SF DC itself is a cloud-based
system I will explain what nowadays
system is in the next couple of minute
but remember that SF DC is a cloud-based
system now when I talk of cloud-based
system I give you a very clear view
right and that's what the first two
lines also talk about all you need is a
laptop or a computer or a mobile and you
connect to it through the internet
now how is it that
works what happens is the entire aspect
of maintaining servers network security
and so on is something which is managed
by the company called Salesforce the
company's product which is
salesforce.com that company makes sure
that the product is available to you
through the internet so you can actually
get your entire product and get it
working using the internet that's what's
out computing means using the cloud to
compete compute your own set of details
your whole set of data and so on what
are the benefits of having cloud
computing simple you'll see some terms
on the bottom left of the screen
multi-tenant multi-tenant means you're
very simple it's like a hostel in which
every signal room corresponds to one
company so every company has its own
space every company works in its own way
inside its room but the overall hostel
is something which is managed separately
you wrote as a tenant in that poster you
don't have to worry about how the post
is maintained all you have to worry
about is the room you earn and that's it
plus the fact that every room is
separated from the next room with
partitions so the person in the next
room doesn't get to enter your room till
you allow them to access as simple as
the ducts multi-tenant second it's pay
per use today you have one room you want
two rooms you pay for two and you get
two rooms that's people use it's very
simple you don't have to look at bulk
costs with salesforce.com what other
cloud computing solutions third it's
scalable today UD you have one room
tomorrow you need five you increase your
the amount of money you are pay for five
to five rooms and you get five movies
tomorrow you want to scale it down to
three rooms do that in the next up in
the next few days after you have decided
so that's what is basically driving
cloud computing and it's making sure the
cloud computing is the way to progress
for the entire
now coming to do quick aspects of cloud
computing one is SAS software is a
service and next one is fast which is
platform and service the software is
said as a service is nothing it's very
simple you have a software it's hosted
through the internet and people use it
through the internet that software is
the service you will see some very key
messages for software is the service
highlighted in a different color I am
NOT going through each of those
individually but try and understand this
any software when you get it through the
internet you can obviously use it for a
lot of purposes which really suit your
own kind of business and when you do
that when you understand software as a
service remember the sales forces are
typical of a typical example of software
is a service that's very important to
understand software is a service is
basically a software which is mosted on
the internet to make sure people can use
that software for their own businesses
next aspect platform as a service so as
the Deeb's explains platform as the
service is very simple it's like saying
that someone has provided me a space on
the internet to do whatever or rather
build whatever systems I want to do one
that on the Internet so what you do is
you build your own systems instead of
someone specifying what software you be
you are given a space on the internet
where you are just asked to develop your
own system a lot of companies want to do
that reason me they think that whatever
software is being sold is not the right
fit for their companies and they want to
develop something on top of it they want
to develop a customized version of that
software for themselves that's when they
go for platform of the service now the
funny part is I said Salesforce the SAS
sales forces also paths how Salesforce
has a I would say variant which is known
as force.com which is the third example
on the left hand side horse comp is
really like a empty box what we even
software technology related
implementation for organizations but a
box means is it's like an open space
where you can develop your own set of
applications on the Internet a box is
available and you can develop your own
set of customized rules you can have
your entire set of workflows and so on
to get your work happening for your
company that's fast for you I really
won't get into a details of all this
because this is something that we'll
discuss in a lot more detail when we are
starting our sessions on the clock chill
classes when we are starting from Monday
or from the next week and onwards and I
am sincerely hoping that at least a few
of you would be there during the
sessions because that's when we'll be
talking a lot in terms of your sales
processes marketing processes services
related processes partnerships how's it
the sales force manages partnerships
what the sales was do it content sales
force is able to make sure that you are
able to quickly manage a lot of details
available on your system or in terms of
your websites or not how is it that you
can do that better how is it that sales
force will help you to post idea in
terms of getting a better solution for
something how is sales who is working
with Google on certain facts what app
exchanges what are the different kinds
of sales those products that I can get
in the market I won't get into the
details of all of these right now but
remember on Pat please the three blocks
on the left hand side sales marketing
service there is these are like the
backbone of salesforce.com it's with
these three blocks that people almost
spend or other companies almost spend 70
to 80 percent of their time remaining
twenty twenty-five thirty percent of
their time and what is spent on the
other five aspects that you see on the
right hand side starting with
partnerships so
since we have now understood a Basics
around what Salesforce provides let's
look at why is it that Salesforce is
really good in the market it's about not
having databases so what do you all what
you see on your screen right now from
the top left is basically Salesforce
providing these databases you don't have
to own any of these databases Salesforce
will make sure all this information is
managed for you second web services API
what does this mean this so a lot of you
who are into development we're into
pure-play application development coding
and so on they would understand the term
that when you want to connect to systems
one of which is in the internet or one
of which is outside your domain you
would want to develop it you will want
to connect it through web service API X
API is are nothing but way of connecting
to systems to one another using easily
computable connectors they are api's or
connectors third workflow engine what
this means is Salesforce has a very
beautiful way of guiding users to flow
through an entire process as I said just
before this night there are three main
aspects of Salesforce sales marketing
and services for each of these three
aspects there is a defined workflow by
Salesforce so any user who is using it
for the first time they will be guided
through that in a fashion that users
cannot go wrong users really take very
less time to get accustomed to
Salesforce and that's the reason why
this product is selling like a hot cake
in the market right now on the upper
right-hand more side forms and page
layout editor what this means is a very
easy way of making sure that your
systems show pedis which is basically
like a web page form
and it looks in such a way that it's
easy to read it's easy to I would say
get all the details from and you can
easily organize all the details from the
page to form logical sections
that's forms and page layout editor
again starting with the lower left-hand
side it's access control and audit this
is actually security plus end-user
administration so that too on the bottom
left-hand side are actually something
related to Salesforce killed which is
one of the best in the market right now
anyone who wants to learn about
salesforce.com security not from up I
would say not from a developer or a
configuration point of view generally
would look at the side called trust dot
salesforce.com they would learn a lot
more in terms of the kind of security
Salesforce provide and how organizations
who have benefited from the two on the
right hand side on the bottom multi
divides in reporting so these are
basically ways of collecting reporting I
am sure all of you understand it's about
meaningful representation of information
multi device means through for
salesforce.com a lot of users actually
want to connect through sometimes you
want to connect through your desktop in
the next couple of hours they want to
open the same application using their
Android phones but at the same time they
want to see all the data that they have
worked on using their desktop or their
laptop this is what multi device means
Salesforce will provide a unified
experience across all these platforms
you can log in through your Android
phone and work on whatever you left from
your desktop that's the beauty of it the
table on the bottom of the screen what
it basically talks about this right now
if you looked at a food store form on a
salesforce.com system developing that
system generally takes 80% of clicks and
only 20% of code what it means is I am
able to configure a system or prepare a
system
specifically for a customer with nothing
but just using an internet connection
with a broadband connectivity its clicks
so what we mean to do what we do is you
basically log in to Salesforce there are
ways of customizing your screen right
inside Salesforce and you don't have to
write at all a lot of code to do that
whereas traditionally all systems be it
s AP be it traditional CRM systems in
terms of say like Siebel they are mostly
coding based so you see effort of almost
80% is is concentrated on the coding
part so this is how Salesforce
differentiates itself from the market
the next three slides actually provide a
base overview in terms of what the three
clouds is I won't go through these
slides in a lot of details because it
would be better if we talked about all
this on the session starting from fifth
of a fifth of September we would have
detailed almost two-hour sessions for
each of these three aspects in a broad
overview if I have to talk about sales
cloud sales cloud is basically around
selling your product selling your
services to a climbing line and sales
cloud actually has a lot of aspects
which you can see in the bottom image of
this field which is their own leaves and
data accounts and contact chatter touch
opportunities these are these are
actually like what can I call them these
are actually like the bread and butter
of Salesforce sales cloud is like the
most important thing which works within
salesforce.com enterprise second service
cloud service cloud is basically
something like you have already sold the
product as a company you have already
sold the product now your customers
actually we have some queries we have
some complaints and so on so what do you
do you have to obviously get the remain
in touch with your customer
right you have to answer their queries
your cancer their complaints you find
ways to provide services to these
customers service cloud is actually that
way of interacting with your customers
and getting in touch with them so that
they and ladies get answered in the best
possible fashion again so his cloud is
something that will come up extensively
in the neck in the classes that we'll
have from 5th October onwards I am
hoping a few of you would definitely be
there to go through the videos let me
take you to the next section which is
marketing cloud the marketing cloud as
the name suggests it's very it's really
I would say intuitive marketing is all
about promoting your services promoting
your products used by using the
marketing cloud what you do is basically
you try and pitch your products in front
of the customers and ensure that they
get are they remember your products they
like your products they want to then
look at these products and then order
these products so till the point the
products are actually sold which is the
sales functionalities of the sales cloud
functions what marketing cloud is what
companies really look at in terms of
exciting customers through various
promotional schemes through various kind
of promotional offers and so on there
are different marketing campaigns which
go on and so on that's marketing cloud
for you this is something I won't go
into this is actually what we call it
the data model this diagram in itself is
something that we will discuss at least
for one hour during our sessions from
fifth October onwards we'll have 16 hour
sessions from 5th October on from sorry
ever onwards this discussion itself will
take at least one and a half hours to
discuss it's like an entire session in
itself because this is how Salesforce is
oriented this is how Salesforce actually
is in the what I what can I call it it's
the way Salesforce is actually organized
to make sure that all the CR
processes are available now I spoke
about three important facts at the end
towards the end of this presentation
one is Business Objects it's like the
bones are the building blocks of our
body without Business Objects you can't
do anything the image that you see on
the right hand side it actually talks of
the different objects which sales force
provides but Business Objects is
typically the way in which you will
always try and organize your information
so that you can relate that information
from one object to another object of
course we will get into a lot more
details of each of these objects as we
progress but then that's how Business
Objects work business objects is
basically the way in which we are able
to connect one set of information with
another set of information it's not like
so I gave you the example right you have
your products in one system say like
it's AP you have your customer related
details in another system if you can't
connect the two dots what's the purpose
of having that information what business
objects will do is it will ensure that
the two information save with two
different blocks get connected through
some way we will talk about how they
connect what information how is it that
this kind of a relationship is
maintained and so on we will talk about
it in the detail sessions but for now
that's the purpose of Business Objects
of course on the right hand side you can
see some images but more importantly is
are the bullets which are provided on
the left hand side these are the tools
without these tools any Salesforce
administrator or a configuration expert
would just be he would just not be able
to work these are the different tools
which any any configurator or any
administrative uses to develop a
salesforce.com
and finally I just kept this slide for a
very important thing this is an actual
salesforce.com user interface when you
log into salesforce.com
you will actually see this is the way in
which things are organized look how
clean salesforce.com systems are
honorable and this is one of the mean
USPS of Salesforce the reason why it
sells in the market it looks beautiful
it is easy to navigate through of course
when you see you will obviously see my
meal in the featuring it's because this
is from my own salesforce.com on what we
will also learn as a part of our
detailed sessions from 5th September
onwards is the fact how do you create
your own salesforce.com
application or organize or organization
for yourself because once only when you
have this organization you will be able
to do a lot of customizations changes on
the systems at so on of course we will
go through this how do we people do
those changes and so on most importantly
anyone asks you what is the best part
about Salesforce I think 9 out of 10
clients would come back and say it's the
UI which is so easy to use I love
Salesforce user interface finally coming
to the last aspect that we want to
discuss today after this I will take the
questions that you guys have analytics
this is the buzzword in the industry
right now anyone trying to just
implement Greenfield systems is not that
successful unless that person is also
able to sell an analytic solution an
analytic solution basically means two
things one reports which is like logical
or logically organizing data into
different groups
second is dashboards representing that
same organized data through charts to
tables through some graphs that's what
the two kind of
or the analytical tools are how does
Salesforce maintain all of it what you
will see in terms of the image on in the
middle is actually a Salesforce
dashboard it's a sample dashboard with
Salesforce shows you will actually see
the beauty of looking at the information
what really happens is anyone who logs
into a system on a Salesforce system and
goes to the dashboards
he will always see a real-time update of
data beat through his mobile be it
through his laptop be through his tablet
real-time information is critical for
any customer relationship management
system and Salesforce excels there plus
what you will also get is each of these
blocks that you see in terms of these
different - puts the charts the what you
call on the gauge this the middle ones
which are semicircular are called gauges
push you can click on all of it to
actually see the data behind it that's
the beauty of sales was you actually see
what constitutes your dashboards it's
not lengths you prepare a dashboard
using excel you send it to someone and
then the other person sits and says that
the data is not available base data
cannot be shown it's not like that it's
as simple as seeing that entire data
right there in front of you and how is
it that that spanning from the dashboard
that's the beauty of salesforce
analogies of course this is again a
representation of how salesforce reports
are prepared reason I kept it here is
very simple yes
all of you move most of our rather most
of you would have seen reports if you
see this particular screen you'll see
three as three aspects of it one is the
vertical column on the Left which is
known as field pane to which I have
provided an information which says drag
and drop fields all you need to do when
you create an importance just pick up
any of these
we compare of the left pull it and keep
it on the bottom right-hand side which
is known as a preview screen that field
will come up there all the information
below that particular field will come up
there
second the the preview screen which is
basically in terms of seeing what you
want to actually see that report so it's
not always you want to see all the
fields you want only specific fields so
you pick only the relevant fields from
your left please
drop them in the preview pane and
they'll organize by themselves you can
obviously move fields across from right
to left and so on third thing the one
above preview the preview screen is the
praetor's 3d test is basically a way of
clubbing your data or making sure you
don't have to see all the data for the
entire rod or the entire salesforce.com
application you can say I want to see
the data for only the last 10 days and
that's it your data will be available in
the preview screen of course what
happens is below the preview screen
there is a button called Save report
moment you click on that save reboot it
will take you and show the entire report
in a beautiful fashion plus what sales
loss also provides this once you have a
report that immediately export it out to
excel with all the formatting intact and
that's the beauty of it so sales force
reports can also be taken out into Excel
and then further modifications can be
done based on how companies work so
that's a company to company preference
in terms of whether someone wants to
customize it further whether someone is
happy with the recorded sales force or
so on dashboards as I spoke up it's as
beautiful as you can get you cannot get
better dashboards and what sales was
provides yes there are a lot of
reporting tools which provides that
boots you can do a lot of stuff with
dashboards from Salesforce and nowadays
a lot of companies also integrate their
reporting systems to Salesforce to get
all the data
from Salesforce reporting systems and
prepare - words but Salesforce has its
own set of beautiful dashboards which
you get practical
best part is anyone and everyone can do
that in sales rose it's that easy
so guys I am done with my presentation
it's time for your questions it's time
for it varies post your queries or the
chat chat window I'll start going
through the questions starting from top
and maybe in the next 10 minutes or so
we'll quickly try and wrap up this
session ok I see almost a lot of
questions having come in ok ok anjali
has a question I'm the instructor at a
do-deca and taking training sessions of
Salesforce yes Anjali I am I'll be the
one who'll be interacting over a month
over 16 hours on weekends starting from
5th of September if you want to learn
about Salesforce I will be there to talk
about sales woes and its different
aspects I am hoping that you will be
there thank you
next question ok let me just scroll down
a little bit ok one question which has
come in from some idioms companies like
monster tops I'm moving from Siebel to
sale so what does is MVC hold for future
the answer for this actually lies in the
way the market is moving so what happens
is monster.com would have in task force
which is moving around in the market and
trying to gather a lot of details you
can't expect the sales team or the sales
reps to come back to their base
locations then type in all the data that
they collected and so on in the system
salesforce provides you with that kind
of mobility that you can actually keep
entering your data as you keep
collecting your data so you will spend
your precious time collecting that
information not entering that
information this is the way the industry
is moving it wants
based solutions it wants digitalization
of solutions it wants to move to a
solution where you don't have to come
back to your systems to enter the data
that's where Salesforce is gaining over
Siebel and right now Salesforce is
almost like number one CRM application
which available of course there are a
lot more in terms of even without
computing but sale you can't beat
Salesforce where it is so Kenya has a
question and I think it has been
answered by EDI Rekha itself in terms of
whether the recorded file will be
available or not the answer to it
obviously is yes Adi Rekha will share
with you the recorded file of this
session ok next question is so myth has
a question again it says can you write
the URL you mentioned to learn as a non
developer user so submit the URL is
trust dot salesforce.com just google it
you will find this URL it so widely
known you are so mittens another
question and it's an interesting one
Salesforce is getting obsoleted what
about this MVC not in the next 15 to 20
years of it there isn't a better
solution there isn't the more I would
say a solution a CRM solution which is
so stable which is so feature
feature-rich right now in the market yes
Microsoft has brought its own CRM
solution which is Microsoft Azure plus
you have I think Amazon also has is
trying space but then next 15 to 20
years Salesforce is not get it going
anywhere it is the market leader right
now and it will remain the market leader
Ravi Malhotra has a question how the
Salesforce connect to social media like
Facebook and Twitter what happens is
Rami will have say you will post ads on
Facebook and Twitter
with links to that particular product
movement you click on that link and you
provide that information what you can do
is through the web forms you can
actually get all that information into
Salesforce that's how it generally
connects Tao sees has a question is it
possible to migrate all the businesses
on Salesforce
if he s how does a design consultancy
how a design consultancy can migrate
these businesses of Salesforce let me
answer this first started before I get
into your second question answer to that
is yes you can do that only thing is it
will need a lot of investment in terms
of developing systems and applications
from scratch but can you not do that yes
you can do that because on Salesforce
using force.com remember pass on
force.com you can build your entire
organization processes systems on sales
force that Stansell I hope I have
answered your question toss it second
question if salesforce is so visible
then why customer end is having the
application in which testament and see
which product is most suitable I don't
actually get the question if salesforce
is so visible then why customers end is
having the application in which
customers and see which product is more
suitable thus if you could just reword
this question once again I'll go through
the detail your question once a company
she cons has a question what is the
future of Salesforce so she can't right
now what's happening is Salesforce is
like the leader in in the CRM space
across the world a lot of
implementations on sales cloud marketing
cloud and service cloud are happening
plus thousands and thousands of
organizations are now trying to build
custom applications which maybe are
related to inventory management which
may be related to HR Sulli
on sales was why because the license
cost related to building those solutions
of sales versus team so sales force is
not going anywhere for at least the next
15 20 30 years and at the same time
Salesforce has really so sales force
brings in something new to the market
every three years every three months or
so so we have something which is new to
the market known as lightning and with
Salesforce says is actually going to
revolutionize the way people look at our
CRM applications in terms of the UI it's
going to be that feature-rich
but it will still be available through
the internet to the quickest of
downloads Anjali has a question the
course that we will talk about does it
cover development or for slaughter so
Anjali couple of things there for
Salesforce as I and as I think we
discussed it in one of the slides it's
80% clicks and 20% coding so I talked
about the 80% bit so you will be able to
do 80% system configuration based on
what I will teach you throughout the
course the coding bit is not something
which I talked about because I am NOT
coded I am a business analyst from a
functional consultant movement so when I
work on my Salesforce projects I
identify the bit of coding that will be
required i identify the requirements I
develop the coding related overall
solution and then they hand it over to
the coding people to do that a very
pertinent question from Kranthi
can you differentiate between an SF
developer which is Salesforce developer
sales for the administrated configurator
so Kranthi the answer to it is
straightforward
administrated and a configurator are the
same thing now a Salesforce developer
versus an administrator is a little
different a Salesforce administrated
will do two things first he will plan
out in terms of how your overall system
would work so your Salesforce
administrator is the one who will give
shape to the organization plus there are
times when the Salesforce
administrator also does the functional
configuration or the clique related
configuration when you can't do certain
things by straightforward Salesforce
features you use Salesforce developers
to develop the coding myth that's called
customization of sales so the sales was
development thus customization a
Salesforce administrator or configurator
does configuration Sreenivas has a
question which is a repeated question am
i going to cover both admin and
development part in between session I
will cover the administration part
development part is something which
since I am NOT the expert there I will
not be there to talk about development
of course we'll talk in brief about the
language that is used for development
but that's it copal has a beautiful
question what are the prerequisites to
learn sales was basic to the point
Cooper thank you for asking this
question coupons the prerequisites are
very straightforward the prerequisites
are you need a laptop you need an
internet connection in terms of your
knowledge you just and so I will tell
you Gopal how I started love learning
fields was I just knew basics around
using Microsoft Excel so whenever I
initially when I started initially with
Salesforce and there were kind
requirements I used to think about it
from an Excel standpoint that look this
is how my data is organized now this is
what my client is asking me to do how
would I do that in Excel do would I copy
it directly there would I be able to
reference one field to another that's
how easy Salesforce learning is until
Mara has a solution how does this
product different from BPM and then it's
a very different tool than a BPM tool a
BPM tool will help you to configure your
processes yes I am NOT a BPM expert but
from my experience of BPM tool will help
you to plan out or chalk out the entire
process
here in Salesforce you will implement a
specific CRM process on a tool which
will help you to implement the solution
it's software solutions for CRM it's not
a process mapping tool Ganesh has a
question do we have training session on
Salesforce specifically the HR module
then is the answer to that is there is
no specific training module for
Salesforce focusing on nature because
Salesforce is not an HR solution but
there are a couple of exercises where I
will actually test your understanding on
Salesforce to develop a HR solution in
the recruiting space in case you are
interested I would love to have you
there and see your expertise on HR
because I want that HR flavor to come
out when we talk of that particular case
very crafty has a question can we
integrate a model from Salesforce say
chatter into another app yes we can
drunky that's actually how we do it
through web service through web services
using ap is how ia s infrastructure as a
service is different from staffs at pass
and that's a question from Venkatesh
when kit is the answer to it is it's
different from SAS I'm sure you would
have understood by now infrastructure as
a service and platform as a service are
basically very similar very similar I
don't know how I would be able to
differentiate between the two basically
there is still a little bit of
difference and infrastructure as a
service I I would typically think it's
like a bare minimum server with a
platform like Salesforce like force.com
platform as a service you still have
some basics in terms of the way system
is oriented and so on software as a
service is completely different it's the
software which is available it's a
consumer software which is there
Ganesh has another question how
difficult would it be for a technology
no Vistula salesman
so that is my answer to this is very
simple again five years back I had never
worked with a ninety in Plymouth patient
I am a guy who has worked with
manufacturing in a poor R&amp;amp;D sector
I had never learned any technology
product before that today I sit before
you and I am giving the training on
sales force it's a tool which if you
like you will really learn very quickly
similar question by Anjali I know C C++
how easy will it be too big so until you
all I understand in terms of the
development part is it's not very
different from the way coding is done
the basics are non-coding in terms of
the logic remains same the basic
differences in terms of how is it that
the language is configured Chandra you
have a question what are the primary
differences between C 1 and C and so I
think I gave that when I talked about
on-premise systems and on-demand systems
Ramprasad has a question how many days
to complete both admin and development
so I'll be talking about the admin part
so admin is something that will have a
16 hour go spread over four weekends
Saturday Sunday through four hours over
a weekend for weekends so that 16 hours
Kranthi I think I have answered this
question difference between a Salesforce
developer Salesforce admin and
configurable I hope you get down to do
that picture as much the question that
you that you have in terms of it is
difficult for me while working with
workflows there the easy process to
learn workflows
work on workflows you learn that's the
way I learned it there's no better way
to learn workflows Ravi Malhotra has a
question can sales must work offline
and come back one salesforce1 the user
is connected to network yesterday we saw
new features of Salesforce which are
coming it is actually allowing offline
connectivity so what do you do is you
can do a bit of offline work moment you
can't connect your system back to the
network it was sync called the data
Hollinger I see your question which is a
bit technical in terms of a life cycle
of a case of a web 2 case you would have
to come back to the session to learn
about the entire web to case
functionality for the bit for the
greater good of the entire group here I
wouldn't want to delve into it right now
Raghava another question I would like to
know whether I can take up since he has
some you can that's the reason why I am
talking about this session I think it's
an easy system to talk about it's an
easy system to learn join the course and
go through the webinars think through
and then join the session
Venkatesh has a question what about
placements for freshers compared to
experience guides please freshers
generally would get placed in terms of
developer roles and basic business
analysts who would typically talk of
system configuration experience people
of course based on what they have what
they know and what they do that's a
different that's a different ballgame
one today
I see Tarun having Tyrone Gupta has
asked about what are the kind of job
opportunities let us just do a NOC
research on in terms of certifying
post.com are certified sales for
developer you get the answer it's it's
as simple as that she can good question
from your end is that the data secure in
the cloud computing it's very secure and
that's the reason why I am saying go to
that say go to that URL called trust got
salesforce.com
ah guys I'll have to quickly take maybe
the next only three or four more
questions and I see the same question
coming up again and again I hope I have
answered that question around
differences between Salesforce developer
administrator and deleted scenes cloud
and service cloud which one is
preferable if so Ram Prasad the answer
to that is companies which want to
implement sales processes look at sales
cloud companies which want to look at
service related features with that
service cloud there are companies which
one to look at both they get both of
them that's sales cloud was a service
cloud Kranthi I think the same question
is being posted by you for almost the
last 15 20 times I hope I have answered
your question in terms of differences
between sales flows developer
administrated and configurator yes I
hope I have ok vanish again a similar
question how difficult would it be to
learn for a coding knowledge to learn
Salesforce Danny I am not even a coding
Louis but I have learned Salesforce
I think that answers your question right
ok Ausmus has a question that if I am
teaching only admin part who will teach
the developer and integration part so as
much this course 16 hours is too less
even for the admin part but I will
include all the admin related part
currently you will have to get back to
edit a cup for the developer and the
integration part I am not the right
person who will be able to give you
these details
Liam you have asked a very good question
and I don't think this is the right
moment to talk about my experiences and
I am well how my job experience it's
been good it's been a learning
experience I am Anna stuff yes it helps
you to learn a lot of things I hope I
have given a couple of witnesses in
there what our life was back then
Kranthi you have a question on
certifications Salesforce has a lot of
certifications which you can do there is
an iodine certification which is known
as to zero one to start with
you can obviously get into advanced
administrated as well then you have
specific certifications on sales cloud
service cloud marketing cloud as a dev
number you have certification signa as a
developer which is four zero one and
then there is an advanced developer hope
that answers your question
Ramprasad you have a question am i I am
in to.net I want to migrate am i
suitable yes you are Roggeveen I think
your question is also similar I am from
mainframe background can I take it up or
no you just have to unlearn a couple of
things about via the frame because
mainframe deals with databases of
servers here you won't have to work on
databases and servers account you'll
have to work in terms of what the front
view is the user in front of you want
shaitana the question how them
development certification will help the
candidates will he'll will be helpful to
experienced candidates so she can what
happens is it's like gaining from
getting that kind of acceptance in the
market that's what certifications always
happy it's never been abandoned and
that's a question by she reverses well
it's never been abandoned you will there
have a lot of people in the market who
are sales good sales force developers
good sales for that we distribute knives
but then they don't have certifications
I myself didn't have my certifications
in the certified but was it that I
didn't get get into projects I went I
got a lot of projects didn't we do hope
that answers their question same
question by a azmuth is the
certification important as a pressure or
experience it's not asthma so basically
what you will need to do is yes it's
helpful to show that you know Salesforce
but obviously when you get into your job
where you try and apply for jobs when
you get into your interviews you'll have
to explain Salesforce that's important
for you all the way so guys I think
that's the end of our questions thank
you for all your time thank you for
being with me here I am hopeful that I
would see a few of you out there during
my sessions from 5th of September
onwards right now the sessions are
scheduled from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. on the
evenings in case there is a change in
plan on the timeline on the time front
we will communicate to all of you soon
enough
thanks thanks guys for your time thank
you so much and hope we'll meet in the
next four to five days thank you bye bye
and good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
