cop and I welcome you all to this
session on GCP pricing now DCP stands
for Google cloud platform and we would
be understanding it from the pricing
perspective but before we do that let's
quickly take a look at today's agenda
first these are the parameters are the
points which I'm going to discuss in
this session that is how does one choose
a service or what are the different
pricing fundamentals after that I would
also talk about various pricing models
that GCP has to offer to you its pricing
innovations and pricing features as well
finally I would finish things off with
the GCP calculator and zcp free tier I
hope this is clear to all of you so
let's not waste any time and get started
then now choosing a service well every
customer considers following points as
and whether the services customer
friendly its transparent and
pocket-friendly GCP also takes care of
all these points it is highly customer
friendly and it is also very transparent
now how is that when when you talk about
transparency GCP offers something called
as a free tier now it solves various
problems which customers normally face
so what are those problems
well customers normally have to pay a
lot of money upfront and then they get
access to the services so they're not
sure whether they should invest so much
money or not what GCP does is it gives
you a free tier or a free trial which
lasts one long year and you can use all
those services for free plus all the
services provided by DCP do not charge
any upfront costs that means you do not
pay in advance
so yes when you talk about transparency
DCP is highly transparent apart from
that it is highly pocket friendly as
well now when I talk about these points
once we move further with the session
you would understand these points in
detail because I would be covering all
the points that are related to pricing
and irrespectively are out of turn we
would be discussing these points as well
so bear with me meanwhile and let's move
to the next point of discussion that is
various fundamentals are the pricing
fundamentals when you talk about pricing
fundamentals every service provider
considers these points what are its
compute capacities services and how
affordable are those what kind of
storage it provides whether it meets the
needs of the user
and again is it affordable when you talk
about data transfers the points we
consider are whether the data transfer
is fast it is reliable it is secure and
again is it affordable or not when you
talk about DCP it takes care of all
these points and based on these points
it has built various models that let you
choose and plan your cloud services very
nicely so let's move further and take a
look at those models one by one firstly
we have something called as no upfront
costs I think I've already discussed
this point a little so let's move
further and discuss this little more
what DCP does is it provides you with a
free tier and apart from that it charges
or asks you for no upfront costs
whatsoever that is you'd be paying only
for those services which you are using
and that too after you have used it the
billing properties which GCP uses are
very nice so when you talk about upfront
costs there absolutely nothing here
pay-as-you-go model yes
DCP takes this in a literal sense what
GCP does is it charges you per second or
for the services which you've used on
second basis so what happens here is say
for example you are using a particular
service for a minute or a two GCP will
charge you only for those minutes and
nothing else if you compare it with a
debase head abuse charges you on the
alley basis what happens is say for
example you are using the service for 20
minutes aw we'll charge you for one
complete our DCP is different here it
will charge you on second basis so if
you are using a service for a minute or
two normally you'd be using a service
more than that but consider you are
using it for just a minute or two in
that case we'll be charged only for that
minute and nothing else so yes it is
literally pay-as-you-go in real sense no
termination fees since you are paying
second wise this is no concern about
termination fees there are no upfront
costs and there are no costs charged to
you after you end the services or stop
using the services - so that means you
are paying only for what you are using
and this is the best way so you do not
have to worry about anything today you
feel like stopping or ending your
account with GCP you can do that and zcp
will stop billing you the very second
you stop it's so
services are using its services rather
so these are the different models which
GCP considers but there are quite a few
other innovations which GCP has brought
into its pricing models so let us move
further and take a look at those as well
now we have something called as
sustained use discount what happens here
well what GCP does is it has something
called as Google Cloud compute engine
now it automatically lowers the price of
a virtual machines when you use them to
run its sustained workloads that means
more the instances you use and for the
longer duration the less amount you're
paying and what this does is GCP
actually provides you with a discount of
somewhere on 25% when you use these VMs
are when you go for the sustained use
discounts so yes again you're saving a
lot of money here let me give you a
heads up in this video we'll be talking
about a lot of pricing and that would
lead me to use these terms like you
would be saving a lot of money and this
is the amount of percentages which you
are saving so bear with me and I hope
you would understand why I would be
using these terminologies again and
again next on this list we have per
second billing yes I've discussed this
point quite a few times rather so I
won't be discussing this any further
let's move to the next point directly
that is preemptable VM instances now
what happens is there quite a few
services which people need to implement
in batch processes that means the
lifespan can be smaller so if your
system is highly fault tolerant and you
can actually better use this smaller
lifespan kind of instances this feature
is for you because it will help you save
a lot of money and that lot of money
would be somewhere on 80% of your total
investments so yes preemptable VM
instances a lot of saving : have you
ever worried about the archives or the
storage that has to deal with archives
if yes you know that you deal with
problems like slow transfer rates and
slowness in the total process now this
is where cold line is very different it
provides you services at the cost of
these slow services that are there in
the market that means it is very cheap
but the services which it provides are
very fast and very nice and those are
called as cold line storage services and
if you use these you're actually
and would be very nice for you to do all
the operations at a very faster pace
next we have something called as custom
machine types
now what GCP does is it involves or
includes a lot of machine learning in
most of its usage or services what that
does is that lets you have real time
analysis on lot of things and when you
talk about customization since you are
using GCP services what it does is it
calculates the amount of services which
you use and accordingly what it does is
it suggests you the most customized
machine types which you can use and thus
you end up saving a lot of money again
right sizing recommendations now it is
similar to what I just discussed right
sizing is choosing the right amount of
services it is not always about choosing
services that are huge in size rather
what you do is you go ahead and choose
those services that are smaller in size
that meet your needs and solve all your
business problems and that - at an
affordable price this is what right
sizing is and this is where GCB again
helps you it has so many ml algorithms
and those algorithms what they let you
do is they kind of help will cut down on
lot of unnecessary sizing issues and
thus you end up saving a lot of money
here - committed use discounts yes we
talked about something called a
sustained use discount it is similar
what you can do is if you use it two
instances for longer durations when you
talk about DCP you are actually going to
pay a lot lesser why is that GCP gives
you 25% discount on sustained usage of
its VMs or its instances so again if you
have committed use you are going to get
a lot of discounts again so these are
various pricing innovations which GCP
has brought in the market now that we've
understood these let us move further and
understand the next point of discussion
next what we have is GCP pricing
features firstly we talked about cloud
pricing leaders now DCP leads the pack
when you talk about pricing I think I've
mentioned this already but let me
reiterate it now AWS is leading in terms
of various cloud service providers in
the market and if you compare its
pricing with GCP GCP is still 60% more
effort able than what AWS is
so when you talk about pricing
leadership yes it goes to GCP again
purpose-built servers chips and switches
yes we all know that google is a huge
organization and when you talk about
various features like built-in servers
data centers tips switches well it has
very advanced technology and that is why
it has great data centers which are
technologically very advanced and this
actually helps you save on a lot of
money how because they innovate so many
things and based on those innovations
your costs are continuously cut down in
n number of ways as you move further we
would be discussing those as well
milliseconds matter now yes going back
to previous point milliseconds do matter
and what GCP does is it helps you cut
down on various costs how say for
example you are concerned with booting
up your system now when you talk about
booting up GCP lets you boot up your
systems in our instance rather in just
35 seconds now that is a very less
amount of time and since you can boot up
so fast you are saving a lot of time
again a lot of energy - and hence you
save money so when you talk about
milliseconds - GCP will actually take
care of that as well
data center efficiency through deepmind
ml now machine learning is something
that actually inspires me a lot and I
have been working in machine learning
for some time now and what I figured out
is using machine learning you can do so
many cool things and GCP also uses
machine learning very well what it does
is it actually lets you engage or gauge
various power sources now when you talk
about cloud services your main concern
is the heating up issues and the
electricity which you are using what GCP
does is it uses deepmind to calculate
the amount of electricity that is
consumed and it helps you optimize that
electricity - by 40% hence you end up
saying somewhere on 50% of the total
cost which you would otherwise invest in
the electricity or all those things not
you basically GCP and since GCP invests
less money in all these things it
actually lowers its prices for various
services that you use and that is why
zcp is so affordable so this was about
different GCP pricing features let us
further and try to understand the next
point then now GCP provides you with a
calculator all this while we have been
discussing how GCP pricing is good how
it helps you lower your costs and all
those things but what about calculating
the money which you are going to spend
because even though you are spending
lists you still need to keep a track of
the services which you are using as in
okay what are the services I'm using and
how much money am I paying for it if you
are worried about that don't worry about
it because GCP has something called as a
DCP calculator and what it does is it
lets you calculate all the money which
you might invest in your services and
thus you can keep a track of all the
investments that you are supposed to do
in your near future as well now once I
get into the demo part I would be
discussing the calculator in little more
depth so before we do that let's cover
one more topic and then we can switch to
the demo part so what do you exactly get
in the free trial now I talked that DCP
provides you with something called as a
free trial or a free tier rather now in
that free tier what GCP does is it gives
you access to all of its services for
free for 12 months and there are certain
services which you are charged for but
that is after a certain limit say for
example you have a particular service
and say for example you have a storage
service you can store some around 10 GB
of data what you can do is you can
actually go ahead and store 10 GB of
data on monthly basis and if you exceed
that limit that is when GCP will charge
you so what GCP does is it also gives
you something called as $300 balance now
this balance is something you can use
when you exceed these free limits during
your trial period so when you talk about
a free trial yes you have a lot of
services to use that are free of cost
but there are certain limits on it and
once you cross those limits you still
have this $300 balance in your account
which you can go ahead and use to pay
for these services as well so you get
sufficient access to all the services
which GCP has to offer to you now what I
am going to do is I am going to actually
go ahead and switch into the demo part
so that we can understand as in how the
calculator works and what is the free
trial and what all services are given to
you in this free trial so what I am
going to do now is I'm going to actually
go ahead and give you a demo of how the
free trial and
calculator works so meanwhile I do that
just bear with me because I need to
quickly switch into my GCP website so
yeah what I've done is I've actually
gone I'd and I've opened the website of
Google cloud platform as you can see on
my screen we have something called as
DCP free tier in order to access this
free tier you have to go ahead and
create an account on GCP website to do
that you'll have to perform certain
formalities or undergo certain
formalities that is firstly we'll have
to given your credit card details
do not worry GCP won't charge you
anything for this but yes there is a
verification process and for that
verification process GCP does deduct one
dollar from your account and that one
dollar is actually refunded back into
your account and this process happens
very quickly so you won't have to worry
about anything after this let me assure
you that no money is deducted or
refunded from your account unless it is
asked to you now once you've created an
account you will be having an access to
various services which DCP has to offer
to you and once those are that span
expires after that GCP will ask you
would you want to upgrade to our
services and if you say yes only after
that your billing cycle would start so
when you give in your credit card
details stay assured that you won't be
charged anything so let's move further
and try to understand this free tier a
little more firstly you have an access
for 12 months in that certain services
are available to you for free and those
are free always there are certain
services which have certain limits if
you cross those limits you will be
charged but those limits are very high
and I don't think there should be any
problem of you exceeding those limits so
as far as trial basis is concerned
you're covered completely if you are
supposed to use some ApS and all those
things for which you have to pay do not
worry about that as well GCP gives you a
credit balance of three hundred dollars
and you can pay for those services using
this balance so all in all when I say a
free tier this is a free tier again in a
complete true sense so let us move
further and take a look at few of its
products that GCP has to offer and there
certain services here we have something
called as Google App Engine using which
you can create your apps you have your
data store where you can actually do
various reads rights and deletes per day
and you have something called as your
Google come
engine which lets you perform various
compute services and there are certain
limits that are given to you and these
limits are more than enough as in the
amount of transactions and operations
which you can perform is huge so I would
suggest that you to go through this
website and understand these things in
detail next we have some other services
that is how these storage works and what
are its utility is that you need to
consider then you have something called
as your Google pub sub I won't be
getting into the details of these topics
one-by-one but they're quite a few
services which you can actually access
then we have something called as
kubernetes no kubernetes is nothing but
a containerization technique yes we do
have a session on this thing so I would
request you to go through that video as
well that video is there on YouTube and
you can actually refer that video if you
want to which talks about Kuban it is in
detail now GCP lets you integrate with
Kuban at ease as well or lets you take
this approach as well the other things
say for example you have something
called as a stag driver you have your
big query now big queries very huge and
very nice when you talk about big data
analysis and yes you GCP lets you use
this as well you have your cloud speeds
and you have other services here I would
request you to go to these services one
by one and try to understand them little
more they're pretty simple and fairly
easy to understand and depending upon
your usage or your business needs you
can actually go ahead and consider using
these services also so this was about
the free tier as in what it is and what
all it has to offer there are quite a
few sessions available here which would
talk about how to get started and all
those things you may refer those as well
for now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to switch into the calculator part
so yes this is how the calculator
basically looks like it lets you compute
or calculate all your expenses which you
might pay in your future say for example
firstly this is the by default selection
which says the compute engine
now if you've used the cloud services
you'd realize that what compute services
and compute engines do basically you'll
be dealing in lot of instances and
you'll be charged accordingly so you can
actually go ahead and calculate the
process of your instances or your uses
basically say for example I'm using
three instances here and I say give me
an estimate as and what is the total
price which I'm supposed to pay here I
can get in or end
all the details that are there as in
what is the OS I'm using whether it's
sent to us which is the standard OS
which normally people use we have our
Ubuntu year and other service providers
as well you can select the type of
instance and all those things and you
can just go ahead and say add my
estimate and it would give you details
as in this is the amount which would be
paying you'd be paying somewhere around
$3 3.8 $8 a month you can even go ahead
and save these estimates just for
reference sake as in say for example
during a particular month you've used so
many instances and in your future you
want to keep a track of it you have an
option of saving these details or you
can even go ahead and mail these details
to yourself so this was about just the
compute part you can calculate all the
other costs as well as in how much the
App Engine would cost you you're Cuban
it is your cloud storage and all those
things so it gives you cost of almost
everything and you can keep track of
whatever that is there apart from that
once you start using these services
based on different projects you can
again estimate as in how much money have
you invested how much are you paying
how can you resize those right size
those how can you optimize your cost in
various aspects and everything that is
why you have this calculator and it will
take care of almost all the problems
that you're supposed to deal with so
this was about the basic introduction as
far as a calculator is concerned and
your free tier is concerned I hope you
all had something new to learn in this
so-called small demo as far as this
session goes I would be ending this
session here in here I hope you had
something new to learn out of this
session and I hope to see you all again
