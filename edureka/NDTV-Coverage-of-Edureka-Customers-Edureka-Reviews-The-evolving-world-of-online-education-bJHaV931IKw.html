experts are predicting a growth of
nearly 17 percent by 2018 it will also
be worth nearly 1.2 billion dollars and
with increasing private equity
investments coming into the sector
edu tech startups to have the gun
shifting focus to delivering skill based
training what a venire using interactive
online sessions or live sessions take a
look at how it's changing the landscape
of professional education Akash Martin
Rajeev the spars are two typical
professionals working in major companies
in India Akash is 40 and a product
manager at a telecommunications firm in
Bangalore Rajeev Biswas on the other
hand is an engineering graduate and a
working professional while both are well
placed in their respective careers they
have left the path and done the
unthinkable both of them have decided to
become students once again I didn't have
that much professional knowledge to do
advanced mayn't in my projects so I
myself started looking for force Rajeev
is not alone Akash has also decided to
venture out mid-career to learn new
skills in his case to learn what Big
Data is all about but for both these
professionals leaving their career was
not an option this is where
internet-based courses came to the
rescue as an option that gave Akash and
Raji the flexibility to learn a new
skill without sacrificing their careers
together the two are a part of a new
breed of mid and senior level
professionals who are increasingly using
the internet to hone their existing
skills and gain an edge on the cartridge
atom in our industry it's very important
to stay abreast of time keep track of
what's going on in the latest in
technology and big data being one of the
you know upcoming things everybody is
kind of like trying to edge is exploring
what it means to them so I thought it'll
be a good idea to explore big data while
courses online are aplenty ranging from
massive open online courses or MOOCs to
free theoretical material and videos
online there are very few that
professional courses life and that was
something that both Akash and Rajeev
were keen on so what were the options
available to them
she obvious choice was interactive
online education or live sessions
specialized courses that allowed
students to familiarize themselves with
every single nuance of a subject lots of
other video online in classrooms until
but mostly they talked about the EOD
parts more about and not really related
to real-world examples also and here
that's the advantage that I can ask the
questions real-time whenever some class
is happening that I can actually raise
the questions and there are other
participants also who are really
experienced like Kenya's five years
experience they are putting they are
giving their feed vehicles so what
exactly would attending a typical online
interactive course or live session
entail four to six weeks of your time
with class flexibility as compared to a
one-year degree course while it would
cost you anywhere between one to four
lakh rupees at a college online
interactive courses give you the same at
quarter to half the costs but costs are
not the only reason to take into account
let's take a look at where the
differences begin and end for the two
courses while massive open online
courses are recorded and broadcast and
free to view for students around the
globe interactive courses are just the
opposite it is broadcast live enables
student-teacher interactions and to top
it all off have help desks that assist
students with their queries post-session
MOOCs have a model where the courses are
self-paced right so you have videos
available where I mean these are
obviously high quality videos they're
discussion forums where in MOOCs where
you can ask your questions but they
don't get and guaranteed response
typically people get stuck at the first
step itself say they're doing a project
and they want to set up their system
right that's where they stuck won't get
stuck most of the times in our case the
life support team helps them get past
that stage so that's where the model
difference the engagement is much more
higher it
difference between a MOOC and an
interactive session are the completion
rates while four to six percent of
students enrolled in a MOOC finish their
course experts say that the number is
higher for an interactive session
anywhere between 70 to 80 percent they
draw a line of comparison between the
amount paid for the course and the
completion rate they say that the higher
the fee paid by the student the more
likely he is to complete the course it
is a human tendency right I mean if
you're paying for something you value
that more so that is one factor the
other thing is that the completion rates
are determined not only by the money I
pay because if I do not like something I
will probably not waste my time on that
so completion rates are determined or
driven by the fact that how much I was
engaged in the course which I took so
and how much I could learn so there will
be different milestones during the
course also right it is not just that
you complete the whole thing so
intermediate milestones will determine
if I am able not able to reach milestone
one I will probably drop off at that
point
online education is also now changing
the landscape of the traditional
distance learning programs being cost
effective and bearing yearly maintenance
charges for the Institute's so what
really makes an online interactive
course click a lot has to do with the
business models and like broadcast
videos and massive open online courses
online interactive sessions differ in
every way from delivery to engagement
and monetization live sessions Bank on
delivery from experienced professionals
for scale upgradation while massive open
online courses are by and large
dependent on college theoretical
material for content and delivery live
sessions also bet on user engagement at
every level so our live sessions the
next big thing when it comes to online
education experts disagree and say that
there is always room for improvement
they watch for a model that takes the
best of both worlds and finally it all
comes down to the monetization model
something which can make or break the
company which provides the course MOOCs
have been struggling to cough up returns
which investors want to see owing to the
free courses that they provide while
they have come up with paid
certification models to aid this it has
done little to in
their situation on the other hand
experts say that interactive online
education has an edge only because they
have paid courses this takes care of
their monetization model in Bangalore
