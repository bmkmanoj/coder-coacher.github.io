models and about the colonel so colonel
as the most important it's a little core
of the Linux operating system so in
third module in three about the Linux
kernel and the different methods the
different files which are present under
slash tab and /proc directories and
followed by the most important you know
commands that that are necessary in
order to as a coming from a system admin
perspective how to check the processes
what is the memory usage how to check on
the disk space how to kill the processes
you know how to check the current status
of the process instantaneous status of
the processes running in the system you
get to see all the important comments so
starting with the Linux kernel which is
the core of the Linux operating system
so it basically helps you in connecting
it acts as an interface in between the
software and the hardware part so has a
mentioned before about the architecture
part if you want you can check the
architecture there is a command called
you name type a name so that you will
get to see the information about the
system and that picture as well here it
is x86 underscore six four similarly if
you want the version of the OS that you
have installed you can get it from that
file UTC Red Hat - release ok so this is
a 64 bit so it's of sports there are two
different types one is 32-bit as well as
the 64-bit okay so and there are some
limitations for both 32 as the less
64-bit it can support the 32-bit can
support a maximum of 4 GB RAM so they
are represented as xi6
so if you observe here there is another
kind of kernel kernel I can EA so if you
want to add additional RAM if you want
to have additional support or cram
you know you can go ahead by installing
this particular kernel that would help
you and having in supporting higher
values of Pamela 32-bit system alright
so by default 64-bit supports Ram higher
than 4x so as a part of your kernel
kernel is basically a set of modules you
will get personally different a list of
all the modules and I'll show you all
the different commands that you can use
in order to lift all the modules but we
will not be making any changes just for
understanding so how to unless the
models if there is a need how to insert
how to delete a specific module from the
existing list all right so all these
modules are linked it to the device
drivers and the firewall kind of
security related modules we'll get to
see and also you can see all the file
system related models as a part of it
yeah colonel ok so these are these are
the important utilities one is unless
one is in which we can let all the
modules ok so if you observe here you
can see IP tables there is something
called IP table in this list which is
related to the security part so like
that you can really the device related
modules and this list ok so like that so
LS model basically display all the
modules which are present as a part of
here colonel
so ok so if you if you want to remove a
specific module from the list
so Adam Adam 1 is the command to remove
the modules and then if you say if you
have downloaded a model and if you want
to insert it under the kernel existing
terminal you can load the model using
IMS mode command ok so what I'll do is I
will I will try to download some module
and and we can so that we can perform
these operations we can add in certain
make the changes to legs
still module list okay so before that so
modprobe
it loads and unloads the modules so
basically empty module also have
dependent since it involved okay you can
check the dependencies using the diploid
come on and then you can use modprobe
modprobe command in order to handle this
dependence between all the insert them
back to the kernel
okay so this is pretty much so usually
most of the time you won't get to use
any of this command these are like but
advanced level handling modules and all
but we will perform i'll i'll show you
how to insert and remove the modules
advanced we will take it to we i'll show
how to perform those operations and the
next session once you get familiar with
the rest of the system processes and
unix system all together okay
next is your unit are the image so in
your system if you go to slash OOP
alright so here you will get to see this
in it ram purpose a file called in a
tram at this okay so you can also get to
see inlet rd image here so basically
when you're tardy later a minute
ramekins will perform similar operation
we are a temporary file system alright
so what happens is a part in the file
system that you see currently when you
try to install or then you start your
system basically then the temporary file
system will get mounted initially
alright so this gate monster mountain
during the system loop so this is what
the file system that you will land up in
we use this single user mode if you
remember we have modified the grub line
going to the grow-op page when you start
your system that we have logged into the
single user mode so that is the that is
your temporary root file system where
and we can change the root password
okay so this
that is the retarding image that is that
would get unloaded into your system all
right so you can also create this images
if there is a new and that are the image
available what you can do is you can
download your trend and here are the few
steps on how to create it and use it
under the slash food directly so if you
remember here Italy let me show you my
drug dot one okay so if you see the grub
dot con here there are two kernels
present so I hope you remember in the
previous session we have discussed about
this say what is the current version of
the kernel we have in case if there is a
latest version of kernel available we
can download that RPM and we can install
that RPM so usually this is the scenario
that comes up when there is a need to
test a higher version or any other
version of the kernel that is available
so in order to test it we can download
the kernel we can make an entry in the
web.com when you restart your system you
will get to see both the kernels so you
can select the latest kernel and you can
start your system and you can see how
the kernel is performing so similarly
just like this there is another way so
this is another vo if you have a latest
India tire the image you can download it
and you can follow these steps and leave
them they sit on the same location and
you can start making use of them in the
tardy image as well alright so actually
if you remember right and in the next
file in the next operating system
everything is considered as a point
okay so we have seen normal files even
the directory is the kind of file all
right now I will show you some other
types of files that are available so if
you can see
so we have other folders like slash dev
and /proc okay so there you can get to
see some other types of files I will
show you now my VM is starting so there
you can get to see block block files or
block device files we can see other
pipes other types of files as well like
PI put files and character device files
like that so there are different
different kinds of files in fact every
device you know every device is
represented as a friend there is a
corresponding configuration file so
while they're interacting with the
device the corresponding calculation
file has to be modified the
corresponding private file will come
into the picture and that will try to
act as an interface between the you and
the device itself alright so one second
I'll show you those files so here itself
you can if you can see I hope I'm
audible to everyone can just one of us
can you please confirm okay thank you I
got it alright so here if you can see
there is the long listing of the files
under the directory called slash them
okay so here there are multiple device
files that are being listed here you can
see the file that starts with C give us
a character file alright and you can see
linker files small yell they are Lincoln
files and then you can you can see B
that represents the block files
alright so mostly all your disc related
files are represent last block points
alright and there is another kind of Chi
files called as pi parents all right so
this pipe of values there act as an
interface between two terminals that
means you can assign the message from
one turbulent and it gets broadcasted in
the other terminal we will see that as
an example see most of the time our
then you're normally files text files
scripts decreased and then Lincoln
points so these are primarily the kinds
of files will mostly be working on all
right
so rest of the rest of the file types
are just for the sake of understanding
so if you take device by block device
file so the best example is your desk
related files that handle blocks of data
chunks of data so they have a separately
different notation called as block
points all right when you try to
interact with the disk automatically the
corresponding driver will come into the
picture all right
so similarly there are for every driver
for every driver there is a separate
block file associated with them once
again I'll show you an example here
about one of the type of the file you
called five-foot-five all right ttyl is
your terminal
so just this is a very basic example of
you know have created a 5-foot file for
you
testing
you
okay so if you observe here right so
it's almost like whatever content that
you pass it to this type of file you can
you can observe this slash them by pipe
I mean I just given the general pype as
the notation so so here this is a piped
kind of file alright so this is the file
I created I mean usually we don't create
such kind of points so there is a
different example altogether here here
what we have done is here as we could do
something called slash the tty so even
that is one kind of it's a character
point okay so basically whatever content
that you pass it to these kind of the
files what it does is it's it's like
temporary it will it will keep the
content and if you try to access the
same pin again from a different location
it will try to give you all those
content so these are like special kinds
of files and then you can even see here
how it works here from this terminal
then we pass a message to this character
file automatically the same message will
be broadcasted in the other terminal
when you try to access that okay so
these are like this is how they handle
the data they handle the chunks of data
as well which you can cross it
considering I mean you can make this
file as an interface and you can pass it
from 120y to another terminal as well
but mostly we will be making use of
these files but just for your
understanding there are other types of
files
other than normal files we have block
files we have cracked the files we have
pipe files and dot okay so these are
some of the examples it's like blog
device files like /dev HD in my system
if I do have this L okay so here slashed
up is da one and then you have his deer
- okay so these are two options like
that we can we can see other files so
for every for every device that we
create in our system there is no there
may be a corresponding file that gets
generated okay so whenever we are we try
to save something in the disc that will
be interfaced to this particular file
which will be which will help in saving
the data to the corresponding with this
okay here if you see there is something
called slash the MV 0 + MD 1 so these
are related to logical volume that we
create in the system
alright so either logical volumes or
something here one one second - but I'll
just finish and then I am unmute you
alright so here if you see if there is a
concept called LVM logical volume
manager we will see how to create
logical volumes so basically you can
imagine it like a container alright so
so far you have seen that in the next
there are we there are partitions just
like in Windows that is a CD and always
drives even in Linux we have partitions
so this is the command fdisk - l is the
command is in which you can see the
partitions okay so here
/ - SDA one is one partition and splash
them SDA - is considered as another
partition but if you observe here it is
called as linux l vm so it's a logical
volume manager so you can consider this
as a container that hosts sub partitions
alright so there is some respect
- the number of partitions that we make
so rather than limiting ourselves to the
number of partitions what we do is so we
create one primary partition and then we
go on with the LVM concept so which
we'll see later when we create a
container inside which we can create n
number of partitions sub partitions okay
so these partitions so these kind of
piles are you know represented a there's
MD 0 1 like that okay and then these are
terminals you can you can open in the UI
you can open n number of terminals and
simply type TTY command and see see what
CDs of this list of terminal is that it
created and another one called as slash
dev slash none usually this is this is
like the black box okay so we're in
usually this is used in applications
where whatever output that comes right
parallel you want to save at some place
or you want to completely delete it from
the system redirecting that output to
slash dev slash null okay we'll very
completely what is it deleted completely
from the system it's like a black box so
what happens is when when running some
applications the output there are three
kinds of messages that came generated so
standard input standard output and
standard error it is a these are three
produce a notations that are available
so we usually whatever we give us an
input it is the STD I am so when you
exit the command I will give you a quick
example to understand this alright so
when we are running something quick so
whatever output comes when it is
displayed to your screen so that is you
have standard output okay and apart from
this if there is an error associated
when you execute the script or a command
that is called as the standard error
that comes to the screen okay so the
reason why I'm talking about please
prepare a little since what happens is
when running from scripts or
applications so whatever that comes to
the screen rather than displaying that
output on the screen we redirect that
content to slash Devlin
so that it is completely lost so there
are two ways so when executing script
okay so you might want to long the
output whatever comes
so among that they can be standard
output
there can be standard error as well
alright so you might want to read their
it standard error to a file and whatever
standard output comes that is something
you are already aware of so what you
will do do is give me director slash dev
slash Nell so that will be lost
okay so so that is one kind of file okay
so like that we have different different
types of device trills available in the
system and regarding slash dev slash
Nell usage of this I will I will show
you how you come up in scripting topic
so I will I write a script where and we
can see that the standard output file
you can store that just like creating
blocks would also be that the country is
slash table none alright so after going
through the files which are present
under slash them I the next one we will
cover is swash /proc will come to the
slash dev este of part later so if you
observe /proc you can hear it and you
can see this on the screen there are lot
of folders particularly marked in blue
right let me tell you I will give you an
example of this so oil process-related
slash croc stands for process created
points okay so so I'm just I will
explain this commander what I'm trying
to do numbers I am trying to generate
I'm trying to list set of processes in
the system and I will show you the
corresponding process ideas alright so
what happens is for every process there
is an Associated process ID and for
every process ID there are certain
parameters okay so those parameters had
present in a text point and there is a
under the slash block which is the
process related directly under that
under than directory so with so whatever
process ID which is there so it with the
name of the process ID holder gets
generated the moment you run that
process there is a folder that gets okay
I'm sorry okay so so I'm talking about
slash broke okay - see all this yeah
so under slash drop is of stalking about
the folders which are present under the
slash slash rock is the process related
information so if I PS - here and just
this commonly used to list the processes
who use gopal okay so if you can see
this is the corresponding process ID
that got generated okay
so here if you observe it corresponding
to this process ID there will be a
folder okay you can observe this rate
so whatever command that that we have
used it runs as a process so bash is
running as a process so there will be a
corresponding folder that gets created
under slash block and then that all the
parameters are whatever value is that
that represent that particular process
they will be stored inside that inside
this particular folder okay so this is
what I wanted to show you with respect
to slash rock all the process skeletal
information so how does it get generated
where does it get stored so this is
where it gets stored the moment you
start a process automatically it gets
generated here yeah so among all these
files I just want to show you the output
of this file / Rock
okay so so this particular pilot defines
the limits for that particular process
okay some of the hard limits and soft
limits are present here
usually if you are running the
particular application okay so there
will be livers that are being set for
that application the number of pipes
that you can use the maximum number of
piles imagine an old space that you can
use like that you have all the
parameters here say if you want to you
know modify any of those parameters you
need to make the changes here all right
so this is by these finds are important
so this is the one of the important use
case not going deep into all the other
files that are present under smash bro
but how they are did how they are
generated so the moment a process gets
started there will be a folder with the
process ID under slash rock you can go
to the inside that folder you can see
all the parameters depend on the
different different files inside the and
inside that folder which is generated
with the process ID okay
if you can see here in this example
slash rock / 1 1 is the body say ID
process ID / the inert user the
grandparent of all the users in the
system so that is the example that has
been taken here similarly some of the
other files which are present under
/proc are named in pool you can see CPU
info information about the memory CPU
and on but usually really we don't want
check these files but information there
are some tools available some commands
available handy so we use those commands
but for the informations sake so we can
also open a slash problem info where we
can get to see all the amount of you
know space total memory that has been
allocated in the free space buffers and
not so so this /proc slash version so
the one we have seen we we can also get
this question using the command we have
used before that is you name space
hyphen e it's the same a same output
that you name gives alright and this is
CPU info ok so there is another command
that I will show you that is called as
top that gives the instantaneous you
know status of the processes that are
running in your system it also so shows
you the memory information and also the
CPU information so basically this this
particular file say you have dual-core
or quad-core CPU right so all the
information about the CPU will be
displayed here the number of course if
you want to quickly check the number of
cores of your system you can come and
open this file and check the groups you
can also check using the top command
level I will show you that in somewhere
okay the next one is /proc slash
partitions let's see that in my system
okay so if you see here so these are the
partitions as da one is da - alright and
then you have BM 0 BM 1 okay so there is
something called major number and the
minor number here okay so this major
number corresponds to the type of
partition so this is HD a partition
alright and among is the the order
starts with 0 1 into alright so it
represents the kind of partition and
then 0 1 to represent the order of the
partitions is da is da one let's do it
similarly if you observe here so this is
one kind of partition and among these
two partitions this is 0 and if you
create another LVM here it will be DM -
2 and then the major number will remain
the same and the minor number will be 2
for it so here it's just there is knee
and my machine there is LVM husband
which I have installed before alright so
here some other files if you see here
slash prop slash success / not ipv4 IP
underscore power so under /proc you
would also get to see files containing
parameters which are which are directly
related to kernel okay so the settings
so the set of variables or the arguments
which we can pass directly into the
kernel and make changes during the
runtime alright so these are the files
which are present I mean the files which
are present under the Frog so if you
make changes to these points we change
this ones to say for example IP n took
the power in the example here so 0 is to
enable 1 is to disable all right so if
you make changes here
files automatically they will get
reflected during the runtime so
automatically the current corresponding
functionality would get enabled or
disabled all right
so that is the importance of these
points like that and see other examples
say we have hostname parameter here so
there is a configuration file called /tc
681 then you can we can also even make
the changes which would be permanent so
there are always two different ways of
making changes to your system
temporarily as well as the permanent
changes you have CCD excuse is still TL
is an interface for analyzing and
dynamically changing the parameters and
the operating system so all the kernel
level parameters whatever out there so
what we can do is we can modify those
parameters we can make the changes
meaning the runtime itself and all these
changes would get reflected in the files
which are present under slash slash your
sis ok so this is the entire you know
list of all the parameters and from this
list there are some parameters which are
important so some what are related to
you I see Linux that is security
advanced advanced security feature which
will handle in veneto sessions so then I
will show you those changes that will
give making directly in the path
spawning points okay so it's like I'm
just talking about the functionality now
so when the corresponding you know
whenever those sections would come
then I will again come back here and
I'll show you the changes that will make
then it will be easy for you to
understand that all right this is one
example here the maximum process IDs
have been set to this particular value
so the kernel does allocation of the
process IDs and you can also manage all
these device
whatever we have seen under slash croc
using all device manager that's in GUI
tool that is available all right yeah so
let me let me just tell you this once
again so if you feel that some of the
topics are being skipped or I'm not
showing you a demo of the topics it's
just because I'm just trying to
prioritize the things so I mean the way
I feel that it will be easy for you to
understand and just prioritize me like
that and I will be coming back again
to show you a demo of those topics
husband but it's just that you know I
just moved here in there so I will be
coming back and show you if you remember
regarding the modules as well as
regarding the parameters that I have
mentioned know under slash croc I will
show you it enough all this but when it
comes to selinux I will show you that
yes person can you hear me hello yes why
don't you just um why don't you just do
the a man just I don't see the flow so
why don't you just do the practical side
why don't you just do it you don't need
to worry about the slides you just tell
us what you know and just go through it
and then you can come back to the slide
and see if you have missed anything you
know so what I'm suggesting is that this
is how I read it in the other class like
the I mean Hadoop class I mean they just
just just go through it and then maybe
he comes back to the slide all right
this is online also the slides we can go
through it also super on well what I
thought was that closet had a lot of
flow in it you know we know how his
style was and he was like so uh I
thought that was more I mean you know I
mean more practical kind of that is what
I think all the all the all the people
are tending the cause wants to see
what's happening in all the slides slice
it okay we can read it we can figure it
out you know that is just for you to
have a guide for us to have a guide but
what robot is expected but more
practical and then you can come back to
this and go through the slide and I
don't know what others think that'd be
great I mean when you go and into the
terminal and you have a flow then there
is a flow to it and then ones are only
it comes back to the slide we do scan
the flow and you know we do strike a
walk where we are now just a suggestion
I don't know all right you can mute me
thank you
all right let's start with some of the
important utilities in Linux
okay I will start with the three come on
all right
so if you can see this is the amount of
memory that I have allocated and this is
used and 3 1 so we can also change it to
you know I can K that will give you an
KP we can we can use typing M it will
give you an MV alright and there is
another element called P using which you
can get a total of the values that is
present all right so this this command
is used most of the time now to check
the memory of our system all the
applications that you make use of
they'll be accessing your memory all
right so so this is the same set of you
know outputs whatever we are getting
here we can even see this outputs under
slash slash proc membrane class then
alright so you can you can even there
the available memory you will get on a
lot of additional other parameters
available here all right so total memory
free space the cache memory ok so here
there is a concept of something called
as swap memory all right as a during the
installation process when you perform an
installation right so you create a
partition on a swap partition column so
scrap is basically in partitioning it is
like it is created on disk but it acts
as your RAM when your RAM is cool what
happens in the pages will get swapped
between your RAM and your scrap
partition all right so basically that
would help you
in managing the RAM which is present in
your system so it is so it is always
important to check the value of swap has
been so mostly as long as you have free
space in your RAM so this should always
be zero the stock should stop
utilization should not be there as long
as you have sufficient amount of memory
in your system so if that is not the
case so there is a possibility that
there is something happening with
respect to the memory so you can start
doing some troubleshooting in those area
so usually that is what we check when we
go with this particular command we see
what is the available space how much is
used and how is the swap status in the
system
okay then alright so this command is
used to check the status of the
partitions or them this together
currently are the partitions that we'll
have created similarly with this we can
use - H to make it human readable and
they're just displaying with in terms of
bytes KBS or envy we can add additional
arguments to make it feel incredible so
this is another important comment so
there is another important usage of yep
it's not deer so just like deer
there is another command called so it's
like free disk and the U is the command
that shows the disk usage all right some
of the place like this disk usage so
basically this command will give you the
usage of every folder that is present
under the slash slash directly which is
the topmost directory so one quick
example of how this is going to be
pretty useful is like elsewhere you can
you can always have application logs
that keep getting generated right in
your system and sometimes what happens
is completely things you're entered this
so there is a need to clear the logs or
at least are capable of a timely fashion
so if that doesn't happen automatically
here applications of your system will
hang so in case there is a scenario
where you have your business completely
full and you want to figure out how to
understand so that is a huge tree
structure a lot of great business of
credits up there you won't know how to
check it so one one way of understanding
is using the do you come and see your if
you observe it di pin sh it gives the
total size of this particular folder so
that th is what gives an uneven readable
format rate so like this
so amongst s nests we can quickly
identify the polder that kind that has
occupied and you can again go to the
subfolder and you can you know run the
same command inside the subfolder
unidentified this is one way of doing it
just I'm telling you there are other
comments as well between see you later
so how we can identify such kind of
directories that have occupied a lot of
space all right
then we have something called top come
on
so talk basically it gives you the
instantaneous status the status of the
processes at a particular instance at
the instance I run the command here even
here you can get to see the CPU usage
memory this web all right
the Lord of information is present here
you can see all users and the
corresponding processes that are running
every time you know for the CPU or the
memory if the consumption changes
automatically it will give you the
instantaneous value all right so here
another important thing to observe is
this the load average so this is the
important part this will give you the
load on your system for the past 15
minutes and then last five minutes and
this is the last one minute all right
so we can we can even monitor this load
load out usually what happens a system
is they prefer to run scripts you know
monitor the memory once a certain
threshold a street I will try to trigger
an alarm some kind of script that
triggers an alarm just to you know check
what is if it is the genuine usage or
some application is adding up all the
memory
similarly there are thresholds that are
being said just to have a control on the
amount of load that is there on the
system alright so these are these are
some of the important things with the
top command you can you can even sort
the content in the top at the user level
or if you want to have a general
listing of the processes we can go with
vs - yeah then you can go through the
month we just - e basically it will list
all the processes that are present in
your system like that means you can oops
okay just to list we have the process ID
and the corresponding pattern process ID
alright so in the system what is the
command that is there and ax is already
like you can see here like this we can
get a list or all the processes that are
running in your system see for example
sometimes you might observe that you to
extra load sometimes your fight box gets
hung all right similarly the same thing
would happen in Union the next junior
part or some other application is not
responding properly or you want to kill
the application so in order to perform
the same operation using command line we
need the process ID of the corresponding
process in order to kill the process or
restart that particular process alright
so PS common basically helps you to give
the process ID of that process so this
is the process and if you want to kill a
particular process and what I can do is
like in get this list and you know get
grip for that particular process say
this one all right
to get the process I can simply pass
this process ID and I can kill the
process okay here yeah more time he'll
show Firefox killing white box is an
example here a lot of applications you
can you know use the GUI or you can
simply try giving the command itself
okay so here what I'm doing is I'm
trying to you know start this
application from the command line itself
okay if I start here the Firefox will
start what the session would remain like
this all right I will not get the prompt
back so I need to so what I can do is
instead I can run the same in the bag
zone using ampersand symbol so okay
system is very slow here
so what I will do is I will show you
this top customers and itself so when I
ran top comment it keeps showing the
instant anywhere news instantaneous
values unless I quit right so what you
can do is simply put an ampersand so
automatically so top command is running
in the background so though it is not
needed just to show you if you want to
run something in the background and get
the prompt back say you are running on
brand level three that you have only a
black screen or the prompt where you
cannot you cannot open other tags as
well what you can do you can simply try
running the first in the bathroom like
this okay keeping an ampersand now if
you want to check all the jobs that
happening in the background what you can
do is you can turn the command called
jobs okay and if you want to kill that's
what I was saying right so
okay so I am a lift I can use in
clicking the corresponding cross side
okay so basically that is how we kill
the processes
so basically kill command what it does
this it sends a signal all right it
sends a signal to stop the execution of
the process so there are different I'll
just show you information see these are
different different kinds of signals
that are available available and since
that kill usually sends okay but mostly
we will stick to the normal kill command
so sometimes the profit may not respond
immediately when you use a kill comer so
in such scenarios what we do is we go
with the forcible killing process that
is kill space - line same the process ID
will be used okay like this so you can
you can either go with the process early
and if you are aware of the exact you
know the process name we can even sell
the process name as an argument to it
alright so okay so so far we have seen
how to check the disk usage disk space
but the free space about memory how how
about you know how much RAM has been
increased for is the scrap all right and
also how do we take the list of
processes that are running in the system
okay
I mean these are all the different kinds
of signals you know
so that means qun command okay - quad
has asked question about all this so
these are all different kinds of signals
okay that he'll usually uses in order to
interact with the processes inside if
there is a need to kill a particular
process see I am not familiar with all
these kinds of signals but primarily so
Cygnet and sync kill all right which are
right this one see kill alright so
basically what happens is it will try to
immediately kill the process using this
and that is why we use kill space - 9
okay I'm waiting you one second yes
that's good
no this is a in the real world actually
I work with some other software systems
applications and the way we get some
issues and handled the the applications
is sometimes we get this error from the
applications right we see that sink int
C kill means it's like yeah almost it's
a bug in the in some kind of a software
like that's what I I understood from
from from interpreting this seek legs
like the C variables right so I just
wanted to know at a high level when how
does this how he needs
lists this as output like you know what
I'm I'm I'm asking like say you I don't
need to know all these parameters but
even is a basic one like C kill are
seeking how how does that how does
unix-like like fix this variable and
and displace it as an output like we're
saying like okay this is an issue this
is the throne because I see a lot of
these things means it's not very common
but some if sees if I see something like
sink in it or something it says it's a
major issue and most of the times it is
a bug in the software that is written so
I'm just trying to understand what this
is let me give you a quick example I
hope you might have heard about the exit
status of a common order process for
example if you see here LS okay so the
command execution is successful okay now
what I will do is so I can see now the
command got a successfully executed see
I have a script in which I have executed
this command and I need to I need to
figure out the way in order to
understand I mean whether this command
is successful or not
okay there is there is a variable called
dollar question mark okay in this
variable it will tell you whether the
previous command was successful or not
okay let's try something else
unless so zero zero means success
anything other than zero means failure a
command Icefield
all right and so the reason why I gave
you this example is the participate is
not just that the users make use of the
kill command but all the processes that
are running in the system they also make
use of the same so if we do simply if we
do restart or a shutdown right so a long
list of all the messages that you see on
the screen even you can see that this
particular process has been said a
silient command that means all the
processes will be send the same command
that miss automatically Dimpy killed one
after the another in a particular order
so see in an application something
didn't work out properly or you have
sent the K command to that particular
process the next moment
you will check whether that has been
successfully executed or not so there is
a way like simply checking another
question whether the killing process has
been successful or not
so you can check that if that was not
successful you cannot continue with your
script you need to ensure that the
process has been properly killed in the
first place and after that only there is
a condition to proceed further them so
in order to ensure that what you can do
is you can again pass a kiloton 9r that
means forcefully you might want to kill
that particular process so like that
system also checks and it sends
different kinds of signals and regarding
the standard output that I've mentioned
the post channel output and standard
ever so every command when it executes
its print something to the screen
so all this processes when they run so
they ensure that whatever output comes
whatever comes they get printer to the
screen where you can get to see all the
signals okay but when it is printing to
or how can I interpret this to as means
this variables is sink int like take any
of this example see int our sink it will
only send the it will only send in this
particular form ultra kill space - line
okay so - line has been sent as an
argument then the kill is the
corresponding signal that will be sent
so the recipient that kill - - has been
sent okay - okay - that the
corresponding number and the process ID
yes the process ID it will kill that
particular process you can give the
process name also so by the exact name
of the process so what what are just
means why do you have different means
the
can you just expect - like - what will
how will this used in
development means so how do I know which
one to use bike kill - two - three means
I got the example of Ellis and a cold
Dollar push and Mark Mitch I I do that
all the time and if I if I get a dollar
question mark as a non zero I do with
the exit of I say exit hundred so that's
what I do I don't know whether that was
a cut away or not exit some some other
nonzero which indicating that you know
it's a something is a failure and I I
stopped the process so but I don't
understand how means how these security
movements because all application
develop all that the development for all
the products used this and I see all
this I every times I I'm trying to
understand how which one to use when
when a process fails like which one it
will be used like one or two example
maybe would be secant right everything
starts with the term called SIB Ocasek
stands for signal so here sending signal
called int int stands for interrupt
so basically when this signal is sent
that particular process is interrupted
okay right similarly nine stands for
killing that means forcefully that will
completely kill the process the respect
II of the street okay all right so so
you are you are asking me about what the
application application where you will
make use of this see I'll give you
another example okay so I have written a
script what the script does is it will
okay say I have a database related
script that I've created it basically
what it does is it will install the
variables corresponding to the database
I have created some folders where I want
to store the computational files there
and I mean new config files then I want
to store the marks everything and I have
started the database
holy so every time water does is left I
said something the next time I come and
even I want to test your lives in are
you what I want to do it I simply want
to read on this script and make sure
that again the setup comes up freshly
getting reappointed that means all the
structures should get so all the
packages would get very install whatever
folders are created should get recreated
again yeah so what it is in the same
script what I do is apart from the setup
what I do is I can I quickly what L says
you can I can eat I will simply stop the
process and check if there are any
additional processes corresponding
processes coming if they are still
running I can simply go with the kill
command I can use the kill command in
order to stop their trusts so you do
kill - mine the process kill yes kill -
9 - forcefully kill the process so if it
is like forcefully so if a particular
process is it's like dependent on other
processes so that is the example of
given you so when when we kill the
process usually so if it is dependent on
other processes sometimes it gets stuck
so so I can give you one example called
as zombie process okay so a zombie
process is there the process gets killed
I went so say there is a parent process
which has which has created a few child
processes okay so whenever a process
gets created and any will be waived in
the process table
alright the corresponding entry in the
memory there will be an incubator in the
process - so when the when this
particular process gets killed so what
happens is still this information must
be pass it to the parent process so that
the parent process will check the
execute exit code of the child process
and then it will take the next step and
it will remove their entry from the
process table so sometimes there is a
communication between the parent and
child process alright so in those
scenarios what we can do is we can
forcefully send a kill - line so that it
will be routed to the parent process and
ensure that the child
biblical and remote from the processor
okay okay so our processes should be
killed before the parent to make sure so
that's it's like when there are inter
related processes sometimes the process
hangs but it doesn't get scale using
kill so specifically in those scenarios
it kill it doesn't work then we will put
in item
oh yeah there are some other commands
the other one is vmstat which is the
virtual memory statistics alright see
you will get this matrix using I mean
the memory matrix lab matrix using the
pre command also but here the advantage
is you can stay what I can do is I can
set up a delay here okay so if you
observe my screen right what I do this
I've set up a delay of 5 seconds that
means I want this come on to
continuously exit and generate the
matrix every 5 seconds alright so that
means you can you can make use of this
and automating and you generating either
complete statistics or a period of time
you got it right you can correlate it to
a scenario you can you can generate the
virtual memory it locks in the
particular location you run the script
you dump you keep generating this matrix
and then you can run some additional
utilities in order to generate the
average memory statistics over the
period of time like a day or a week like
that so this is something which you can
modify and so this is the interval how
we set up the interval and we have some
other options here the other arguments
that you can check with vmstat
yeah that's mostly we go with the
instead - a that this place you know as
mentioned here active and inactive
memory
so what we will do is we will say we
will see we will try running some
database software alright and then
perform some try to dump some content or
perform some raid operations
automatically so that the memory gets
loaded and then you know keep running
this VM start in the background and then
we can generate some matrix in order to
see how memory consumption is happening
so that is the data so we can replicate
you know kind of real-life scenario
where some application runs you know as
as the memory keeps getting memory usage
keeps getting increased similarly we
have another command called how you
start alright so this I will start it
talks about the race and rights that are
happening in your system so these are
the device files and the corresponding
read and write operations so even I will
start can be automated we can be put in
a script and we can keep continuously
generating so mostly it would be pretty
much helpful when you try benchmarking
some of the features the database
features where you want to check the
kind of read or write operations that
are happening you know you can calculate
the average matrix out of this values
for a period of time and then since my
system is either you can mostly see
zeros here yeah I will finish the slides
and if you remember in the second module
I had to quickly finish explaining the
the same HTTP Apache server
configuration so I will explain you I
have already installed HTTP and I have
configured concrete emissions are
created location forecast or see actual
so I will show you that so that we can
cover both aspects and
plus I'm show you how to perform the
installation by taking the hair start
CFG from the HTTP service okay so I'll
show you that I'll finish this
slides and then I will go to the next
ATP competition so here are some of the
comments that I have missed our soap at
the top as you can see the total it
gives you the total list of all the
users and the corresponding process IDs
so you can go with even - you come on in
order to list the user specific
processes okay and similarly you can set
up a delay time for top as well I will
die with me check for the commands that
I have nice TS
see we can just just world to mention
this pretty good come on so if you
address it so psi PDA of Prince you know
a setup list will default variables and
the values book dead printer so if you
want you can either move a pipe in E and
no option as you can see here we can
mention the specific variables or the
value that we want and you can fill that
out like they're using - Evo so well
this is just one of the important
arguments I'm mentioning it here yeah
DSP is just - you know if you remember
the file system structure that I've
mentioned and the beginning class like
inverter tree structure if you want to
see that inverter tree structure again
use the ps3 command starting from the
pattern process how all the child
processes are they should be how they
get how they are generated so it just
gives the command gives the entire tree
structure for you so we have seen kill
yeah the next is the nice come on okay
so when we run at top command actually
all the processes that are running in
the system will have default priority
and sign them all right so so this so
this is all about
I mean there are two important commands
with respect in that will help us in
changing the priority of the process is
saying you want to suddenly start a
running process you know that means the
CPU we are trying to get the CPU time
according to the priority okay so what
do you want to do is you want to learn
the process and you want that you know
rather than waiting in the queue you
want that to get any good quickly so
what you can do is rather than we are
technically later you can change the
priority of the process and the
beginning itself before starting the
process itself and you can figure the
process automatically it will be given
higher priority okay so that is
one we are doing there we see the
Commandant's a nice comer so if you want
to see the priority of the processes so
here in the top comment that is
something called PR okay so that is the
that stands for the priority of the
process or if so the previous top
comment that I mentioned where in the
USPS face - you all right followed by we
can give PCP you and PRI alright CMD and
then I will keep it simple
PID PRA okay so this is the list see
this is the comment that is getting
executed and this is the process ID and
this is the priority that has been set
okay so there is a range of these
priority values from negative to
positive
so usually negative is the higher
priority and positive and fluidity so
this is how we can use of this PS PS -
Evo argument so we can you can just list
out the arguments that we want the
process ID or you can be you can you can
even print the CPU you can even print
memory and then you can start it all
right there is a command called I'm just
trying to explain the usage how this
command is beneficial will rather them
using here we can list all these three
right and then I can say start okay so
so this would get you know sorted we can
we can do normal sort we can sort on a
specific column from this is to say we
have printed CPU okay and then we have
printed memory or we have printed the
priorities we can sort that particular
column and then
even what we didn't do is save pipe head
- ten all right so for that particular
parameter say CPU will get the top ten
CPU can do much or the top ten memory
usage in processes that are consuming
memory highest memory consuming Frances
highest sleep even killing process like
that we can make in freezer and get that
list as well we can keep that handy
that's those comments for getting the
top consuming processes alright so here
so I was talking about the priority so
this is this is how we can check the
priority of the processes and so the
command in order to change the pure tour
if you want to initiate a process which
you know with the highest higher
priority then you can do that in the
beginning itself so there are two
comments one is nice another one is
three nice so if you want to start a
process with a highest or lowest
priority you can start it like this
using the nice comment or you have there
is some process if you have already
started that is running slowly what you
can do is you can modify the priority of
that particular process so it's like say
suddenly you want to run a process there
are other processes which are not a
priority you can you can bring them back
in the queue you can change their status
to you can prioritize them you can
change the status to less priority and
you can whatever process that you want
to quickly start executing you want to
you can set it up with the - okay so the
nice things for starting a process if
you want to change the priority before
initiation it's done and the time of
initiation
you set the pre or again start the
process if there is a process which is
already running in the system if you
want to change the priority that the
command is pretty simple so this is the
priority which I want to say and this is
for the process ID so you can there are
two this you can set it at a user ID
level or you can also set it on
use it level that means for this
particular user all the processes that
are running with this particular
username you can change the priority per
all such processes all right so that's
that's pretty much about all the
commands that we have seen in this
module so what I will do now is I will
show you regarding the setup of no KS
dot c fq as a part of the HTTP service
alright so case in HTTP or apache server
of service okay so what we are trying to
do is we are trying to recover its like
post site then we will keep our case
tots three fg5 all right so whoever hits
that HTTP link they'll be able to access
the case not smoothly similarly the same
link will be passing it to passing it as
a part of parameter to the to our
kickstart center okay so how do we set
it up so KS toward CFG or something in
which we can get it from our system
itself we do want you can make changes
to it so with respect to http I'm just
telling you the steps to install he
stated put in its - it will be prince
the demin so when you use him it will
pull that package from the repository
and it will try to install it so open
httpd the important configuration file
is /pd under 3 TV you have httpd and
corn there is another directory under
the pun you have httpd.conf
ok so here since this package is already
installed I believe in the years and
install it will pull the package and it
will ask you for confirmation once you
install it the configuration file would
get generated and initially the service
won't be running we need
make the changes in the configuration
file and then start the service all
right so it says this is already
installed okay so we install the service
and then we open the corresponding
configuration file
it is the extra TP d con ok this is the
only file we will be making the changes
respect to the service okay now here now
let me tell you the changes that I have
made I've simply added the URL which is
my host maybe here I've set my host name
to no www dot and SK dot-com alright so
by default HTTP source at least once on
what number 8 0 80 okay I believe so
after just computation I'll show you how
to list and check all the ports that are
currently open and which are in
listening mode alright so here so server
engine so this is the root user ok so we
depend some basic parameters like the
hostname and then my server name either
we can give the IP address or we can
give the server name as whatever you
have set for your host or we can give
localhost all right and then we have
something called document root here so
by default when you install it is qtp
service and you start the service
alright so you start the service when
you try to access here your IP address
ok
let me show that to you the point works
so what happens is whatever I have
defined here host name at this
particular for this particular service
is running on this host on this
particular boat right so the URL what we
get is either the host name or the
domain name for
ray : eighty then it will start the
service okay so when it starts the
service so this is the cold of document
go to the folder which which contains
the default points where www.h tml so
usually when you install these are this
their slash HTML folder will contain
your index point it's like welcome to
HTTP service something like that okay
okay so even this structure will be
created by the HTTP service itself
alright so that is your index dot HTML
okay so the list of parameters that we
define here are the first thing is the
host name and we'll be running it on the
default boot we arrived with very basic
configuration of Pattie server and then
we redefine the host admin as the root
at the domain whatever we have mentioned
okay
other than that so there is something
called index file which is there that is
already where in your system the moment
you run the service okay so before with
these changes that I've mentioned before
we can start the service and what we can
do is we can simply take the URL that
I've mentioned
okay so here you can see there is
something called zombie bitch so it's
the same and there is no HTML nothing
it's just a text which lets go generator
okay so this you can even place HTML
points okay so by default this is the
default configuration that i7 now what I
am trying to do is I want to I have
defined another folder here okay
okay
so the bad ww have created a folder
called case alright and this is the
earliest name all right
and what I build this have kept the case
towards CFG inside this particular
folder and there are some permissions
from world so what we are doing is it
the tallest an order here okay so order
is first hello and then deny okay so
this is the order in which it has to
follow there is no one triple deny we
are simply saying hello from all anyone
can access this particular page okay so
here if you if you see here I am just
hitting this particular hostname color
Katie put okay and it is displaying me
okay so here what up consist but this
structures where WWll okay there is an
alias name clearance so if there is an
error file automatically followed by the
website address he will you will get to
see the other files somewhere in this
location if they are generated all right
similarly there is an alias link created
so whatever comes here
ww-where ww6 tmn inside that we have
index dot HTML so that index dot HTML
gets printed directly here itself
okay so similarly the structure I have
created is unless where WW case so for
this have created an alias name called
case so the URL will be followed by by
that
if you remember right so what we did is
regarding permissions we have granted
hello from all that means then everyone
say if anyone can access this the same
concept alright so in this the place of
configuration file if I copy and keep
all the rpms here okay and then what I
can do is I can simply simply point my M
reports.com that location and in that
configuration I can simply point this
particular folder automatically youngin
so why as a part of creating a local
repository that's what we have seen so
they have created a HTTP service very
basic configuration here at a particular
folder we had an earliest name give
access as per your requirement so only
those people will be able to access once
you read this folder he will help all
the list of points here okay so for case
what CMC what we will do is you will
give this part now let will say that the
configuration file is present in this
part and this service is available over
the network and everyone has access so
we simply give this automatically the
kickstart file must be taken from this
particular location ok so I will just
show you that configuration once again
so VA
okay so this is what I do so there is
already you'll have the existing
earliest new configurations so if you
see here there is a folder called icons
over there so here even put that folder
hello from all similarly you create a
folder for our viewers for your
configuration 4k is to have CFG and you
know you can mention who are lol who are
not allowed
all right
okay so so once this is done so once we
have configured this so we installed the
install using yam and then we have very
changes to the configuration file you
created the corresponding folder over
there and there is a concept of
partitions so what we have to do is you
need to give permissions to the
directory that we have created okay for
example if I go there where that would
okay see if you see here right this is
the folder that I have created say I've
created another poll okay so here we
need to make sure that this folder has
all these permissions okay we'll go
through the provisional part so
basically other than the owner okay this
is the group and other so they need to
have proper permissions in order to
access this folder otherwise we get the
other in then it will try to access the
contents of this particular folder all
right so what we'll do is I created this
I have given proper permissions not only
to this point but also to the content
which is there inside case so tomorrow I
might keep some more contents on it to
make sure that so all the files inside
place and proper permissions usually
yeah we will see that in the functional
part what permissions must be given and
you know how we can block the users with
respect to permissions and so we need to
ensure that file has proper permissions
once that is done we simply has to UTC
init thirdly httpd so check the status
so by default it will be I stopped or
after installation so we simply have to
start the server already started I'm
showing you I will restart the service
so the moment I start the service the
URL will be up and running okay and also
what I do is I use
chk config
and it's
okay so you should also make sure in the
current eleven that particular service
is up and running so currently I will
run level five it is on so you should
also permanently update that change you
can see it click on 1ch keep on so that
next time we'll start start with restart
your system service will be up and done
so this is how we conclude basic HTTP
service alright so the next section
highly I'll fix my VM issue and then we
will pass this particular URL as our
given to the it start burn and see how
