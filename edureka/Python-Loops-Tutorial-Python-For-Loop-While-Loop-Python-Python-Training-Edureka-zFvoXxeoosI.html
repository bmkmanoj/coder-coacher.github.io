Rekha and in today's session we'll be
focusing on various loops that are
available in Python so without any
further ado let us move forward and have
a look at the agenda for today
so first we'll see why to use loops what
are the reason of introducing loops in
the programming world let me see what
exactly are loops and then we'll focus
on various types of loops that are there
in python namely while for a nested i'll
be explaining you all these three loops
with examples after that I'll give you a
brief summary of all the things that we
have discussed in today's session so I
hope we all are clear with the agenda
kindly give me a quick confirmation by
writing down in the chat box so that I
can move forward all right today says
move forward so does Natalie Siddharth
Siam Java titania Kanaka all right
fine guys so I've got confirmation from
almost everyone so let us move forward
and see why we need loops now let us
understand this with an example that is
there in front of your screen
suppose you are a software developer and
you are required to create a software
module for payroll processing of all the
employees in your office now one of the
things you need you need the salary of
those employees the bonus and the total
amount that they'll get at the end of
the month right so all these things for
each employee you need to print so for
each of the employees you need to print
all these three details now there are
two ways of executing this task so let
us see one of those two ways so the one
way is you can actually write a logic to
calculate the total salary of each of
the employees that includes all the
fields like salary bonus in total and
you are going to write that logic for
all the employees that are there in your
office there might be hundreds of
employees that are there in your office
so you need to write the closet or you
need to write the code for all of those
employees so this process is actually
pretty hectic you need to repeat the
same logic for total amount of employees
are there in the office I am just giving
you an example of three employees but
what if you're have like hundreds of
employees so at that time this
particular process will not work this
will not only increase the size of the
code it will make it more complex and
less efficient now another way of
approaching this task would be you write
this logic to calculate the Sal
you keep on hydrating that logic for the
total number of employees that are there
so when this Lube runs once it'll print
the side of your first employee when the
loop runs for the second time it will
print the salary of the second employee
similarly it will keep on repeating so
if you have a hundred employees it will
repeat four hundred times now what
advantage we get here the major
advantage that we get here is we don't
need to write the logic for each
employee in order to calculate the
salary we can write one logic and keep
on repeating it for all the employees so
this way the size of the code gets
reduced the length of the code is
reduced at the same time it reduces the
complexity makes it more efficient and
even increases the speed of execution so
this is just one example in order to
show you why we need loops so there are
hundreds of thousands of examples that
you can think of why we need loops right
so this is just one simple example that
I've shown you in order to make you
understand why we need loops so if you
have any doubts any queries please write
it down in your chat box
Dave says he's clear our soda siddhart
Siam
Kanaka nationally jothee or red wine so
I've got a confirmation from almost
everyone so let us move forward and see
what exactly our loops let me explain
you this with the help of the flow chart
that is there in front of your screen
now what our loops loops basically
allows us to execute a statement or a
group of statement multiple times let me
explain you this with the help of an
example that is present in front of your
screen now over here what happens the
control comes here and checks the
condition so if this condition is true
it will go on and execute the
conditional code that is here this is
nothing but the statements that are
present inside the loop so it will
execute that and again it will go back
and check the condition so if the
condition is still true then again it
will execute the conditional code of the
statements present inside the loop and
it will keep on repeating until this
condition becomes sports and the moment
this condition becomes false the control
will move out the loop and it'll execute
the statements that are present after
that loop now one thing to notice here
guys is that there can be two kinds of
loops one is finite this is actually the
flowchart for the finite loops and
another can be infinite now in infinite
loops what happened the candy
we'll never be false so at that time the
control will never come out of the loop
so it will keep on repeating and it will
never stop
that is what infinite loops are so
basically the condition will never be
false and through that the loop will be
executed infinite number of times now
there is one more way in order to
categorize loops that is called
post-test and pretest in postage loops
what happened the control will first
enter the loop and then in the end it
will actually check the condition but in
pretest loops the control will enter the
loop only when the condition is true so
the condition is checked in the
beginning of the loop in pretest loops
but in post-test loop the condition is
checked at the end of the loop now in
python there are no post-test loops
present there are only pretest loops so
we'll focus on pretest loops in today's
session so I hope you all are clear with
what exactly our loops if you have any
doubts any questions you can write it
down in your chat box I'll be happy to
help you alright the day says no
questions
so does Siam Dorothy Kanaka alright so
I've got a confirmation from everyone so
we'll move forward and we'll see various
type of loops that are present in Python
so Python basically supports three kinds
of loops one is vy4 and nested we'll
look at all these loops one by one and
I'll explain you with examples as well
so first we'll have a look at while loop
so while loop is basically used when you
don't know how many iterations are
required so let me explain you this with
the help of the flowchart that is there
in front of your screen now over here
what happens the control will move
inside the loop only when this wild
condition is true and when it is true it
will execute the body of the loop and
then again it will go back and see
whether the condition is still true or
not if it is still true then again it'll
execute the body of the loop and it will
keep on doing that until the condition
becomes false and the moment the
condition becomes false it will come out
of the loop and execute the statements
that are present after the loop now this
is syntax for while loop firstly to
write while then you write the
expression of the condition then you
give a colon and the statements or the
body of the loop now why we use while
loop basically I told you earlier as
well
loop is used when you don't know how
many iterations are required so you
don't know how many times you need to
execute the statements that are present
inside your loop so that is the reason
why we use while loops now let me show
you that with the help of an example
I'll open my PI charm and I'll give you
a very basic example of using while loop
and after that I'm going to increase the
complexity of the code so first we'll
see a very small introductory example of
a loop in which I'm going to print the
integer values between 0 to 9 that won't
include 9 so it will print 0 1 2 3 till
9 but it burned in huge 9 so let me open
my pie thumb and show you how to do that
now this is my pie charm guys so over
here as I have told you earlier as well
I'm going to print the integer values
between 0 to 9
but that won't include 9 so for that
what I need to do is I need to first
define a variable let me name it as
count and I'm going to initialize value
to it that is 0 now after that I'm going
to use a while loop and I'll write while
and then I'm going to give a condition
which says that when count becomes
greater than 9 it should come out of the
loop alright so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just type in friend let
it be number colon comma print count
right now I'm going to increment the
value of count count equal to count plus
1 yep now when I come out of the loop
I want to friend say goodbye
yeah looks fine now let me tell you what
I've done here I've defined a variable
and I've initialized the value 0 to it
after that I have used a while loop in
which I've given a condition that says
that count should always be less than 9
because I want to print values between 0
till lines this won't include time let
me tell you that
so my condition says that the loop
should be executed only when the count
value is less than 9 the moment it
becomes greater than 9 then the control
should come out of the loop after that
it's just a sent general syntax I have
given a colon and then I have written a
print statement that will print the
count value and after that I have
increased the value of my count by 1 and
finally when the control comes out of
the loop I want to print good part so
let us see whether it works or not
I'm going to run it and as you can see
that it works so we are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
&amp;amp; 8 and finally when the control went
out of the loop it has printed goodbye
this is just a very small example guys
now let me go back to my slides now the
example that we just saw was a very
simple example so I'll increase the
complexity of it and I'll give you one
more example so let us move forward with
that so over here what I'm trying to do
is I'm trying to code a little guessing
game all right so what happens in this
guessing game so there will be a random
number that should be generated between
save 0 to 20 and you need to guess that
number so the number that you have
guessed is less than that random number
then it will print number is too small
if you have guessed the number that is
greater than the random number then it
will print that number is too large and
the moment you get the right answer
you'll exit the while loop and you have
won the game basically so it's just a
pretty simple example but this is a
perfect example in order to show you why
we use while loop because if you notice
here I don't know how many iterations
are required in order to guess the
correct answer so at that time while
loop is a perfect solution to this
problem so without wasting any time I'll
actually open my pie charm and show you
how to execute this so this is the code
here guys let me explain you each and
every line that is present here now what
happens
first I need to import a module that is
called random in order to generate a
random number now over here I have
defined a variable N and I've given a
value to it that is 20 because I won the
random number that is to be generated
should be between the range 0 to 20 now
I have taken one more variable and I've
named thus to be guessed and over here
it should be an integer types of written
end and this logic will generate the
random number that I am talking about
and this will be generated between the
range 0 to 20 so how it will be
generated it will be generated with the
help of random modules that we have
imported so it will be n random dot
random plus 1 this will actually
generate a random number between 0 to 20
any doubt still here guys all right so
no doubt still here so after that what
happens I have defined one more variable
guess and I have assigned a value to it
or initialize the value to it 0 all
right so now comes the while loop now in
val loop i have given a condition which
says that the number that i have guessed
if it is not equal to the random number
then enter the loop now once you enter
the loop you need to input the new
number the number that you want to get
again now if that guessed number or the
number that you are guessing is greater
than 0 then again there will be one more
s condition which says that the number
that you have guessed is greater than
the number that has been generated or
the random number that has been
generated then print number is too large
and if the number that you have guessed
is actually smaller than the random
number generated then print number is
too small now there is one more
condition that is else which means that
when the number that you have guessed is
less than or equal to 0 then that means
you are giving up so it will break it
will come out of the loop and it will
print sorry that you are giving up
that's when your game gets over and you
have lost it finally if you have guessed
the correct number then it will print
congratulations you have made it so I
hope you have understood the code that I
was explaining here any doubts any
queries you can write it down in your
chat box it's a very easy example but a
very perfect example in order to show
you how while loop works because over
here I don't know
how many iterations are required in
order to guess the random number that
has been generated all right so we have
no questions so let us go ahead and
execute this and see what happens
all right so it asks me for a new number
so it has to be between 0 to 20 so yep
I'll type 10 and let's see what happens
so it says number is too small that
means it is between 10 to 20
how about 13 all right so I've guessed
the correct number and it says
congratulations you have made it now
over here as you can see that it took
only two iterations for me in order to
get the correct number but what if it
would have taken more iterations I mean
I'm pretty unclear how many iterations
it will take for me so that is the
reason why we use while loop because we
don't know how many iterations are
required now we can run this program
again and I can show it to you once more
ask a new number so I'll just type in
say 14 it says number is too large so
I'll type in 11 again the number is too
large that means it is between 0 to 11
so how about 8 guys number is too small
so now now as you can see that already
three iterations have occurred and for
the fourth iteration definitely the
random number will be somewhere between
8 and 11 so how about 10 so
congratulations you have made it and the
control came out of the while loop and
it has printed congratulations you made
it so any doubts till here guys all
right so we have no doubts
I've got confirmation from almost
everyone so we'll move forward and see
for loops in Python so for loop is
basically used when you know the number
of iterations that are required unlike
while loop where you are not sure about
the number of iterations that are
required in for loop you know how many
times the statement that are present
inside the loops need to be executed the
for loop provides you with a syntax that
will include 3 fields basically or you
can say 3 informations so first will be
the boolean condition then comes the
initial value of the counting variable
and then the incrementation of the
counting variables
so as you can see from the syntaxes well
first you write for name of the variable
in the range then you specify the range
in which that variable should be or and
then you specify the range that means
from which point at which point it
should be executed so you know the
number of iterations required then only
you use for loop now over here as you
can see from the flow diagram itself the
control comes to this and it will see
the item from the sequence it will
execute the statement go back again and
then from the range it will pick up the
next item again it'll execute the
statement again go back and then from
the range it will pick up the third item
and it will keep on executing until the
range becomes over or that is the last
item from the sequence so when there are
no items in the sequence it will go on
and execute the statements that are
present after the for loop so this is
how for loop works guys now let me just
give you a very small example of how for
loop works I'll open my pie charm again
and I'll start with a very small example
and then I am going to increase the
complexity of our code like I have done
that in while loop now over here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to first
define a list and I'm going to name it
as fruits so what all fruits you like
guys I'll first type in mango then I
like grapes
and finally I'm going to write and say
Apple yep so this is my list which
contains the three fruits mango grapes
and Apple now I'm going to define a for
loop and over here what I write I'll
define a variable say fruit for fruit n
fruits give a colon print current fruit
and type in fruit now when you come out
of the loop just print again goodbye so
I have declared a list and the name of
that list is fruits now that fruits list
contains elements which are mango grapes
and Apple now after that I have defined
a for loop which says that for a
variable named fruit in fruits so this
will give me the range fruits will give
me the range as you know that in the
fruits list there are only 3 fruits so I
know it will I trade only thrice first
for mango then for grades then for Apple
so this is the difference between the
viral for loop in for loop I know that
will take only 3 i trations after that
print the current fruit that's all and
when the control moves out of the loop
print goodbye it's pretty easy guys so
go on execute this and see what happens
so yep the current fruit first is mango
then comes grapes there comes apple and
then finally print goodbye so any doubt
seller guys you can ask me if you have
any questions any queries please write
it down in the chat box
they says no questions sort of Zarate
Siam Natalie alright everyone's clear
nice to hear that so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to increase the
complexity now as I've done that in
while loop as well so I'll show you an
example first let me go back to my slide
so what I'm going to do in this example
I'm going to calculate the factorial now
one thing to notice here guys again in
factorial also I know how many
iterations are required because if you
see if I'm calculating the factorial of
5 and I know that I need multiplication
five times first I need to multiply as
five with pause and four with 3 and 3
with 2 and then 2 with 1 so this way I
require only 4 I trations so I know the
number of iterations required so it's a
very good example in order to show you
where we should use while loop and where
we should use for loop so let me go back
to my pycharm and execute this
practically so this is the code in order
to find the factorial of a number so
over here what happens first I need to
input the numbers that I want to
calculate the factorial of after that I
have defined a variable factorial and
I've initialized the value to it which
is 1 now I have defined a condition if
the number that I have entered is less
than 0 then print the number must be
positive because I can't calculate the
factorial for negative numbers right and
again I have given one more condition
which says that if number is equal to
equal to 0 then factorial is equal to 1
and then else condition says that when
number is greater than 0 then I've used
a for loop which says that for I have
defined a variable I in the range 1 to
num plus 1 when I write num plus 1 the
range will be between 1 to num plus 1
but it won't include num plus 1 so it
will only be including one till num all
right so after that what I have written
factorial is equal to factorial into I
so factorial was 1 earlier then it will
multiply by I I will also be 1 in the
beginning and then again it will go back
and it will become 2 similarly it will
keep on increasing until it becomes numb
so till that time it will keep on
executing the loop and the moment it
becomes equal to num it will come out of
the loop and it will print the factorial
value so do you want me to repeat it
once more or are you all clear with the
code that I've written here all right so
they want me to repeat the code once
more all right Dave so what's the first
line says here first line says input an
integer number so that number whose part
really want to calculate basically so
you enter that number after that I have
defined a variable factorial and I've
initialized the value to it which is 1
then I have given a condition which says
that if the number that I have entered
is less than 0 then print that number
must be positive obviously I won't be
printing the factorial of a negative
value then I have one more condition
Elif which says that the number that are
given if it is equal to 0 then
definitely the factorial is equal to 1
now one more else condition which says
that when the number is greater than 0
at that time execute the for loop which
says that when I is in the range 1 to
num plus 1 now notice here the range is
between 1 to num plus 1 but it won't
include num plus 1 it will stop till num
itself all right so after that what I
have written I have written factorial is
equals to factorial into I now let me
take an example since the factorial
value is 1 here so this will be equal to
1 and then 1 into I I will be 1 in the
beginning so 1 into 1 is 1 of that it
will again go back and it will become 2
so factorial is 1 earlier 2 1 equal to 1
into 2 is 2
now the factorial value will be updated
it will become 2 then again I will go
back it will become 3 so what do you
have factorial is equals to factorial
value is 2 earlier so will become 2 into
3 similarly it will keep on repeating
until I reaches num value so once the
factorial is multiplied with the value
num this will print factorial and come
out of the loop so I hope you have no
doubt still here if you have any doubts
you can write it down in your charge box
I'll be happy to help you any doubts
guys alright so there are no doubts so
let me go ahead and execute this and
show you if it works or not
so I need to enter the number so let's
say I want to calculate the factorial of
3 which is 6 so if I want to enter one
more number so what I can do is I can
start it once more so 1l type I can type
again 4 so it prints 24 which is
absolutely correct so
now still here guys you can ask me all
right no doubt so we'll move forward and
we'll see what our nested loops in
Python so python basically allows us to
use a loop inside and another loop for
example you can use a for loop inside a
for loop or you can use a while loop
inside of a loop and at the same time
you can use a while loop inside a for
loop as well and a for loop inside a
while loop as well so that is basically
what is called at nested loops now we'll
have a look at the example of nested
loops as well don't worry so let us move
forward and see one example of nested
loops now over here what I'm going to do
is I am going to write a code in order
to simulate a bank ATM alright so for
that I'm going to use nested while loop
and what will happen first you need to
enter the four-digit pin and then you
can perform the following functions you
can check the balance you can make a
withdrawal you can deposit some money
and you can even if you don't want to do
anything you can tell the machine to
return your car as well so let me show
you how it is done I'll open my PI charm
once more so this is the code that I've
written in order to simulate a bank ATM
and explain you each and every line so
don't worry about that
so first line is nothing but a print
statement that says welcome to iron bank
of Braavos atm
alright and then I have defined a
variable restart and I've assigned a
value to it that is why similarly
chances of a sign of value that is 3 and
this is the balance that I'm going to
initialize that is 67.1 phone notice you
over here you won't get more than 3
chances in order to write the correct
password now comes the while loop which
says that when chances are greater than
or equal to 0 at that time what we'll do
you need to enter the pin so you need to
input the four-digit pin that you have
and if that pin is 1 2 3 4 then it will
print that you have entered the correct
pin now comes one more while loop which
says that while restart should not be in
this particular tuple that is the value
of restart should not be n capital n or
small n o or capital n so it should not
live within this particular sequence
that is n capital n oh no and n but we
know that the restart value is y so it
will enter the while loop now over here
what will happen it will give you four
options first option is in order to
check your balance for that you need to
press one to make a bit roll you need to
press two in order to pay in some cash
or you need to deposit something you
need to press three or you want your
card box you need to press four so these
are the four options that will be given
to you so when you choose option one it
will print the account balance so over
here as you can see that your account
balance is and the balance that is there
in your account after that it'll ask you
for restart so you need to input that
value so that will say would you like to
go back and if you restart value lies in
this particular topple then it will
break and we'll print a thank you
statement but if you want to continue or
you want to go back then you can press
anything else apart from small n n o or
this no or capital n so if you press any
other button apart from these it will
actually go back and in the while
statement as you can see it says that it
is not present here so it will give you
all these four options once more so I
hope I am cleared in here if you have
any doubts till here you can ask me any
doubts case alright so it is clear now
after that what if you choose the
another option in which you need to make
a withdrawal so for that what will
happen you need to enter the amount that
you would right to withdraw which can be
a float number it cannot be an integer
number so that's why I've used float
here
so you need to enter that value and once
you enter that value it will check
whether it is in this particular list or
not that is 10 20 40 60 80 100 now by
default it will give or restart why
because you need to enter the amount 1
smooth so again it will go back and it
will give you all four options so you
can choose a Twitter all option again
and you can choose a number which is
present in this particular list now when
you choose withdrawal equal to equal to
1 at that time it will again ask you
please enter the desired amount so this
is for option 2 now when we talk about
option 3 it is pretty much similar to
the couple of options that we have
discussed before so it is pretty much
similar to that over here again whatever
the amount is that you want to pay in
the how much firm amount that you would
like to pay and
plus the amount that you are depositing
so it will print the balance that will
be equal to balance plus the amount that
you are depositing again it last you for
restart if you press anything apart from
this particular tuple then it will go
back to the while statement and it will
give you all these four options
similarly for auction for as well now
what happens when you enter the
incorrect pin so there is one more
condition in the end which says that if
the pin that you have entered is not
equal to one two three four then it will
print that incorrect password and it
will decrease the chances by one so
earlier you had three chances if you
press the incorrect pin once it will
decrease your chance and it will make it
as two again if you write the incorrect
password then again it will make it as
chance it equals two chances minus one
which will become one and if the third
time also you do the same thing then the
chances would it comes you and the
moment it becomes zero then it will
print no more tries break and come out
the loop that's all guys so any doubt
still here guys you can ask me all right
so we have no doubt so let us go ahead
and execute this and see what happens so
please enter your four digit PIN so I
will just write one two three four and
give me four options which is one for
balance two for withdrawal three for
pain for the return a card so if I want
to check my balance and put in 1 so it
has printed my balance is 260 over seven
point one four and then the restart
value that I was talking about it is
asking for that let me just make it big
for you here would you like to go back
so if I press n here it is come out of
the loop and it'll break
and if I press anything apart from small
n capital n Oh small N or capital n it
will actually go back and ask gave me
all the four options out with it so if I
press Y will again give me all the four
options or other you can see that press
one so again if I want to make a
withdrawal I'll press 2 how much amount
that I would like to withdraw say I want
to withdraw ten so my balance has
reduced from sixty seven point one four
two fifty seven point one four so would
you like to go back so I will again
press Y and it will give me all four
options if I want to pay in something
that is I want to deposit something and
press three how much about that I would
like to deposit and say ten so my
balance became again sixty seven
one for again it is asking me really
like to go back no I don't want to go
back so I can type in n so yep so it
says thank you and again ask me me for
four-digit pin so let me show you what
happens if I die the incorrect pin say
if I write one one one incorrect pin if
I write that then again again incorrect
again incorrect so we have no more tries
it has come out since I've exceeded the
chances that I was given so I was given
three chances I couldn't write the
correct pin in those three chances so as
you come out of the loop and it will
stop so this is an example of nested
vine now let me go back to my
presentation and I'll show your example
of for loop as well so this is an
example of nested for loop so over here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
write a code in order to print the
Pythagorean number between a particular
range so what happens is suppose if I
want to enter the number 20 that means I
want the Pythagorean numbers between 1
to 20 so particular numbers are nothing
but the integers which satisfy a square
plus B square is equal to C squared so
at that time it will print all the
Pythagorean numbers that are possible
between 1 to 20 3 4 5 you can see that 3
square 4 square is equals to 5 squared 9
plus 16 is equals to 25 similarly it
goes 4 5 2013 6 8 10 8 1579 12 15
similarly for 12 16 and 20 Dover you
guys I'll go back to my Python and I'll
explain you how you can do that so this
is the example of a nested 4 so first
over here I need to import certain
modules in order to use the square root
function so from math module I am going
to import the square root function after
that last me for the number in the
example if you can remember the slides
where I've written 20 so does printed
the particular numbers between 1 to 20
that same number it will ask me and it
will print the Python numbers between 1
to n so whatever the number n that I am
going to put in or give an input after
that I'll run a for loop and it will say
that for a which is a variable in range
1 to n plus 1 that means 1 to n that
means 1 to N plus 1 but don't include n
plus 1
after that there is one more variable B
which is in the range a comma n that
will not include n it'll only include
till n minus 1 so the square root C
square I've defined one more variable C
square is equal to a exponential or a ^
2 similarly B raised to the power of 2
alright and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to calculate the square root
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define one more variable C and
it will be an integer that will be the
square root of C square so if that C
square is minus C square is equal to
equal to zero then print ABC it's pretty
simple logic guys okay explain it once
more name so this is an example of
nested four so over here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to first import the
square root function from the math
module I up to that I'm going to input a
number so if you can remember in the
slides I have given it as 20 so it will
print the Pythagorean numbers between 1
to 20 over here also it will print the
Pythagorean numbers between 1 to n so
whatever the value of n you input that
will be depending upon it so the
particular numbers will be depending
upon the values that you input so it'll
be printing the particular numbers
present between 1 to n after that I will
run a for loop which says that for a
should be in the range 1 to n plus 1
that will not include n plus 1 guys
it'll only include n so 1 till n plus 1
but don't include n plus 1
after I've defined one more for loop
which says that for be in range a comma
n it won't include n it will be 10 only
n minus 1 I have defined one more
variable here which is equal to C
underscore square that is equal to a
square plus B square now after that I've
defined one more variable C and this
will be actually the integer of the
square root of the C underscore square
all right
so whatever value that you will get here
the square root of that value will be
converted to an integer value and will
be assigned to C now one if condition I
will be using here which says that if C
underscore square minus C square is
equal to
equal to zero then print ABC that means
that will be a pie too good a number so
this is a pretty simple logic guys if
you have understood it just give me a
thumbs up or you can ask me any
questions that you have in your mind all
right so I hope you have understood the
code that have explained you here now
let us go ahead and execute this and see
what happens
yeah so the first number that I'm going
to type in say five and give me all the
particular numbers present between one
to five so we have only one particular
number that is three four five in that
range now I'll execute this once more
and I'll type in ten here so we have two
particular numbers there are three four
five and six eight ten similarly if I
execute it once more and I type in a big
number say 25 yeah so we have these many
pythagoras numbers present wien 1 225 so
I hope you have understood how to use
nested for loop if you have any doubts
please write it down in your chat box so
we have no doubt Davis clear solar
siddhart gnarly jority Siam kanika Thani
everyone's fine so I've got a
confirmation from almost everyone so
we'll again go back to our slides and
we'll have a look at one more example
now in this example I'll actually be
using a for loop inside a while loop so
what is this example I want the bulk
reservation of train tickets so I have
like group of people who are travelling
somewhere and I want to give their
details such as name age and sex I want
that to happen in bulk I don't want to
give it one by one
I just want it to happen in bulk so for
that what I'm going to use is I'm going
to use a for loop inside a while loop as
I told you earlier as well you can even
use a while loop inside a for loop but
for now I'll use a for loop inside a
while loop and see what happens so let
me go back to my PI charm so this is the
code in which I will be using a for loop
inside a while loop so first I have
defined a variable traveling so in which
you need to input whether yes or no so
if you're traveling you say yes
obviously and then we'll have a while
loop which says that while the condition
is traveling equal to equal to yes that
means if you are willing to travel enter
the number of people who are traveling
so you need to enter the number of
passengers that are traveling and that
will be assigned to a variable num now
there'll be a for loop which says that
for num in range 1 to num plus 1 but it
won't include num plus 1 enter the name
enter age and finally whether the person
is male or a female and then print all
those values now one more thing here is
again it will ask you whether you have
missed someone or not so you need to
input that oops forgot someone so at
that time you can write in yes if you
have forgotten someone that again it'll
execute the loop again it'll ask you the
number of people traveling in all these
details if you write in anything apart
from yes that means you have not
forgotten anyone and it will come out of
the loop so it is a very small example
but a very good example to understand
how for loop can be used inside a while
loop so let me go ahead and execute this
whether you're traveling I would say yes
I am traveling number of people
traveling I would say 3 name is Sora
ages 78 male alright so again it has
asked me for one more name so I'll say
need
is 90
you know female male yep so one more
name I need to type in say I would type
in geography
is 98 made of females female and yup it
will print all those details for me so
now it is asking have you forgotten
someone so if I type in and say yes then
it'll again ask me the number of people
traveling that means it is again
executing the while loop so if I would
say the number of people traveling is 1
and I would type in the name of the
person that was traveling so I would
just say Siddharth whose is is 77 and
he's a male yeah again it has asked me
so if I type in anything apart from yes
say if I type N so yep it'll come out of
the loop and this is how you can
actually use a for loop inside a while
loop so if you have any doubts you can
ask me guys alright so we have no doubts
as natalie says no doubts
Siddharth Dorothy everyone I've got a
confirmation from almost everyone so let
me just open my slide and yep so this
was an example of a for loop inside of
while loop now I am giving you an
assignment guys what you have to do you
have to come up with a good problem
statement in which you need a vile OOP
inside a for loop and you need to get
that assignment before the next class so
let us move forward and I'll give you a
brief summary of what all things we have
discussed the till now first we saw why
we need loops we actually use the
example of software module for payroll
processing in which I showed you two
methods the one is manual and the
another one in which you are using loops
after I told you what exactly I loops
and we saw various types of loops in
Python namely vile foreign nested then
we focus on each of these loops we
started with while loop and I explained
you well to use by loop I gave you two
examples of I loop similarly for for
loop I explained what exactly's for loop
how it works its syntax and two examples
again for for loop when you talk about
nested loops again I've explained you
the syntax how to use it and I've given
you three examples for nested loop as
well as I showed you earlier in that
your assignment your assignment is to
write a code in which you are using a
while loop inside a for loop alright so
