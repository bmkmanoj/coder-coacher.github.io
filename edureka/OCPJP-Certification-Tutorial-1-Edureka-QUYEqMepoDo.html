one present today my name is vineet and
I'll be the instructor for all of you in
today's class we'll be going to the
basics of Java in the core starters OC
pjp certification course that is powered
by a dareka okay now OC pjb
certification is very important
certification that is provided by oracle
itself blessin says hello hello lesson
now in order to go for this
certification you have to prepare
yourself thoroughly okay so you need of
course you need a preparation before
that so you should go through a course
before actually taking up the final OC
pjp examination so let's understand why
should you go for OC pjp 6.0
certification first of all first of all
you will be receiving a certificate by
oracle so it is a good it is a big name
it is a big thing if you have got a
certification from Oracle it is like an
excellence patch on your resume a
whenever you mentioned that yes I am
certified certified by Oracle then you
get a preference while seeking for job
is if you are up fresher if you are a
professional it will help you to switch
jobs right and finally it takes you a
step ahead than others always whenever
you are going for an interview or any
job you'll be preferred more than others
because you are Oracle certified so this
is one reason why you should take OC PTP
now in order to take OC pjp you'll be
you should be prepared thoroughly before
that now let's understand how to prepare
for OC t tape e 6.0 for doing that you
should have the understanding of kochava
concepts thoroughly because the syllabus
of OC p JP includes the kochava part so
you should be thorough with the core
java concepts you should be solving
simulation test regularly
what is simulation test it is like mock
paper exactly similar to the OC pjp
examination okay so these simulation
tests will actually prepare you for the
final exam in our course will be
you ten do 20 simulation tests so that
you are very familiar with all these
examination all the pattern that is
followed in OC pjp okay finally you
should have an overview of advanced Java
concepts because sometimes were happen
even in the OSI pjp examination you get
questions from the advanced concepts as
well so you should be you should have an
over your overview of these concepts as
well as not just for the examination
this course actually prepares you for
the entire future whenever you go for a
job the OSI pjp certification is not
only good enough it will certainly get
you a preference but after getting the
job they will expect more from you but
you only have the kochava concept so
that won't help for that you should have
the advanced Java concepts as well that
you'll be receiving in this very course
now you should have a continuous
practice under guidance guidance is very
important while preparing for OC pjp you
should know how to solve a problem in
how much time each question has to be
attempted right now sorry before we now
without wasting any more time we'll just
move on to the java concept will start
with java now for a server Java is not
just a programming language but it is a
complete platform for object-oriented
programming that means in Java all the
up concepts are being followed like
inheritance and capsulation abstraction
okay so everything in Java actually
revolves around object you have to make
an object first of all and then only you
can do certain operations on them so you
should be clear that Java follows the
object-oriented programming
what is JRE TR is the java runtime
environment
whenever you have to run a java
application on to your system you should
have JRE installed in your system you'll
find GRE whenever you go to C Drive in
that you'll go to program files and then
you'll find a Java folder in that Java
folder you can find this JRE because
many software's uses Java ok they are
many of the many applications are Java
applications hence you should have a JRE
installed onto your system as well
what is jdk jdk is Java development kit
whenever you will have to develop a java
application in order to develop that you
need a Java development kit that has to
be installed onto your system if you do
not have a JDK you cannot develop a java
application so all a few peas right down
on the chat window are you clear with
Java JRE and JDK if yes then I'll move
forward to the next slide
everyone darshan says yep clear what
about the rest of you become say yes ok
then I hope it is clear to each and
every one of you moving on I come to
Java Virtual Machine now what is Java
Virtual Machine
it actually makes Java platform
independent first of all it runs the
bytecode second it makes Java platform
independent whenever you write a Java
code that is the Java source code it is
the dot Java file after that you compile
the file it gets converted into dot
class file which is called the bytecode
okay now that bytecode is sent to other
systems locally or through network by
doing so on every system there is a JVM
present now each and every JVM can
understand what is a bytecode can read
the bytecode and after reading the
bytecode it converts the bytecode into a
language that could be understood by
that particular machine for every
operating system there is a different
JVM for like Windows there is a
different JVM for Mac operating system
there is a different JVM for Linux there
is a different one but all of all the
jaebeum's can understand the bytecode
and they will convert that bytecode into
a machine language that could be
understood by that particular operating
system okay so this is why Java is said
to be platform independent language that
means it could run on any kind of
operating system now let us understand
how Java works first of all Java
compilers convert
your code from human readable to
something called byte code in the shower
that is dot Java file gets converted
into byte code using the Java compilers
after that darshan says byte code is
machine dependent or not now there is no
such thing like byte code is machine
dependent right byte code is an
intermediary language that byte code is
only as understood by a JVM JVM is a
machine dependent component which can
convert the byte code into a language
that could be understood by that
particular machine is that clear session
so you cannot save byte code is
independent or dependent of a machine
okay then that's good that says ok now
after you convert the code into byte
code it is interpreted by JVM that means
it has reached some other system there
is a JVM present that JVM will convert
that byte code into a language that
could be understood by that machine in
JVM there is one more thing present that
is just-in-time compiler just-in-time
compiler is a program that turns Java
byte code into instructions that can be
sent directly to the processor ok so I
hope you are clear with this working
please write down on the chat window if
it is so each and every one of you
darshan says yes for about the rest of
you blessin Karthikeyan prearranged and
Shivangi Vikram
Akasha with T ok I receive all the Asus
now that's good
moving on we come to the basic Java
syntax now we'll be dealing with the
programming part how to actually code
the java application now first of all
water class is an object as I told you
in Java everything revolves around
classes and objects so what is the class
a class is a collection of object which
have the same parameter as their class
ok now what you do every code that is
written in Java actually comes inside a
class ok
so you write the class keyword after
that you mention the name of the class
and you open the curly braces within the
brain
says you provide all your code now as it
is written it is a collection of objects
which have the same parameter as the
class so class actually acts as a
blueprint it acts as a template using
that template you can create as many
objects as you want okay now an object
is anything that really exists in the
world so whatever the real operation
that has to be done will be done on
objects they are the real objects they
are the real components now if you see
objects if in a class there are methods
they are variables so using that class
if you make any object that object will
contain these many things that is those
variables that were present in the class
as well as the methods that were present
in that particular class let's try to
see how you actually write a class so I
come to eclipse now first of all this is
eclipse this is the software that you
use for java application development so
i'll make a project in it i go to file i
go to new in that I'll go to java
project i'll give a name to this project
I'll say hello underscore Java I click
on next I click on finish now I have got
I've got my project on the left side
that is the package Explorer in that you
can find a source folder in this source
folder you'll add your class so I'll
right click on it
I go to new I add a class in this I can
name any class first of all like first
class ok and I'll add the main method a
liquid finish so there is a public class
just forget this right now now whenever
you define a class you write the class
keyword and within that you write for
the name of the class after that you
mention the name of the class you open
up the braces right here so this is the
parameter that is followed for defining
a class I'll just show you once again
how do you do it
delete this one I go to the package
again new I go to class give it a name
first
let's go class I click on this also
allowed the main method you guys give me
a second I'll just be back
you
okay then so you created your class
using a class keyword that has class
first class now within that I've
mentioned a main method what is the main
method main method is considered to be
the starting part of your application
whenever you run your application it
directly calls the main method and
whatever the things that are present
within the main method will get executed
now I'll show you how to create the
object of this class I come inside
alright that is the name of the class
first of all that is first underscore
class I give the name I give an object a
name that is anything like OB or
anything according to your choice equals
to mu again you write the name of the
class first class and you put the
parentheses after that and then you
mention the semicolon so this statement
will actually create an object of this
first class right so all of you are you
clear how to use a class how to create
an object of a particular class please
write down on the chat window
everyone okay blessin says yes Vikram
says yes version says what is the
difference between object and instance
both are the same thing they are the
same name for adding okay they are the
different names for the same thing you
can call an object as an instance of a
class or you can say object of a class
okay okay then let's get back to the
presentation
I come to Donna types in Java now in
real world you have got many kinds of
values like you've got numbers you have
got characters letters sentences how to
use those values in your java
application how to store those values
how to define those values in your
application for doing that you have got
data types in Java there are types
define the nature of a value whether it
is a number it is a character or a
sentence now we need different data
types to handle the real world
information as I said now these are the
data types that are available in Java
that is long integer short by double
float character so you can use these
Dora tides to store your integer numbers
to store your letters to store your
sentences okay so for sentences you have
got string so these are the datatypes I
hope you are clear with it moving on
I come to the naming convention of
parables the world of variables
variables are the containers in which
you store your values okay now you
define what kind of value can go into a
variable using the datatype if you write
in size datatype dozen says how to find
now these size are already defined okay
and this is the range that you go
through it is a simple concept you just
search for that do a research and you'll
get it
okay dashing so these are the sizes that
are present okay now how to define a
variable name it could start with a
letter it could start with an underscore
or it could start with a dollar sign
these are the three initials using which
you can define then a variable you
cannot start with a number if you start
with a number then it will be an error
for you okay now these are some examples
of variables that is long first the data
type that is what kind of value this
variable will store you'll mention that
and then you you'll give the name of the
variable you can start with underscore
that's fine you could start with a
letter that's fine dollar is good letter
we'll find work G is fine and V is also
fine so these are all valid data ties
but if you if you define a valuable name
with starting with a number then that
would be an invalid variable name okay
moving on I come to static vs. non
static values there are two kinds of
variables present in Java one is static
variable the second is non static
variables static variables are shared
all across the object of a class there
is only one copy of that variable
now can anyone of you give me a real
world in example where we can use a
static variable in which we only require
one copy of a variable that should be
shared all across the application and
one of you can you give me an example
regarding that if no just right now on
the chart I will give you the answer
I'll give you an example version say is
no lesson says no what about the rest
Bikram says though okay I will give you
the answer then I request others also to
write on the chart Pyrenean says no okay
let's can consider a company like added
a hydrogen company so in that company
they will be many employees each and
every employee will have a profile there
will be a common thing in each and every
profile that is the name of the company
so what you can do you can store the
name of a company in a static variable
because it could be shared all over the
application and that would be a single
coffee even if the name of the company
changes in future you just have to make
a change in one particular position by
doing so it would be reflected in each
of each and every profile because there
is only one copy of the variable present
so all of you have you understood
understood this example now everyone
please write it on the chart if yes
rear-engine says yes russians is okay
Vikram says nice example Thank You Vic
rum okay then now non-static variables
they are simple variables there is a
separate copy for each individual live
object static variables cannot be
declared within a method so there is a
condition you cannot declare a static
variable within a method because if you
define it inside a method it will be
confined to that method scope you have
to declare it globally so I will show
you how to declare a static variable
you mentioned the static keyword first
of all right static then you mention a
data type like integer you give a name
of a variable let's say count equals to
10 so this is a static variable that is
count it has a it has got only one copy
and it has a value that is 10 now you
have to declare it outside to me any
method so it will be declared globally
always if I
move it in the method it will give you
an error as you can see I'll move it
outside now
I'll show you how to use this variable I
will just print out the value of this
variable okay so a static variable
actually acts as a property of a class
so for using a static variable you have
to use the name of the class itself so I
will just show you how to print the
value
so I'll write system dot out dot println
this is the output command using which
you can print the output so what I'll
write just println in that I'll mention
the name of the class that is first
underscore class dot then I can find my
variable that is count okay so this way
I can use the variable that is first
name of the class the dot operator and
then mention the variable that is count
if I run this code for running you can
press this one or right click on your
project go to run as and click java
application so i receive a result 10
because the value of count was 10 so i
hope everyone is clear how to declare a
static variable and how to use a static
variable please write down on the chat
window russian says yes for both the
rest of you I request everyone to
actively participate interact with me
audit the Akash lesson darshan Dinesh
Karthikeyan we run gentle luck okay
moving on we come to operators you
understood how to declare a variable you
understood how to store a value using
the datatypes how to define the nature
of a value now using those values you
can do many kinds of operations but how
to perform those operations that can be
done using operators in Java operatives
in Java has been divided into different
categories basically there are five
categories assignment operator
arithmetic operator relational logical
you know operator so we'll go through
each of them one by one first of all I
come to assignment and arithmetic
operators first assignment operator you
would have seen
you give a variable that is integer x
equals to five that means you are
assigning a value five to the variable
how you are doing it you are doing it
using the assignment operator so
assignment operator assigns a value to a
variable for example x equals to five
that means five value has been assigned
to a variable X using the assignment
operator so it is quite easy to
understand second is the arithmetic
operators arithmetic operators are for
addition subtraction multiplication
division these are common arithmetic
operations now I come to modulo operator
can anyone of you tell me what is the
function of a modulo operator please
write it on the chat window everyone
gives remainders ershon say is exactly
correct it will give you a remainder
like the value of x is equals to two or
five let's say five prints the remainder
of a division tillich says exactly
correct illa for example the value of x
is five and there is a value and there
is a valuable Y whose value is two when
you write X modulo y then it will give
you a result one because the remainder
is one when you divide five by two you
receive a remainder of one
now there is an increment and decrement
operator increment operator will
increment the value of a variable by one
the decrement operator will decrement
the value of a variable by one
okay version will implement it okay
we'll see the practical version so this
was arithmetic operators moving on we
come to relational operators it is used
to compare values these are also quite
quite easy that is when you have to
check whether X is greater than Y or not
this is for X less than Y or not greater
than equals to less than equals 2 this
is the equivalence operator when it
whenever you have to compare the values
whether they are equal or not you will
be using the equivalence that is double
equals to operator not equals to
operator will check whether the value is
not equal to or not
okay so these are some general operators
now we come to logical operators now
everyone be concentrate right here there
are six logical operators conditional
and conditional or bitwise and bitwise
or not operator and exclusive or
operator in conditional and operator
these all operators actually works on
two conditions
okay so conditional operator if first
condition is true and second condition
is true then only conditional and will
give you a true result in any other case
it will give you a false result light
first one is false second one is true it
will give you a false result first one
is two second one is false it will give
you a false result okay both are false
then also it will give you a false
result but if both the conditions are
true in that case only that conditional
and will give you a true result I come
to conditional Lord in conditional or if
either of the conditions are true it
will give you a true result okay both
are true gives you a true result one is
true second is false gives you a true
result first one is called second one is
true will give you a true result and if
both are false in that condition only it
will give you a false result now bitwise
and bitwise and works on single bits
like 1 &amp;amp; 1 1 and 1 bitwise and will give
you a 1 result okay 1 &amp;amp; 0 will give you
a 0 0 result 0 &amp;amp; 1 will give you a zero
result and 0 &amp;amp; 0 will give you a 0
result ok bitwise or works the same it
works on the bits not a single bits like
1 and 1 gives you 1 0 &amp;amp; 1 gives you 1 1
&amp;amp; 0 gives you 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 gives you 0 not
operator not operator will negate the
value will give you a compliment value
okay that is if you write not equal to 1
it will give you a 0 and
if you write true equal not true it will
give you a false result okay
and finally the exclusive-or now can
anyone of you tell me in what conditions
will be receiving results in an
exclusive all that is true results
Vikram and Dinesh when I when will be
dealing with if and else condition there
I will be dealing with operators also I
will be showing you the practical
examples okay after this will go through
a phenols and there I will show you
within the if and else construct how to
use these operators now please tell me
in what conditions I will be receiving
true results in exclusive or please
write down on the chart window let me
see Omni of you can give the answer
okay Karthikeyan says exclusive are
exactly that is the XOR operator like
zero and zero and one and one Russian
says in zero and zero and one and one it
will always give you a false result
Phillips says 1 0 and 0 1 exactly
correct in 1 0 and 0 1 it will give you
a true result that means when the
conditions are alternate first one is
true second is false gives you a result
true first one is called second one is
true it will give you a result true but
if both the conditions are saying in
that case it will give you a false
result like true and true will give you
a false assault
false and false will give me a false
result ok so this was the cut logical
operators will be showing you examples
in a while when we'll be dealing with FL
else construct ok moving on we come to
statements and block a simple statement
is a command terminated by a semicolon
as you can see name equals to Fred
semicolon so this is one statement a
block is a compound statement enclosed
in curly braces nowadays whenever you
show a block you open the curly brace
you close the curly brace now in a block
you can contain multiple statements you
can find one semicolon here so this is
one statement second semicolon over here
so this is second statement right and
finally a block may contain other blocks
within that and it can contain multiple
statements that means there can be
nested blocks present one within the
other I hope you understand this
everyone P side down on the chart window
you clear with it
okay
blessing says yes then it says okay sir
I got it rerun Jen says yes sir hillock
serious okay - Shannon Vikram also says
yes that's good moving on I come to flow
control Java execute one statement after
the other in the order they are written
that means first one will get executed
first then comes second third fourth
fifth so and so on so one after the
other it gets executed in the order they
are written now there are many
statements that actually change the flow
control they are called the flow control
statements you can alternate the flow of
execution by using if if-else and switch
okay we'll also go through looping
statements like core while and do-while
now these are called the Java basic
constructs if-else switch statement for
loop while loop and do-while loop will
be going through them one by one and the
first one is FL syntax now how to use if
else construct in your application you
write the if keyword first within the
pal parentheses what you do you mention
a condition if the condition turns out
to be true then it will execute these
statements that is execute these
statements if condition is true if the
condition is false what it will do it
will skip this part it won't execute
this one it will directly come to the
else part and it will execute these
statement if the condition is false okay
so let's go to eclipse and we'll try to
implement this part I come here I'll
just come in these lines if if else
construct so I need a condition so I'll
use the same static variable I'll place
the simple condition that is count
equals to 10 oh sorry
equivalence 10 okay in that I'll print a
statement system dot out dot println
I'll print count itself similarly I will
copy the statement if the condition is
false it should print okay instead of
this it should print false here and here
it should print true okay so I'll just
save the file now all of you tell me if
I run this code what will be the result
that I would receive darshan says
condition should always generate boolean
result or other can be allowed condition
has to always generate a boolean result
hillocks a is true version okay in java
if all only takes the boolean value
right here but in if you talk about c
language in c language you can even pass
one that is an integer value that is
considered to be true okay yes exactly
correct Dilek an addictive when I run
this code I will receive a value true
because the condition was checked here
count is equals to 10 hence it comes
here execute this block and it will
leave the else block if I change this
condition to not equals to I am
simultaneously using the operator so
everyone take a look now I am using a
not equals to operator I'll run this
code again this time the condition was
false so it printed the else block it's
kept this one okay so I received false
in the console window so this is the use
of if else construct it alternates the
flow of control I'll see the logical
operators so first of all I will show
you conditional on
conditional on and I'll mention the same
okay so we have got two conditions first
one is true second one is also true so
in this case I will receive a result
true around this code control f11 I
receive output true I'll make the first
condition false now and second one is
true when we conditional and this will
receive a false result here so it
directly execute the else part okay now
I'll make both the conditions false and
I run this code I'll receive a false
result because the condition was false
in here
right now we come to conditional or now
if I change this condition to
conditional or what will be the result I
would receive can anyone of you tell me
anyone please write down on the chat
window the Russian say is true Tillich
says false and I go with the logic
artist it will give me a result false
because both the conditions are false
right now say it will give me a false
result in all the other cases if I
change first one to true and second is
false it will give me a true result okay
even in this it will give me a true
result I hope it is clear to everyone
you
so now we move on to explore operator
first of all now in this case both the
conditions are true what will be the
result that I would receive can anyone
of you tell me blessin say is false
Akash say is true Ganesha is false
other this is false exactly correct it
will give me a false result because both
the conditions are same if I change one
of the conditions one is true and the
second one is false
I run this code I'll receive a result
true because the condition was true okay
so all of you I clear with conditional
operators now okay I receive yes since
that's current getting back to the
presentation okay
Dilip says what is the difference
between conditional or and bitwise are
the differences between or actually
works on singular bits okay and these
conditional statement gives you a
boolean value they work on two
conditions
is that clear the italic okay he says
yes moving on I come to switch case
statement this is the format that you
follow you have a switch keyword you
mentioned the expression within that on
the basis of that expression you check
the cases you make different cases if
case is one it will print this one and
it will get out of the loop using a
break statement then again you have got
the second condition if the condition is
true it will execute this block and it
will get out of the loop using the break
statement if the condition does not
matches any one of the cases it will
directly go to the default one and it
will print the default case let's see on
Eclipse how to use switch case I'll just
come in this part again control seven I
move down I come to switch case
statement
I'll pass a key let's define and eat a
value key equals to one
I'll make two cases simple case month
copy this part and I'll mention the
second case as will too so I made two
cases if the case is one what it will
print that is system dot out println it
should only print case one similarly I
will copy this part I'll come to case
two and I print case two right here
Karthik is a switch case can accept
string now in the latest that is GRE
seven the latest version of Java
it can also accept spring but the all
the lower versions do not accept string
okay they can only accept a character
value or an integer value right so I
won't advise you to use a switch case
using this string parameter or a string
expression because your application
won't work in the lower versions is that
clear Karthikeyan please write down on
the chat window yes okay that's good
this time I'll mention D first and I'll
save the file all of you be quick and
tell me what will be the answer if I run
this code exactly Akash it would be case
one yes the lock you are also right
because the value of it was passed right
here so it directly came to case one and
it executed this statement and using the
break statement it got out of the loop
that is out of the switch case if I
change the condition to truth too then
in this case what will happen it will
directly jump to the second case it will
execute this one and it will get out of
the switch case using case - yes please'
Nanaki Akash it will give me a result
case two and if none of the cases
matches let's say seven seven is passed
none of the case matches so it will
directly go to the default one and print
default in the output string that has
default so all of you are you clear how
to use a switch case State
everyone a car says yes what about the
rest of you be quick and let me know the
next is why don't we use break in
default statement because default is
present at the end okay and I am using a
default break statement in the default
one it is completely up to you if you
are met
placing your default one in the end then
you can remove this default okay it
won't matter I hope it is clear to you
getting back to the presentation now we
come to loops okay we'll be starting
with loops now we'll deal with all the
three loops that is for while and
do-while altogether and then we'll go to
eclipse and we'll implement the codes
okay so everyone be patient first of all
for loop but refusing for loop you
mentioned the four keyword you
initialize a variable in in within that
that has integer I equals to zero I less
than 5 I plus plus now this is the
condition on which this loop neurons and
this is the increment value so I will
show you the working first thing is your
variable gets initialized after that it
checks the condition whether the value
of I is less than 5 or not if true it
goes inside and it will execute these
statements after doing that it comes
back and it will increment the value of
Phi right here after that it again
checks the condition and if it is less
than 5 the condition is true it will go
inside and execute the statements once
again and this cycle will go on again
and again until the condition is false
pill the value of I is equal to 5 it is
no more less than 5 in that case it will
be false and it will get you out of the
for loop so all of you are you clear
with the working of a for loop please
write down on this - though Tillich says
yes tension says yeah Acosta's yeas the
knee says yes lesson says yes becomes
easier wonderful now I come to while
loop it is also quite similar but there
is a syntax change ok you'll be
initializing available outside the while
you
uit while Hebert mentioned a condition
on which the loop will Ron mentioned the
statements within the block and the
increment will be present in the block
itself so first of all the van will gets
initialized after that it checks the
condition whether it is true or not
whether the value of I is less than five
or not after doing that if it is true it
goes inside and execute these statements
increments the value of I and then again
comes back and checks the condition if
it is true it will follow the cycle till
the time the condition gets false till
the time I is equals to five okay so
this loop will run I hope you are clear
with my loop as well it is quite similar
to the for loop moving on I come to the
do-while loop for do-while loop you
initialize a variable first of all you
use the do keyword in the block you
mentioned the statements and the
increment you after that you mentioned a
while keyword and you place the
condition on which this do-while loop
will run so first thing initialization
of variable second goes inside and it
will execute the statements increments
the value and checks the condition so
after checking the condition again comes
and execute the statements the cycle
will run till the condition is false
till the value of I is equals to 5 now
can anyone of you tell me what is the
difference in Google loop there's
something different in Dubai loop then
while or for loop can anyone of you tell
me he's right down on the chat window
until that time I'll go to eclipse
okay Karthikeyan says can be able to use
string incarnation like I equals 2 hello
in condition like yes Karthikeya
absolutely you can pass hello in your
case switch case statements but in the
later version of Java ok in the previous
versions you won't be able to do it a
car says at least once tie code executes
exactly correct akka in do-while
absolutely correct
the lock says it executes at-least once
even though it does not satisfies the
given condition absolutely correct okay
so let's see the examples how to
implement it will be quite quick because
I think you guys are already aware of
the loops so right for in teacher I
equals to zero I less than five that is
the condition and finally I increment
the value that is I plus class in that
I'll mention the condition that I'll
execute the statement system dot out dot
println I'll print the value of I and
all of you be quick if I run this code
what will be the result that I would
receive on the console window everyone
right down on the chart zero Akasha is
zero to four and that's the correct
answer control f11 that is zero to four
Denisha is five know that this is zero
to four correct that's good now I'll
move down I'll implement I'll just come
in this for loop now at any point if
anyone of you have got any question you
can ask me okay
I come to why loop now while loop with
condition I'll define a viable int
condition equals to zero initializing
the variable I'll make a condition less
than five okay within the while loop but
although I will place a statement
similar to the four one that a system
dot out dot println it will print the
value of condition itself now if I run
this loop what will be the result I
would receive no Karthikeyan not like
that
like if you have God I will just show
you less and say is 0-2 for no blessing
it won't it will be an infinite loop
right now it will keep on printing zeros
it is because I haven't placed a
increment condition so I have to
increment the counter as well that is
condition plus plus and semicolon this
time it will give me a result 0 to 4
exactly correct okay now I'll just
quickly answer karthikeyan's question
let's say make it spring
hello equals to hello
okay I hope that again this answers your
query right now are you clear up please
quickly write down on the chat window if
you have understood this lesson say yes
Karthik and let me know now I will
implement the do-while loop okay let's
use the same variable I will command
this while one the nature is clear on
circuit again says yeah it's my dog so
is it clear to you that again that's
what I'm asking it can accept it okay I
was showing you the example now I come
to do while loop let's use this string
as well equals two
hello in this also I will show you right
within this I'll place a statement
system dot out dot println and it will
print condition itself now this loop
will keep on running okay I'll run this
code it will keep on printing hello
because the condition will always be
equal to hello right so if I change the
condition within that I will just write
rendition equals to this time my name
not has been eat and I put a semicolon
so I'm changing the value of condition
and now I run this code what will be the
result I speak he tell me okay I'll run
this code I receive only hello because
first time it runs at least once and
then the value of condition was changed
the condition was false hence it did not
run for the second time no other that
won't print money
okay no cars again you cannot increment
the string value okay and yes you're
right
okay then quickly getting back we are
done with loops now I come to methods
methods have got five components one is
modifiers the return type the method
name the parameter list in parentheses
and the method body enclosed between
braces so this is the diagram return
type it could be public private
protected so that is a return type sorry
that is the modifiers okay public
private protected that is what is the
permission for using this method then we
come to return type what kind of value
will this method return whether it will
be a integer value a string or character
okay or whether it will not return
anything in that case we'll mention it
as void second thing is the name of the
method by using the name of the method
you will be using this method in your
application okay this would be the
identifier of this method finally we
come to the number of parameters that is
what kind of parameters and how many
parameters does it take let's take an
example of an addition function now that
addition function will take two input
parameters that has two integers so
you'll be mentioning int X comma int Y
using those values of x and y it will
compute the addition you'll in the body
of the method within the braces okay
here you'll be making the logic you'll
be writing the logic of this method that
is what kind of operation this method
will perform so let's see a very small
example of a method so that you are
clear how to use a method so I come here
outside the main method I mentioned
first of all I'll show you void method
void add so this is a simple void method
I'll print something system dot out dot
println printing
boid okay it will print boy now you for
using this method I have created an
object of this class so using the object
I can use the contents of the class so
I'll write OB dot
I can use the add method and I call this
method now when I run this code all of
you tell me what will be the result that
I were to see please write down on the
chat window
Danae say is void Tillich says void akka
says word Denise's okay absolutely
correct for run this code it will
directly call when it executes the
statement that is OB da tired it will
call this function and it will print
void now I'll change this method I'll
put a return type in that that is it
will return an integer value and within
this I'll make integer X comma integer Y
okay so it will add the numbers and in
system dot out dot println it will print
I will just remove this I'll add a
return type okay whenever a function is
using return so you have to use the
return keyword in that I'll return the
sum of x and y so all of you are you
clear with this that is I have written
right here written X plus y that means
it will return the sum of value x and y
that again says yes what about the rest
of you
yes finish you can come up with your
doubt absolutely I did they Akash what
about you blessin create the rerun
gentle arc okay I receive yes says so I
come here on the table now this time I
have to pass parameters as well so let's
say 10 comma 10
okay hundred and 1 comma 10 let it be
and I'll say I'll just print this value
out okay system dot out println within
this alpha said and I'll close the
parentheses so whatever value that will
be returned from this method will be
printed out on the console window so
tell me what will be the result I would
receive Akasha is 111 that's correct
I'll receive one one one the luck it
will be 111 yes all of you are correct
nomination is asking me a question that
is why we use int by return okay because
it is using two integer values right so
it the Sun will also be an integer value
hence we are mentioning that it will
return int
a value are you clear of lesson sorry
are you clear Dinesh please write down
on the chat window okay that's good we
come to erase an array is a list of
similar things that is it can store all
the similar kind of items it is a
storage container an array has got three
things fixed one is the name of the
array second is the type of the array
that means what kind of values this
array can store and finally the length
of the array what will be the size of
the array that means how many element
can this array can store so these must
be declared when the array is created
array size cannot be changed during the
execution of the codes so let's see how
to use an array so just commenting this
and even this here itself I show you in
a race so write the value what kind of
value it will store give the datatype
for the array integer give the name of
the array put the brackets equals to new
operator will assign memory to this
array again mention the return integer
type that is what kind of values open
the brackets and within the brackets
mention the size of the array so this
array right here has got a name that is
a double R it can store in dejure values
within it and the size of the array is 5
that means it can store 5 values within
this array the index of these two array
you can store values in the array like
this just array 0 so it starts from 0 so
the final index will be 4 0 to 4 so
write 1 like this
so using the index you can assign the
array or you can directly use a loop to
fulfill the erase all right for loop
integer I equals to zero I less than you
can for one thing you can do you can
write I less than five or you can use
the name of the array a double r dot
length
okay length is the property of an array
which fetches the size of the array
finally increment the value of I in this
first of all I'll add a double are open
the brackets in that I'll pass I as
index equals two I'll put the value I
plus one within that and there itself
I'll print the value of array also as
system dot out dot println a double are
brackets and with that high so all of
you if I run this code what will be the
result I would receive note that you
cannot do that I will just show you it
will give you an error the nature is
five it will print the value from one to
five Akash you are correct that is one
two three four five so all of you are
you clear how to use an array now Ganesh
is saying sorry Tillich is saying can be
mentioned it like this here five so it
will always give you an error I will
show you other things as well you can
remove this bracket and you can place
before the name as well this is also the
correct syntax or another way is open
the curly braces put the semicolon
within that place your values so it will
directly take the size automatically
okay it will be initialized as well as
size will be defined like this so tell
us I hope your question has been
answered
I got the gainsaying if we overload
array what will be what will happen if
you overload it it will actually show
you another integer or sorry let's say
any other type character okay
array
a double R equals to the brackets so can
you see it is showing you an error even
if I put elements within that characters
past like this so you cannot overload
the RNA are you clear with it
Karthikeyan please write down on the
chart window okay that's good
so example of an array as soon as you
write this statement gets executed there
is a memory allocated first memory
location is array 0 or a 1 or a 2 or a 3
or a 4 using which you can assign the
values so I run this for loop same loop
that is I questions oh I less than 5 I
plus plus I will be 0 first time so I
Raziel Oh will have value 1 right here
array 1 will have 2 array 2 will have 3
for the 4 time array for array 3 will
have 4 value and re4 will have got 5
value and after that it will get out of
the for loop so I hope everyone of you
is quite clear how to use an array how
to populate it and how to print the
array please write down on the chat
window then I'll move on to the next one
Dilek says yes the naysayers yes Cathy
Cain says yes Acosta's yes or for the
rest of you play dungeon lesson lesson
says yes these are other examples of
array and I've already told you that is
array dot length and length property can
be used to find the length of the array
that is the size of the array now we
come to the actual implementation ok we
learn the few concepts and even you guys
had few knowledge of Java from before
itself so can you tell me the answer
right here the answer to this question
what will be the output if I run this
particular code that is right in front
of you first you give me the answer and
then I'll show you the solution for it
northern Asia that won't be the answer
see the question in front of you that is
written there is a boolean variable you
have gotten de jure x equals to 343 now
in Y you are creating the object of a de
de de this is other way and you are
calling the function that is go in that
you are passing first the boolean
variable and the value X the variable X
so it will be stored in B the boolean
true and the variable 343 this function
gets executed they will be a value
return and it will be stored in the
variable Y finally you are printing the
value Y now if you can give me a give me
the answer everyone give it or just
right now on the chart then I will give
you the solution I will show it think it
is quite easy answered lesson says no
now these questions are actually on the
pattern of OC p JP examination right
okay Danae says 49 Tillich says error
denise is seven akasha is 49 de neige
says 49 and seven northen H those of you
who have said that the result would be
49 are correct
I'll show you how so I'll just open the
solution I have got the solution from
before so this was the code right here
which you needed to true in the question
it was true okay so we have got true
boolean variable X equal to 343 I am
passing true and boolean variable to the
function so B will be equal to true and
I will be equal to 343 right here akaash
says e Karthikeyan says how ok so since
you are calling this function you are
passing boolean variable and 343 it is
saved in B that is true and I will 343
you are checking the condition F if the
condition is true it directly goes
inside and returns the value that is I
divided by 7 which is equal to 343
divided by 7 equals to 49 49 is returned
and it saves to Y and you are printing
Devourer
it does not come to this statement I run
this code ctrl f11 and you can see the
result 49 on the console window if I
change it to false okay
the condition is boolean variable is
false here it won't go inside and it
will execute this one this time you'll
be receiving the result 7 ctrl f11 I
received the result 7 in the console
window so Karthikeyan are you clear each
and every one of you please write down
on the chat window you clear with it how
you are receiving the result 49 there ok
that's good now the question round is
not clear I'm coming to the second
question whether it's me rear-engine
says got it sir
now give me the answer to this question
right here
now which code fragment inserted at line
food that means this one first second
third and this is the fourth line which
of the lines right here will give you a
result like this that is 1 bar there is
a space and this value and then a bar
tell me if first one will give you this
result of the second one or the third
one Akash is that the third one will
give you the result what about the
others do you think Akash is correct
Danae say is no idea sir deluxe a is
third one blessin says no idea Priya
runyan rear-engine says no idea that
again says don't know absolutely silicon
Akash are correct it will give you the
result third third one the third
statement so let's see now I come to
question two and open this now I'll just
print the third one ctrl f11
as you can see bar there is a space and
then twelve point three four five now
ganesh is saying how in sake i tell you
now point three is representing that
after the point it will be displaying
three values hence you have got three
four three seven is represent
that there will be total of seven spaces
that is 5 3 4 3 that is 3 space dot is
both 1 2 is v 1 1 is 6 1 and finally a
space pad a 7 so total will be 7
characters that is 7 spaces and after
point it will print 3 values if I change
this 7 to 8 this time there will be 8
spaces so in starting you have got to
space cut again says he has got it what
about the nation the rest of you let me
know have you understood it lesson says
got it
Tillich says yes what about the others
Akash says yes that's good moving on to
the third question Ganesha has
understood sir now give me the answer to
this one I told you an array right now
I'm asking you about a two dimensional
array this question is on two
dimensional array now sometimes you
would have seen that in your examination
you receive a question out of the codes
right so this is an out of the course
question for you give me the answer to
this what will be the result will it
print 2 3 4 6 or 7 or 8 is a compilation
fails the NACE is 3 I don't think the
nays 3 would be the answer
Akash says error Akash you are also
wrong Karthikeyan says answer is 3 data
speed no Karthikeyan the answer is not 3
what about other skies attempt the
question let me know blessin say 6 well
lesson you are quite close they're
actually figuring out outright but still
if your answer is wrong Dilek says 7
exactly correct answer 7 would be the
answer and I'll tell you how it is 7
good answer to luck I come here I'll
just close this
I opened the question 3
this is the question now what is
happening you're printing y21 okay Wisie
acts exactly similar to X because you
are assigning y the complete values of X
okay so you are actually asking for two
and one let's understand this format
first of all so this is one block the
first bracket you have got two brackets
so this is one block this is the second
block and this is the third block but in
your java every index starts from zero
so this is zero block this is one block
and this is the second block okay so if
you're writing in the first block - so
it is directly going to the second block
first of all then you're writing one so
the values are 0 1 so one at one
position it is seven hence it is
printing with the value 7 control f11
and in the console window you can see
seven Akasha is okay I got it
Karthikeyan says yes is answer is seven
what about the rest of you all of you
write down on the chart window
are you clear with that Denise are you
clear with it Dilek says yes then it's a
simple idea I feels ok so I hope you are
clear with that every one of you and I
come to one more question and this is
also n out of the course question it is
on the ArrayList ok now tell me what
will be the result if you execute this
code right here
every one of you please write down on
the chat window what will be the result
Vanessa's see okay what about the rest
what do you think Ganesha is correct the
luck says D okay I'll go with Denise
Denise has answered this question
correctly I'll show you how I come to
the fourth question now now you have got
an ArrayList you have inserted value 1 5
&amp;amp; 3 so I'll just come in these part
first of all these two and I'll only
print the ArrayList so I'm calling
collection ArrayList is a kind of
collection
yasaka stats the correct answer
ArrayList is the kind of collection so
using which what I am doing I am
printing the array okay I press ctrl f11
so it will sort the array I will also
come in this one so that you can find
out the difference first of all I added
the value so it is 1 5 and 3 after that
I execute this statement that is
collection dot sword
I passed the ArrayList that is he I run
this code this time I will receive 1 3 5
it has sorted it has arranged the values
in an ascending order after that I add
one more value that is 2 so if I add one
more value so I will receive a result 1
3 5 2 as you can see 1 3 5 2 then I
reverse the value when I reverse it I
will receive a result 2 5 3 1 and that's
the answer
2 5 3 1 so all of you have you got the
answer Tillich have you understood it
Deluxe is okay what about the rest of
you everyone write down on the chart
Kathy can say yes Aakash says yes simple
ok so this was the final question for
all of you so this is the way we
actually teach ok we provide you the
concept first of all after that we take
you through few questions after the at
the end of the class or that you get you
get to apply your concepts right and
let's give you few more information a
car says don't you teach offline no
Akash we provide online class
says because these are much more
beneficial than the offline I will give
you the advantage like you do not have
to go anywhere so you are saving a lot
of time of going and coming back from
there right
second thing online the availability of
the instructor instructor will be more
you can come online anytime on skype and
you can take the Skype session with an
expert you can ask as many queries that
you born ok we will be available
throughout the week for you right then a
says good timings of classes exactly now
I'll show you few details I'll tell you
each and every detail of the course so
that you are quite familiar with it so I
go to Chrome now open a new record and
first of all login with your Facebook
account after entering your details
you'll be logged in directly scroll down
and you can find STJ POC TP 6.0 click on
that he'll come to this page right here
so these are the key features salient
features of this course live online
classes will be held for you ok 24/7
online expert help will be available to
you
it's than simulation with 10 full-length
mark examinations ok will prepare you
thoroughly for the final exam that is
the OCT AP exam now will provide you the
same pattern papers and will provide the
time in that time you'll be attempting
that exam itself and you have to clear
that will be the one will be telling you
that yes now you are prepared to take
the examination okay and you can go at
your own pace it is not so that if i say
that in one in one month you have to
complete the course and after that it is
up to you take your exam it is not like
that
the way we teachers will be preparing
you till the time you're actually
prepared okay we'll set the target and
we'll prepare you till that time and
then we'll tell you yes now you are
prepared for the examination you can go
for it then aces cost of examination
fees for OCP JP for OCP JP you have to
take the examination from oracle itself
ok and the cost is near
$300 that is around 15,000 rupees
okay that is why people actually take a
course before that so that they can
prepare themselves for the final OC pjp
exam once they take the course complete
the course and then they apply for OC
pjp takane says can we be able to ask
questions on any time exactly
Karthikeyan that is what 24/7 online
expert health means okay you can have
Skype sessions as well
Aakash says o OC pjp combines both j2se
and j2ee now I'll explain you Akash for
CT JP only includes the core Java
certification first of all there are
three levels first level only includes
the core Java one now in this course
you'll also receive the recorded
sessions of all the classes like you are
attending the class right now you'll
receive the recorded session of this
very class so you can go through the
recording again and again and clear the
concepts you will be becoming a Oracle
certified Java programmer after OC pjp
as well as once you do our course will
also provide your certification from Ed
Eureka itself which will be globally
accepted and can be verified from our
website okay let me show you a course
content that is in this we'll be
teaching all those topics of core Java
apart from that we'll also cover
advanced topics like networking applets
event handling AWT swing JDBC
connectivity JSP and servlets rmi these
are not the topics of scj p SC JP and OC
p JP are same thing Akash they are both
the same thing the name says how many
years the certification will be valid
once taken it will be always valid
Ganesh
Akash is what is something exam fee for
that is $300 that is around 1500 rupees
fifteen thousand rupees sorry okay so in
this course we will not only prepare you
for the OC pjp examination but also we
prepare you for your future when you go
for a job you'll certainly get a
preference right
since your origin you'll be Oracle
certified after you clear a paper but
you'll only have the knowledge of core
Java and that is not good enough for a
company hence what we do we not only
provide you the core Java we not only
prepare you for OC pjp but we also
prepare you for your future for your
company experience and we provide you
all the advanced topics as well in this
very course so I hope you have quite
clear with it you can come to the page
and go through the course content as
