Eureka and welcome to today's session on
our tutorial so let's not waste any time
and let's move forward and look at
today's agenda we'll begin this session
by first understanding why do we need
analytics and what exactly is Business
Analytics and why do we prefer our over
the other tools in the industry after
that we will begin by deep diving into
our by understanding the basic
fundamental concepts like variables in
our data operators data types and flow
control finally towards the later half
of the session we will try to understand
how you can plot the various types of
grass in AI so I will have today's
agenda ok so I have got a confirmation
from Eric Shubham Dave roshni
Gayathri Reshma Pankaj ok it's great to
see that all of you guys have fallen so
I hope you guys are excited for the
session as I am so let's not waste any
more time and let's move forward and
look at the first topic for today's
session that is why do we need analytics
now before we actually move into the
content in the slides I just want you to
spend two minutes to have a thought and
let me know why do you feel we need
analytics so the most common answers
that I have got from you guys is that we
use analytics to make better decisions
that's perfectly right but analytics is
not just used for making better
decisions
there are many major things that
analytics helps us achieve so we'll
mainly be discussing the need for
analytics across four major parts now
talking about the need for analytics in
an organization we can come across these
four points now the first point is Cost
Reduction now every company invest a
huge amount with respect to different
resources that they take it could be an
investment on another company it could
be investment on the same company across
their employees
it could be with respect to certain
marketing campaigns that they are
running certain research they're putting
into but how do they know which is going
to be successful and which needs for
investment and where you need to cut
sure and that's exactly what analytics
helps us achieve through analytics we
can
identify with section is actually
performing well now I am let's say
you're investing maybe 50 million on
three companies as such so not all
companies achieve the same level of
performance and give you the same reward
with respect to that so you would
definitely prefer to invest more in a
company that is giving you more reward
and to know that what you need to do is
you need to analyze the performance of
that company
now this is a big example let's take a
smaller example we end up spending money
on a lot of unnecessary things over them
and at times we end up short over the
market now I personally have experienced
this a lot of times and here what we
actually need is to analyze and reduce
the cost expense that we take up on a
regular basis I personally had invested
a lot of my money into fitness side so
finally after some time when I had
checked how was I making the right
decision investing that I realized I was
it so again those are one of the key
things that help you identify and make a
better decisions with respect to that
say you know Eric items stop going to
the gym I just increase that and reduce
a certain level of unnecessary
investment so again those were decisions
I had made after carefully analyzing my
investments as well as my opportunities
which in turn also helped me reduce the
cost that I was spending so the next key
part that I would be talking about is
better marketing okay now again it's
always important to understand how the
present market is and what is the public
demand as well once you understand that
it becomes easier for you to market your
product according to the requirements of
the user as well as create a better
product that would meet the requirements
of the user in itself now if you have a
good product by yourself then almost
everyone would definitely go for your
product rather than any other product
and not much so this can be achieved
through an Alexis similarly comes making
better decisions with respect to your
investments and marketing now if I know
how the market is how the trend is how
things are working in the market then
it's easy for me to make a decision that
could have normally taken a lot of time
this is basically because I've already
analyzed the market I've already
understood
everything I have understood the
requirements the needs and even tried
out a few models but what would happen
if I had done this I would have even
tried out some scenarios with respect to
that and once I have tried it I have
experimented all this I analyze the
complete result then it's piece of cake
for me it would make a decision calls
that so it's quite fast when you compare
to a rather risk-taking situation where
I have no idea how the marketers have
not even bothered thinking on what is
the requirements but still I am just
going with that flow so data analytics
definitely makes it easier for you to
make better business decisions and
better marketing policies finally comes
organizational analysis now every
company needs to understand where they
are in the current ways now to do that
one of the key factors is to help
understand how they are performing
themselves now organizational analysis
helps them understand how they are
performing as an individual as well as
organizational support now we've all had
our shares of reviews there are
quarterly reviews that are yearly
reviews all that comes into picture and
helps the organization understand better
who is actually devoting more towards
the organization and whom to take up up
the chain with respect to that now we've
definitely seen this on our day to day
basis because we've seen certain people
who do perform extremely well being
pulled up but compared to people who got
more experiences so always this analysis
that is done within the organization
helps you achieve better result as an
organization as a co now with these four
points I hope you guys have got a simple
understanding as to why we need
analytics in an organization as well as
on a personal life aspect as well ok so
I've got a confirmation from shabam
Reshma Eric Pankaj that's great to see
guys so again please make sure at any
point if you're not clear with any
concepts or if you have any doubts or
even if there's something that you want
me to repeat once again you put it
across in the chat box if I have to
repeat the same concept ten times I have
no problem but I want to make sure that
you guys are completely clear with
respect to what we're discussing as part
of today's session okay keep that in
mind let's move forward and
understand what exactly is Business
Analytics we understood why we need but
then comes the question on what exactly
is Business Analytics now Business
Analytics basically is the process of
examining the large set of data that you
have and achieving a hidden pattern or
correlation between that or even a
better insight as to what you need to do
it basically helps you understand with
all the data that you have gathered this
could be your organizational data it
could be the market research it could be
your product research once you've
completely analyzed all these data then
you could find something that you are
lacking
once you identify this then it becomes
quite easy for you to make better
decisions better products better
marketing strategies and so far now
again if you look at the image here
below this is exactly how your data is
at mobile
it's a scattered mess okay you've got
everything that you want present in your
data but to find anything specific
becomes a problematic and to understand
how you're doing is an even bigger mess
so to achieve all that you need to use
analysts through lambda this process it
becomes easy for you to make a
correlation under structure across the
data that you have so that it becomes
easy for you to go ahead and make the
better decision now analytics is not the
complete solution as such and it helps
you understand how you are exactly doing
at the moment with respect to what you
have already tried out as well so once
you have established the path for you to
move ahead it becomes quite easy for you
to make a decision on which path you
want to go or follow and which path will
take you for the betterment of your
organization so clear it up okay now the
result of this analysis that you perform
may not be something that could be
always understood by someone who's not
from an analytical back
and this attacks becomes a hindrance
because you can't expect the people in
the chain above to always understand the
raw data that you are providing them
after analytics so to overcome this gap
we have a concept of data visualization
but what exactly is data visualization
data visualization basically is a visual
access to the huge amount of data that
you have generated after analytics now
again when you talk about why we need to
use data analytics it's a quite
straightforward and a simple
understanding that the human mind
processes visual images and visual
graphics move better than compared to
raw data as it's always easy for us to
understand a pie chart or a bar graph
better when compared to the raw numbers
that you will be providing and this is
something that's common for anyone
across because this is how our human
minds have been said now you may be
wondering how can you achieve data
visualization are from the data that you
have already analyzed then to do that
there are major tools in the market
press these are some of the major
players in the market at best now here
you have tableau click view R as well as
Penta for bi and you can see a lot of
other tools as well now these are some
of the major tools now and when you look
at tableau and click those are tools
that are completely dedicated to data
visualization itself ok
but then again you all must be one
regnant there are already these tools
that help you achieve data visualization
and certain amount of analytics why go
with R and that exactly what I will be
explaining now when we talk about why R
with respect to other tools in the
market one of the two major points that
I would definitely like to bring out
first itself is is both a programming
language and the statistical languages
now I am quite sure that some of you
would have at least heard that R is hard
and is not one of the easiest subjects
that you can pick up but trust me with
respect to R capability as a programming
language and a statistical language it
is the best in the market ok and when
you look at how easy it is to code in R
then you will definitely realize how
things are apart from that R can be used
for both data analyst
as well as visualization now if you look
at some of the other tools that we had
seen in the previous slide they are
tools that are specific to achieving
either data analytics or data
visualizations vessel but with our you
can achieve both analysis as well as
data visualization in a single tool
itself so here again it becomes a tool
for multi-purpose now apart from this R
is one of the simplest languages to
learn as I have mentioned earlier now R
is quite close to the English language
therefore writing codes in R is a piece
of cake okay now in today's session we
will be trying out a lot of codes as we
are going into R so at the end of the
session you will completely be able to
understand how easy it is to learn and
how simple R is for performing various
operations now one of the key reasons as
to why Ark is so popular is because it's
a free and open source project now again
when you talk about free and open source
project it basically means that anyone
can download it anyone can modify the
original source code of it and anyone
can feel free to redistribute this code
as well so arc lets you completely
player on with its source code itself so
if someone is actually doing that with
their products or schools then you can
completely understand how popular how
open and how big the community is with
respect to that - now R has a very huge
community comprising of both programmers
and analysts so here you can find both
flavors and everyone is quite friendly
and health so at any point if you have
certain queries along the line in your
career using R feel free to reach the
our community and you can definitely
find someone who'll be able to assist
you so any questions to hear about what
is data analytics by what is data
visualization and why are exactly ok
Pankaj is asking me house are better
than tableau so Pankaj again here when
you see definitely I would say tableau
helps you achieve better visual graphics
but for tableau you need to always feed
in and analyze data ok so then once you
have your analyze data set then it just
you can perform certain operations like
filtering out or selecting certain
amount of data but true
you can actually completely perform the
process of analysis and Bend and that
says you can achieve your data
visualization you don't need to depend
on any other tool for achieving data
visualization with respect to the data
that you have achieved through analysis
so basically you're reducing the need
for another tool itself is that clear
Pankaj okay so with this it's time we
begin deep diving into that and the
first thing that you guys need to do is
install R on your system okay to do that
all you need to do is go to the official
site of art that is Graham dot R -
product over G let me just show you that
so you can just open your browser and
search for download R and you get the
first link now the first link is for
Windows for those who are working with
Windows can directly click on this and
go to click on download option okay for
those of you who are working with
different operating systems like Mac or
Linux you just need to go to their home
page and here you have the option for
Mac and Linux and inside Windows you
need to always ensure is that you're
downloading the base option because
that's exactly what you need as part of
this session so once you've gone ahead
and downloaded this an exe file would be
downloaded so again if you click on
basically redirects you to the first
place that we had come in so just click
on download for Windows and you can see
the exe file for downloading so just
save it now I've already installed it on
my system so you guys can download it
and go ahead with the installation step
it's quite easy all you need to do is
just keep clicking on next so please go
ahead and install and if any of your
face again you troubles please let me
know so that I will be able to assist
you ok so it seems like all of you
successfully installed are on your
system now you can directly begin by
coding in R but what I would recommend
is you go ahead and install the R studio
ide now the purpose of an IDE is
basically to make it easier for you to
program and ask the guiness I'd
definitely recommend that you begin with
downloading and installing the our
studio ide TF so again with respect to
the purpose of downloading and
installing an idea is basically to have
a common environment for working with
respect to your data and as well as
becomes easy for you to learn about the
various
abilities and understand about your
mistakes in an ID better so you can go
ahead to our Studios website let me show
you we need to search for us to your
download
so let me show you the home page for our
studio so this is the home page for art
studio and you just need to click on
download our studio option so here you
can see different versions of our that
are available so I would recommend that
you download the our desktop version
here now
apart from having a free version they do
have a paid version but again I would
recommend that you go ahead and download
the our desktop free version from we
asked from this page so if you click on
download you can see the various options
with respect to each operating system so
again choose the version that suits your
operating system just download it and
then again the installation is quite
straightforward you just need to keep
clicking on next so if any of you are
facing any troubles let me know and then
I'll be able to assist you with respect
to that frame okay so now that all of
you install our studio on your system so
this is basically how your ass should
you looks like so to your left you have
your console to your right you have your
environment window and finally you have
one of the most important windows that
is your workspace window now here
basically if you have multiple tabs here
now again files that you want to work
around with you have your plot so
basically any graph that you're plotting
can be seen here and then you have your
package system so these are very
important options so let's say you want
to install a specific package for your
our program all you need to do is click
on the install button here and then you
can select whichever package that you
let's say I want to install a package
called ggplot2 so again I just have to
type ggplot2
select it from here and then just click
on install so basically what happens
this are actually checks with its
libraries and then it goes ahead
downloads the package and installs it as
part of my ostrich to once downloaded
you can find it here so any packages you
want to understand what exactly it does
or how it works on all you need to do is
just click on the package name and then
here you can find the complete help page
for that package
so here let's say figure ggplot then you
can find the description the usage the
argument it takes for the details and so
far okay so this is a packet basically
used for graphical representation
so I hope you guys know we're simple
understanding on working with the
Oesterle okay so now let's go back to
our presentation and begin by deep
diving into our now the first topic that
we'll be discussing as part of the
fundamental concepts of R is a variable
now available basically is nothing more
than a result memory location use the
store certain values which again in turn
means let's say if you're working with a
value then that value needs to be stored
in that memory and the storage in the
memory you're going to be creating a
variable so it's a very straightforward
simple definition now there are three
ways you can actually create a variable
in our okay if you look at the image
here now again I can directly write the
variable name equal to the value or the
variable name a less than symbol
followed by a hyphen and equal to the
value or even the value - a greater than
symbol and the name of that variable so
these are again the three ways you can
declare a variable in our but again in
turn all of them have the same meaning
in the memory location of such the
difference again let me show you how you
can declare a variable in our and how it
actually works out in the a screen so
let's go back to our our studio and I'm
going to say my a equal to 25 okay
immediately when I type this I want you
to observe the environment window when I
give a renter automatically a new entry
has being pushed into the environment
variable saying that the variable a of
numeric type okay which is occupying 48
bytes has the value of 25 so this is
something automatically done same way
let me say B and I'll give a string
value so let's say hi
how are you today
okay so this is a complete statement can
I give an end up you can see here the
value has a new variable has been
created in is called be the value also
has been set and you can see the memory
location allocated to excel character
type and its occupy 120 bikes so apart
from this you can also work with boolean
value let's say true or let's say false
so I will give it to Val you see
variable C and enter so here you can see
I have declared three variables but
again the way I have declared them is
slightly different but the end result
for all three of them is the same so
again a new variable is being created
and the value has been assigned so here
if you look at C basically it's a
logical type and 48 bytes have been
allocated for it okay so please go ahead
and try these things again I know it's a
very small thing but again it's quite
important to understand what is
available and how to work around with
variables when you're working in are
okay now one key thing with respect to
our value in comparison to other
programming languages is that you do
need to actually define a datatype for
atomic datatypes again what exactly is
atomic data type will be seeing later
but to give you a simple understanding
your integer your numerical value your
logical value your strings so all these
do not need to have a data type define
while you're creating them again it's
quite easy and straightforward language
now this is something that you have seen
while you are working with Python if any
of you actually tried it out as well so
clearly here with respect to what is
available and how to declare a variable
in our okay that's great to see all of
you understood so now let's try to
understand various data operators that
are present in our so there are many
five types of data operators that you'll
be working around with our you have your
arithmetic operators you have your
assignment operators relational
operators logical operator and special
operator okay so we will start off by
first understanding arithmetic operator
the arithmetic operators are quite
straightforward you have an addition
subtraction multiplication now if you
look at the examples to the right here
again two plus three is giving me the
answer but plus two can also be a sign
that it's a positive two well again save
with abstraction three minus one is
giving me a result of two and minus is
actually used to denote that it's a
negative two number multiplication and
division are quite straightforward let
me show you how they work out in our
studio so here let's say I already have
a variable a so what I do is I will
create a new variable D equal to five
okay so let's say a plus D
you see the output us 30 a minus D again
at any
if you want to see the value of a
variable you can just type the variable
name and the output is correspondingly
shown okay so apart from seeing the
value here you can always check it on
your console as well now let's say A to
D this is 125 a divided by D is giving
me the answer as five and so far
basically all your arithmetic operations
can directly be performed here and then
you can go ahead and execute now apart
from these four basic arithmetic
operations
you also have specific operators where
you have an exponent operator and then
you have a specific division operator
again when you talk about exponent
operator let's say D to the power of
three okay so basically what I'm trying
to tell is five to the power of three
that's this one twenty five let's say D
to the power of eight okay so this is
the corresponding answer with respect to
that same now again the second operator
in this list is basically a modular
division what a basically does is it
divides the number but instead giving
you the quotient it actually gives you
the remainder of the division okay let's
say I am going to divide 22 pays person
percent seven okay now we all know this
is going to give us the value of pi' but
what happens if I do a modulo division
here then it is actually giving you a
remainder of one instead of the value of
pi' okay instead of bringing me the
quotient is actually giving me the
reminder and it's making the division as
terminating so the last division here is
a floor what flow division
basically does is it divides the two
numbers but the quotient that you get
that is always rounded off to the
previous value okay so I just clear my
screen we ask to you and let me just
show you so let's take the most useful
case now again let's say 22 when I am
modulo divide by self okay no we had
seen the value to be 1 ok same time but
when I say a normal division of 22 by 7
is giving me the value of pi' that is
three point one four two eight five
seven okay again this is a non
terminating but it has chosen to put
only six decimal points after the bar if
I say 20 to flow division
of seven then it is giving me a value of
three that is it has rounded off this
value to the value of three so I you
guys clear with respect to these are
thematic operators
okay so Reshma is asking me a question
what is the decimal point value is
greater than five okay that's a very
good question Reshma soo I'll show you
an example yeah let's take a random
number here let's say I am going to take
three point eight
okay three point eight flow divided by
two what's going to be the answer can
anyone tell me okay
I have multiple answers here both one
and two so let's just check this out the
answer is one because as long as it does
not reach a complete whole number it
will always be rounded off to the
previous number that is exactly what
your flow division does so does this
care your doubt Reshma okay that's great
to see
now the next operator is your assignment
operator so we've seen the assignment
operator you can always use an equal to
sign if you can you see less than
followed by - and again it can be a
double less than answer so I think we
have not seen that so let me say e equal
to 50 again same result a new value has
been entered into my environment so you
can see E is of a type numeric which is
taking again 48 bytes and the value is
50 here okay now again same process can
be followed for assignment to the right
hand as well again let's say 100 -
greater than greater than 2 the variable
s so again f has been added to my
variable list with the value of 100 okay
so these are how we work around with
assignment operators the next set of
operators are relational operators so
relational operators are some of the
most interesting operators are like
working around in our because these
actually act as a base to various
different operators that we'll be seeing
at with statements whereas operators are
dependent on these simple relational
operators and they are quite useful as
now again all your relational operations
will give you a region value as your
output okay so let me just show you an
example here let's say my F is greater
than e okay it's a simple statement here
you can see the values if I say it is
true but let's say e is greater than F
then basically it's returning
same case you can see and when you want
to compare two operators then you're
going to use a w equal to operator
so say e equal to equal to f then it
says false note they have different
values and when you want to check
whether two values are not equal to then
again it's quite straightforward
let's say D not equal to so again not is
denoted by an exclamation mark not equal
to e then it says true both D and E have
different values again if you check in
my environment list D has a value of
five at E has a value of 50 now apart
from a single operation of less than or
greater than or equal to or not equal to
you can combine the equal two with both
less than and greater than where it
becomes two Creator than or equal to and
less than or equal to now let's say D is
greater than or equal to e it's false
but let's say I'm going to take another
variable say G equal to five okay and
then I'm going to say D is greater than
or equal to G here it is giving me true
because both conditions are being
checked whether these either greater
than G or is it equal to G only when
you've tested these two conditions
whether it is greater than no it's false
and whether it is equal to no it's false
only in that case will you get an answer
to be false but if either of the
conditions are found to be true then the
answer comes back astral so are you guys
clear with respect to the first three
kinds of operators that is our thematic
assignment and relational
okay so moving forward let's talk about
the next type of operators that are
logical operators so with respect to
logical operators there are mainly three
types of operators you have your and
operator here then you have your or
operator and not operator so with
respect to your and operator let me just
show you how it works out okay so here
what happens is
I'm going to assign two new variables
let's say X is equal to true and my y
equal to false
okay so let's say x + y
so let's say x and y okay so the value
of one is true the other is false but it
is giving me an output to be false but
at the same time let's say X and X is
giving me a value of true so your and
operator gives you true only and only if
the value of both your operands that is
your left operand here and your right
operand here their value is true unless
and until both these values are true you
do not get the output to be true now
again let's say Y and X so this is false
and true okay is giving you false and
let's say Y and y
is giving me false so here you can see
the only case where I'm getting through
is when both my left open and my right
operand is having a value of true now
keep this in mind this is something that
is going to be very important by working
this conditional statement so make sure
you're quite clear with respect to how a
and logical and works okay but similarly
when you look at the next operator that
is our operator this is quite
interesting now again you're our
operator let's take X again here and
your R is again denoted by a PI symbol
like your hand was denoted by an
ampersand let's say x and y again this
is the first condition that we had
checked okay now here what we're
checking is X or Y when I pass it it
gives me the value of true your or
operator is opposite your and operator
what it basically does is if any one of
the two operands is having the value of
true then it returns your output to be
true earlier what we had seen with
respect to the and operator was only if
both the values are true we will get an
output to be true but with respect to an
or operator as long as at least one of
them is true then the value set to be
true now again let's say you've seen X
or Y let's say Y or X okay this is false
and true is giving me true let's say Y
or Y
then it is giving me fault so again
since I have both my options to be false
it's giving me the value to be false now
the final logical operator is the not
operator basically it converts the
present value to the opposite one now as
you know my Y has a value of false now
what I'll do is to that Y I'll add a not
okay
not Y and I pass it it gives me the
value of but again when you check the
value of Y it is false so you're not
negates the current version that is if
it is true it becomes fall and if it is
false it becomes true so are you guys
clear with respect to the logical
operators it's quite important that you
understand them well
so all of you seem to be clear on this
so let's move forward to the final
operator that are special operators in
our okay now the first is the range
operator so your range helps you
identify that a store occur sequence of
numbers within a specific range now you
need to specify the first number and the
last number between on the left hand and
the right hand of the cool this tells
that all the values present in this
strange have to be stored in a variable
now again let's say I'm going to create
a new variable say H that is going to
store a range from 1 to 10 so 1 colon 10
and if you look at H value here okay
it's having an integer value with
storing the values from 1 to 10 again if
you want to check the value you can also
print it on your console just type the
variable name and you can see the values
here okay the next special operator
basically is an inn operator it checks
if a specific element is present in that
value so this is something that you will
definitely be using in a range of values
now let's say I want to check if a
variable let's say is 6 is present okay
in my H variable so what it does is
you're checking if a value 6 is present
inside your variable and it is giving me
a boolean value whether it's true or not
now let's say I'm going to check a value
15
in haste now we know that head is you a
variable they are storing the numbers
from 1 to 10 so this should give me a
value of false
so you guys clear so we've come to the
end of the various operators in our so
any doubts with respect to this any of
the operators that you are not clear
that you want me to repeat
okay so I see everyone is cute that's
great to see I mean I am as an
instructor I'm quite happy where all of
you are following so again remember at
any point you're not clear with anything
make sure you put it across in chat box
so let's move forward to talk about the
various data types that are present in
are now talking about the various data
types in our there are mainly six data
types present in half you have vectors
you have list you have matrices arrays
factors and data frames now vector in
itself have six atomic data types but
not going into that right now one thing
you may have noticed is that at any
point when you need a variable you can
go ahead and declare it as part of your
code so this becomes quite easy for you
you don't need to declare it first
itself or let's say while you're working
on your code suddenly you realize a new
variable has to be created you don't
need to go to the start and then declare
it so at any point if you need a new
variable to be created you can create it
right and we followed that same process
here as well so let's be driving to each
of these data types we'll start off by
understanding with vectors okay now
vectors basically is a sequence of data
elements that are of the basic data type
okay now if you look at the example here
what am I doing this
I am storing numerical values into my
vector again the assignment with respect
to the vector can vary with usage of the
assignment operator but vector in itself
can be classified into five different
atomic types or they better known as the
five classes of fact these are your
character complex integer numerical and
logical one now in your logical value
you basically have your true and false
in numerical it can be a numerical value
and integer can have an integer value
okay you can also work around with
complex number where there is a deal and
an imaginary part and you can also work
around with characters characters could
be a single character it could be a word
or even a sequence of words or a
sentence as well so your character
variable would take a corresponding size
and are always takes care of the memory
management so you don't have to worry
with respect to that now let me just
give you an example for each one of them
let's go back to our our studio now here
let's say if you want to clear the
variables in your memory all you need to
do is click on this operator and
automatically
the object in your environment will be
clear okay same for curing your console
just press ctrl L and your console is
also pure now with respect to your
logical variable let's say a okay equal
to you have both true and false
so again true has to be returned in
capital because this is a reserved
keyword and when you write true you can
see corresponding value has been set
same can be with respect to B this is
going to store false value again these
are reserved keywords that have a
certain definition already present in R
so they you would get a correctly
prompted response so a and B a true or
false
now with respect to numerical values
let's say C is going to store five okay
and I'm going to create another variable
which is going to store an integer Y so
D is equal to five and today note that
it's an integer you need to add a
corresponding el associated with it this
basically tells us that this is an
integer value now here when you look at
your environment see basically is a
numerical value which is storing 48
bytes but when you come down to D you
can see it is of an integer type that is
using 48 bytes for this memory location
so gayatri is asking me how is integer
different from new mac that's a very
good question guys
okay now if you talk about integers they
are actually used to store whole loans
you cannot store a decimal pointed value
or a fractional number inside an integer
but in your numeric you can store
decimal values in the float class as
well as whole numbers so basically your
numeric could be the whole set where
your interior is basically a subset of
your numeric does that answer your
question guy three again if it's not
here let's say e equal to eight point
five L again when I try to do this it
gives me a warning that integer literal
eight point five contains decimal use
numeric value okay
but when you see a new value has been
created in my memory and if I go there
you can see it is off type numeric and
not integer so does this answer question
guy three okay
now apart from this let's say I have F
which is going to store certain
character value let's say
is fun
and there you have it
so any doubts with respect to the data
types that we have discussed till here
the five basic atomic data types again
here one thing you need to remember is
while you're working with these atomic
classes you don't need to specify the
data type for them for the variable that
is okay automatically our text the value
and decides and assigns video a type for
these schedules okay so it basically
reduces your effort by half all you need
to do is decide a variable name and then
fix the value for the corresponding
variables okay so any doubts now let's
take in your empty workspace now as we
had mentioned earlier a vector basically
is a collection of different data types
so let's take a vector VTR and to that
let me just store a sequence of numbers
now again we had done this earlier as
well when we had seen these special
operators but again lipstick same case
here let's say I'm going to store one I
have three
then I have 5 there's 11:45 2367 55 and
finally I have 41 so these are the
numbers that I'm going to store inside
my vector okay so you can see here there
is a missing comma between 67 and 55 so
again it makes a big difference when
you're specifying different values
because it becomes hard for our to
identify the different values okay so
now you can see a new vector has been
created I have nine elements starting
from one it goes all the way till 40 so
this is a simple collection of vectors
of numeric type and nine values are
stored here similarly you can have
another vector one that is used to store
different characters
I'll say hi another hello again
characters need to be in quotes okay
these can be single quotes or double
quotes but always make sure you put it
across cut and I will put an away
so here you can see these have been
added correspondingly to the new vector
so even if you have a single element or
if the collection of elements it's
always a vector
are you clear with this
okay so some operations that you can
perform using vectors are basically
indexing replacing sorting so let me
show you these operations as well
now again so this is a vector of
different numerical values so to sort it
let's say I'm going to create a new
vector say sort and to that okay sort is
basically a keyword so I'm going to say
sorted VTR okay to this I am going to
Fort my vector and then store it so sort
is an inbuilt function you can call it
and you can pass the datatype here so
vector
is what I'm going to pass and then if
you print sorted vector
then you can see the complete list has
been sorted and is getting printed here
so any doubts with respect to the sims 2
this is something that you can perform
for any digital if you pass a character
data type then what happens is basically
sorts based on alphabetical order so
here let's say VTR 1 if I print again so
you can see it's rearranged everything
in an alphabetical order so as long as
it's a vector you can perform the sort
operation apart from that let me just
take the vector VTR and here if you want
to access any specific elements in that
case just use a square bracket and you
can specify which element you want so
let's say the second element then plus 2
so if you see the complete vector the
second element is 3 but let's say you
want a range of values then what you can
use 2 : I want the values from 2nd
position till 6th position then you just
need to specify the start point and end
point of that range and all the values
gets printed with respect to let's say
including the range values that is
number two three four five and six okay
so who can tell me what will happen if I
give minus one here okay so all of you
are telling me the last element will get
printed okay let's see what happens can
anyone tell me what happened here yes
when you save minus of an index it
basically means excluding that index
element print everything else all right
okay great
let's see if you want to replace a
specific element in your vector list so
let's say I want to replace the third
element in my vector that is five with
let's say 50 it's a quite
straightforward process you just need to
specify the index followed by the new
value and if you print the vector now so
now if you just print vector VTR you can
see the updated value where I had five
originally it's getting replaced by 50
so this is basically replacement of a
specific value are you guys clear with
this okay so one last trick question
what happens if I say replace it by 11
so I have nine positions here if I'm
going to put 15 in my leavens position
what will happen okay so some of you are
telling it will not get added some are
telling it you get added to the tenth
position let's see what happens do you
think this command will execute
successfully okay I find a lot of PS and
all so let's try that first okay it's
got successfully executed now let me
just see what my vector looks like after
inserting to the levant position so you
can see here it has been inserted into
the 11th position leaving a blank at the
tenth position that's the reason you're
getting not applicable n/a here okay so
if you are adding a value to the index
beyond the range with respect to some
gap now I had nine I'm leaving a gap I'm
putting level then all the values
between that range becomes not
applicable but your value will get
inserted into that position so with this
we have come to a conclusion with
respect to vectors are you guys clear
and out still here
any doubts with respect to vectors
okay so with that we've actually come to
an end tailing this vector so let's move
forward and talk about you
now Lister basically are objects that
contain elements of different data types
now okay so you can have strings you can
have integers numerical values boolean
values all that in a single element so
that's how it is slightly different with
respect to vectors it's the same thing
but it is just different with respect to
what kind of data types that you can
still in vectors we had seen that you
can only store one kind of data types
but enlist you can store different data
tags let me just show you how to do that
okay
so before that let me just show you how
vector converts your data if it's of
different data types so let's say vector
2 is going to store
hi then it's going to store a numerical
value of 15 I give an integer value of
21 and finally I'll add and true as well
so with this I'm going to save it and it
saves it but what data type is it
storing now to find that let's say class
off classes a function that helps you
identify which class each variable
belongs to okay so vector 2 is variable
which I had store different kinds of
data types in and if I say enter it
tells me it belongs to character class
what does this mean it basically means
that all the values in vector 2 have
been converted as characters so you can
see every value hi 15:21
and true are in quotes that means each
one of these are characters you can also
verify that in your variable environment
so you can see this vector basically of
a character type and every value is
being stored as a character okay so same
time let me create a new list that's
going to store different kinds of values
so let's say list 1 and here you need to
specify the type list off ok let's say
hey is going that
a large falls as well
I'll add 54 and 35 as integer now if you
say this there is no error here but
let's see what is present in list 1
whether they're being converted to
character or not
so you can see here each of them are
being stored as their original data type
list
hay is being stored as character falls
status falls 54 is 54 and 35 is set as
35 so here each of them retain their
original data type but whereas in
vectors they get converted to character
data types
so are you guys clear with this right so
you can perform the same set of
operations that you had performed with
vectors as well but one thing that
differs is let's say I'm going to create
a sorted list for my list
so here I am going to say list one and
who can tell me what is going to be the
output of this
tell me whether this command we get
executed or not okay let us go ahead and
try it it says it cannot
because again what happens is since you
have different data types present here
it becomes hard for our to identify on
what parameter it needs to sort out this
data okay let me just clear this
workspace so apart from the operations
that we had seen earlier with vectors
these are some of these specific
operators here as well so let's say you
want to merge to this now these two
lists can be of any type so I have this
one let me create list two
that is going to have a combination of
both
factors and numerical values I will say
hello I'll add new
put an R as well and add 45 and 28 so
this is a list that contains both
character and numerical value now let's
say I want to create a new list that is
most of my list one and list so before
that let me show you a list one this is
what my list 1 looks like and this is
how my list - looks like so I want to
merge these two data so for that what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
new list 3 again in which I'm going to
merge this now to do that you need to
use this function merge and here you can
pass list 1
common list
and you can see if you print list 3 then
you can find a merge list with respect
to both of them ok so here you can see
all the elements of that list have been
merged to a single element so you can
see hey falls 54:35 from my first list
and then hello Neil our 45 and 28 from
my second list so these two have been
merged to a single list so any doubts
with respect to merging lists okay now
apart from this another way that you can
combine these two is basically using
them with respect when they're declared
itself so let it four is equal to a
combination of both my list one and list
two
okay now if I print list four can see
the elements present here but let's say
I just want certain elements from my
list for then what I can do is I can use
an indexing parameter here now if I say
five here basically extract hello
so one two three four five here so this
is basically extracting a element from a
list so I hope you guys are clear with
lists so let's move forward to the next
data type that is arrays
so now after vectors comes list now with
respect to list they're basically
similar to your vectors but the only key
difference being with respect to vectors
is that they can store elements that
belong to different datatypes itself so
let me go ahead and show you on our
studio itself so I will begin by
creating two vectors that have called
list 1 okay which is going to store
numerical values 2 3 1 5 7 13 and 15
okay mate c'mon sorry about that okay so
I'll go ahead and create another list
say call it place - okay and this is
going to have character elements present
in it so let's say I given colors red
blue and green okay so these are the
elements of my list now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create something
known as list 3 which is going to store
both of these now these are basically
vectors okay so if I directly write this
3 equal to C of list 1 common list 2
then what happens is it gets created but
when I print list 3 ok all the elements
of my list are considered to be
characters because again here it's just
a vector that's being called list to
convert this to an actual list what you
can do is here you need to first change
it and will be name it as list four and
you need to specify this is of a type
list now when you do that automatically
are understands that used 4 is going to
be of type list and then if you create
this
let's try printing list 4
so here you can see both the lists one
is completely retaining its numerical
elements and two is completely having
characters they are not being converted
completely as we had seen with vectors
similarly if you create list five which
has a combination of all these elements
let's say list and here we're going to
add 35 49 L then I'll put in true
and I'll add Neil okay so I am taking
four atomic data types and I am creating
list file when I print list five you can
see here each one is actually retaining
its original data type and we are not
getting converted to character as we had
seen with vector so list can help your
objects retain their original data types
so I you guys care with this and the
difference between lists and vectors
okay now apart from the operations that
you had seen earlier there are certain
operations that we have already seen now
again you can merge two lists as well as
you can perform slicing okay apart from
that you can standardly perform your
indexing as well as slicing so that's
something that you can definitely try
out now coming to the next data type is
arrays now basically the purpose of
arrays in R is to store your data in
more than two dimensions okay to store
it in two dimensions you have matrices
but we will talk about that in the next
part but basically you need what you
need to understand is that array has you
store data in more than two dimensions
and it usually takes vectors as input
parameters okay now what I do is let me
just clear all this so talking about
arrays basically I'm going to create two
vectors here vector one which basically
is going to have five numerical values
so here I am going to have values - then
I have six allowed 14
so basically certain random numbers
itself then 22 so five values present in
my first vector okay I am going to
create vector two
in which let's say I have five I have 15
25 45 65 85 1:05 and 125 so basically I
have two vectors present here one has
five elements the other has eight
elements against now to create an array
what I can do is I can say a our image
is called Maya arr
then following that I need to specify
the array type so basically this is my
array type and then I need to provide it
an input so let's see of vector one so
now what I will do is now I've just
created a single dimensional array let
me just show you the how the array looks
like so if I just print a ara so this is
how my single dimensional array looks
like now the purpose of array is to
create it as multi dimension so let me
just show you how it's done now what I
am going to do is I am going to make a
multi-dimensional array here so I'll
just call it array two and interrupt
just passing vector one
I'll pass vector two as well now apart
from this I'm going to specify the
dimension how it has to be so one
slightly change the dimension here so to
do that just use time to get time
basically supposed to set the length and
here I will pass a vector which tells
how the dimension should be I'm going to
have five elements my first row five
elements my second and three elements in
my third so this is basically how I am
going to define once I have done this
and if I print arr - so you can see how
my matrix looks like so if you see the
values here it may look slightly jumbled
so let me just help you understand this
better now I have taken first five
values from vector one and then I've
stored it in my first column so if you
see that vivianne stored correctly then
what happens this in my second column I
am taking continious values so 5 15 25
45 and 65 have been stored so that is my
limit the value is following that we'll
start from the next column
so again 85 105 and what verify I'm at
end here but again since I have to store
the values continuously again you are
starting from 2 6 14 1822 and again you
start it from that nexus since there are
three copies being created the order
continues there
salsa 100-105 you starting with 125 in
the next one so I hope you guys are
clear with respect to how our data is
being stored in an array in our so any
doubts with respect to arrays or less
okay it's great to see that you guys are
following now apart from RS comes your
matrices now medicines are quite similar
to your eraser but only difference with
respect to your matrix to erase is that
it's not a multi-dimensional it is just
two-dimensional rectangle we had created
and combination of a matrix of 5 cross 5
and we have created three of them in a
single eye now if you go back to that
let me show you another feature there
now here let's say I'm going to add
another value let's say 2
and I'll call it array three and if I
print array 3 then you can see it is
storing it into a multi-dimensional form
so I have a matrix here which is again
in turn getting stored inside another
matrix so you can see these are the
first three rows for the first column
these are the next three rows for the
second column okay so it's a combination
of multi-dimensional elements here but
when you talk about a matrix it
basically is used to store elements into
a two dimensional format it's quite
simple and is more of the basic
fundamental here okay so let me just
clear all this and clear the variables
as well now the syntax for creating a
matrix quite straightforward you specify
the keyword matrix followed by the data
that you need to pass it could be
multiple vectors together and then you
specify the number of rows number of
columns by row basically is a logic by
which your row elements have to be
arranged but for now don't worry about
that and dimension names so let's go
back to our our studio and try it out
I'm going to create two vectors again
vector let me just take the previous
state so I'm going to take the same
vector and I'm going to modify the
spectrum
okay so basically I'm creating two
vectors vector 1 and vector 2 having
different values both have five elements
presented now let me create a matrix MTR
of the type matrix again so when you
type matrix okay now again that is the
highlighted here it helps you understand
what should be the syntax for this
function so as for the first part but if
the data I'm going to say vector 1 comma
my vector 2 and then I need to specify
the dimensions now I can either make it
a 5 cross 2 or a 2 cross 5 element now
again the filling of the element starts
column wise so always the data will be
filled down so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make it a 5 cross 5 so
number of rows is 5 number of columns is
5
ok and when I hit enter a new matrix is
created but to see the data elements in
the matrix type MTR and you can see the
elements so here if you see first vector
is getting inserted into the first
column completely the second column is
getting completely filled with the
second vector third column with the
first vector of four columns second
vector and first column with the third
vector so always the data filling
happens in the column wise sequence so
in adults with respect to actors against
the regime has asked me what happens if
I give different dimension okay
definitely let me just show you that as
well rich now let's make it empty r1
okay and here what I'll do is I'll
change it to let's say 8 cross 5 or let
me just make it 8 cross 6 okay okay
the problem with this when I try with
this is that it goes beyond the ridge
now I'll just change it to 3 cross 4
again that case it does not get created
so not all values come into the picture
because it's not a sub multiple but
let's say I'm going to make it 10 comma
15 then it gets created because it's a
complete multiple okay so I'll just
print my matrix 1 so you can see here at
n cross 15 matrix being created okay so
it needs to be a multiple with respect
to the original number of values present
in that matrix is that clear Reshma what
you need to do is if you are creating a
different dimension from the vectors
that you have then make sure your number
of rows and columns are a multiple or a
sub multiple of the number of elements
present in that vector is that clear
rational
okay so moving forward let's talk about
the second last data type of today that
is factors now factors basically are
something that are used to categorize
the data into levels okay now here you
can use it to categorize both strings
and characters and apart from that this
is something that you will extensively
be using when you're working with
different statistical models now it's
quite straightforward let me go back
here it's clear everything here and from
here okay so let's begin by first
creating a new vector so I'll just say
VT one
let's put me very loose let's say 3
comma 5 comma 7 comma 11 comma 5 15 11
again 23 okay once you hit it a new
vector is getting created
now what I am going to do is now I am
going to create a factor out of this
vector
for that it's quite straightforward I'm
going to create a new fact available
fact VTR ok on this I'm going to convert
factor and I'm going to pass the
parameter of vector once I have created
this a new factor is created ok so to
see what is the value inside factor in
this print available so you can see here
the different values that are present
here but their unique values are denoted
by the levels so this is something that
will definitely come into use while
you're working with statistical modeling
so there may be situations where you'd
be seeing different values but to
understand the unique values you can
always convert those values into factors
and check their corresponding levels so
the quite straightforward process
so let's say you're working with a data
that has different probabilities to
understand the unique probabilities you
can always take that data and convert it
to factors then you can identify the
levels to identify what are the various
possible probabilities that are present
in that data again so are you guys here
with factors
all right that's great to hear so moving
forward let's talk about data frames so
data frames is something quite
interesting that you'll be working with
arts and is one of the most widely used
data types after vectors in our
okay now with respect to what exactly is
the data frame it could be a table or it
could even be a two-dimensional array
like structure okay the inner data frame
each column actually contains a value
from one variable and II through
actually contains from one set of values
from each of the columns now rather than
explaining this let me just go ahead and
show you how it works out okay what I'm
going to create this I will create a new
vector let's say ID and this is going to
store a range value from let's say 100
to 150 or let's say I'll just take a
smaller number let's say hundred inside
so five numbers are going to be inserted
into ID apart from that I'll say name
okay name is going to have let it have
my name okay so I'll add an Eric's name
as well
then we have Dave as well okay Dave I
hope you don't mind you guys okay not at
all then let me now Rashmi as one and
let me bring in Pankaj okay so these are
the five minutes now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a data frame
that combines these two vectors now how
do I do that let's say I'm going to call
it class STD okay that means it's just a
single name okay now this is going to
take a data frame data rod frame and
here I need to pass the values so ID
comma name once I do this it gets
created and let's see the bit okay so
this is problem because there is a
difference with respect to the number of
elements between both now here if you
see ID has six elements whereas name has
released five element so in that case
what I do is I just go back to my name I
just clear all goes well thing name of
six is equal to pressure
okay so
now I have six elements now if I try to
save it gets created and if I print this
let's see how the output looks like so
here you can see they are getting linked
together each ID is getting a
corresponding value from the name okay
now similarly let's say you have another
field let's say Marx okay please don't
mind this and
he'll say 80 85 87 95 92 and 89 again
six valence now I'm going to create
another new data frame STD 1 and here
similarly I'll pass the third vector
that is marks
now if I print the class STD one data
frame then you can see corresponding
each row has a value from each of the
vectors that is one element is getting
picked from each of the vectors and
correspondingly they are being linked
and put in a row so any doubts with
respect to how a data frame looks like
and how a data frame works so a data
frame is something that you can
definitely use while you're working with
different tables so let's say your take
extracting a table from a CSV file or an
excel file in those situations your data
frame will be something that will
definitely come into hand okay so for
now don't worry too much about it will
be extensively talking about importing
and working with different data sets in
the next session
but I hope you guys are clear with
respect to the different data types okay
so I've got a confirmation from Eric
Shubham Reshma Pankaj Gayathri that's
great to see Adam okay that's nicely
that all of your for me so with this we
come to a conclusion of data types so
I'm quite sure some of you are familiar
with programming language and in
programming language there is a very
important concept known as flow control
state now what these control statements
actually do is they divert and control
the flow of every program and then the
sequence of execution of these programs
so in today's session we will be
discussing across eight of these
different flow control statements you
have if you have P files switch repeat
for while break and continue now if
if-else and switch are your selector
statements whereas your repeat for while
are your loop statements break and
continue our jump statements because
they help you jump from the sequence of
the operation okay so we will start off
by talking about the selector statements
now talking about selector statements
they have just a simple aim that is
please choose certain set of operation
after evaluating a condition so that you
don't have to bother to be exact detail
now there are mainly three select the
statements you have if if-else and
switch if actually evaluates just a
single condition and besides and what
has to be done in case the condition is
true if it's false it just ignores it
now if else is a group of statements
that can help you check multiple
conditions it's similar to begin but it
helps you achieve a bigger
which basically helps you check the
different possibilities which are
already known to you that is if a
certain variable can take a specific
value then you can go with switch so the
first topic that we'll be discussing is
the if statement now if statement is
quite straightforward
it just has a single key word is
followed by the condition and then a
certain set of statement that needs to
get executed in case it is true now if
you look at the image to the right this
is basically the flow of if control so
you start off your code you check the if
condition if it is true the conditional
code or the statement returned inside
the if we get executed if it is false
the statement gets ignored and you will
move forward now before we go ahead and
look at an example of it I'd like to
discuss about if-else as well because
these two statements are completely
related now you can use if and if-else
or an else if ladder that will help you
achieve the following order so what you
lose you first check the code if it is
true that means the first if code gets
executed if it is false then it goes on
to check the else's condition and if it
is found through the else will get
execute finally even is the else if code
is found to be false then you go ahead
finally to the else code and it gets
executed that is in case if none of
these conditions are true then you
execute the else statement but you can
have a multiple chain with respect to s
else you can have any number of if-else
conditions that you want but it
suggested that you do not write too many
because it comes contribution for the
user aspect now to see the practical
example of the first statement let's go
back to our our studio so let's begin by
creating a new script file in which
we'll write our code and directly
execute it rather than writing it on a
console so first let me begin by
creating a new variable called X and
this is going to have a value of five
now comes my if statement if X greater
than three
then print
X this greater than three now to rather
this is click on the source option here
and directly it will convert it and
execute it on the code so you can see X
is greater than three but let's say I'm
changing this value to five
and then I'm rerunning this code but
there is no output here can you see that
here there is no output here because the
statement written inside the it does not
get executed now in such cases what you
can do is you can write an else
condition where the if condition ends is
print X is not greater than five okay
now you can run it and you can see
printing X is not greater than five but
let's say you want to add another
condition here then what you can do is
you can write an else's
X is equal to five
then print exes
equal to five
okay let's run this and see sorry double
equals two always remember that for
comparison it's all doubly good
can see it's printing X is equal to five
so any doubt still here how the if-else
ladder works okay so I've got a
confirmation from everyone Gayatri is
asking me is there a limitation on
difference no that's definitely you can
use a continuous nest of if as this an
else statement any number of times that
you want so it's all up to you but again
the more you put conditions the slower
your code becomes because it needs to
check every condition with respect to
that set okay so make better decisions
when you're doing that all right now the
third kind of flow control statement is
the switch case T so switch case is
basically used to compare a certain
expression to of known values so this
your all the other what value that
variable can take and based on that what
has to be done so let me go back to my
ass video and clear all this for in case
of switch let's take a new vector here
let's say we TR is my new vector and to
this I'm going to add certain bearings
see if let's say 150 200 250 300 350
and finally 400 now what I need is I'm
going to write a new variable that says
option now option basically is going to
be the expression to the evaluate now in
this case I am just assuming it to be
equal in to me and then I need to
further identify a mean of this
operation but in general cases it can
take any values and that's exactly why
we take switch case so here if I write
switch
need to specify first the expression so
my expression is with respect to option
after that put a comma then it can take
it can be mean which is equal to now to
compute mean you already have an inbuilt
function so which you need just need to
pass the parameter so in this case it's
my weight now to move to the next case
this put a comma
let's same mode
and mode has a simple function
and finally the three media
now all these results have to be printed
so add a print before it
you
and then you can directly close the
switch case statement so with this we
have completed the switch case and let
me just print from this code and you can
see here to satisfy is the mean of this
vector which has different values
ranging from 150 to 400 so from this
range value the mean is found out we
want to certify and if I say median
then the median is also calculated so I
hope you guys are clear with respect to
switch case statement and how they work
in your abs okay how do you write
defaults here
okay default statement is quite
interesting here just put a comma and
then you can write
and this change it to Emmie and then if
you try to run this the default case is
considered so as long as you don't
specify the case and the last option is
considered to be a default Street
this is clear
okay that's good so with this we
actually come to a confusion of our flow
control statements the next kind of
statements that we will be talking are
loops now what do loops to Luc's
basically help you repeat a certain set
of actions so that you don't have to
perform them repeatedly now the main
objective of a loop is quite simple it
basically has to repeat a certain set of
actions n number of times so that you
don't have to manually write it now
imagine I need to perform an operation
ten pipes so if I start writing the code
for it ten times then what happens is
the code length increases and it becomes
a problem also for B user to understand
but at the same time by using the loop
if I write the statement I want to
execute ten times inside the loop then
it saves me the code length as well as
it makes easier for code readability it
also optimizes with respect to code
efficiency
now repeat statement and while statement
helps you execute a certain set of codes
until the condition is true but for this
is a kind of loop statement that you use
when you know how many times you need to
repeat that statement now let's say you
want to repeat a set of statements ten
maps then you go with the form but let's
say you are not quite sure on how many
times you want to repeat it then you go
with the repeat or while so let's move
forward and start talking with respect
to the repeat statement now this is the
basic syntax of the repeat loop
so first you start and then you execute
your code once you've executed it you
check if the condition is true and if
it's true you go back and execute the
block until the condition is meant to be
false once it's found out to be false
then you break from the loop and you
exit so this is the general syntax you
have a repeat keyword then you have the
commands that need to be executed once
the command has been executed you need
to write a condition based on which the
loop you statement will exit on so let
me show you how it's done so let me
scare all this
so let's say repeat
now here let's say before the suggest
declare a variable say X is equal to one
and I'll say X is equal to
x-squared
now I'm going to write if I change value
of extra 2 if X is greater than 100 then
break before this Alice print X so that
you can follow it
then it's time we execute this code
so you just run this and you can see the
value of X first three twos four then it
becomes sixteen and then once it becomes
256 we realize it's greater than 100 so
we break from that loop again if I add
another zero and grade on this then you
can see from 256 it's again getting
squared and it's getting and the number
is becoming six five five three six
which is greater than thousand and
you're breaking from that loop so
basically in situations where you are
not quite aware of how the value is
changing but you know at one point where
it has to stop then you use the repeat
you similarly a while loop is also quite
same as you go back to your presentation
my loop actually starts by checking the
condition and then it executes the code
block okay and once is computed
execution of the code block then it goes
that and checks the condition as long as
the condition is found to be true they
will keep executing the code block but
the moment the value is found to be
false then you exit from that room so
let us go back here and I'll modify the
same code for while so here what I'll do
is I'll change it to while
I'll bring in this condition
and I will remove the condition from
here
so how your repeat and while loop
changes earlier with respect to your
repeat you had actually changed this
condition to be greater than thousand
but in case of while loop you're
basically going to change it to less
than thousand that is if the value of x
is less than thousand then only enter
that loop okay now if you rerun this
code then you can see the output present
here which was same as our repeating but
the major difference here is change with
respect to the condition now your while
loop basically defined when you're going
to enter the loop where you're say
repeat loop defined when you're going to
exit from that look so these two
statements are better known as entry
control loop and exit control your
repeat loop is something that defines
when you leave from that loop after
you've completed execution of the
statement but as your Y basically
controls when you're going to enter into
that loop to execute the state okay
that's how your repeat and while loop
are different so I hope you guys are
clear with respect to both these loops
okay reshma Celsius so to Sky 3 Adam
that's great to see
okay so the last kind of loop that we'll
be discussing is a for statement now
your for loop is quite straightforward
okay
when you know how many times the loop
has to be executed then you can directly
go ahead and execute
so let's say I'm going to define a new
vector v TR now in my vector what I am
going to do is I am going to add five
elements seven nineteen twenty five
65/45 okay now I want to print them one
by one instead of individually printing
all of them at one go so in that case
what I do cell use a four I in my vector
VTR okay so for every value in my vector
VTR I am going to print that value so
basically you just need to write print
off
hi
if you run this you can see all the
values are individually being printed
here okay but if you just directly print
with here you can see the difference
between both so when one is printing
each value in new line when you print
the whole vector all the numerical
values are present in the same line and
are considered to be one entity as part
of the whole witness but here you can
access each of the values one by one so
I hope you guys are clear with respect
to how to work with the for loop okay so
you follow up with something that you'll
definitely be using while you're working
with matrices as well as arrays and some
amount to data frames as well okay so
keep this in mind because this is an
important cause now comes your break
again so you've seen break how break
statement works why we had seen our
repeat loop but none of you actually put
a cross question what a break statement
was so a break statement basically helps
you come out from the loop whenever it
is being caught now if you look at the
image here first what you do is you
check the loop condition if the loop
condition is found to be false then you
exit from that way after that you come
in and you check if the break condition
is true that is inside a condition when
you have written break that condition is
it true or not if it is true then it
will encounter a break and it'll exit
from that loop but if it is not true
then what happens is the code written
after break get executed and then you go
back and repeat the for loop once again
so after your break comes the next
statement your next statement is quite
similar to the continue statement that
you have seen in other programming
languages now what actually happens is
your next slightly opposite your break
statement here instead of leaving from
that loop what happens is if you
encounter the next statement every code
that is written after that does not get
executed and you go to the next
iteration okay so if you look at the
flow diagram here you check first the
loop condition and then let's say you
have certain codes written before the
next condition then you check if the
next condition is found to be true or
false
if it is false then you will execute the
remaining code written in that block and
then you will go to the next iteration
but let's say if the condition is found
to be true then you do not execute the
code written below and then you iterate
to the next okay now it may seem
slightly confusing so let me go back to
my a so do
and show you how it works so here what I
will be doing is I'll say for
I in let's say I'm going to give a
specific train so 1 to 15 now in this
range I don't want to print even numbers
so for that if I modulo 2 that is when I
divide I by 2 the remainder is equal to
0
then color next if not current I okay so
let's try executing this code
so just run this and you can see only
odd numbers are being printed and even
numbers are not getting printed so
basically every time this statement is
found to be true the next key word is
being encountered and then the print
command is not executed so it goes to
the next iteration without checking the
code written after this so I hope you
guys are clear with respect to these
flow control statements okay that's
great to see I have got a confirmation
from Reshma Gayathri roshni Adam szubin
Pankaj that's great
till here we've seen the analytical
aspect of our so now let's move forward
and look at the visualization aspect of
our
so with respective visualization aspect
in our you can create these six
different kinds of plots using a data
that you have now I'll be showing you an
example of how to create each one of
these plots one-by-one so we begin by
first talking about pie charts now again
when you talk about pie charts pie
charts are best used to compare
different parts of your code so again
let's say you have different branches to
identify which branch is getting your
most sale it would make more sense to
plot a pie chart with respect to all the
branches of details ok so create a pie
chart it's quite easy let's go back to
an ass video and I will show you how to
do that so I'll just clear all this now
to clear the memory here as well
vector VTR in which I'm going to have
percentage of my five departments okay
Sophie let's say one department is
contributing to 14 percentage of my
sales the other is contributing with
respect to 28 percentage then there is a
department that contributes 11
percentage and then there is one which
contributes to 30 percentage of mine and
finally I have another one which
contributes 70 percentage okay so these
are the different percentages with
respect to each department but to
understand better which department is
contributing to each value I'm going to
create a new vector as well that's
called names so here I just give some of
the departments I'll say R&amp;amp;D
then let's say I have marketing
I have corporate
and their sales
and finally I have support
okay
these two values I just show you how to
plot a very simple pie chart now if I
just say PI of VT R comma name so you
just need to run this code and you can
see the plot has been provided to your
left so here you can see the
contribution of the different
departments you have marketing you have
corporate sales support and R&amp;amp;D and a
pie chart has been created from the
corresponding values that you have taken
from pect so this color seems a bit dull
for me so I'm going to say vol equal to
rainbow so rainbow basically gives me
different values now how many different
values do I need I need length of vector
that means with respect to the total
number of values present in vector
please give me different colors now if I
run the same code again so you can see
the change with respect to the colors so
this looks a little bit more better
so this is not the end of capabilities
with respect to HR there is a lot more
that you can play around but this is
just give you a simple idea that you can
plot a pie chart like this it's
basically with respect to three simple
steps that you are writing in are okay
now apart from this the next type of
graph that we'll be looking at is bar
chart now your bars are basically used
to compare things between two different
groups of track the progress of certain
things with respect to different times
as well so let me show you how simple it
is to plot a bar chart as well
now for a bath not I just modify the
same content I'll just remove this line
and say barplot and I'll just pass VTR
so this is all the value that I need for
plotting a simple bar chart and if you
run this you can see a bar chart with
respect to the different values present
here so you can always zoom and see a
complete bar chart apart from that let's
say if you won't even export this image
then you have the option to say that
through our okay so this is how you plot
a simple bar chart now apart from bar
chart you can also plot a box plot again
when you talk about box plot this is
mainly used to summarize the data from
multiple sources and display the result
basically in a single graph so again
when you summarize the data from
different class it becomes a problem for
you to use any other representation to
understand better the difference or the
change as well so a box plot definitely
helps you achieve that so let's modify
the same code to create a box plot okay
so for bar plot what we will do is we
will be using a standard input data set
that is present in house library that is
empty casts so to see the data set let's
say empty cars is there so if you just
print this you can see the complete list
of empty cars now here what I am going
to just take is I'm going to take the
name I'm just going to say the maximum
power with respect to the cylinder and
then I'm going to create a bar plot with
respect to that's it now this is a
simple command that I have written here
that will help you achieve the same okay
so these two columns have to be selected
the data is from empty cars in your X
label it should be number of cylinders
your Y label should be miles per gallon
and your main plot should be with
respect to mileage of data if you run
this you can see the grass present here
let me just export it so you can see the
data now let's say you want to give
color here then all you have to do is
put a comma calls
call is equal to
the colors that you want to pick any
three colors okay I have red yellow
something else
okay beautiful Oh Keisha okay so these
are three colors that I want as part of
my bar plot close this and now let's try
rewrite this so you can see they've been
colored as well so if you just zoom on
this you can see the three different
colors that they have taken so again you
don't need to worry how exactly it is
working because our next session is
completely devoted to visualization in
our okay but I just wanted you to have
an idea on what more types of crafts you
can plot in our and how simple and easy
it is now the next type is histogram now
histogram is one of the most easiest
graphs that you can work with so gums
are basically used to plot frequencies
of continuous data so again this is one
of the most common kind of graphs that
you will be preparing as part of our
apart from scatter plots so definitely
this is something that will that is
quite easy as well so let me just show
you how to do that so in our studio let
me just remove all this let's say vector
one okay throw at me some random values
okay so nine eleven twenty five seventy
three four five nine okay this is my
source data and based on this I am going
to create a histogram switch so to
create a histogram with just hist and
then you just need to pass vector one
now if you run this code
can see the histogram here now it feels
a bit dull so what I'm going to do so
this close this let's say call is equal
to
bluh
again it needs to be in quotes
give a boarder let's say
Moda is
again if you just rerun this so you
histograms got a little more color with
respect to that same now although there
are certain inconsistencies but this is
because you've just taken a random date
effect again so all it requires it's
just one simple command for you to
create a histogram and it's quite easy
with respect to that see now coming back
to our presentation the next in second
last graph our line graphs now line
graphs are something that's quite
interesting you can always plot
different kinds of language it could be
a single line it could be multi line it
could be a single line it could be two
lines it could be multi lines so any
number of lines as long as you have the
correct information now let's go back
here so let's go ahead and modify the
same part itself so we'll just consider
the same vector one and I will just hit
plot this pass vector one comma the type
again type takes a value P to either
draw Li points I to draw only lines and
go to draw both points and lines so
since we want both I'm going to pass the
value of type to be oh okay now if you
just run this you can see a line graph
being plotted for the different values
that we have passed so it again quite
simple and the final kind of graph that
we'll be discussing a scatter plots
scatter plots actually tell us how one
variable is basically affected by
another variable so this could be with
respect to two different criterias
itself the change in value of one how
badly does it affect the change in value
for the other so this is something that
can definitely be understood using a
scatter plot so let's go back to our
studio
so here all you need to do is you let's
say you already have another vector so I
have vector to present here so I will
say vector 1 vector 2 and instead of
type O I'll just let it be black that is
plot a scatter plot across vector 1 and
vector 2 so these are the values present
in vector 2 and if I just run this you
can see the scatter plot that is spread
across these two values for vector 1 and
vectored how the variation makes a
difference with respect to book so again
it's quite straightforward to plot any
grass in our once you've analyzed it
it's just either a single line of
command or maybe two lines of command at
the max so the main agenda of showing it
these different kinds of graph is to let
you understand how easy it is to plot so
I hope at least you got an understanding
with respect to that set now don't worry
if you not completely understood on how
these graphs are created because as I
had mentioned our next session
extensively deals of that we started
this session by first understanding why
do we need analytics and what exactly is
data analytics from there we moved on to
understand why our and the various data
operators in our and the data types in
our finally we talked about the flow
control statements and we serve data
visualization in up so any questions
with respect to today's session any
concept that you're not clear with or
any point that you have hired out
okay since none of you have any doubts
