today you will learn to install hi when
your single node Hadoop cluster in case
you haven't set up Hadoop and peg
already please watch the previous videos
in this playlist first let's download
the hive package from the internet and
since it's free we can just download it
from Apaches website so I'm just going
to download hive from here downloaded
release now and guys you can download
this hive one point two point one
version this is about 100 MB I have
already downloaded this and let me show
you where it is present in my local file
system so the Apache a hive tar file you
see here right this is the package I
downloaded now we need to extract the
contents from this tar file and we can
just do it by run your command from the
terminal and the command is tar - x VF
and filename now that my package is
untied we need to follow three steps to
setup hive the first of them is we need
to update the environment variables in
the dot bash RC file with hives path so
second is mean to create a high of
directory in the Hadoop file system and
finally update the path of Hadoop and
hives configuration file let's get
started with updating the environment
variables in the bash RC file we have to
first go to our home directory now run
the G edit dot bash RC command and we
have to set the path of 5 here so I have
it here with me I copy it and let me
paste it here this just indicates the
path where my hive has been installed
and there's a bin folder inside my heart
directory which is here now I have to
save this and I'm going to close this
now I need to source this dot bash RC
file so that it gets synced so the
command is source dot bash RC
okay now that I've updated the
environment variables after next create
a high of directory in my how to file
system I am right now in my local file
system and to go to my HUD file system I
give this command Hadoop FS make
directory - P and the path now what this
command is going to do is it's going to
create a hive folder inside which
there's going to be a warehouse folder
in my user folder so this user is a
default folder in my hardwood file
system this Hadoop FS indicates that
this path is going to get created in my
HUD file system so let's give enter okay
now that's created we have to now update
the permissions for this directory and
to update the permissions we give the
command
Hadoop FS - chmod G + W and then the
path what this does is the path user
slash higher house in my whole file
system gets the write command G here
stands for the group so it's going to
give the right command to this group
here okay now that we've updated the
permissions for this we have to also
update the permission for the TMP file
okay on the commander's Hadoop FS -
chmod G + w / TMP
final step is we need to update the path
of Hadoop in hives configuration file we
have to first go to our home directory
and go to our hive folder in here let's
list on the contents and we have a bin
folder here ok let's go to this bin
folder and if you can see here there's a
configuration file hive - conflict dot
SH this needs to be updated with her
dogs path so for that purpose we need to
run a G edit command I've configured SH
and my path of Hadoop is here we'll copy
it and paste it right here it indicates
hive where Hadoop is installed ok now
I'm going to save this and close we can
now run hive by just typing hive from
our hive directory so I'm going to go
one path back now the command is HIV e
this will open the hive shell as you can
see we are in the hive shell which means
that we have successfully configured
hive in our Hadoop cluster thank you for
watching the video to learn how HBase is
installed in your single node Hadoop
cluster what is the next video in this
playlist do subscribe to our ed rekha
channel to learn more happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
