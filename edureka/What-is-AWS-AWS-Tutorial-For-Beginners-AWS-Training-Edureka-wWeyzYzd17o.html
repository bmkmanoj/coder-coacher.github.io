welcome to this session on what is EWS
so without wasting any time let's skip
on to the agenda to see what all we'll
be covering in today's session so we'll
start this session by first discussing
what is a WS and then move on to discuss
the different companies who are using
the enterprise service once we're done
with that we'll move on to discuss why
companies big or small are using AWS or
any other cloud provider for that matter
right so once we'll discuss what is AWS
and why AWS is important we'll look at
some of the basic services that AWS has
to offer us and then move on to discuss
the AWS doable infrastructure
once we're done with that we'll end this
session by discussing the various
pricing options provided by AWS right so
guys this is our agenda for today I hope
it's clear to you now let's go on and
discuss the first topic of today's
session which is what is AWS so guys EWS
that is Amazon Web Services is a
subsidiary of amazon.com as a world
leader in cloud computing market right
it was launched way back in 2006 when no
company had the cloud computing business
model it took the risk and now today 70%
of the whole cloud computing market is
residing on AWS so now you can imagine
how big a the professor's right talking
about companies who are on EWS let's
look at some of the companies some of
the prominent companies were using the
AWS infrastructure so these are some of
the very popular companies like
Kellogg's Robbie air B&amp;amp;B Chen electrics
Netflix and Amazon which are using the
AWS infrastructure for their operations
now Netflix and Amazon are completely
dependent upon the AWS infrastructure
now you can imagine if these two
companies which are so big and though
the whole world is using it even your
application is going to share the same
infrastructure as these apps so you can
imagine that your application is in safe
hands right you can be assured with that
having said that let's move on to
discuss but why do companies use AWS and
what's the advantage of having the cloud
computing technology with you right so
let's shed a light on that and for that
let's take an example say you think of
you know starting a business and say
your business is
you think of launching the Instagram
application and you have the application
ready now you have to make it available
to the world
so the first thing that you have to do
is you have to invest some money buy
some servers and upload your application
on it and your application is up and
ready right so you start with a small
user base and you say ok so in one month
or so I can expect that so-and-so users
will be there but your plan doesn't go
according to your will and what happens
in overnight your application becomes so
viral that there are millions of users
were trying to access your application
now so the servers that you had and now
very overburdened with the kind of
traffic which is coming in and you get
very anxious as to what to do so what
you do you invest some more money by
some more servers and now the situation
seems to be a little normal right
but guys servers are machines we should
not forget about it right and they have
bound to break down so one finally what
happens is your servers they go down
they go haver and your application is so
to fix this again you had to hire a
maintenance team which is now going to
manage your servers for you that is
anything kind of server upgrade which is
required any kind of software up pass
which has to be put in and when your
server goes down replacing it with a new
server all of that is now going to be
managed by the maintenance team right so
the kind of attention that was required
for you to give to your application it
could not get that attention because how
are we our attention was towards the
infrastructure side which is
understandable right so these are the
problems we folklore computing and one
fine day the bills came up and said but
why don't you use my servers right I
have a stack of servers in my warehouse
why don't you use some of them right and
the best thing about it is that you know
I you know how to bias the servers from
me you can just rent them from me use
them for the time you wanted to and give
them any time you want say you give to
me up to five hours you just pay for the
five hours time that you used it for
right at the same time you don't have to
worry about the maintenance right I will
do the maintenance for my servers and
with this this was like you know if the
god came in and said let me help you it
was like that so this was a very good
deal for you because now you not spend
money on buying servers and not spending
money on the maintenance team everything
is being managed by AWS and at a very
cheap price of parada pieces right so
it's very awesome so moving forward we
have understood why you know AWS
companies are adopting AWS or any other
cloud platform and what exactly is AWS
it let's move on to discuss the service
with now so let's take an example again
here let's take the example of a website
so this is a skeleton architecture for a
very normal web site that is there right
how does it function the user first he
goes onto a website he goes onto the
internet and he types in a web address
right that web address then goes to a
DNS server that DNS server basically
gets that converted into an IP address
that IP address points to a load
balancer that load balancer in turn is
you know distributing the traffic among
many of the servers and you end up on
any one of these servers this is how it
happens right and now this server is
again connected to a relational database
and this relational database is
basically having all the information
which is required for your website and
also with these entities that is your
database and your servers are inside a
network so that they can communicate
with each other right so these are the
basic entities which are there in a
cloud computing world right now taking
the same problem as before that you know
what suddenly a whole lot of user group
comes in and your servers become
overburdened now how do you take care of
that so you don't have to take care of
anything cloud computing you know the
cloud mobility model is herbs then it'll
take care of itself right so it
automatically senses that you know the
servers are getting overburdened it adds
a solar automatically and now your
situation becomes normal right so this
is how the cloud computing board is
going to help you out we discussed this
already right but now having seen this
architecture how it works now let's look
at how these services or how these
components will look when you took it
from the AWS perspective right so when
you talk about AWS services the DNS
server that we discussed is called route
53 this servers the web servers that we
discussed our issue servers the
relational databases are yes the network
in which these components will be
closed-in is BPC and the load balancer
is again load balancer and the property
which increases the number of servers
and know is them according to traffic is
auto-scaling right so these are some of
the basic services offered by AWS and
these are awesome values right so these
were the services that we were to
discuss moving forward now let's discuss
about the global infrastructure that AWS
has to offer
now AWS provides these many services
throughout the globe it has a global
presence right and these orange dots are
the regions that AWS has right each
region has multiple zones and zones are
nothing but huge data centers with a lot
of servers right so probably when you
choose America when you choose the US so
probably you will be ending here
somewhere around here right if you
choose the region 1 region is this and
the other region is this one zone would
be one circle and this is how it
functions right
so in all there are 18 geographical
regions around the world and in those
regions we have around 50 availability
zones like I said a 50 huge stay the
centers around the world that are at
your disposal right but why will he need
a global infrastructure is a question
right so say let me take the same
example forward the website servers and
these servers are now distributed among
different places throughout the world
now what advantage does it give you
first of all it helps in the disaster
recovery kind of situation for example
this server was done you all again have
these two servers to solve your traffic
flow right so this server goes on
because of power outage or any natural
calamity your application is still up
because it has been hosted in different
regions right this is one advantage the
second advantage is that it serves the
purpose of users from different
countries for example you are in this
country and in your trying to access
your website probably you can access it
from this server right rather than
having your servers at one central
location which will not only have more
latency that is response line if a
customer is out of the country but also
it's a very bad measure to take when we
are too concerned about disaster
recovery right so this is the reason
that AWS has a global presence and they
have a global infrastructure so it is
there because so then your
Chalmers can have the lowest latency
possible and also you can implement the
best is ask recovery measures all right
having said that let's now talk about
AWS pricing there is now a double
pricing is amazing so like we discussed
so we have a per our billing kind of
system right so and the pricing is also
region specific in the sense that each
region has different pricing for
different services they don't differ
much but so they are different from each
other for each region so you can choose
a region according to your preference
also there's a scene called reserved
instances so many choose reserved
instances you save up to 90% costs
so when you say reserve this a basically
means you rent the server for a
particular term say a one-year term or a
three-year term and when you do that
when you compare it with on-demand
pricing you save up to 90% which is
awesome right and also there is an
option for spot pricing as well wherein
you get incredibly low prices by bidding
on servers for a particular price right
so you're bid on server for saying I
want to sell for $2 if a server is
available you get it right you use that
server until the server price goes up
and once it goes up the server is taken
automatically for you right it could be
helpful for workloads where in the work
is not that urgent but you want to get
it done in the minimum cost possible
right so it is helpful with that and
with that guys we come to an end to the
