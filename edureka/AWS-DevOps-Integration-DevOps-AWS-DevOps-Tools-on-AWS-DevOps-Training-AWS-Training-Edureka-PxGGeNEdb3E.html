welcome to this session on AWS
integration with DevOps now AWS and
DevOps are the most trending terms out
there in the IT industry right now and
today in this session I'm going to
explain each and everything in detail
from scratch from you as and what is AWS
what is divorced and how can these two
technologies be used together right so
let's go ahead and discuss the agenda to
understand for these two terms so first
in this session we are going to discuss
what is AWS and then we want to discuss
what is DevOps after that we are going
to discuss some of the most prominent
tools of DevOps which are used in the
industry such as docker such as selenium
such as Jenkins etc and I'm going to
show you guys how you can use these
tools together to form the development
lifecycle right so in the hands-on
section I'm going to teach you guys how
you can create or simulate the whole
development lifecycle from the point a
developer commits a program to the point
it gets automatically deployed to a
product s server via the selenium
software which basically tests over
automatically right and these broad
servers and test servers are actually
going to be hosted on a Terp Louis all
right so guys this is what our agenda is
for today and this is what you're going
to do today so without missing any time
let's go ahead and start with the
session by the first topic which is what
is AWS
so guys EWS is a cloud services platform
so this it's a cloud services platform
on which you have sources like database
you have services like compute cloud
security cloud monitoring networking
file system contained Italy etc right
so basically AWS events you server so
instead of buying your own stores you
can rent service from a deployers and
use them at the price of at the minimum
price of 0.03 dollars per hour right
that is the kind of pricing AWS has to
offer so if you need a machine to work
on and you don't want to buy a machine
which is probably you need a machine say
you need a 16gb machine with the 8gb of
graphics card Andy who don't have that
machine right now with you all right you
can rent this kind of machine from AWS
at the minimum price possible and
whenever you're done with it just
close that machine and you just be AWS
for the time you use that machine for
example you use that machine Fassett say
to wash you just pay us with the price
of those two hours and that is it that
is all the commitment that you have to
give to a depressed and suggestions
about the AWS and the whole of how the
cloud industry actually works and EWS
has to offer a lot of cloud computing
services or offer services not only in
compute but also offer services in
database and offer services content
delivery file system networking cloud
monitoring cloud security etc right so
this is the whole ecosystem of AWS and
every day they had new and new services
which cover probably everything which is
out there in the IT world right so this
was about AWS let's go in and discuss
what is DevOps
so guys DevOps is not a technology it is
actually a fashion which is being
followed it's a revolution which came in
the past years now what is DevOps
exactly it is actually the merging of
the development team and the operations
team so early when DevOps was not there
there was always a constant war between
these two teams that at the development
team and the operation see the
developers you should develop the
application it used to run on their
machines but when the operations people
used to upload it on the server's it
didn't run over there right so this was
just a basic problem that had to be
solved there were numerous other
problems as well that both these teams
had to suffer right but with the
introduction of DevOps with DevOps came
a lot of tools and it formed all these
problems it created a bridge between the
development teams and the operations
team so that they can collaborate with
each other and work on the same
application that they are supposed
right the developers and the operations
basically work in the same application
right the developers developed that
application and the operations teams are
sapru their application on the prod
servers or on the test servers so that
it gets available to the world or for
the developers to test this is basically
the job of operations people right now
with the use of DevOps tools now
developers and operations team can
Polk's
and how they can do it I will show you
in a bit when we discuss the DevOps
tools so without wasting any time let's
go ahead and understand what are these
different tools and what do they
actually do so the first tool is get
right so what is get exactly is of get
is a version control system which is
basically used to log any kind of change
that you made to your code right for
example you have a package in which you
you have a code so the first time you
commit your code your code automatically
gets uploaded onto get when it gets
uploaded onto gate say tomorrow you
would change something in your code and
you say ok I'm committing my code again
so no other copy of your code is
actually being deployed on the kids
servers what happens is what it it
recognizes what changes are there and it
implements those changes on the gate
servers alright so this is just one
feature of what you get does the other
feature what happens you say I have a
project that I want other developers to
contribute to right so there's a concept
and gate which is called branches
alright so I'll have a master branch so
the master branch basically means the
master file master folder where my main
project is and each developer can create
his own copy of that master branch or
master folder and work in his own folder
for example there are three developers
developer a developer P and we're a
Percy so developer the a can copy the
master folder well if a B can copy the
master for developer C can copy the
master folder and then work on that
project now all these three developers
will come in their own version of the
projects and as I as a owner of that
project can see which of these three
versions I would like to use in my main
project right should all these three
twelve pearls would have made some
changes and whichever developers work I
liked the most
or whichever developers book I feel is
the best I will take his folder and
integrate it with the master folder in
the sense that now the master folder
becomes the extended version which the
develop PSC made right and all of this
is possible so it basically removes the
confusion as to you know which version
or which part should I now integrate or
house
integrated into the master project
everything it removes and it gives you a
clear way of worsening your software
application so this was about get right
this next tool is called docker
now dr. is again a very interesting and
a very important tool which basically
gives you your own environment to work
it for example you have a Windows system
right and you are creating an
application for say Linux so say your
prod servers are Linux servers right so
what do you do is you can download a
docker container for a Linux machine for
example we want the Ubuntu flavor of
Linux and docker so you just download
the docker container for in a bun to
machine and when you run that container
that container is basically the Ubuntu
operating system all right and it can
run inside your Windows machine you can
deploy your application inside this
docker container and the best part about
this docker container is if you copy
this cut off container and run it in
some other machine it will work exactly
the same as it was working in the
previous machine that is all the project
dependencies all the project libraries
whatever were related to your project
which was lying inside the docker
container also get copied along with
that container so the problem of the you
know when the developers said that it is
running on my machine why isn't it
running in your machine gets old
using this tool right and it's an
awesome tool guys because like I said if
I you have a Windows machine you can
actually work in the Ubuntu machine or a
one two environment using the docker
containers and also the docker
containers are as low as 55 mV so
there's a Linux version of docker
container coiled and the Alpine OS right
and it's as low as say around 50 or 60
mb/s of operating system right so you
can have that Linux environment in just
60 MB of data how cool is that
right and this is what docker container
is all about the next tool is selenium
right so selenium is an automation tool
which automates the path of testing
right if you have a website for example
and the job of the tester is to enter
some test cases in the sense you know he
enters some values for username for
some password he clicks on login and
then he checks whether the login
succeeded or not right see if the logon
succeeded he says test passively login
feels he said test filled right now this
can be automated using selenium so you
give selenium whatever inputs you want
to give the selenium tests those input
on whatever application that you have
specified it logs the response from it
and then decides whether deciced
passes passed or failed all right so it
gives you a quick feedback if a
developer is developing an application
if you before submitting in the
application he wants to check if his
application is passing all the test
cases or not he can basically just run
his application in the selenium software
and check whether his application is
working or not
right so it's an excellent tool for
automated testing then came his Jenkins
so Jenkins is the master of all tools so
basically what it does it does
continuous integration so it integrates
all these tools that is it integrates
docker it integrates gate it integrates
other tools it integrates selenium so
you can use all these tools together
using Jenkins so what Jenkins does is
for example if you were to talk about
the development lifecycle say I come at
a code to kit right and I say whenever a
commit happens to the master branch so
in the case when you know developer a
developer B develop I see all the own
implemented or gave me their own
versions of projects and I decided okay
but when a Persis work is something that
I want to be tested on the testing
servers so I say okay so developer C I
will integrate into my mass transit it
is according it is okay according to me
right the moment I integrate into my
master branch Jenkins will get to know
okay that something has been committed
to the master branch in this particular
repository right so it fetches all the
files from that master branch of copies
all the folders and files from that
master branch and puts it on the test
server inside a docker container right
so I can specify what version of docker
container I want where exactly do I want
both files to be stored and I can
specify all that using my Jenkins tool
and my website will be deployed inside
that docker container which is exactly
the same environment
of the developers right so that problem
of not working will get solved right so
once it runs in the docker container and
the next thing that I can do with
Jenkins is I can tell it that okay so my
website is now deployed it is hosted now
I want to test it right so using the
same tool that is Jenkins I can also run
a selenium test on that particular
website trying so these are the test
cases please see if this can be sold
please see if this gives a positive
response
again now all of these tasks are done
automatically so once the website gets
repaired it automatically moves on to
the testing part so it tests whether the
website is working or not so if the
website gives a positive or a successful
message it pushes the application to the
cron server automatically if the server
or st test fails it has an option to
first of all rollback everything on that
test server that is it deletes the
workspace and at the same time it can
also give an email to whoever committed
to the master branch saying that your
application has failed for so-and-so
reason this is the error that you bought
on the test server all right so this is
how the whole of development life cycle
that is from the point a developer
committed to the kit program till the
point where it got tested and deployed
on the prod soil is automated right and
this is what DevOps tools are all about
now this is something this is the
hands-on part guys this is what we are
going to do today in this session so
first I am going to create a Jenkins
server on which I am going to host all
my applications
you know I will put all the commands
that I have to be supposed when I will
do all the configuration on the second
server that is test server I'll have my
docker containers or I am a dog docker
software so my Jenkins will basically
deploy the local container that I'll be
mentioning that is mentioned by the
developer right he will deploy the
website along with it inside the docker
container when the website is hosted it
will do a selenium tests on this docker
container and if everything goes fine it
will go ahead and push it to the prod
server and at the same time once all
these things alone I can continuously
monitor it so this is where
the continuous feedback loop is right
you can continuously monitor what is the
feedback of the users which are coming
in for example you say okay so you know
what I just deploy my website only for
the users of India right so if you're a
big company you decide okay so let's
test our product first on the Indian
audience so you deploy a product and you
know you take the feedbacks as to how
the whole user experience is going what
what do the users say you listen to all
the feedbacks from different social
websites you mean take that feedback you
integrate that feedback and now you want
to improve your application right so you
take in the feedback you improve your
application and again you commit to the
master branch and again it gets to prod
with the prod server this is the whole
continuous development lifecycle right
you're right once you have product was
done it never gets finished it just
continuously developed as and when we
get the feedbacks and we upgrade our
application alright so this is how the
whole lifecycle works and this is
something that we are going to implement
today in this session all right so just
give me a second
the first thing that we're going to do
is we are going to create a Jenkins
server right for that let me go to my
AWS management console so this is so
basically first I'll go to my AWS
website that is aws.amazon.com right I
log into my management console so just
give me a second
alright guys this is my management
console I just go to my preferred region
so it is already
I am coincide ec2 so like I said ec2 is
a service which gives you source it
gives you draw servers to work on right
so I basically want one two machines to
work on so what I'll do is I'll launch
an instance and I'll select the type of
operating system that I want so I want
an open to operating system I'll select
that of system right I select the kind
of processor that I want for my system
so this is a demo and I think probably
the T 2 dot micro system will do so if
you guys are on a free tier or we have
just registered for the AWS account and
if you don't want to be billed you can
probably select the T 2 dot micro
instance which is going to be free for
the next one year from the time you sign
up all right you select this instance
and you click on next
right now this is something that you
don't have to worry about if you are a
beginner or need a bus and if you wanna
do this demo just click on review and
launch and click on launch at the end
now there is a concept called GPL which
is basically a public key private key
kind of an arm kind of kind of setup in
which you get a key using which you can
authenticate yourself to use that
instance so there is no password which
is required to connect to your instance
alright so what you can do is you can
either create a new key pair that is you
can go here and choose create a new key
pair just name a key pair and select
download you will get a private file you
will get our PEM file right and using
that file you can connect to your
service now the problem here is that you
will get a PEM file and for connecting
people to server using a software called
putty you have to use the PPK version so
let me show you how you can you know
actually create a new key pair so let me
create a key pair called
ed Eureka - devops let me download this
key pair so I have this key pair now and
I can click on launch instances so this
will basically deploy mess over on AWS
and you can check your source over here
in the ec2 console by going inside your
running instances and here you can see
my server is being deployed it's in the
pending state right now so let me name
it as Jenkins alright and I can deploy
most of us just like this I all have to
do is I click on launch more like these
servers and I'll click on launch I'll
select the same key pair which I've just
created and click on launch instances so
again the same configuration server will
get deployed and I can see it over here
in the ec2 console all right it is
getting deployed over here let's name it
as test so all right so my test server
is now running my Jenkins server is now
running now to connect to these
instances all you have to do is you have
to go to a software or you have to
download a software called the put ijen
tatra you run the software and basically
this will ask you to copy the PEM file
over here you can probably just drag and
drop the PEM file in this tool let's
let's load this PEM file so I'll just
call it desktop or I go to downloads and
I'll just select the PEM file that I've
just downloaded so this is the purple so
it's a successfully imported awesome
now what I have to do is I have to save
the private key from this so I click on
safe private key I'll click on yes and
let me save it on desktop as a Eureka -
DevOps and as yoga element notice it is
now being stored in the form of PPK so
earlier the extension was pam file now
the extension is PPK let's click on save
so this will now save my PPK file on my
desktop now all I have to do is I will
run my pootie software right I will copy
this IP address so let's say I configure
my Jenkins server first so I'll copy the
IP address with this I'll paste the IP
address here right so this is my footie
software now I go to SSH I'll good Worth
and now I'll have to select my PPK file
so that using it it can authenticate to
thee easily so right so let me specify
my BBJ file so it is Erica - DevOps
theaters let me sell
it and let me click on and this will
open my soul show whenever you launch an
Ubuntu operating system the login name
is Ubuntu
you will just type in a bun - and now
I'm connected to my open to server
alright so here is Ubuntu server guys
let me see if I can make this text a
little bigger for you
you
so here you go guys this is your Ubuntu
machine now the things that we are going
to do on this server is first we have to
install the Jenkins server now for
installing the Jenkins server all you
have to do is you have to run these
commands now for Jenkins to be installed
guys the first thing that you have to do
is you have to install Java all right so
let's install Java on this machine
so first let's update this machine so
right so I'll say sudo apt-get update so
this will update this machine now once
the machine has been updated the next
thing that I'll do is I'll install Java
so here I go this command will basically
install Java on my system once Java is
installed the next thing that I after
install is this so I have to add a key
to the repository alright so this
command will basically add the Jenkins
key for it to be installed so my job is
being installed and this will install
the key with this we can basically add
some more values now we will update
and now let's install Jenkins so here we
go
now on Jenkins is being installed on
your server guys so it's just like give
it some seconds and be up and running
now while this is being installed there
are some firewall settings that you have
to do to your server so for that you
just click on Jenkins and you will go to
launch visit and over here you can
configure the inbound settings for your
server all right so I'll click on edit
and over here you have to basically open
the ports for you to connect to your
server in the sense that Jenkins is
available on 8 0 8 0 port right so for
the sake of simplicity what you can do
is you can select all tcp ports and you
can basically open all the ports for
yourself so that now Jenkins is
available to you from your browser all
right so let's go ahead alright so
Jenkins is now installed on this
particular computer so now if I go to my
instance which is basically over here
I'll go to check-ins I'll select the IP
address I'll copy these writers over
here as write : a throw and so I will
hit enter and hey whoa here you have the
Jenkins interface alright so the first
time you install Jenkins you will get
this screen try to you have to enter the
administrator password so all you have
to do is you will copy this link that is
over here you will go to your terminal
will say sudo cat and you paste this
address over here and this will
basically open or read this file and
displayed on the terminal that this
initial admin password alright so here
is the password you can copy the
password from here go back to your
screen paste it here and click on
continue alright so your Jenkins has now
started and it is up and running now the
next screen you have to install the
plugins for Jenkins so you can just
click on install suggested plugins and
it will install all the necessary
plugins that are required for any
default or any normal job that you want
to run
Ekans right so it is going to install
all these plugins for get for ant for
Gradle right for males it isn't
swallowing all these plugins and while
this is being installed so we don't need
this server anymore let me let us just
close the server right the Jenkins
server or we'll be working from tooth
from on the Jenkins over from here now
onwards
now let's set up our tests over alright
so I'll select the IP address from here
I'll open the putty console let me
select the key from here so it's the
same key as my Jenkins over right and
it's on desktop so I'll just type in AWS
and then L Eureka - DevOps got PPK and I
click on open this in turn will create a
connection to my so let me make the font
a little bigger
all right so let's type in the name for
the server which is Ubuntu or h1 logged
in now let's see so the first thing that
I will be doing is first let's update
our servers well say sudo apt-get update
all right so my server is being updated
now so while my server is being updated
let's see the next thing that we have to
do so first let's install docker on our
system for that we have to run all these
commands so let's run these commands one
by one
this will add the key this will add this
link to the Ubuntu repository now after
this we again have to update the
computer let's do that as you can see
these links have got pane have now been
updated now let's check if our local
entries are there yes they are there now
let's install blocker on the system so
this will now install the occur on this
particular system let's get installed
the next thing that you have to do is
for your selenium so you for selenium
you need to have a browser on your
system right so let's install Chrome on
this system so we'll go back to this
terminal let's install Chrome on the
system
let's press Y and chrome is now being
installed on this particular session now
let's go back and install the chrome
driver as well so this will install the
chrome driver
all right it's taking some time let's
leave it for that let's let me set up my
Jenkins over to them alright so my
plugins have now been installed on
myself
let's give us over our username my
Jenkins server so it's any record let me
get the password again give the password
let get the full name for mine there was
a man Sharma and let me give the email
address which is this all right let me
click on save and finish alright so
Jenkins is ready now so let me click on
save let me save the username and
password and let's click on start using
Jenkins alright this is basically the
default console that I get for using
Jenkins and while before doing anything
over here let me complete the
configuration for my test so so my
Chrome browser has now been installed
now let's install Chrome driver on this
so this is the command for installing
the chrome driver let me paste it over
here let me in tender alright so my
chrome driver has now been installed
also we have to install Java on this
system as well so let us install Java as
well so Java is now being installed on
the system why do you need Java on the
system is first your selenium tests are
basically jar files right so to install
or to run jar files you need Java on
your system also Jenkins would be
connecting to the slave using the chain
LP protocol and for that you need Java
again alright alright so Java has now
been installed on the system awesome so
let's go ahead and configure Jenkins now
the first thing that I would do in
Jenkins is connect my slave to thinkin's
alright for that all you have to do is
you have to click on manage Jenkins you
have to click on configure global
security
all right now you will go down and you
will click on random when you have Glu
agents so if you want to connect to your
slave using jnlp you have to select this
option and click on save all right so
your jnlp has been selected it hasn't
set to random now the next thing that
you have to do is you have to click on
manage notes once you click on manage
nodes you will click on new node and
let's name that no-name as slave so this
will basically add your slave or connect
your slave to your champions alright so
you click on permanent agent you click
on OK now you will select the remove to
route directory the directory where all
your files will be copied from gate so
let me specify it as Jenkins slash
workspace alright we've specified it and
nothing else has to be configured here
just click on save alright so my slave
has now been configured now let's
connect our so our slaves over to this
Jenkins so for that the first thing that
I have to do is you have to download two
files so the first file is slave agent
and the next file is agent right so both
these files have to be present on your
test server and the way you can copy
these files on your test server is using
FileZilla so let me open FileZilla and
now you have to have the IP address of
your test server which is this let me
paste it on my FileZilla let me enter
the username which is Ubuntu let me
specify the port number and before that
let us open the ports for our test
server as well the way we did it for our
Jenkins over so alright everything seems
to be configured here awesome
so basically it's the same security
group as of that of my Jenkins server so
it works for me all right so it has both
the same settings nothing has to be
configured here either score easily
dashboard could running instances and
let's connect to my Jenkins server now
for that again over here I have to go to
settings I have to specify where
private key is so I click on add key
file I go to desktop I select the PPK
file and it's added now I'll click on OK
and let's click on Quick Connect so this
will basically list the directories or
the files which are there on this so all
right now what I want to do is I want to
copy those two files over here so let's
do that so first let me rename them and
let me delete the old files and let me
rename this fire as it is required on
the server so it's agent let me paste it
on the server head goes next thing is I
want my slave file to be there as well
so this again has to be there on the
server so let me dname it as slave agent
and then just copy it now - my ubuntu so
here it goes
alright so now both these files are
there on my server and you can actually
see it over here let me clear the
command console let me say LS alright so
as you can see both these files are now
visible in your home directory now the
next thing that you have to do is you
have to run this command in sudo mode in
your slave and this will basically
connect your instance to your Jenkins
server I'll hit enter and as you can see
it is connected now it says connected I
will just duplicate the session because
now you cannot use it the process is
running in the foreground I have closed
this one so this is basically another
copy of that terminal this is the same
server I will be working in it's just
another terminal alright and now if I go
back to the list I can see the cross has
been removed which basically means my
slave is now connected to my Jenkins
over all right so the next thing that
we'll be doing is now we have to
configure docker alright now as I told
you guys what docker is let me show you
how you can use dock where how towel is
exactly used right so I say sudo docker
images
so I don't have any images as of now now
say I want another one - operating
system inside this particular computer
so it's a pseudo rocker run - IT - Dee
and ten Ubuntu and then I'll click on
enter so it's unable to find the image
locally so what it is doing it now it is
downloading the image from the
repository and as you can see the image
has now been downloaded and what I do is
I'll say pseudo local images I'll take
the similar ID as a pseudo docker run -
i t - t - P and then I'll say port 80
should map to put 80 and then and
specify the container ID
alright so container is now running and
let's now say sudo docker PS I've got
this container ID and let us
so I just have to go again inside my
container so as a pseudo dog exec - I T
then the container ID and then bash
so I'm inside the container I say
service status let's see for the patches
so this is running inside this container
all right so it says a party to wonder
can I service let us install the sauce
so it's sudo apt-get sorry little gate
Apache to install
all right and now let me refresh this
browser as a service a part a to restart
all right
and as you can see the Apache service is
now running on the server alright so
this is what we wanted guys this is what
what we actually wanted we wanted the
Apache service to be running from the
container and that is exactly what is
happening right now right so like I said
Apache is not installed on my computer
so if I do exit and I say service Apache
to status it says inactive so there was
no Apache to service formed right but if
like I said my Apache service is now
inside this container inside the
container that is an operating system I
have my Apache service and from there
I'm seeing that Apache service over here
because the port has been now matched
right so the port 80 of my docker
container is being forwarded to build AP
of this over and the server's IP address
is this and this is how I'm getting this
Apache page awesome isn't it and now if
I kill my container that is if I just
say sudo Rocco PS right and if I said
this is the container ID and I say sudo
docker kill and I click it I will no
longer be able to access this Apache
server because not now the docker
container has been killed alright and
similar is what we are going to do today
as well so with our website what we are
going to do is our website is going to
be hosted inside a docker container and
inside the same docker container we are
going to have Apache service as well
right and from a server from a test
server we will be checking on selenium
on the local O's that is the port 80 we
will be checking whether whatever
website is there on port 80 it is
passing the selenium tests or not all
right so we have the docker container
ready let me show you how my selenium
script looks like so this is how my
selenium script guy is actually look
like so what is basically going to
happiness my chrome driver is basically
there in this particular location of my
motor server it's an user library
chromium browser and then
chromedriver here des right I'm
basically what I will be doing is I will
be checking on the local host so it will
basically open the local host and it
will check these following elements it
will find the login element login and
resend the key here month over there
right then will find the element called
password and send the keys keys over
here and what is the website that we are
testing this on so this is basically the
website this is the website that will be
checking these tests on my Eclipse on my
selenium will enter in the login
component it will enter the keys here
month so basically this is my login
component alright it'll enter hey month
over here it'll enter the password which
is SDF over here and then it will click
on submit alright so it will look for an
element which will be named click so
this is that element and it will click
on it so once you click on submit we
will get login succeeded and then it
will go down it will look for an element
called test so this is basically that
test element and inside the test element
whatever text is there it will going to
store it inside the a month variable
this human variable will then be
compared to this string which is login
succeeded if that is the case it will
pass the test if that is not the case it
will fail that so this is the selenium
testing which we are going to do on this
particular website and this website is
going to go inside the docker container
inside the test server and this job is
going to be automated using Jenkins
right so this is the whole of the things
that we are going to do now what how
exactly are we telling Jenkins what kind
of docker container do we want you can
check it over here so let me show you
the code that is going to be there so
this is the docker file guys and docker
file is a file where we describe how our
container or how our container is going
to be so let me open it using notepad
plus plus right so from a repo there's a
container or this and waste that I have
configured that is called Ubuntu new one
to one to one basically this this image
this
curr contain an image I have installed
Apache alright and it's an Ubuntu image
so what I'll be doing is I'll be adding
my file what is the file this is this is
the folder of my website right inside
this I have all the files for my website
so basically this folder I'm specifying
over there add this folder inside this
particular directory inside my docker
container so first it will initialize or
it will download this container and
initialize it after that it is going to
add this particular folder to this
particular directory in that container
once it is then it will run the Apache
service in the foreground that is it
will restart the Apache service once it
has added the blog/website
in this particular folder and once that
is done it will remove the pre-existing
index dot HTML that is the Apache test
page from this particular directory
inside my docker container alright so
this is these are the commands that are
passing inside my docker file and this
is what is actually going to happen so
let me close it and this was about my
daugher file this was basically the
selenium test clip that I have showed
you so basically what I've done is I
have gone to my project with a selenium
test I have right clicked it I haven't
gone to export I have selected runnable
jar file I have clicked on next and this
has basically exported or created a new
jar file for me inside this particular
destination which is new folder to when
that final dot jar and this is actually
the same destination over here that is e
SP new folder is - and here is where the
final jar file will be created once I
click on finish alright so this is how
you create a jar file for your selenium
test and all these files I have created
inside one particular folder so this is
my website folder files this is my
daugher file this is my selenium file
and this oil is basically a good
directory so what now I can do is I can
click right click here and click on get
bash here this will basically open the
gate command prompt over here and now I
can upload all these files to my remote
repo that is on github where is my
remote repo it is over here so what
and go here I could get hub to my
repository and here it is guys so you
have my blog files you have taqwa file
and you have my child file as well all
right so now what I can do is I can go
back to this folder and I can make a
change in the website so that you guys
can see it so what I can do is I can
probably have this image in the
background so for that what I can do is
I will go inside my index file and I
will change this picture so to say it
well dot jpg I'll save it I'll close
this and now I will go back and let me
upload it again to my remote repo so
I'll say git status this was probably
show me that my index dot PHP has now
been modified so I'll say alright commit
this transaction so as a gate commit - M
and say L eureka demo all right so my
file has now been modified and it has
been committed all right so first you
have to add these files to your branch
and now you will commit to your branch
by saying git commit - m lu Rekha demo
all right so it says one file changed
one in social also now let me push it to
my repository so I'll say git push
origin master and when I press enter
this will basically be pushed to my
remote repository now before I do this
let me create a job in Jenkins so what
I'll do is I will go inside my Junkins
and let me create a job so that job will
basically integrate each and every tool
that we have discussed so far in this
session so I'll click on new item I will
think I will give my job a name let's
call it get build all right I will click
on freestyle project let me click on OK
and this will in turn create a new job
for me
alright so my job has now been created
now the next thing that I have to do is
I'll say ok so I want to get a project
and my project URL
let me piss it in my good job
so from here it'll get all the files and
say restrict where this project can be
run I want to run it on the slave
alright let it run on the sleeps over
and the source code man it's on kit and
here is the URL for the depository
awesome and where the bill triggers so
whenever I'll be pushing my code to the
master branch it should run this job and
build in my I mean nothing is needed
bill stepped I will execute a set of
commands what are those commands let me
show you those much right so basically I
will be running all right so these are
the commands that I want to run let me
copy these commands and let me paste it
inside my shangkun's command prama and
let me explain it to you so the first
thing that will do is it will build the
docker file that i've specified from
this particular directory so my code
from gate will get pasted to this
particular directory I specify Jenkins
slash workspace remember right so my
docker file will be built from so my
docker file is located in this directory
that will get built and it will be named
as this particular image that is HR
slash new right after this I will run
this particular image that is pseudo
Quran and basically when I am building
the docker file
it will already take the website and put
it inside the docker container because
I've specified everything in Simonov I
remember now all I have to do is I'll
run my daugher container and map it to
port 80 right so once it's mapped to put
80 the next thing that I want to do is I
will copy my final dot jar file which is
my selenium file I'll copy it
inside my home directory and then I will
run this command which basically is runs
the final or jar file as an Ubuntu user
all right and then all these steps once
they are done it will give me a success
page if everything goes fine all right
so let's click on save now and this
basically creates my job now
the next thing that you have to do is
you have to configure the web hook in
your github if you want your job could
be triggered automatically once you push
your code to the master branch for that
you will go to your Apple will go to
settings you'll go to the books right so
there's already a web app will let me
delete this trust me for my password let
me specify the password over here all
right so I've deleted the book let me
add a weblog now right and the payload
URL what you have to do is you have to
give your IP address over sure and then
after that you have to add get web hook
slash and then click on add web book so
this will add the web hook let me edit
it search github the book
right let me update it
alright so my link is working fine now
as you can see it's clean so it can
interact with the Jenkins interface
alright the next thing that I'll be
doing is so my Jenkins so my gate is now
able to interact with Jenkins my Jenkins
is in turn able to you know trigger the
darker jobs and trigger the selenium job
on my test server and let's go ahead and
now commit to my master class the moment
I come into my master branch it will
automatically controller a job over here
alright let me say git push origin
master which is basically pushed my
website on to the github repository
right I'll hit enter
all right so my file has been pushed on
my github all right it's been done now
I'll wait for my github to pick up the
job so as you can see my job has
automatically been triggered over here
and it is running that job now one thing
that I forgot to do I had to kill the
process that is already running which is
okay so there are no so I have already
killed it awesome let this job run and
probably if everything goes well all my
things will get configured automatically
my website will get configured
automatically on a test server and as
you can see it gives a blue icon which
means everything passed successfully so
I go to my console output and here is
your console output guys so as you can
see it deployed the docker container it
ran the tests and it went as successful
so if now I go so this is the IP address
of my server remember I just refresh it
and as you can see the website is now
deployed on my test server and also my
selenium tests were executed on Jenkins
so that you can see again here in the
Jenkins console output as well starting
chromedriver
you know it say it did all the tests and
it came as success now say I closed my
database server so basically my website
is interacting with the database server
so what I can do is I'll go to my
database server see this is my database
server let me close the database server
in AWS so let me stop this database
server so I click on stop I'll click on
yes stop now and it is basically now
stopping the server on AWS so we can
check the output over here first on
localhost and then we can trigger a job
over there again so let me enter the
name let me enter some value let me see
if I am being able to connect to the
server so it says login field right so
let us try so if it says Robin field
basically my test should fail when I run
it on make it up so right so I
go back to project and let me change
something in the code let me come back
to my index file and let me change this
again back to the image the background
image it first right and let me again
push it to my master so I'll say get a
dot you get commit checking selenium
right I will commit it and let's push it
to a my master now so once this is
pushed it should in turn again trigger a
build over here in Jenkins so let's wait
for the job to be triggered over here
no before that guys I have to kill the
container I'm sorry for that
so let me kill the container from here
so I'll say sudo doe kill the container
otherwise I'll show you the error what
it gets it will not be able to deploy
the docker container again basically so
as you can see it says external
connectivity on port is already
allocated so that basically means my
container was running right so let me
build the job again so I'll just go back
to the project let me trigger it for
here on these while sake build now so
floor for the demo purpose as you can
see it's giving me a red sign which
basically means the build failed right
so it's running the test now again it is
deploying everything again the website
that is there on Kate it is deploying it
again here let's see how it goes
so now probably everything has been
deployed it is checking whether the
values entered is it being able to
connect to the database and if it's not
it will give me an error over here you
can actually check the console output if
you want you can probably just go here
to control output and you can see it has
executed everything it is executing the
selenium test now and it says finished
failure if you check the error you can
check the error over sure and you can
see probably what the error was
as you can see it says no such element
unable to locate element but basically
means it was unable to locate my login
successful element and that is the
reason it's called an error and this is
what we wanted right so it has
successfully deployed my website on that
particular server it has checked if
everything is going fine and then if it
fails it gives me a failure message and
as you can see in the console it gives
you a red sign all right you can also go
ahead and specify what happens if your
build is successful so I can say add
post build actions and I can specify to
build other projects so basically I can
create one more project which just
pushes my website to a prod server now
when I click on build other projects it
will say trigger only if the build is
stable in the sense if this build is
stable if this bill goes fine then
trigger one more job and that job
basically be to update this gate project
on my prod server as well so that it
gets available to everyone all right you
can specify it over here again you can
also trigger an email here so you say
email notification will just click on
that and send email for every unstable
build so whenever you build will fail
you will get an email on your specified
recipient saying that the build has
failed for so-and-so reason and then you
can check it so that option can be
configured from over here all right so
with this guys we come to an end on this
session so today let's see if we have
covered everything we covered gate we
saw how good we can configure get to use
with Jenkins we saw how we can use
Jenkins to trigger a docker we also saw
how we can use Jenkins to trigger a job
on selenium we also saw how to connect a
slave server to your Jenkins for area
basically your job will be deployed and
we also saw how to install all these
tools from scratch alright so guys this
was the whole development lifecycle this
was basically the way it works in
industries as well and this is how the
DevOps tools
useful in the industry it basically
automates everything from the time and
developer commits till the time when
goes on and gets deployed on the server
everything is alright so with that guys
