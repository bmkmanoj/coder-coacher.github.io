exception handling this this is
interesting here now we all know what
that exception is right it it's an error
that happens during the execution of a
program so whenever there is an error
you know Python just embrace any
exceptions and thus and like in any
other programming language you can
handle the exception as well and why use
exception you all know as to why use
exception by it many a times there can
be valid exceptions and at times there
can be invalid exceptions as well you
would want to catch those exceptions and
handle it the way you want to and also
there are some that are times where in
you'd want to handle your own exception
or raise your own exception for that
matter you can do that as well in in
Python so when you and the last last
point here it says when you raise an
exception raising an exception breaks
current code execution and returns the
exception back until it is handled right
and when when you raise an exception it
just comes out of that loop and until
you have handled it so these are the
common types of exception I you error
import error your value error so if you
are trying to open a file and then let's
say the file is not available in this
given input output error importer you
are trying to import a package and
that's not available that gives you an
importer and there are likewise there
are keyboard interrupt error and the
file error value error so in encase
right let's say for example I have
defined a list equal to one two
a dot next
okay a right one second next off no it
does not work just a second here oops
the next method here and I tried that
actually god of this the second year I
give braces okay I know it it's still
not working the title rater is not
working not sure okay even port one
second just give me second guess it all
depends on package right whether you
have imported your package or not import
my two tools built in no I I don't think
I think I have missed some package
because this is a new installation yep
and you anyways we'll we'll see that
later soaks the what happens is that
okay let me give you a simple example
like why try to go that far so a is here
right if I say a of 0 I get a value a of
1 I get a value but then do when I do in
a of 2 it gives me an error right and
then it says trace back most this is
list index out of range right this is n
the file error I mean beyond you do not
have anything any of - so okay Gaurav
says I ITER next of sure let's let's
I'll go to that later thanks Laura for
that I'll come to that later ok when I
have either a tour function so anyways
let let me try whatever you have given
okay i won
okay a dot this one okay it's okay sorry
right next up okay I have to use that
might a little function okay next up
right thanks Laura
it does work with with this one okay
let's let's just move along right so now
I will we'll talk about that when I come
to the iterator function but you know
sir some of this yeah some of these
things you know you have to remember
what when to use either a turn and you
know because the a traitor function has
either and you know next closely
associated so you'll have to define a
nitro function before you can use next
so thank you all for that
so common exception errors program with
error handling you see less let me take
this example exception handling here now
I have a problem with my cue board also
okay
exception handling the object okay let
me just write because like my system
crash right I'm not finding anything
actually I'm sorry for that guys here
what's that
okay input enter a number of button okay
we'll have to actually I I went through
this example in my last class also but
let me go through it again this is input
with a number which it's it's starting
to instance it is it all done
will will try in mind
number basically all I'm trying to show
is that you know as to how do we handle
exception and why do we need to handle
exception enter a number let's say I
enter one right it's it gives me one
will get name error okay enter ABC yes
Bob that that's what I was trying to
show but in this case I did my by sham
it's still saying instance hitting test
I don't know what's trying to
instantiate okay I I just closed that
will we'll go and see it in this case
when I enter in a you know it just okay
it's Roy input let's know it should not
have given me this so whenever you are
entering a number here right if you
enter anything apart from number you
will just get an exception all I was
trying to show is that you know you get
such an exception okay so okay so let's
let's move along and now we will go and
see some try accept and you know some
other exceptions along with that now in
this case now where is my exception yes
exception handling
mr. module test defined example here now
okay now we'll see program with
exception handling okay here we are just
trying and enter a new number between 1
1 and 10 and then if I enter a I can
just handle that exception here like
this right like you have you might have
handles in any other programming
languages it says printer numbers are
only allowed if you write this block of
code you can take this block of code
write it and then execute in your Python
or eclipse wherever it is and then if
you just enter a it will say numbers are
not allowed because that stated that you
have given here okay and then you just
say exit which means you're coming out
of this system okay but then you know if
you put one or two or any number here it
will not give you an in any number okay
it will not give you an any error it
will just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
