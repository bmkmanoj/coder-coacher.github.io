today's session is going to be on
machine learning algorithms so without
any further ado let's move on to the
agenda to understand what all be covered
in today's session so we'll be following
a top-down approach we'll start from the
basics and understand what is an
algorithm and how it can be used in
machine learning
after that we'll understand what is
machine learning exactly and how a
problem can be solved using machine
learning after that we'll be discussing
various technique using which a machine
can learn and after that we'll also be
discussing some of the basic algorithms
which are used in machine learning
towards the end we'll be doing a
demonstration where and we'll see how we
can prepare a data set for the creation
and validation of a model and after that
we'll be creating a model using one of
the algorithms that we'll be learning
today alright so guys this is our agenda
for today are we clear with it okay I'm
getting confirmation so current is clear
so assuage Matthew alright guys since
most of you are clear let's move on to
the first topic of today's discussion
that is what is an algorithm so let's
start this topic with a very generic
approach so if you were to interact with
the computer and tell it how it should
execute a particular task the way you do
it is using a program right so what is a
program a program is basically logic
which is wrapped around a syntax a
particular syntax which is specific to a
programming language now this
programming language could be anything
it could be is to have a script it could
be Java it could be Python it could be C
it could be C++ whatever right but the
basic thing doesn't seem that is the
logic
alright the logic remains the same in
every language having said that what is
this logic this logic is what an
algorithm is alright so in simple words
and algorithm is a step by step
procedure towards solving a problem in
the computer world all right
so let's take an example to understand
this thing which you exhaust discussed
all right so let's take an example so
this is a problem or this is an
algorithm to print numbers from 1 to 20
right so let's go step by step and
understand what this algorithm is doing
so this is the start position we start
over here and then we see that our
algorithm is initializing a variable X
to 0 all right so we initialize a
variable X to 0 and then we implemented
it by 1 after that we are printing that
variable and we are checking it
whether it's less than 20 so if it's
less than 20 if it's true or if it's yes
it goes back and increments the value
again by 1 otherwise if it's unknown it
goes on and into program right so since
it's a yes right now it goes back and
increments the value by 1 again so we
are printed 1 and now we have
incremented the value of x by 1 again so
now the value is 2 and then we print
that value so we have now 1 and 2 on the
board all right
then again it checks whether it's less
than 20 if it's true it goes back again
incremented by 1 now it's 3 prints see
so this process goes on until the value
of x reaches 20 so when the value of x
is 20 it prints that value and it checks
whether it's less than 20 which is
unknown and then it ends the program and
hence you have values which are printed
from 1 to 20 all right so this is a step
by step procedure for printing values
between 1 to 20 and this is in similar
way you would create other algorithms as
well so as complex an algorithm can be
it can always be represented using a
flowchart all right so guys this is what
an algorithm is now our next topic is
what is machine learning
now for making a machine learn there are
a lot of ways and there are a lot of
algorithms right now since no problem is
the same every problem so if it takes
all case alright so we tackle every
problem with the different approach
now algorithms are nothing but approach
for a computer right now based on the
problem
you decide which algorithm to use right
so for now let's understand what is
machine learning so machine learning is
basically an artificial intelligence
wherein the machine can learn on its
code meaning we were programmed at once
but every time it encounters a problem
it should not be programmed again that
doesn't mean motive of ours right it
will not be programmed again it changes
its own code according to the new
scenarios it discovers all right so this
is what machine learning is it self
learns whatever has to be learnt from it
we provided scenarios will be provided
with past experiences we feed the values
and learning from those past experiences
it comes up with new solutions this
topic is actually very interesting to
learn about because you might be
thinking how a machine can actually redo
its code or how can it update its its
code on its own right so sounds
interesting right
so this is what we'll be doing in the
next few sessions that we'll learn about
machine learning so today's session is
going to be a very basic session we'll
be seeing how much in learning actually
works what is the basis for machine
learning alright so by the end of the
session you will have a fair idea of how
things basically work with machine
learning but for the advanced part of
machine learning we have the next
sessions lined up so I don't want you
guys to miss any of those sessions all
right ok so moving ahead now so we have
learned what machine learning is but
like I said there are different
approaches towards solving a problem
right so there are basically different
ways a machine can learn let's see the
different ways a machine can learn
basically there are 3 kinds of ways so
the first way is supervised learning the
second way is reinforcement learning and
then you have the unsupervised learning
right
discuss each of these in detail and
understand what these actually are so
the first kind of learning is called
supervised learning all right so what is
supervised learning so supervised if you
concentrate on the word supervised
supervised means when you are monitoring
someone or when you're constantly
monitoring someone or making them
understand something so you can compare
the scene with a classroom scene right
so you sit in a class and the teacher
explains you difficult concepts right
the concepts that cannot be learnt on
your own
that's why teacher is there right so the
way we teach machines in supervised
learning is like this so we provide them
with a particular set of inputs and we
give the corresponding answers as well
for example if I am if I say that what
are the parameters for deciding whether
it will rain today or not so the
humidity should be above some certain
level temperature should be above some
certain level the brain should be in a
certain direction and then if these
scenarios are there it will rain right
so we give a lot of inputs to the
computer with this data and with each
data we assign one it rains and zero it
does not rain
so if the temperature is high and the
humidity is high and the wind is in a
particular direction it will rain so we
say 1 and if the humidity is low and the
temperature is low as well so we say it
will not rain so I will give it a
certain input that today it's certified
degrees Celsius the humidity in 97% the
wind is in this direction will it rain
today all right so the machine will
actually see ok so much up from my past
experiences I saw that ok this was the
temperature and the humidity was this it
rained so it will compare that according
to it and it will come up with the
probability and hence come up with the
solution or an answer whether it will
rain or not right so this is what
supervised learning is so basically we
are providing it with the answer and the
inputs as well all right so if you were
to discuss it in a more general way so
you can take your kids as an example so
like I said your kids go to school right
so your teacher is explaining concept so
you
kid using example so you tell them so
you're trying to make them understand
something you're giving them examples as
in this is the way it happens right and
that's what we do as well in supervised
learning we give the machine example so
example that day your train and those
seen those like this the temperature was
the humidity was this and hence a train
right so if the inputs are like these
you come up with a decision okay it will
drain right so this is what supervised
learning is the next topic is
unsupervised learning so basically if
you understood what a supervisor is okay
so first guys any doubt and what
supervised learning is okay surah says
is clear others all right good so our
next topic is now unsupervised learning
so what is unsupervised learning so you
can understand on supervised learning by
comparing it straightaway with
supervised learning all right
so in supervised learning like I said
you were giving them answers as well to
inputs but an unsupervised learning you
don't do that you just give them inputs
now you are not giving telling your
computer what will be the answer so what
computer does is or what is it think
logically the only thing computer can do
with the inputs is find a pattern behind
it or find a structure in it right so
this is what the computer actually does
so in unsupervised learning what it does
is you provided inputs right so for
example I want my computer to I give my
computer some inputs on fruit all right
so I don't tell the computer what the
flu pills actually but I give other
parameters such as how big it is or what
color it has say what is the taste of
that fruit all right so when I give all
these conditions or all these parameters
to my computer so it groups the fruits
basis on that so basically it will group
it on the basis of size it's a group it
be on the basis of taste it will group
it be on the basis of color right and
then it shows us that data and then we
can actually label so okay so the size
is big and the color is this you this
this fruit will be known as an apple all
right now what kind of
problems are actually there in
unsupervised learning could be when we
don't know whether there is a
correlation in the letter or whether
there is a structure in the data for
example if you talk about big data right
so big data is nothing but a huge chunk
of data right so we don't know that ring
that is Adam it's not structured right
so whenever we want to find a structure
in data we use unsupervised learning now
it's the job of the algorithm to figure
out what is if there's a pattern in the
data and if at all there is a pattern it
gives us that fact and hence we can
decide how we can move ahead alright so
if we have structure or if we have if
you know how that data can be
differentiated how it can be structured
then supervised learning can be applied
on it but if we don't know what that
data structure is we use unsupervised
learning right so guys are we clear with
what supervised learning is and what
unsupervised learning is
okay so if you want to take the same
example forward so we talked about your
kids in the Pierce example so in the
previous example that is supervised
learning your kids were learning in
school right so your teacher was were
telling them examples and we're teaching
them how what a particular problem is
and how can be tackled
but unsupervised learning is when your
your kids are learning on their own so
they have the books right there trying
to figure out what a thing is on their
own so that is what unsupervised
learning is moving on to the third part
which is reinforcement learning so what
is reinforcement learning so
reinforcement learning basically is when
your computer is trying to take
decisions all right so what kind of
problems can be included in
reinforcement learning is say when
you're when you wanted to teach you
computer how to play chess now you
cannot tell your computer what to do
because there are a lot of things that
are like a zillion possibilities or a
zillion moves that can be done in chess
so you cannot tell each and every move
to your computer but what you can tell
is whether he did right or wrong all
right and that is what reinforcement
learning is for another example that you
can take is when you are training your
dog all right so you cannot tell your
dog what to do because even not
understand but you can actually reward
your dog if it does right and you can
punish them who does wrong right so that
same thing is actually applied in
reinforcement learning as well so it
basically the computers aim is to
maximize rewards right when it does the
actions so it will come up with the
solution which has the maximum rewards
in place so we define if it does our
sudden action you get a reward
and then from its past experiences it
understands okay when I did this I got a
reward so let me do something similar I
will get more rewards right and that is
what reinforcement learning is all about
so if you were to take the same example
forward let's say your kid when you are
parenting your kid you tell him you
cannot control what a kid does the
throughout the day right you cannot tell
him each and everything but if he does a
bad thing you can actually scold him and
tell in that what he did
wrong and then you'll understand okay I
don't have to do this thing because I
get scoldings when I do this thing all
right as you can appreciate your kid
when he does a good thing right so
you'll understand okay I was appreciate
it for this so maybe this is the
behavior which is expected from me so
this is what reinforcement learning is
right so guys are we clear with what
supervised unsupervised and
reinforcement learning is any doubts in
any of these three learning techniques
which are there in machine learning ok
I've got a question from Anita so Anita
is asking me can you give me one more
example for reinforcement learning ok ok
so consider this so you have a
temperature control system in your at
home right now that temperature control
system has to decide whether I should
lower the temperature but I should
increase it all right so this is an
application which actually uses
reinforce learning because it has to
make a decision now so whenever there is
a decision that has to be made you use
reinforcement learning now how will it
decide whether it will increase the
temperature decrease the temperature it
will decide based on its past
experiences right so it's C what what
what what is basically the user or how a
user responds to a certain temperature
all right and then it will come up with
a decision okay so if my temperature is
cuddy to right now
maybe I need to lower it down maybe I
need to lower it down to 30 right so
this is just an example there are a lot
of parameters that are taking place how
many people are there in the room and
everything but then this is how the
algorithm works when it takes decision
based on its past experiences right so
if you go by the definition so
reinforcement learning was actually
inspired by the human behavior or the
rat behavior when it is there in the
maze right so when I ratted there in
maze it has to decide whether it should
stop we should go left or right right so
that is what this recording has been
inspired from any more doubts guys any
more doubts and supervised unsupervised
and being forcement learning okay so
I've got confirmation from the most of
you since most of you are clear let's
move on to the next topic we now know
different ways a machine can learn right
now let's discuss how you actually can
solve a problem using machine learning
all right so now a problem comes up to
you now how would you decide or how will
you start with that problem
so let's shed a light on that so
whenever there is a problem that cap
problem can be categorized in five ways
so those five ways are like this is this
a or b is this view how much or how many
how is this organized and what should I
do next so your problem can would want
an answer but which could be is this a
or b as in your view you have a problem
which is asking say you are
differentiating between fruit is this an
apple or is this a banana all right so
when you have these kind of problems you
use classification algorithms the next
category is is this view analyze
patterns all right so when you have
problem wherein you have to analyze plot
and where and you have to find in an LOC
anomaly or an odd one out you actually
go for anomaly detection algorithms all
right the next category is how much or
how many so then you have to deal with
numbers right so when you want some
numeric values you want to get a certain
value or for example what should be the
minimum number of hours that you should
put in so that you get promotion all
right so when you have these kind of
problems
so you apply your exertion algorithms on
to that then we have how is this
organized all right so when you have
these kind of questions you use
clustering algorithms because basically
you are trying to find out what is the
structure behind certain data set right
so when you are trying to know this
structure behind a certain problem you
use clustering algorithms and then you
have a category which says what should I
do next so well a decision has to be
made then algorithms for reinforcement
learning are used all right so guys any
doubts in any of these five categories
that we have just discussed so basically
what I'm trying to tell you is that each
question so any kind
problem that you come up with can we
categorize under these five categories
right it cannot be beyond these five
categories it will definitely come up in
these five categories and then you can
relate to a category and then come up
with the algorithm so when you have a
set number of outputs you use
classification algorithms all right so
it works like that so any doubt and
whatever we have discussed so far
okay that since most of you are now
clear alright so let's move on to the
next topic so they've discussed so when
we have these kind of problems we come
up we can solve this using these little
columns right so let's learn about these
algorithms now that is classification
anomaly detection regression clustering
and reinforcement so that's it
so let's shed a light on that so let's
start with algorithms machine learning
algorithms so the first algorithm is the
classification algorithm so like I said
when you have a set number of outputs so
basically for questions like this so is
it cold outside today so it's the answer
will be either yes or no so you have
only two outputs the outputs could be
either yes
but the output could be known all right
or the next kind of question to be will
you go to work today
so it's either a yes no or maybe right
so you will either go for work or you'll
not go for work or you maybe you say
maybe I'll go to work right but there is
no other on service can come up right so
when you have these kind of conditions
you come up with you solve it using
classification algorithms now when you
have two outputs like for example yes or
no it is called two class classification
but when you have more than two choices
as in in a second question we have yes
no or maybe right so this is called
multi-class classification so whenever
there is an output which is set as in it
is either true or false or 0 1 or yes/no
whatever right so if it's fixed you use
classification algorithms this is
basically the gist that you should get
out of this any doubts
and any doubt and whatever we have
discussed ok so let's move on to our
second algorithm now which is the
anomaly anomaly detection algorithms so
in these another you analyze a certain
pattern and you you get alerted whenever
there's an anomaly or something which is
not usual which happens all right for
example if as you can see in the figure
that you have apart when you have some
blue men right and then 7
a red kind of person comes up so this
algorithm will actually flag that person
because he breaks the pattern he is
something which is not expected right
and he becomes an anomaly and this is
what anomaly detection accordions are
all about now what is the use case for
anomaly detection algorithms it could be
for example in credit card companies so
in credit card companies each
transaction of yours is monitored right
and whenever there is a transaction
which is not usual right which doesn't
match your daily transaction pattern you
get alerted for it so they might confirm
with you whether you only made this
transaction all right so when you have
these kind of problems you use anomaly
detection algorithms to solve them the
third algorithm is regression algorithms
so like I said whenever you have to come
up with the value right so you use
regression algorithms so for example
what will be that be the temperature for
tomorrow right so whatever value will
come out of this will be a number right
so let's say I came up with 28 degree
Celsius so I got that temperature using
some formulas right and I came up with
that noumic value so whenever I am come
up with a numeric kind of value of
whenever my problem demands that I have
to get a mathematical value I go with
regression algorithms so the second
example for this could be whenever I
want to give a discount to my customer
now how much discount should I give that
customer so that I get more customer and
at the same time I do not go and loss as
well right I stay in profit so whenever
this kind of problem comes up I can go
on and use a regression algorithm and
solve this kind of problem all right
moving ahead
we have clustering algorithms so
clustering algorithms are basically used
so we discussed unsupervised learning
remember so an unsupervised learning we
have clustering algorithms wherein we
try to establish a structure right so we
have some unstructured data that you
want to make sense of so what we do is
we power
through a clustering algorithm and if
there is a pattern which we are
computing and see it comes up with that
pattern and shows us like this so for
example I feed data to my computer right
and my data then applies crashing
algorithm onto that so this is the kind
of output that I will get so it will
categorize it and the Group a group B
and Group C and then I can make a
decision whether what what I can what I
want to do with this data that I've got
all right if this computer doesn't
understand anything what this data is
all about it doesn't understand maybe
it's of cause maybe it's of food
maybe it's of money right so the
computer doesn't understand but what
computer understands is numbers right
and that is how it relates it to each
another and comes up with groups now
when it comes up with groups maybe you
you want to use some other I will call
it amount to it and decide or come up
with the solution but this is what a
clustering algorithm will give you right
having said that let's move on to the
next algorithm now which is
reinforcement to regard them all right
so we discussed reinforcement learning
so that is what reinforcement Gorgons
are all about whenever you have to make
a decision right and so whenever you
have to make a decision and your
decision is based on the past
experiences of your machine or whatever
inputs that you have given to your
machine you use reinforcement learning
now for example whenever you go you
wanted to train your computer how to
play chess it is usually enforcement
learning and when it has learnt or when
you have created a model for that and
your game is actually being played by
the computer each decision that the
computer makes is also based or is also
taken from reinforcement learning the
other example like A to Z was of a
temperature control system where in your
system had to decide that I should
increase the temperature or it should
decrease the temperature right so
whenever these kind of problems are
there right you use reinforcement
learning or reinforcement algorithms ok
guys so this brings us to the end of
machine learning algorithm so we have
basically covered the basics which are
there we have covered the base
software algorithms which I use in
machine learning so now if I give you a
problem you should be able to identify
which algorithm will fit into this
problem right what each algorithm is all
about how many algorithms are there we
discussed that in our later class but
for now for today you should understand
if I had this problem okay so if I had
this kind of problem I should apply this
algorithm to it how will I apply this
algorithm we'll be discussing that in
the later class but this is the idea
that you should get today this is step
one if you are through with step one it
becomes very easy because now just what
learning about what each algorithm does
but this is the concept behind machine
learning this is the concept that should
be set in your mind that whenever this
kind of problem comes up okay so I have
to find a structure behind this problem
okay I use flushing algorithms okay so I
have solutions to this kind of problem
okay you supervised learning and I will
be using algorithms in supervised
learning for this right so I have a
fixed number of outputs for this I'll
use classification algorithm for that
all right so this is the basic
understanding that you should get from
this session today all right so enough
of theory guys so we are now understood
the concept behind machine learning now
let's see first of all you guys won't be
knowing how the inputs are actually
given to a system to create a model
right so these inputs are actually
called
data sets right so now what we'll be
doing is we will be seeing how we can
prepare a data set to actually create a
model and then also verifying that model
whether that model is predicting right
or wrong right so let's take a sample
data set so basically what if we will be
doing our machine learning
demonstrations in us so I expect you
guys to download our studio and the our
language in the next class because the
next class will also have a lot of demos
for today you can just see how we are
doing right now and later you will have
the code in your LMS you can use that
code and execute it and like be ready in
the next class because the next class is
going to be a lot of demo right but
today our time
raishin what we're going to do is so
this is guys the input that it gets so
these these are the values this is a
data set which is called empty cuz it's
a sample data set in our right so
whenever you have to create a model you
basically divide your data set because
you have to validate that mortar at a
later stage as well so you divide your
data set between the training part and
the testing part so the training part is
used to create a model and a testing
part will be used to actually verify
that model all right
now how you can divide the data set is
what I'm going to tell you in a few
moments
but is this clear to you guys why are we
dividing the data set we are dividing
the dataset because first we will create
a model so for creating a model the
computer should be fed some values right
so when it will be fed some values it
can make sense out of it and it will
come up with a model now this model can
be used to predict values right but how
will we verify whether it is predicting
correct values or not so for that we
have the testing data set so we picking
up some values from the testing there is
it peering in the values and we see
whether it is producing the correct
output or not all right I will clear
with our problem statement alright guys
so let's begin our demonstration then so
this is your all console guys what
you'll be doing is first you write this
command which says data empty cars so
what this basically will do is it will
import the sample data set called empty
cars all right so I've got a variable
now which is empty calls so let's let me
show you this data set so this is how my
data is like so basically these are the
car names
so there are name of the car and then
there are some values associated with
that car for example this is the
displacement of the car this is the
weight of the car and based on the
weight and displacement and the
horsepower and the other values you have
these two values which is whether it has
a V kind of engine or whether it has a
straight engine
all right so if Hat has a V engine it
will be a 1 if it has a straight engine
it will be a 0
all right so some values might indicate
that it can have a V engine as well as a
straight engine as well but with today
what we are going to do is we are going
to predict basically we will be taking
in two values will be taking WT that is
the weight of the car and we'll be
taking D is P that is the displacement
of the car and then we will be
predicting whether this car will have a
V engine or a straight engine so we'll
be creating a model in the later part
that of today's demonstration but for
now we have to divide this data set
between the training data set and the
testing data set so let's see how will
we do that
so first of all we have to import a
library called CA tools
all right so we'll improve that library
so it is set all right so now I will
write split I will define a variable
called split and then I write sample dot
split and now I will enter the data set
which is empty calls and then I was
precipitous Plitt ratio equal to now I
want my training data set to be 70% of
that data set and my testing gate is
said to be 30% all right so I'll specify
point seven which specifies 70% right so
basically what I am specifying here is
that I want to split my data set empty
calls in to 70/30 ratio right so let's
run this command all right this command
is front all right so now I will run
this particular variable I will execute
this particular task so it has now been
executed so what basically has now
happened is it has picked out random
values right and for each value it has
assigned either a 2 or a false right so
70% of the data set has true is true and
30% a data set is false
now we will be leveraging that and will
be deciding our training and testing
data set based on that so training data
set is equal to
subset of empty cars where split is
equal to equal to true all right so
basically what I have specified here is
my training dataset will be a subset of
empty cars where the split is true right
so my true is 70% of the data percent
right remember so now we'll be executing
this so I executed it and similarly for
testing I will specify that the split is
false right so I'll write falls over
here and then I will execute the
statement all right so let's check
whether we have glittered our data set
or not let's check the testing data set
so as you can actually see from here
that testing has around 12 observations
and training has around 20 observations
now so the data set has been splitted
our empty cars had traded two
observations we have splitted in 70/30
ratio so our training gear set has now
20 observations that are 20 rows and a
testing data set has 12 observations all
right so let me show you my testing data
set now so as you can see this is my
testing data set
this was the whole data set that is this
this is the whole of empty cars and this
is the data set that has been divided
now so my testing data set is 30 percent
of this and it has these many values all
right
so now will be we have splitted our data
set now let's now create a model all
right so the creation of the model model
is same for each and every algorithm
just the command changes so let me apply
a regression algorithm right now it's
called logistic regression right so what
royczyk regression does is it comes up
with a value right and with that value
you decide whether it will be a 1 or a 0
so my logistic regression actually you
might ask a question to me that ok so
this kind of prop
we have to decide it should be either
one or a zero so it's a classification
probe through guys but behind that
classification we are actually
calculating probabilities right so we
are actually coming up with the number
right so whenever you are coming up with
the number we use regression algorithms
but when you talk about logistic
regression logistic regression actually
comes under the classified as
classification algorithms as well and
the regression algorithms as well right
so we'll be applying logistic regression
and the logistic regression will then
give me a probability of as and when I
given the values WT that is the weight
of the car in the displacement of the
car it will give me a probability
whether this car will have a vs engine
what is the probability of this car
having a PS engine right so this is the
probability that I get and this is the
model that I will be creating right now
so let me give clear my console all
right so for creating a model you have
to type command which is like this so it
is type in model all right and for
logistic regression the command is GLM
and then you will be giving the formula
so the formula is we have to predict PS
right we have to predict what is the
value of years will it be a 1 or a 0 so
we will say BS tilt this means vs WT
plus D is P right so I want to take into
account the weight of the car and the
displacement of the car and I want to
predict when the weight of the car is WT
and the displacement of the car is d is
P what will be the value of U this is
the formula that I want my model to
predict all right now now I'll be
specifying bits data set this model has
to be applied on so since I have
splitted my data set so I want it to be
applied on training and then I have to
specify the family of the model so
basically it's a 1 or a 0 right the
values the answer that the vs value is
in 1 or 0 right so the family
is binomial so this is what you will be
specifying right so let's execute this
particular statement now we click on run
all right so my model has now been
created let's so let me show you the
summary of the modular all right so as
you can see I have came up with the
model and it has given me some
coefficient values which has been
calculated now what are these
coefficient values don't worry I Tao I
will be explaining this in the next
class but for now what you have to
understand is what I am trying to make
you guys understand is that we are
coming up with numbers right so we are
not doing any clustering we are not
doing any decision making we are coming
up with numbers and that is the reason
we use a regression algorithm now
further as you will see in the next step
I will be predicting a value which will
be the probability of the car having a
VA census all right and then I will
teach you how you can actually classify
that problem as a 1 or 0 all right
so hang on so now what we'll be doing is
we have a model right and this is our
testing data set so as you can see these
are the values that we are going to
predict right now so what we'll be doing
now is we will actually be feeding the
WT and the ISP of this testing data set
and mind you guys our model has been
created from the testing data set all
right so from the training data set so
we have not so our model has not
encountered the testing data set as of
now so these are basically like real
values to a model right so now we'll be
predicting so let's take an example car
air so let's take Fort Pantera and
predict whether this car will have a V s
engine or a straight engine right so
let's feed in the values of that so
we'll be creating a data frame first so
we'll be feeding our values in the data
variable derive rod frame and then with
the WT value is so for fault Pantera l
the WT value
three point one seven zero so let's fit
in that point one seven zero and the D
is p-value is 351 so let's read in that
as well so we have fed the values
now let's predict it so we'll be
predicting our answer in this variable
so the command for predicting is predict
model there is a model that you have to
predict from the data the data which has
the values and type of answer that is
response so I want a response now what
I'll be getting from this is a
probability write the probability of
this car having a vyas engine now if the
probability is less than 0.5 that means
that the probability is that that means
that it will not have a reason and the
odds of it having a vs engine becomes
very less and hence we will consider it
as apposed but if it is greater than 0.5
that means the odds of having that of
the car having vs engine becomes more
right so we will consider that that car
will have a vyas engine if its value if
its probability value is greater than
0.5 so having said that let's execute
the statement and then let's print the
answer for Pantera l we predicted that
the vyas probability the probability of
that car having vs engine is point zero
zero seven let's compare whether our 420
Rahel has a vs engine so as you can see
there is zero over here that means that
four doesn't have a vs engine so if it
doesn't have a vs engine it has a
straight engine and we have predicted it
right our value is correct having said
that let's predict one more value for a
car which has a vyas kind of engine so
let's pick a car from here let's take
this car which is Toyota Corona all
right so let's feed in values for Toyota
Corona so for Toyota Corona our
displacement is 120 point 1
let us read that one 20.1 and my weight
is two point four six five so let's feed
in that as well
let's predict the value now so as you
can see the probability of Corona having
a vias engine is 0.7 seven all right so
it has a 77% probability of it having a
via signal let's check whether it has a
vs engine so yes it has a vs engine and
hence our model predicted that right
value all right guys so we created a
model which can predict values now so
you can feed in any displacement and any
bait and this model will tell you
whether that car should have a V s
engine or a straightener right so this
brings us to the end of our session guys
so before that do you have any doubt in
the demo that we did right now any
doubts and I will explain it right away
all right so Anita has a question she is
asking me she understands this is a
regression algorithm but why is it a
classification algorithm also okay so
another as I told you that regression
algorithms are basically compute values
all right you are calculating
probability here but based on this
probability you are actually classifying
okay let me show you how this will
happen just wait a second
okay now so let me type in this you so
if you type in this command and you
specify it that if it's greater than 0.5
specify it as true all right
so add this specify greater than 0.5 and
then let's check what will be our answer
right now
so it says true so now you have
specified that for this value which is
77% if it's greater than 0.5 as its true
so basically you are now classifying
that this car that Toyota Corona I will
have a BS engine alright now if you were
to do that for Ford Pantera L let me do
that for you
also so basically I just have to change
the
values so that is 351 for this spaceman
- 351 and weight is three point one
seven zero all right so let's predict
the value again all right so now it says
false right so you have classified V s
as true or false so true is when it will
have a v8 engine and false as well it
will not have a PS engine right so you
regressed to probability and based on
that probability you classified and that
is the reason you call this particular
column that is logisitics record them as
a classification algorithm as well as a
regression algorithm as well all right
does that make it clear to you later or
any more question there is anything that
you want to understand
all right so Tracy says nice tension
