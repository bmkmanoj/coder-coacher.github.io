scientists that I was talking about
different depending on which component
you are expectation the type of role
that you may get may be quite slightly
different okay
Shashank says for data visualization
which tools do you think one can get
exposure to there are multiple of them
like R itself has lot of plotting and
charting capabilities and there are
newer things like tableau which can do
better visualizations and are now
exactly like Adonis's tableau is used
very popularly in ODIs
okay Niranjan says predictive analysis
versus machine learning I think it is
overlapping where is the difference can
you please explain a very good question
as you said predictive analysis and
machine learning are overlapping and I
would even say there subset essentially
so predictive analysis is just a one
branch of machine learning technique
okay and there are other classes of
machine learning techniques around let's
say clustering and other things which
are which do not form predictive model
okay so predictive modeling or
predictive analysis is a subset of
machine learning techniques yes and rner
puts it in our another way which is
absolutely right is machine learning
helps to do predictive analytics
okay this is again different roles and
the focus of those roles okay like if I
am a data researcher for example the
focus of my work would be primarily on
doing machine learning and starter
States and necessary math behind it
whereas if I am a business person if I'm
a data business person I'd be spending
more time on the business aspects of it
which is probably dealing with a lot of
domain expertise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
