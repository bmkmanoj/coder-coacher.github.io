Rekha and today we'll be learning what
is ansible thank you all the attendees
for joining today's session so let's get
started with it first let us look at the
topics that we'll be learning today well
it's quite a long list it means you'll
be learning a lot of things today let us
take a look at them one by one the first
we'll see the problems that we're before
configuration management and how
configuration management helps to solve
it
we'll see what ansible is and the
different features of ansible after that
we'll see how nasa is implemented
ansible
to solve all their problems after that
we'll see how we can use ansible for
orchestration provisioning configuration
management application deployment and
security and in the end we'll write some
ansible playbooks
to install and stack on my node machine
and host a website in my node machine so
guys I hope that you're all clear with
today's agenda so give me a quick
confirmation on the chat window so that
we can get started okay I've got a yes
from Harsha's Ana bhikshus Tao Mahesh
and I've got a few more yeses too so we
are always ready to get started now
before I tell you about the problems let
us first understand what configuration
management actually is well
configuration management is actually the
management of your software on top of
your hardware what it does is that it
maintains the consistency of your
product based on its requirements its
design and its physical and functional
attributes now how does it maintain the
consistency it is because the
configuration management is applied over
the entire lifecycle of your system and
hence it provides you with a very good
visibility and control when I said
visibility it means that you can
continuously check and monitor the
performances of all your systems so at
any time the performance of any of your
system is degrading the configuration
management system will notify you and
hence you can prevent errors before it
actually
and by control I mean that you have the
power to change anything if any of your
servers fade you can reconfigure it
again to repair it so that it is up and
running again or you can even replace
the server if needed and also the
configuration management system holds
the entire historical data of your
infrastructure it documents all the
snapshots of every version of your
infrastructure so over all the
configuration management process
facilitates the orderly management of
your system information and system
changes so that it can use it for
beneficial purposes ok I've got a
question from Harshit he asked that what
do you mean by snapshots and where does
configuration management actually stored
these snapshots
well hurshe that's a very brilliant
question thank you for asking when I
said it documents the snapshot it means
that it records the configuration
details which are nothing but data
descriptions of the overall state of
your system at a particular time and
where does it store all the snapshots
while configuration management system
has their own repository which is known
as we CMDB or it's called the
configuration management database so
this is where all the configuration
details get stored so we'll be seeing
how configuration management tool will
actually interact with the configuration
management database later in this
tutorial
so be explaining more about it but I
hope that you caught your answer now her
ship give me a quick confirmation on the
chat window ok say it's got it so hope
that the others have understood this as
well so let us proceed to the next topic
and see the problems before
configuration management and how
configuration management solved it and
with that we'll understand more about
configuration management as well so
let's see now why do we need
configuration management now the
necessaries behind configuration
management was dependent upon a certain
number of factors and certain number of
reasons so let us take a look at them
one by one so the first problem was
managing multiple servers now earlier
every system was managed by hand
and by that I mean that you have to
login to them via SD such make changes
and then log off again now imagine if
the system administrator would have to
make changes and most of the number of
servers you'll have to do this task of
logging in making changes and long
enough again and again repeatedly so
this would take up a lot of time and
there is no time left for the system
administrators to monitor the
performances of the system continuously
safe at any time any of the servers
would fail it took a lot of time people
detect the faulty server and took even
more time to repair it because the
configuration scripts that they wrote
was very complex and it was very hard to
make changes on to them after
configuration management system came
into the picture what it did is that it
divided all the systems in my
infrastructure according to their
dedicated task their design or
architecture and the organized mess
system in an efficient way
like I've grouped my web servers
together my database servers together
application servers together and this
process is known as baselining
now let's for an example say that I
wanted to install lamb stack in my
system and lamp stack is a software
bundle where L stands for Linux a for
Apache M for MySQL and P for PHP so I
need this different software's for
different purposes like I need Apache
server to host my web pages
I need PHP for my web development I need
Linux as my operating system and MySQL
as my data definition language or data
manipulation language since now all the
systems in my infrastructure is baseline
I would know exactly where to install
each of the software's for example I'll
use Apache as my web server here for
database I will install the MySQL here
and also began easy for me to monitor my
entire system for example if my web
pages are not running I would know that
there is something wrong with my web
servers so I'll go check in here I don't
have to check the database servers and
application servers for that similarly
if I'm not able to insert data or
extract data from my database I will
know that something is wrong with my
database servers
I don't need to check these two for that
matter so what configuration management
system did with baselining is that an
organized mess system in an efficient
way so that I can manage and monitor all
my servers efficiently so guys I hope
you've understood this if you have any
questions you can always pop it in the
chat window and anytime now let us see
the second problem that we had which was
scaling up and scaling down see nowadays
you can come up with requirements at any
time and you might have to scale up or
scale down your systems on the fly and
this is something that you cannot always
plan ahead and scaling up your
infrastructure doesn't always mean that
you just buy new hardware and displace
them anywhere happily you cannot do that
you also need to provision and configure
these new machines properly so with
configuration management system
I've already got my infrastructure
baseline final exactly how these new
machines are going to work according to
their dedicated task and where should I
actually place them and the scripts that
configuration management uses are
reusable so you can use the same scripts
that you use to configure your older
machines to configure your new machines
as well let me explain it to you with an
example let me explain it to you with an
example let's say that if you're working
in an e-commerce website and they decide
to hold a mega sale a new your Christmas
sale or anything so it's obvious that
there is going to be a huge rise in the
traffic so you might need more web
servers to handle that amount of
requests and you might even need a load
balancers or maybe to to distribute that
amount of traffic onto your web servers
and these changes however need to be
made at a very short span of time so
after you've got the necessary hardware
you also need to provision them
accordingly
and with configuration management you
can easily provision these new machines
using either recipes or play books or
any kind of script that configuration
management uses and also after the sale
is over you don't need that many web
servers or load balancer so you can
disable them using the same easy scripts
as well and also scaling down it's very
important when you're you
in cloud services when you do not need
any of those machines it's no point in
keeping them so you have to scale down
as well because you have to reconfigure
your entire infrastructure as well and
with configuration management it is a
very easy thing to auto scale up and
scale down your infrastructure so I
think you all have understood this
problem and how configuration management
solves it so let us take a look at the
third problem the third problem was the
work velocity of the developers were
affected because the system
administrators were taking time to
configure the server's after the
developers have written a code the next
job is to deploy them on different
servers like test servers and production
servers for testing it out and releasing
it
but then again every server was managed
by hand before so the system
administrators again have to do the same
thing log into each server configure
them properly by making changes and do
the same thing again to all servers so
this was taking a lot of time now before
DevOps came is a picture there was
already agility in the developer's end
for which they were able to release new
softwares very frequently but it was
taking a lot of time for the system
administrators to configure the servers
for testing the developers would have to
wait for all the test results and this
highly hampered the work velocity of the
developers but after there was
configuration management the system
administrator had got access to a
configuration management tool which
allowed them to configure all the
servers at one go all they had to do is
write down all the configurations and
write down the list of all the
software's that they need to provision
the servers and deploy it on all of the
servers at one go so now agility even
came in to the system administrators and
as well so now after configuration
management the developers and the system
administrators were finally able to work
in the same pace now this is how
configuration management solves the
third problem now let us take a look at
the last problem now the last problem
was rolling back and today's scenario
everyone wants to change and you need to
keep making changes frequently because
customers will start losing interest if
things stay the same
so you need to keep releasing new
features to upgrade your application
even giants like Amazon and Facebook
they do it now and then and still they
are unsure if the users are going to
like it or not now imagine if the users
did not like it they would have to roll
back to the previous version again let's
see how it creates a problem now before
there was configuration management let's
say you've got the old version which is
the version 1 when you're upgrading it
you're changing all the configurations
in the production server you're deleting
the old configurations completely and
deploying the new version now if the
users did not like it
you would have to reconfigure this
server again with the old configurations
and that will take up a lot of time your
application is going to be down for that
amount of time that you need for
reconfiguring the server and this might
create a problem but when you're using
configuration management system as we
know that it documents every version of
your infrastructure when you're
upgrading it with configuration
management it will remove the
configurations of the older version but
it will be well-documented it will be
kept there and then the newer version is
deployed now if the users did not like
it this time the older of configuration
version was already documented so all
you have to do is just switch back to
the old version and this won't take up
any time and you can upgrade or rollback
your application in zero downtime zero
downtime means that your application
would be down for zero time it means
that the users will not notice that your
application went down and you can
achieve it seamlessly and this is how
configuration management system solves
all the problems that works before so
guys I hope that if all understood how
configuration management did that if you
have any questions you can pop it in the
chat window let us now move on to the
next topic now the question is how do I
incorporate configuration management in
my system well you do that using
configuration management tools let us
take a look at all the available
configuration management tools so here
I've got the four most popular tools
that is available in the market right
now
I've got ansible and foul stack which
are push based configuration management
tool by push-based I mean that you can
directly push all those configurations
on to your node machines directly while
chef and puppet are both full based
configuration management tools it means
that they rely on a central server for
configurations they pull all the
configuration from a central server
there are other configuration management
tools available in the market too but
but before are the most popular ones
so now let's know more about ansible now
ansible is a configuration management
tool that can be used for provisioning
orchestration application deployment
automation and it's a push based
configuration management tool like I
told you what it does is that it
automates your entire IT infrastructure
and gives you large productivity gains
and it can automate pretty much anything
it can automate your cloud your network
your servers and all your IT processes
ok I've got a question from Dikshit up
what does automation exactly mean it's a
very good question Vic sure thank you so
much well you can think of automation as
a solution for turning your
infrastructure administration into a
code base and it described all the
processes necessary for deploying a
server in a set of provisioning scripts
that can be reused again well an easy
word stick shift our automation is just
writing a script about how and what you
want all your systems to do and don't
worry we've been learning how to write
the scripts and ansible they're called
answer the playbooks and we'll be
learning that later in this tutorial
so this r is clear with what
automation is give me a quick
confirmation on the chat window so that
I can proceed ok she says yes so let us
move on to the next topic so now let us
see the features of ansible the first
feature is that it's very simple it's
simple to install and setup and it's
very easy to learn because ansible
playbooks are written in a very simple
data serialization language which is
known as Gamal and it's pretty much like
English so
anyone can understand that and it's very
easy to learn next feature because of
which ansible is preferred over other
configuration management tools is
because it's agentless
it means that you do not need any kind
of agents or any kind of client
softwares to manage your node machines
all you have to do is install an sigil
in your control machine and just make an
SSH connection with your nodes and start
pushing configurations right away the
next feature is that it's very powerful
even though you call ansible simple and
it does not require any agent it has the
capabilities to model very complex IT
workflows and it comes with a very
interesting feature which is called the
batteries included it means that you've
got everything that you already need and
in ansible it's because it comes with
more than 750 inbuilt modules which you
can use them for any purpose in your
project and it's very efficient because
all the modules that ansible comes with
they are extensible it means that you
can customize them according to your
needs and for doing that it do not need
to use the same programming language
that it was originally written in you
can choose any kind of programming
language that you're comfortable with
and then customize those modules for
your own use this is the power and
liberty that ansible gives you so hope
guys that is all understood the features
these are pretty simple so moving on to
the next topic and if you have any
questions you may ask me anytime on the
chat window now let us take a look at
the case study of NASA what were the
problems that NASA was facing and how
ansible solved all those problems now
NASA is an organization that has been
sending men to the moon they are
carrying out missions and Mars and
they're launching satellites now and
then to monitor the earth and not just
the earth they are even monitoring other
galaxies and other planets as well so
you can imagine the kind and the amount
of data that NASA might be dealing with
but all the applications were in a
traditional hardware based data center
and they wanted to move into a
cloud-based environment
because they wanted better agility and
they wanted better adaptive planning for
that and also they wanted to save costs
because a lot of money was spent on just
the maintenance of the hardware and also
they wanted more security because NASA
is a government organization of the
United States of America and obviously
they wanted more security because NASA
is a government organization of the
United States of America and hold a lot
of confidential details as well for the
government so they just cannot always
rely on the hardware to store all these
confidential files they needed more
security because if at any time the
hardware fails they cannot afford to
lose that data and that is why they
wanted to move all their 65 applications
from a hardware environment to a
cloud-based environment now let us take
a look what was the problem now for this
migration of all the data into a cloud
environment they contacted a company
called in frozen now in frozen is a
company who is a cloud broker and
integrator who implement solutions to
meet needs with security so incident was
responsible for making this transition
and now if I wanted to make this
transition in a very short span of time
so all the applications were migrated as
it is into the cloud environment and
because of this all the AWS accounts and
all the virtual private clouds that was
previously defined
they all got accumulated in a single
data space and this made of a huge chunk
of data and NASA had no way of centrally
managing it and even simple tasks like
giving a particular system administrator
access rights to a particular account
this became a very tedious job well NASA
wanted to automate end to end deployment
of all their apps and for that they
needed a management system so this was
the situation when NASA moved into the
cloud so you can see that all those AWS
accounts and virtual private clouds
they've got accumulated and made a huge
chunk of data and everyone was accepting
directly to it so there is a problem in
managing the credentials for all the
users and the different teams but NASA
needed was divide up all their
inventories all their
into group and number of holes and also
they wanted to divide up all the users
into different teams and give each team
different credentials and permissions
and also if you look in the more
granular level each user in each team
could also have different credentials
and permissions let's say that you want
to give the team leader of a particular
team access to some kind of data but I
don't want the other users in the team
to access that data also NASA wanted to
define different credentials for each
individual member as well they wanted to
divide up all the data according to the
projects and jobs also now I wanted to
move from chaos into a more organized
manner and for that they adopted ansible
Tower now ansible tower is ansible in
more enterprise level ansible tower
provides you with the dashboard which
provides all the state of summary of all
the hosts and jobs now anthem of tower
is a web-based interface for managing
your organization it provides you with
they're very easy to use user interface
for managing quick deployments and
monitoring all the configurations let's
see what ansible tower did it has a
credential management system which could
give different access permission to each
individual user and teams and also
divided of the user into teams and
single individual users as well and it
has a job assignment system and you can
also assign jobs using ansible tower
it's supposed let's say that you have
assigned job one to a single user job to
another single user while job c would be
assigned to a particular team similarly
the whole invention was also managed all
the servers let's say dedicated to a
particular mission was grouped together
all the host machines and other systems
as well
sensible tower helped NASA to organize
everything now let us take a look at the
dashboard that ansible tower provides us
so this is the screenshot of the
dashboard at a very initial level you
can see right now there are 0 hosts
nothing is there but I'm just showing
you what ansible tower provides you so
on the top you can check all the users
and teams you can manage the credentials
from here you can check your different
project
and inventories you can make job
templates and shed you with jobs as well
so this is where you can schedule jobs
and provide every job with a particular
ID so that you can track it you can take
your job status here whether your job
was successful or failed
and since ansible tower is a
configuration management system it will
hold the historical data as well so you
can take the job statuses of the past
month or the month before that you can
check the whole status as well you can
check how many hosts are up and running
you can see the host count here so this
dashboard of ansible tower provides you
with so much ease of monitoring all your
systems so it's very easy to use ansible
tower dashboard anyone in your company
anyone can use it because it's very user
friendly
now let us see the results that NASA
achieved after it has used ansible Tower
now updating nasa.gov used to take one
hour of time and after using ansible it
got down to just five minutes security
patching updates we're a multi-day
process and now it requires only 45
minutes the provisioning of OS accounts
can be done in just 10 minutes earlier
the application stack up time required
one to two hours and now it's done in
only 10 minutes it also achieved near
real-time ram and disk monitoring and
baselining
all the standard Amazon machine images
this used to be a one hour manual
process and now you don't even need
manual interference for that it became a
background invisible process so you can
see that how ansible has drastically
changed the overall management system of
nasa so guys I hope that if understood
how ansible helped NASA if you have any
question you may ask me at any time on
the chat window let us proceed to the
next topic now this is all about how
others have use ansible so now let us
take a look at the ansible architecture
so that we can understand more about
ansible and decide how we can use
ansible
so this is the overall ansible
architecture I've got the ansible
automation engine and I've got the
inventory and a playbook inside the
automation engine I've got the
configuration management database here
and host so
Harshit that you're asking me about that
where does it store all the
configuration details this is stored in
this configuration management database
which could be in your cloud or it isn't
could be in your bare metal server and
this configuration management database
is a repository that acts as the data
warehouse for all your IT installations
it holds all the data relating to the
collection of your all IT assets and
these are commonly known as
configuration items and it also holds
the data which describe the
relationships between such assets so
this is a repository for all your
configuration management data and here
I've got the ansible automation engine
I've got the inventory and inventory is
nothing but the list of all the IP
addresses of all my host machines now as
I told you how to use configuration
management you use it with the
configuration management tool like
ansible but how do you use ansible well
you do that using playbook and playbook
describe the entire workflow of your
system inside play books have got
modules api's and plugins now modules
are the core files now play books
contain a set of place which are a set
of tasks and inside every task there is
a particular module so when you run a
playbook it's the modules that actually
get executed on all your node machines
the models are the core files and like I
told you before ansible
already comes with inbuilt modules which
you can use and you can also customize
them as well it comes with a different
cloud module database modules and don't
worry I'll be showing you how to use
those modules in ansible and there are
different API is as well well API is and
ansible are not meant for direct
consumption they're just there to
support the command line tools for
example they have the Python API and
these API is can also be used as a
transport for cloud services whether
it's public or private you can use it
then ascott plugins now plugins are a
special kind of module that allow to
execute ansible tasks as a job build
step and plugin for pieces of code that
argument the ansible core functionality
and ansible also comes with a number of
handy plugins that you can use for
example you have action plugins cash
plugins callback plugins and also you
can create plugins of your own as well
let me tell you how exactly different it
is from a module let me give you the
example of action plug-in now I can plug
in our front-end modules and what it
does is that when you start running a
playbook something needs to be done on
the control machine as well so this
action plugins trigger those action and
execute those tasks in the controller
machine before calling the actual
modules that are getting executed in the
playbook and also you have a special
kind of plugin called the connection
plug-in which allows you to connect to
the docker containers in your node
machine and many more and finally have
this host machine that is connected via
SSH and these host machines could be
either Windows or Linux or any kind of
machines and also let me tell you that
it's not always needed to use as I said
for connection you can use any kind of
network authentication protocol you can
use Kerberos and also you can use the
connection plugins as well so this is
fairly a very simple ansible
architecture so guys I hope you have all
understood give me a quick confirmation
on the chat window it says yes big
out her okay so now that you've
understood the architecture let us write
a playbook now now let me tell you how
to write a play book and playbooks and
ansible are simple files written in
Yambol code and yeah mo is a data
serialization language you can think of
data serialization language as a
translator for breaking down all your
data structure and serialize them in a
particular order which can be
reconstructed again for later use and
you can use this reconstructed data
structure in the same environment or
even in a different environment so this
is a control machine where ansible will
be installed and this is where you'll be
writing your playbooks let me show you
the structure of how to write a playbook
now every playbook starts with three
dashes on the top the first thing have
to mention the list of all your host
machines here it means where do you want
this playbook to run then you can
mention very
by gathering facts then you can mention
the different tasks that you want now
remember that the past get executed in
the same order that you write them for
example you want to install software a
first and then softer beef later on to
make sure that the first task would be
install software and the next house
could be install software B and then
I've got handlers at the bottom the
handles are also tasks but the
difference is in order to execute
handlers you need some sort of triggers
in the list of tasks for example we use
notify I'll show you an example now ok
let me show you an example of playbook
so that you can relate to this structure
so this is an example of an ansible
playbook to install Apache like a
tolling starts with three dashes on the
top remember that every list starts with
a dash in the front or a hyphen here are
only mentioned just the name of one
group you can mention the name of
several groups where you want to run
your PlayBook then I've got the tasks
you give a name for the task which is
install Apache and then you use a module
Here I am using the apt module to
download the package so this is the
syntax of writing the apt module to give
the name of the package which is Apache
to update cache is equal to yes it means
that it'll make sure that apt-get is
already updated in your node machine
before it installs the Apache - and in
mentioned state equal to latest it means
that it will download the latest version
of Apache - and this is the trigger
because I'm using Handler is here right
and the handler here is to restart
Apache and I'm using the service module
here and the name of the software that I
want to restart is Apache - and state is
equal to restart it then notifies
mentioned that there is going to be a
handler whose job would be to restart
Apache - and then the tasks in the
handler would get executed and we to
restart Apache - so this is a simple
playbook and we'll also be writing
similar kind of play books later on the
hands-on part so you'll be learning
again so if it's looking a little
gibberish for you will be doing on that
on the hands-on part so then it will
clear all your doubts
so now let us see how to use ansible and
understand its applications so we can
use ansible for application deployment
configuration management security and
compliance provisioning and
orchestrations let us take a look at
them one by one first let us see how we
can use ansible for orchestration ok
I've got a question from Mahesh what is
orchestration well orchestration means
well Mahesh let's say that we have
defined configurations for each of my
systems but I also need to make sure how
this configurations will interact with
each other so this is the process of
orchestration where I decide that how
the different configurations on
different of my systems and my
infrastructure would interact with each
other in order to maintain a seamless
flow of my application and your
application deployments need to be
orchestrated because you've got a
front-end and back-end services you've
got databases
you've got monitoring networks and
storage and each of them has their own
role to play with with their
configuration and deployment and you
cannot just run all of them as ones and
expect that the right thing happens so
what you need is that you need an
orchestration tool that all these tasks
happen in the proper order that the
database is up before the backend server
and the front-end server is removed from
the load balancer before it gets
upgraded and that your networks would
have their proper VLANs configured so
this is what ansible helps you to do so
make sure to understand what
orchestration exactly is ok he says yes
ok so let me give you a simple example
so that you can understand it better
let's say that I want to host a website
on my node machines and this is
precisely what we're going to do later
on the hands-on part so first and in
order to do that first I have to install
the necessary software which is the lamp
stack and after that I have to deploy
all the HTML and PHP files on the web
server and after that I'll be gathering
some kind of information from my web
pages that will go inside my database
server now if you want to perform these
out
you have to make sure that the necessary
software that installs the first I
cannot deploy the HTM and PSD files on
the web servers if I don't have the web
servers if a party is not installed so
this is orchestration where you
mentioned that the task that needs to be
carried out before and the task that
needs to be carried out later so this is
what ansible Play Books allow you to do
so Mahesh and everyone else I hope that
you've understood what orchestration is
to give me a quick confirmation on the
chat window so that we can move to the
second application okay I've got a few
yeses now let's see what provisioning is
like provisioning in English means to
provide with something that is needed it
is same in case of ansible it means that
ansible will make sure that all the
necessary softwares that they need for
your application to run is properly
installed in each of the environment of
your infrastructure let us take a look
at this example here to understand what
provisioning actually is nice I want to
provision a Python web application that
I'm hosting on Microsoft Azure and
Microsoft Azure is very similar to AWS
and it is also a gout platform on which
you can build up all your applications
so let's say so nice I want to host my
sis I'm developing a Python web
application for coding I would need the
Microsoft if your document database I
would mean Visual Studio we need to
install Python also and some kind of
software development kit and different
API for that so ansible
you can list out the name of all the
software development kits and all this
necessary software's that you will
require for coding this web that it
would require in order to develop your
web application so you can list out all
the necessary software's that you'd be
needing in an ansible playbook in order
to develop your web application and for
testing your code out you will again
need Microsoft reviewer document
database you would again this visual
studio and some kind of testing software
again you can list out all the
software's in ansible playbook and it
would provision your testing environment
as well and it's the same thing while
you're deploying it on the production
server as well ansible will provision
your entire application at all
stages at coding stage testing and at
the production stage also so guys I hope
you've understood what provisioning is
let us move on to the next topic and see
how we can attain configuration
management with ansible now ansible
configurations are simple data
descriptions of your infrastructure
which is both human readable and machine
possible and ansible requires nothing
more than an SSH key in order to start
managing systems and if you start
managing them without installing any
kind of agent or client software so you
can avoid the problem of managing the
management which is very common in
different automation systems for example
I've got my host machine and our party
web server is installing each of the
host machine I've also a PHP and MySQL
installed if I want to make
configuration changes if I want to
update a party and update my MySQL I can
do it directly I can push those new
configuration details directly onto my
host machines or my node machines and my
server and you can do it very easily
using ansible playbooks so guys are
clear about what is configuration
management with ansible if make with
confirmation on the chat window ok I've
got a few yeses from Mahesh and hard
 bitches are ok so let us move on to
the next topic let us see how
application deployment has been made
easier with ansible
now ansible is the simplest way to
deploy your applications it gives you
the power to deploy all your multi-tier
applications where reliably and
consistently and you can do it all from
a common framework you can configure all
the needed services as well as push
application artifacts through one system
with ansible you can write tables which
are the description of the desired state
of your system and it is usually kept in
the source control sensible then does
all the hard work for you to get your
systems to the state no matter what
state they're currently in and playbooks
make all your installations on your
upgrades for day-to-day management very
repeatable so with ansible you can write
pay books which are the descriptions of
the desired state of the systems
and these are easily kept in the source
control and symbols and does all the
hard work for you to get all your
systems in the desired state no matter
what state they're currently in and pay
books make all your installations your
upgrades and for all your day-to-day
management in a very repeatable and
reliable way so let's say that I am
using a version control system like git
while I'm developing my app and also I'm
using Jenkins for continuous integration
now Jenkins will extract gold from get
every time there is a new commit and
then major software build and later this
build will get deployed in the test
server for testing now as changes are
kept making in the codebase continuously
you will have to configure your tests
and the production server continuously
as well according to the changes so what
ansible does is that it continuously
keeps on checking the version control
system here so that it can configure the
tests and the production server
accordingly and quickly and hence it
makes your application deployment like a
piece of cake so guys I think you have
understood the application deployment
don't worry and the hands-on part will
also be deploying our own applications
on different servers as well so guys are
we ready to proceed to the next topic
give me a quick confirmation ok I've got
a few yeses now let us see how we can
achieve security with ansible in today's
complex idea environment security is
paramount you need security for your
systems you need security for your data
and not just your data your customers
data as well not only you must be able
to define what it means for your systems
to be secure you also need to be able to
simply apply that security and also you
need to constantly monitor your systems
in order to ensure that they remain
compliant with that security and with
ansible you can simply define security
for your systems using playbooks with
playbooks
you can set up firewall rules you can
log down different users or groups and
you can even apply custom security
policies as well now ansible also works
with the main point group which writes
ansible rules to apply d Sestak now d
Cystic is a fiber security methodology
for
energizing security protocols within
your network servers and different
computers and also it is very compliant
with the existing SSS and winner in
protocols and this is also a reason why
ansible is preferred over other
configuration management tools and it is
also compatible with different security
verification tools like opens gap and
stigma what tools like OpenScape and
stigma does is that it carries out a
timely inspection of all your software
inventory and check for any kind of
vulnerabilities and it allows you to
take steps to prevent those attacks
before they actually happen and you can
apply the security over your entire
infrastructure using ansible so guys I
hope that if understood security with
ansible if you have any questions you
may ask me anytime on the chat window so
how about some hands-on with ansible so
let us write some ansible play books now
so what are we going to do is that we
are going to install Landsat and then
we're going to host a website on the
Apache server and will also collect some
data from our webpage and store it in
the MySQL server so guys let's get
started so here I'm using the Oracle
VirtualBox manager and here I've created
two virtual machines the first is the
ansible control machine and the ansible
host machine so Antigo control machine
is the machine where I have installed
ansible and this is where I'll be
writing on my playbooks an ansible host
one here is going to be my node machine
this is where the playbooks are going to
get deployed so in this machine I'll
deploy my website so I'll be hosting a
website in the ansible host one so let
us go to my control machine and start
writing the playbook so this is my
ansible control machine now let's go to
the terminal first so this is the
terminal of my ansible control machine
and now I've already installed ansible
here and I've already made an ssh
connection with my node machine so if
you want to know how to install answer
well on how to make an ssh connection
with your nodes you can refer to my
previous video we have shown you how to
set up an Sibyl and make it such
connection with your notes so let me
here just become the routines office now
you should know that you do not always
need to become the root user in order to
use ansible I'm just becoming the root
user for my
convenience because I like to get all
the root privileges while I'm using
answers but you can't order to any user
if you like so let me clear my screen
first now before we start writing
playbook set of first check the version
of ansible that is installed here and
for that I'll just use the command
ansible
- - version and as you can see here that
I have got the ansible two point two
point zero point video version here now
let me show you my hosts inventory files
since I've got only one load machine
here I'm going to show you where exactly
the IP address of my node machine is
being stored so open the host file for
you now so I'm just going to open the
file and show it to you I'm using the GI
disk editor and the default location of
your hosts inventory file is at seek
ansible slash and this is your hosts
inventory file and now have mentioned
the IP address of my host machine here
which is 192 point one 58.50 6.1 video -
and i've named it under the group name -
service so i'll just write the name of
your group under the square bracket now
I just have one node machine so there is
only one IP address if you have many
node machines you can just let down the
IP address under this line it's as
simple as that or if you even want to
group it under a different name you can
use a different name use another square
bracket and put a different name for
another set of your hosts okay now let
me clear my screen first so first let me
just pass out the SSH connection whether
it's working properly or not using
ansible so for that I'll just type in
the command and Sybil and think and then
the name of the group of my host
machines which is death servers in my
case and paintings to call it means that
an SSH connection is already established
between my control machine and my node
machine so we are all ready to write
date books and start
blowing it on the nose so the first
thing that I need to do is write a
provisioning table now since I'm going
to host a website I would first need to
install the necessary software's so I'll
be writing a provisioning playbook for
that and I was provisioned my node
machine using lamp stack so let us write
a playbook to install lamp stack on my
node machine now it's already written
that playbooks I'm just going to show it
to you I'm using the T edit editor again
and the name of my provisioning table is
lamp stack and the extension for a Yama
file is dot yml and this is my playbook
now let me tell you how I have written
this playbook as I told you that every
table starts with 3 dashes on the top so
here are the 3 dashes and then I've
given a name to this label which is to
install Apache PHP and MySQL now I've
already got the L in my lamp because I'm
using a boon to machine which is a Linux
operating system so I need to install
our party PHP and - given now and then
you have to mention the host here on
which he won this kay book to get
deployed so I've mentioned test server
here and then I want to escalate my
privileges for which I'm using become
and become user it is because sometimes
you want to become another user
different from what you are actually
logged into the remote machine so you
can use escalating privileges tools like
foo or sudo to gain root privileges and
so and that is fires used to become and
become usual for that so I'm becoming
the user group and I'm using become true
here on the top what it does is that it
activates your privilege escalation and
then you become the group user on the
remote machine and then gathering facts
true now what it will do is that we
gather useful variables about the remote
host now what exactly did we gather is
some sort of files or some kind of teeth
we can be use later in a different play
book and as you know that sv playbook is
a list of tasks that you need to perform
so this is a list of all my tasks that
I'm going to perform and since it's a
provisioning playbook which means I'm
only installing the necessary software
that will be needed in order to host a
website on my note machine so first I'm
installing a party
so I've given the task name as install
apache2
and then I'm using the package model
here and this is the syntax of the
package module so you have to first
specify the name of the package that you
are going to download which is Apache 2
and then input state equal to present
now since you're installing something
for the first time and it won this
package to be present in your node
machine so you're putting state equal to
present now similarly if you want to
believe something you can put state
equal to absent and it works that way so
I've installed in Apache PHP module and
I've installed PHP client the HTM
scripts PHP DD library I've installed a
package PHP MySQL and finally has
installed the MySQL server in the
similar way that has installed a party
too and this is a very simple playbook
to provision your node machine and
actually all the playbook for simple I
hope that you have understood how to
write a playbook now let me tell you
something that you should always keep in
mind while you were writing play books
make sure that you are always extra
careful with the indentation because
Yambol is a data serialization language
and it differentiates between elements
with different indentations for example
I've got a name here and a name here
also but you can see that the
indentations are different it is because
this is the name of my entire playbook
while this is just the name of my
particular task
so because 2 are different things and
they need to have different indentations
the one should the similar invitations
are known as siblings like this one this
is also doing the same thing this will
also install in some kind of package and
this is also installing some kind of
package so these are similar so that's
why you should be very careful with
indentation otherwise it will create a
problem for you so now I hope that if
understood how I have written this
playbook if you have any doubts you can
ask me questions right away so can I get
a quick confirmation that you all
understood this ok
ok everyone has said yes so what are we
waiting for let us run this playbook
clear my screen first so in order to run
a table and the command that you should
be using to run an answer book playbook
is ansible - playbook and then the name
of your file which is glam stack
yeah me and here we go and here it is
okay because it is able to connect to my
nose machine a party - has been
installed
and it's done my playbook is
successfully run and how do I know that
I know that scene beef common return
values so these common return values
like okay I changed unreachable and face
they give me the state of summary of how
much table restaurant so ok equal to
eight it means there are eight tasks
that was run okay changed equal to seven
it means that something in my note
between has been changed because
obviously I've installed new packages
into my node machine through its showing
change equal to seven unreachable is
equal to zero it means that there is
evil hosts that were unreachable and
Saint equal to zero it means that geo
tasks will fade so my playbook was run
successfully on to my node machine let
us check my note messy Nancy a party n
my skill has been installed so let us go
to my node machine now so this is my
node machine let us check now for our
tea server has been installed so I'm
going to know web browser so this is my
web browser in my node machine let me go
to the localhost and check if a fashion
web server has been downloaded and it's
there it works now this is the default
web page of Apache - web server so now I
know for sure that Apache was installed
in my node machine now let us see if my
SQL server has been installed let me go
to my terminal this is the terminal of
my node machine now if you want to check
if MySQL installed just use this forming
two month MySQL user root and then - see
sudo password
a smidgen for MySQL and there it is so
MySQL server was also successfully
installed in my node machine let's go
back to my control machine and let's do
what is left to do so we are back into
our control machine now i've already
provisioned my node machine further see
what we need to do next now since we are
deploying a website on the node machine
let me first showing you how my first
web page looks like let me first show
you how my first web page looks like so
this is going to be my first web page
which is index dot HTML and I've got two
more PHP files also this shall be
actually deploying these files onto my
node machine so let me just open the
first web page to you so this is going
to be my first web page and what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to ask for
name and email because this is a
registration page for Eddie Rachel where
you have to register with your name and
email and I want this name and email to
go into my database so for that I need
to create a database and also need to
create a table for this name and email
data to store into so for that will
write another playbook and we'll be
using database modules in that clear the
screen first now again I've already
written that playbook so let me just
show it to you I'm using the T edit
editor here again and the name of this
playbook is my external module okay so
this is my playbook so like all table it
starts with three dashes and here I've
mentioned host all now I just have only
one host I know I could have mentioned
either the only one I see address
directly or even given the name of my
group but I didn't just all here so that
you can know that if you have many group
names or to have many nodes anyone this
playbook to run on all of your node
machines you can use this all and this
table will get deployed on all your node
machines so this is another way of
mentioning your host and I'm using
remote user root and this is another
method to escalate your privileges
it's similar to become and become user
so on the remote user to have root
privileges while this cable could run
and then the list of the tasks so what
I'm doing in this case book is that
since I have to connect to my MySQL
server which is present in mine old
machine
I need a particular software for that
which is the MySQL Python module and I'm
going to download and install it using
pip now pip is the Python package
manager with which you can install and
download Python packages but first I
need to install fit in my node machine
so since I told you that the tasks that
you write in a playbook it gets executed
in the same order that you write them so
my first task is to install pip and then
I'm using the apt module here
here I've given the name of the package
which is fighting fit and state equal to
present and after that I'm installing
some other software's using this and I'm
stalling some other related software as
well I'm also installing library - click
line death and after that using pip I'm
installing the MySQL Python module now
notice that so you can consider this as
an orchestration playbook because here
I'm making sure that it has to get
installed first and after pip is
installed I'm using pips to install
another Python package so you see what
we did here right and then I'm going to
use the database modules for creating a
new user to access the database and then
I'm creating the database named Eddie
so for creating a MySQL user I have used
the MySQL user database module that
ansible comes with and this is the
syntax of the - quill user module it
clear the name of the new user which is
Eddie wake up
you mentioned the password and the
prettier it means what privileges do you
want to give it to the new user and here
I'm granting all privileges for all
database and since you're creating it
for the first time and you want state to
be present
Cimmerian using the MySQL DD module to
create a database in my MySQL server
named Eddie so this is the very simple
syntax of using my SQL DB modules we
have to just give the name of the
database in DB equal to
and state equal to present so this will
create a database named Eddie and also
and after that asked me to created
people inside the database for storing
my name and image details right and and
unfortunately ansible does not have any
MySQL tables creating modules so what I
did is that I've used the command module
here with command modules I'm directly
going to use my SQL queries to create
the table and the syntax is something
like this you can write it down or
remember it if you want to use it so for
that since I'm writing a MySQL query I
started with MySQL user Eddie wake up
the - U is for the user and then for
password it's ready wake up now after -
II just write the query that you need to
execute on the MySQL server and write it
in single quotation so I have written
the query to create a table and this is
create table ret the name the email and
then after that just mention the name of
the database on which you want to create
this table which is Eddie for me so this
is my orchestration playbook I hope that
is understood have written this if you
have questions you may ask me anytime
so guys should we run this playbook so
harsh it says go so let's go clear my
screen first now do you remember the
command to run the playbook yes you're
absolutely right big Sheeta the command
is answered with a - play hook and the
name of your playbook which is MySQL
model and here we go
again my common return values tell me
that label person successfully because
there are no failed tasks and no
unreachable hope and there are change
stars in my node machine so now all the
packages are downloaded now my node
machine is well provision it's properly
orchestrated now what are we waiting for
let's deploy our application well clear
the screens first so now let me tell you
what exactly do we need to do in order
to deploy my application and in my case
these are just three PHP files and HTML
files that I need to deploy it on my
node machine in order to display this
HTML files and PhD files on my web
server in my node machine what I need to
do is that I need to copy this files
from my control machine to the proper
location in my node machine and we can
do that using playbooks
so let me just show you the playbook to
copy files and the name of my file is
deploy website so this is my playbook to
deploy my application and here again
I've used three dashes and then the name
of my playbook is copy the host as you
know that it's going to be dead service
I'm using privilege escalation again and
I'm using become and become user again
and gather facts again true and here is
the list of the task and the task is to
just copy my file from my control
machine and paste it in my destination
machine which is my node machine and for
that and for copying has used the copy
module and copy module is a file modules
that ansible comes with so this is the
syntax of the copy module here you just
need to mention a source and source is
the path where a fire is contained in my
control machine which is homemade eureka
documents and the name of the pilots
index.html and i wanted to go too far ww
HTML and it's index or HTML so I should
be copying my files into this location
in order for it to displayed on the web
page and similarly I've copied my other
PHP files using the same copy module
as mentioned the source and destination
and copying them to the same destination
from the same source final thing any of
you would have questions there this is
the most easiest playbook that we have
written today so let us apply our
application now and for that we need to
run this table and before that we need
to clear the screen because there are a
lot of stuff on our screen right now so
let's run the playbook
and here we go and it was very quick
because there was nothing much to do you
just have to copy files from one
location to another and these are very
small files let us go back to a host
machine and see if it's working we're
back again at our host machine let's go
to my web browser to check that so let
me refresh it and there it is
and so here is my first web page so my
application was successfully deployed so
now let us enter our name and email here
and check if it is getting entered in my
database so let's put our name and the
email tips for you see dot-com and add
it the new record created successfully
means that it is getting inserted into
my database now let's go back and view
it and there it is so congratulations
you have successfully written playbooks
to deploy your application you have
provisioned your node machines using
playbooks and orchestrated them using
playbooks now even though at the
beginning it seemed like if you start to
do and so the labels made it so easy so
