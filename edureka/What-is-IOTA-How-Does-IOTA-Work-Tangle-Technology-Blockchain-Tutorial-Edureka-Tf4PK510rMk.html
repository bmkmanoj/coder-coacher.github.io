welcome to this interesting session on
what is ioad now before we begin the
session I'd like to just clarify that we
are not by us towards any cryptocurrency
and this does not deal with iota
cryptocurrency
rather than that it deals with the
underlying technology which is the IOT
implementation as such we'll try to
understand what is Internet of Things
first we'll talk about what is iota how
these two are related
then we look at the various features of
iota what makes it stand in comparison
to all the other implementations of
blockchain that are out there and
finally we'll have a look at how IATA
works now I hope you guys are definitely
excited for the session moving forward
let's first try to address what is
Internet of Things now before we talk
about iota it's quite important that you
understand what Internet of Things is
now in denial of things has gained a lot
of births today Internet of Things
basically lets you connect everyday
things which are around us which have an
embedded technology in terms of
electronics software or even a sensor to
the Internet and which enables us to
collect and exchange data to have a
smarter system as a whole now this in
turn makes it quite easy for us to have
a day-to-day experience as well a smart
home is something that we all want and
that's also something that's quite
possible in today's world we all live
with sensors and electronic devices
around us so having a smarter
environment definitely is something
that's quite useful as well now the
other key term associated with Iota is
blockchain in itself because this is an
implementation of blockchain as a whole
so first to address what blockchain is
let's first try to understand what is a
block a block basically is a simple file
which records all the most recent
transactions or informations which have
not yet entered any prior block as such
a block in itself can be compared to
your account ledger as well where all
the transactions which have not been
printed since your last time will be
printed so same thing is going to happen
here all the validated transactions
which are approved will be present in
the block and this keeps going on as
well
now blockchain basically is a collection
of these blocks interlinked to each
other every block will have a reference
to the previous block and this in turn
forms a chain as well now what iota does
is that it changes the overall idea of
blockchain in itself
iota is believed to be the third
generation of blockchain let's first try
to address and understand what IO ties
IATA basically is an open source
distributed ledger system which focuses
on providing secure communication and
payments between machines rather than
individuals on the internet-of-things
platform now what it does is that it
implements two greatest technologies of
this era blockchain and Internet of
Things and brings it together with
respect to this platform as well now you
might be wondering why we cannot use any
of these other implementations for the
Internet of Things implementation now
the idea here is that each of these
blockchain implementations although has
its own advantage also has a set of
disadvantage as well now let's take the
Bitcoin blockchain implementation itself
now one of the major challenges when I
look at that implementation is that
there is a bottleneck that happens when
it comes to creation of blocks and
validation and itself what happens is
that only a single block gets created
every ten minutes now although there are
millions of users today that are out
there that are using the Bitcoin
blockchain implementation but let's
think about the scalability when it
comes to Internet of Things there are
close to trillion Internet of Things
devices that will be available by 2020
now handling the data coming from
trillions of devices is not easy when
you need to provide a secure
communication channel with them as well
as validate and manage the payment that
are happening between these devices now
the idea of building a blockchain
implementation for Internet of Things is
so that the machines themselves can
communicate with each other
and perform the transactions without
human involvement what basically I wanna
imply here is quite straightforward
let's take an example to understand this
better let's take an example of a smart
phone now let's say I have a community
where a lot of smart homes are available
one of the major requirements in a smart
home is cleaning and as you might have
noticed today there are a lot of smart
home cleaners that are available today
but let's take a realistic scenario how
many of us would actually like to buy a
smart home cleaner which would actually
run just once a week not a lot of us act
to be practical but what I can do is
that I can get a few devices for the
community and let's see if I want a
service of that device what I basically
do is that my smart home will come in
with that device it will request a
specific time slot for the cleaning up
of the house and the payment would be
made by the home itself
so here the machines are communicating
with each other and creating a pigment
based system for the service that they
are providing as well so this is how the
artificial intelligence and IOT
environment is growing quite rapidly and
today we have a lot of this quite
possible as well don't think what I'm
telling is something that's quite far
distant into the future this is quite
realistically possible in the next few
years itself now let's look at some of
the key features which make iota stand
up in comparison to most of the other
blockchain implementations that are out
there today in the market one of the
most key factors which makes Iota quite
easy and effective in the platform of
Internet of Things is the capability of
its scalability now in comparison yes
iota can have a lot more
cryptocurrencies generated yes it can
manage a lot more number of transactions
as well now if you are comparing one of
the most essential factor for any
cryptocurrency or any blocks in
implementation I would go with
transactions per second that is how much
amount of information can be processed
per second now if you take the Bitcoin
implementation basically it can handle
about three to five transactions and if
you look at a theorem that's close to 15
transactions per second iota on the
other hand can handle close to thousand
transactions and again it can keep
growing as well now this is just a
recent stress based information that I
am telling you the highest would be
rippled with about thousand 200
transactions per second but again the
ideology with respect to Ripple again is
quite similar with Bitcoin although it
can handle a lot more transactions but
there's always the issue of a single
information source being created here as
well and we'll be addressing this while
we go forward and how Yoda tackles this
as well so in terms of scalability iota
offers a lot more when you compare to
most existing implementations of
blockchain that are out there coming to
the next point modularity now the iota
protocol in itself if we talk about it
it's quite lightweight and easy but with
the use of modularity what they've done
is that they've actually not compromised
on the parallel functioning capabilities
what I basically am trying to imply that
each component associated with the iota
platform can in itself work out without
compromising on the overall
functionality as well as the speed of
the system as well now one key essential
factor that makes IO tuk stand up in
comparison to the others is
microtransaction now this in turn
actually reduces the need for minors and
thereby completely eliminating the need
for transaction fees in itself one of
the biggest challenges for Bitcoin
blockchain not most of the blockchain
implementations that deal with
cryptocurrency today is the transaction
fees that are associated earlier the
idea of blockchain was to introduce a
system that did not bring the
transaction fees but today the ideology
has changed a lot today even with
Bitcoin
etherium or ripple most of these include
a certain amount of transaction fees
that are associated with any kind of
transaction that you perform on the Iota
platform the transactions that you will
be performing will be independent of
transaction fees as their micro
transactions are such finally let's talk
about the quantum systems now one of the
biggest challenges most blockchain
systems that are out there to date face
is a challenge in future that will
happen is that if we use a quantum
computer which has sufficiently high
computing powers then we can actually
provide false transactions into the main
block itself this in turn can actually
cripple the entire system providing a
chance of compromise in the security
itself now let's say I provide 50000
false transactions into the Bitcoin
blockchain system itself then it becomes
highly impossible for us to remove from
this once a block of false transactions
is added to the blockchain then it
becomes unremovable because of its
immutable feature and if I create newer
chains based on this false transaction
blocks then it becomes harder and harder
as well so these challenges can actually
be overcome in iota because it uses
triple hash function known as curve to
ensure that it is not crackable even by
a quantum computer as well now let's
actually try to understand how iota
works and how it's different from any of
the other blockchain implementation now
in iota there are no blocks or even
block chains in itself this is how it is
different
Yoda uses a new data structure based on
directed acyclic graph which replaces
the need for blockchain as its
underlying infrastructure as well now
the use of tangle there by in itself
reduces the need for mining and
transaction fees as a whole now how does
it work let me just give you an idea so
here this is a rough representation of
how the tangle would look like now each
of these is a directed acyclic element
okay basically what do I mean by
directed is that there is a direction
for each of these now each of these
circle in itself is a transaction or
site for better reference okay and each
of them are linked to at least two other
transactions are such leaving the
initial transactions okay now this in
turn these two other sides validate the
transaction and the direction specifies
the connectivity between each other now
the edges that you are seeing are
basically the tips of the transactions
now these are just new transactions
which are yet to be confirmed or
validated so any edge or any site or
transaction for that matter which is not
linked to two other transactions or
edges are unconfirmed transactions for
that matter now to help you understand
better let's just take a simple example
let's say I'm going to add this
transaction to the track a simple
transaction for that matter now when I
have a new transaction I select two edge
nodes and then I connect them to this
transaction now once this transaction
has been confirmed but then what I'm
going to do is that I'm going to connect
it and then go and bring new
transactions and then keep connecting it
therefore so this in turn ensures that
there are multiple transactions that are
happening why one is being validated as
a whole as well so this in turn
increases the chance for scalability and
makes it quite faster as well when you
compare to normal blockchain transaction
now what it basically also means is that
if more and more transactions are going
to come in to the iota then it also
increases the speed of iota processing
as well so move the transactions move
the people involved with it the faster
the system will be getting as well so
like I said I Oda has added about
thousand transfers per second this will
keep increasing as the number of people
involved in this also keeps square now
iota is still a product in development
has a lot of various options available
today for people to learn and explore as
well Nyota is not just restricted to one
specific language implementation hour is
restricted to a narrow mind thought as
well now if you have to look at the i/o
test kit repository you will find a lot
of various applications but one thing
that you should definitely look out for
is the various library implementations
of iota that are available there so you
have Python you have Java you have
JavaScript that has also been introduced
then you also have rust you also have
various are the programming's like
c-sharp and this keeps growing as one
now iota is one project that is out
there that you should definitely look
out for because it becomes the
connecting bridge for two of the most
important technologies which are
revolutionizing today's market so if you
are interested in blockchain and IOT
this is definitely a project that you
should really look out for now with this
we come to a conclusion of today's
