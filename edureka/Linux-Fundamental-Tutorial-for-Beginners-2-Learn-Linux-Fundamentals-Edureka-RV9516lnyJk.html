covering basic starting from basic file
permissions then we will see user
administration how to create users you
know how to create groups I'll guard
users to the group's those topics then
again I will come back you know to the
publishing spot so initially I will
explain about the basic permissions then
we will go to the next level that will
be setting up sui d and g oid stick a
bit there are some other concepts ok so
we both the basic ones then go to
creating users and all again we will
come back to setting up permissions and
all ok ok we have started with this in
Linux primarily there are three types of
users ok so here if you observe this r
WX this is for the owner who is the user
here and he belongs to a group called as
admin user ok there is overfilled
admitted so this is the permissions
these three there will be three
permissions for every user ok that is
read write execute in the same order I
mean the numeric notation would be four
to one readwrite exit in the cube pull
the one okay so the first three is open
the owner the next three is for the
group to which this particular user
belongs to and the next three fields
chase for others other than over group
whoever rest is in the system last three
pizza applicable for that user ok now
here so the basic positions these are
the three I will just show you the new
recommendation say you have something
here take common file all right so if
you want to change the permissions of
this particular file so we use ch
so why they fold 777 okay hhc number 4
plus 2 plus 1 4 plus 2 plus 14 place to
place one space pilot okay so there we
get r WX r WX r WX all right so
similarly so this this is the easiest
way say if you want to change specific
using there is two different notations
one is the brake way using chmod another
one is chmod same so the user group
others all right so he'll and then use a
u- i will say x ok common file i see
what happened so here X am taken X out
of the permissions that the user has so
RW hyphen similarly if I give if they
want to give it sale I want to remove it
from group now all right and I want to
be able W okay and got three more so you
can say if you want to perform
operations okay you can use a comma
separator 10 minus how the me x okay so
everything has been two more so these
are two rotations okay you can run lead
right technique you permissions so
similarly just like I have granted the
permissions the normal users you can
plant it to the folders has been alright
so this is about permissions another
important thing that you should remember
about permissions is the you must value
okay there is something but you mask ok
so that is the default permissions that
are set when you create a file or a
folder okay three touch peplum hem to
tap create in the files I want we aren't
any
permissions so these files they got
created with some default permissions
okay so this is what your umask value is
good okay so by default every user will
have to you must value so say you mask
to 22 I'll make it simple okay now 384
and then I clear the directory the air
one okay unless I pin l will take one
example first see so this is how you
have to calculate by default the total
positions say if you have granted all
permissions to everyone that means over
all permission layin right execute for
test 2 + 17 like that to the group to
the owner 777 okay so by default 777 is
the maximum value that we can grant to
everyone okay so when we have set some
you must value P to substract the you
must value from the maximum value in
order to get the existing value okay let
me repeat by default triple seven is max
that we can give from this you need to
subtract the umask then you will get
whatever the result and you gets here it
is 555
so ideally it should be 55 whatever you
have given from that you need to
subscribe to troop whatever the result
comes so that will be the default value
that will be shipped with the files as
well as the directories here it is for
for for me see what is assigned to the
directory all right so it seems cellar
so for directly if they observe rwx so
here too is missing here w 2 is missing
hewwo is missing alright so so from the
total value we need to subscribe the
umask in order to get the values for the
default files and directories that we
create ok so if you want to change so
whatever manually using you mask space
numbers not a given so that is the
temporary change if you want to make a
permanent change what you can do is
there is a file called under the home
directory yeah so you can see our files
called back in school profile or mash RC
and this profile you can simply define
here you mask is equal to whatever one
you want so the next thing you login as
this particular user so all the
variables here you can see alias names
everything is get sourced ok and
automatically the new value will get
picked up ok so like the way we have
declared path value similarly we can
define the umask value has a variable
here and automatically that will be
assigned to the newly created files and
directories ok so here we have seen r WX
r WX r WX ok now we will see how
wait to use the same groups and then
we'll come back to this to this topic
then we will c SQ yd SG ID set user ID
these are two bits that are set to the
users groups and then we see sticky bit
ok let's see how to create users and how
to create groups now so I have been
opening this file alright so this is the
file if you create a particular user yes
yes transformer how you pump this sticky
but i will explain SEO ID sgod and
sticky bit as well ok so in the password
pie so this is the file related to the
users so the moment we create a user and
until gets created in the password point
say in order to create a user we go with
user ID come on your user ID say John ok
so the next moment and entry got created
here so here this is the first field as
the user second field x this is the
password field then we have the user ID
then we have a group ID see this group
doesn't exist the moment we create a
user the corresponding loop the same way
that is a private group for this
particular user ok so that will get
created automatically and then we have
that particular user's home directory
and this is the default shell that we be
allocated when this particular user logs
into the system alright so we'll see a
couple of options here other than so
with respect when you clear the user ok
there are two important files which
would get updated one
ttc password another one is the pc dad
all right so there is an end in shadow
so I come back I'll explain you the
entries in the shadow in as well and
there is another file called in pc rule
ok this is the third file since a
private group got created with the same
name there will be an infielder group as
well and then the is to shadow ok so all
totally there are four configuration
finds it is a password ptc shadow user
related it is he group the TC g shadow
is related to the groups ok ok so i have
just created a user called a user named
john and the four important
configuration files are actually that
would get updated it is a password it is
a shadow Ritter single pretty see G
shadow all right now apart from these
for configuration files by default when
you create a user using user add comment
so under the home directory with the
name of that particular user user of the
name of that user the folder would get
created ok and inside that folder you
get to see all the default files ok
every time you create a user all this in
place we'll get created inside that
particular users from the rape free
in fact if you observe right so the same
set of files are present inside epc
still as well so if you ask me when we
create a user so how does this place get
generated so by default when user gets
created all the default files then
partner ttc scary they will get caught
bit to that users or make things so that
these are the list of steps that would
happen so the folder is get created
content from scale will cuddle use of
soul directory all right and then all
the full important configuration files
will get updated okay so we have we
already seen ET ce pas ass good-bye okay
here so the password is not given we
have the user ID and we have the group
ID home directory and the the function
so for user ID we have used use the red
comment there are obviously there will
be lot of arguments using which you can
change the user ID that means let it
whip to randomly generate high this if
you observe all the use occurs here all
right in a typical linux system your
user IDs or loop IDs less than 500 when
the first 500 would be allocated to the
system users all right mostly above I
and whatever users that we create those
user ID is could be more than 500 but it
is possible to change them it is
possible to change the user ID and group
IDs way the route even the root user he
cannot see the password but the rule is
orbiting extended can change the
password of other users we will see that
has been so here password is not present
okay but password is stored in the
system and then encrypted form word for
that you need to go to this place first
of all I have
set the password for the user John all
right let me quickly set it see now on
the road user right and i am setting a
password for John Paul tokens
successfully updated okay now you can
see then clipped a password again
operator again the shadow file you'll
also dead updated okay so the user root
user cannot fear but he can change the
password of the normal users ok and here
let's see the other parameters here if
you observe read the user name and the
password and here there are some other
options we will see what these options
are so they are related to the password
aging policy right so how long the user
the password should be active or when
was the last time the user exchange
password like then we have a comment we
will see that come on okay for that and
the Cybermen if this is shut up okay
would always I will open to the girls so
that I can family executing sure if
others can access it
okay when you can already see that there
are no permission let completely blank
that means no permissions has been given
to any user so by default it's like if
you if you can guess the first type in
will be four it says it is file or
directory and then you have one two
three four owner and then next three per
group and the next three brothers so
even though the order is root here and
low for permissions are set route by
default can access any file or folder
it's only for the road user in the net
permissions are not that he can access a
bunch okay alright so now we have we are
done with this yes rota can change the
permissions has been root user I mean is
the administrator can perform any kind
of operations in the rest all right I
really what i'll do i'll quickly delete
the user now oops user then so just like
user creation process even during easier
deletion all the four files will be
modified and show only one pipe so there
is no user here okay then we need to
check home the victory ok so the folder
and the content are still present okay
so what we'll do is so for that user and
John how are heading in see this
census the home directory already exists
okay because this was you know get
deleted last time so not copying any
pipe from scary Directorate it's clear
that / UTC / scale in the directory that
contains all the default files that
would get copied to user school- so what
you can try doing this 3e set up a
network and by default by the time you
create a user you want some default
files to be present in that users home
delivery so what you can try the list
keep some files inside ATC scale and try
create users see they get copied
automatically or not you need not
something you can and try okay so now i
have created the user again since that
folder is already present the else are
not copied know so if you want to delete
a user along with the whole directory so
you need to use the open adoption all
right so that will delete all the files
as well okay so this is how we now
individually what we can do is as the
loop you is there you can change the
default shell that is assigned to the
users all right i think i have not shown
this before so there is the command will
see this equal on the shell then dash
okay so what I want to do it we want to
okay then I'd show you this fine it
positions this is the best options but
we need to cross check whether these are
present or not the corresponding another
big lash see a switch dash some dessert
present so there is a
CH sh all right then bin dash ok now I
need to exit out of the system I mean
global and then login back then
automatically by default I'll be able to
use the bin dash Michelle okay so this
is how you can switch shells if you if
you want to e so the primary thing that
you would observe that when you switch
from Bosch to other shells would be with
respect to the features like here
whatever previous comments that you can
see how those features will be available
and we have this control our option
where we can reverse switch the comments
that we have used those options are not
available like that most of the comment
line features that are helpful for you
they're not be available with respect to
them confessions so that's why most of
the time we stick to the bash shell and
he starts come on I haven't heard from
you yeah did you came up with a very
interesting topic without changing
shelves before that I just wanted to
know you create a user with the default
she'll even without if even if the user
has been configured to use a default
shell he can he can use so how does that
work meanwhile other shall means I I
wrote a script maybe that is a script
con XYZ and it has been configured say
with a default is a bash and when I
actually execute like xyc it will invoke
the bash file or or how does that work
means say if I have like if I'm using a
console commands specifically in that
one and I the default has been a set to
to the bash one and I just executed XYZ
so how is it going to take means with
which fun I am assuming it should read
from some file as and then start and
then interpret that this is the default
shell and invoke it right how does it
work because because configuring is just
11 default shell you are you are sitting
but the user can be is free to use
initial right in general right there a
you can yes yes yeah I mean that is
something which you can set on the top
of their shell script you have this
shebang line right there you can define
the child then to pit or that has that
is responsible for interpreting script
oh the what is it called the shipping or
something like that right yeah we get
hash excrement free okay a convention
that is that the pattern that interpret
their script so this one is
as a body part whatever shell that you
have if you want to switch she'll think
that ok yet we haven't been user c CH sh
sh sh and changed little bit licks it
alrighty ok I let's eat now I'm trying
to use the pword arrow it's not working
but we will type the commands manually
it will not work in this little so this
is vinh dash okay so this is our sis the
shell I have logged in here i will use
ctrl r see thats what it prints so it
will not get me those here we have a
command called hitch 300 bucks in it so
what information did are the arrows how
did you change the controller which one
the the control our means how did you
how were you able to get rid of back on
deck arrows no no yeah that's what I'm
telling you in this in this this is
batch okay you can see this sir it is
bash this side it is a different dash
Vash mm-hmm ok this is bash here if I
use ctrl R narula is basically to
reverse it whatever comments i have used
before I will simply type LS it will
give you the last unless comment that
I've used oh that is the advanced sales
you have used some good comments before
the way see continued user 30 it will
display the entire line got abused
before going to remember all comments
that have used okay you here in the
bastion today actually if I do the same
if i press ctrl r you simply prints that
controller button and whatever it is
they're you Prince it on the screen but
it will not reverse such for me so that
feature is not available that is
what I'm going to say in this tab I
pressed controller didn't work so ctrl C
I canceled it and upward arrow downward
arrow see this is how it has left and
right so right say we say a less / home
oh how to get rid of control character
hope you use that one even with that
feature is not supported in this shell
that is what I will intersect oh it is
not at all support okay okay yeah he all
right you're all those command line
features that are present with bash they
are not present here okay okay okay some
some sitting like httyd you raise a
controller or something they're used to
I don't remember I if means is there a
way to vince if i am screeching to a
different yes i know i have to users in
account of one user have one user
default is fashion I think he has all
this control a character I don't know
how to get rid of it but almost asking I
don't know how to get rid of them I mean
switching to bash again switching to
bash will have all these features switch
okay but batch itself I'm just here i'm
trying to get deep a because this is a
very common problem in everyday life
when you work with unix shells and also
just trying to understand it so each
shell what you meant to say is each
shell has its own kind of control
buttons right the keyboard strokes if it
is different from shellfish and it might
be different from shelter champagne is
that what you're saying some are not
supported some some okay and how do we
know the lecture is there a manual right
now that my mom is any help like is
there any on the system and something to
find out like about this one I'll tell
you that now that you are aware of all
the bash features so
we'll just have a general discussion
about comparing the officials by my
organization management push it okay we
are definitely have a discussion unless
okay okay now what I what able more what
I are not asking to comparison of the
shells but if a particular shell means
the the issue that you encountered right
now right the you said like it that the
dash or this one doesn't support right
now FARC in my screen right I just type
man CSH okay that is corresponding shell
so there are pantages available with
every shell if it is installed then it
should be getting a man pitcher see you
can move to the features online okay
okay this go through these features but
also the features are available with
bash so we'll stick to bash most of the
time okay so if you're from
yes present I will also cover the pseudo
related stuff okay issuance I have
covered user creation now i will also
finish the pseudo pot knob itself but i
think sugar is in a different module so
now that we have created the users okay
so you have been seeing me using su
command lot su is for switching from one
user to another user so x cube admin
user so there are only are two important
things with su so one is then you have
switch you to a peon user using the
default su command what is the working
directory where you have landed in all
right it is / truth previously you were
under / boot itself okay the second
thing is su space hyphen admin user okay
now you are under the home directory so
it's up to you if you want to move their
own layer to use in a paper else you
stick to this itself okay so this is a
broad su now there is another important
feature that is the pseudo sudo feature
so it is mainly used in order to perform
some restricted and wind tasks in the
system all right so that would be used
like in most of the index of
administration tasks so rather than
directly logging into the system at the
root user what we do is either you grant
access to some specific users who are
part of the headman group so what do you
do it you create a group and you add
some users to the group and for these
users you give some restricted access
all right then those users can handle
the edwin job for you rather than you
know it is not at all recommended to log
in and perform the road tasks as a road
user so the most important file with
respect to this is a TC
soon lowers right here so if you observe
here so there are lot of later there
will be by default only one user that is
considered here all right so our route
to perform all kinds of operations okay
and all the shells anywhere in the
system all right so this is the only
configuration available so this is where
we need to define either the groups or
the users you can be granted through the
access once you grant a pseudo access in
this type automatically the user will
get sewer access then go to the purple
an operation I'll give you a quick
example say I use it complete sorry apt
if my vanilla Turk puts food in win
phaser
okay so AB this I can tell it will not
work because he does not have sufficient
privileges okay where is the same will
give me output if I run as root user so
what i can do is so i can i get grant
permissions to this user john so that he
will be able to perform two similar
operation alright so then once the left
the villages are granted you need to use
sudo valid so reconfirm he has to give
as password
okay so this is the process so every
time you will use the sudo command okay
for not only this if you want to perform
some partitions or if you want to
configure some network all right so all
these features they can be categorized
and the corresponding commands can be
granted access to so by default when you
use a pseudo the system will warn you
because you will be performing admin
tasks then you need to give the
passwords as John is not part of the
silver spy this government will not get
executed so what I will do is will
quickly make changes three floors okay
sorry forest so actually we do not edit
this particular file directly which is
so diverse okay there is the command
called VA sudo ok so you need to use
that command and when you open the file
you can get to see all the list of
categorized commands respect to play it
working ok so there is an alias name
what you can do is you can simply remove
the hash so you have this unless you can
simply assign this el es wird to that
user so let us go with the day forward
way of you know we'll take a simple
example here it is ok and at this point
this is very important if you're not
suppose to directly modify it to see
through doors file ok now yes I am
showing you how to add a user here
alright so you have seen here once i
have added the user to the sudoers list
ok this command has got executed all
right so like this you can create a user
in your system and grants over access so
by default if you if you are performing
over the installation ubuntu user will
have a default school axis ok and ok
here what we can do is if we wore if we
have to perform if you want to give
individual of you on the Grand
individual access right say here we have
multiple things he for networking there
is already an ally as mud created you
can simply unhatched haha you all the
hash
and you can add this networking in the
last leg instead of all you can add that
over there all right okay you take this
particular example okay so for all
system related okay services this is how
the permissions are granted okay this is
a better example for you so similarly
what you can do is you can create some
full pipe users ok so here okay so much
more here for the road user all
permissions have been granted okay he is
able to execute each and every publisher
every command in the system you can do
anything in the system right for judge
for John I showed you how to initially i
have used the sudo command in order to
execute have this happen Ellie but he
was unable to execute that before it
throwing an error that this particular
user is not in this wordlist okay so
after that what I did was have simply
added him and I have granted in all
permissions here yeah yes that's cool
yeah I the entries that you are saying
Reyes would owe you open this file under
so this is I I am able to understand
like after only once you add this one he
will get John will be getting the
privileges I ever done but what kind of
rate means what are the different
options we can control here like your
what is it all equal to all we like
things if I have like 10 users so that
all the 10 users can be added here on
all the all the 10 users should be in
this file right if if all 10 users
should have a complete route then does
it mean all 10 a user should be included
in this in this 5 at the particular line
yeah I was able to explain that person
moment so here if you go through this
file uh-huh so there are two different
things one is the way the services are
say commands are categorized some
network related commands omit see when
we software installation comments here
if you see mainstream so related to
storage so these are all the comments
and there is an alias name that has been
defined me if you want you can create
your own earliest vehicle they find your
own commands say here I'll make an entry
okay local book he'll say commander the
score early s7 and i'll pick few
comments this or this like the 3 or 4
i'll add it here okay so once i made the
change I have my own alias that i have
defined then so this is one group the
second group is you can have multiple
users multiple groups in your system
okay so if you are clear that there is a
group of users who must be given this
specific permission that i have created
know what you can do is you can come to
this time and here you can define that
group and instead of all okay you have
lot of examples here so instead of all
you can leave that early asleep then
under that alias name whatever comments
up there so the users in this particular
group they will be able to execute those
commands so there are two lines John all
equal to all and then all leather like
three increase right john is a username
and all equal to all meaning what is it
second one he'll be able to perform all
sorts of comments are no be it's like on
all kinds of services okay related it to
all kinds of sex related to all exhibit
okay the first one is the type of it
okay how do I know how do I understand
like which one refers to what means say
you I mean I'm showing you the
corresponding examples know that is what
so then it will be more
clear for you right okay okay prodigy
just a minute yeah okay see here there
is a group called users ok so here it is
clear that allows members of the users
group to mount and unmount the c d---rom
as the root user right so personalized
users this is the group so all the
mothers of this group will be able to
execute this command ok similarly so it
is the blueprint aeration here ok
similarly there is another group code 6
ok so all members of this system will be
able to run all the commands that are
present as a part of these earlier
screams all right so you can quickly
start creating normal user ok and then
you can say this index is the same or
even if it is a blue or a particular
user ok please and then we can see low
or no password means you can give this
ok ok you are referring to the one where
the slower so should we ask for a
password right ok but by default all the
cases it is mandatory so no password is
usually given if you observe here wait
there is a low login she'll respond to
you there is no password option which
will be given for system processes but
Jesus usually I mean you can if you are
setting up you have network maybe you
can get them congregated yes this option
will help you enable that feature do it
so like that here we can create multiple
earliest things you can create groups
add users to the rule
add the group here okay and then you can
test out all the individual aliases
simply users are able to execute those
specific set of commands or not okay so
try these options and let me know if you
have any issues Stanley word with group
management so some of the other options
which you can see the ppt is so if you
want to see this field is empty here
alright so if you want to specify
something some comments about the user
so you can do that using the hyphen c
argument i miss that argument okay and
the next thing is regarding the groups
okay so by default this group it's
created there is an option called how
you can hear John baby now so what we
can do is we can
cool you can bypass the user from
creating a default group so here the
user ID is 505 but is this is not part
of the group ID which is 505 ok so I'm
so there is a default group in your
system that is users we have seen the
same ID in the ATC coming in pseudo or
spy there is a personalized users group
right so by default if you don't want a
user to be part of his private group
what you can do is you can simply use a
pen n option then automatically will be
part of the default use the looping
system ok similarly will what I will do
is will just quickly I mean it's about
adding users and then adding the groups
although the basic commands if there is
something to you know expand deep about
many of the topic and I will go through
Ellie show that but now I didn't just
take you through the ppt yeah so here so
as you have asked me can we change the
user ID can we change the group ID
similarly can I have a deep a different
home directory other than the one that
gets generated under / from ok so for
that there is an argument like that you
can even change the default shell that
you want at the time of creating the
user or even after creating the user so
we have seen CH SH right right see this
that mean use it ok so what I did using
CHS it and I've changed in the default
shell right so similarly so at the time
of pleading the user you can change you
can change the deep for
she'll you can change and the home
directory and you can change the user ID
group I refuel early after creating the
user also you can change these values ok
so user ID is the power which you'll use
if you want to make any changes you are
additional a given set the time of
creating users and user mod is the
command which we can use to modify the
existing entries of a particular user ok
so those are entries would include all
the values that we have seen so / so
type in the advert will change the whole
directory similarly you can change the
user ID alright so if you have observed
here as I've said before ok so top 100
500 user or group IDs are reserved for
system users and groups ok so most of
the users that you create all of these
days that you creating a user ID or
group ID rather than 500 ok similarly
user lil here see in this option so if
you use it by default it will only be
eight the user and we'll get these are
from all the deleting a user means
liberating the entry of that use it from
the computation prints ok but the whole
directly would remain so you need to use
hyphen R option in order to remove the
directory as well ok so user Delhi pin
are then we have something called hype
and F even if the user is logged in you
can remove the user next just like the
set of comment you can correlate them to
group creation and group modification as
well however you like we have two files
it is a password and shadows similarly
we have lettuce e group and we will see
that ok we have seen a TC group right so
this contains the group the correct
password is not being so yes it is
possible to set up passport form to pass
one all right and so this is the group
ID and these are the groups to which
this particular user belongs to all
right
so once again this is the user ok so
this user yeah this password is not
displayed and then you have your user ID
sorry the loop ID and then the other
groups that use it belongs to so it is
like every user will be part of one
primary group and they can be part of
multiple secondary groups ok it will be
a can be part of one primary multiple
secondary groups so what we can do is we
can create a at the time of creating a
user we can say hyphen G I will make him
as a part of the route and the secondary
i will put him in redmond user ok and
see up so i have just created a user and
he is part of his primary group is Ruth
in his secondary groupies ok let's see I
think he has been added to the default
users may be my maybe I did something
stick with my sin tax okay so check
okay all right so so that's high so you
can begin simply go through other
options which are here so we can say
that we can so all these arguments are
helpful in hiding the users similarly
like least important configuration file
we have corresponding configuration
files with respective groups has been so
we have seen the group file then there
is another file called G shadow that
that contains the encrypted group
password if you have set to the boots
alright so see a in a in a lipid in an
organization you can have multiple
administrators ok so if you want to
restrict a particular group from
restrict others other admin users ok so
from modifying the contents of that
particular group then what you do is you
can restrict password it's like now we
are simply talking about users and basic
rules but at an organized we should
level they are much more complicated
you'll have multiple users and multiple
groups based an organization based on
they get a lot of different categories
competed so there is a feature available
and we can we make use of that feature
Hank ok so here are ya you can see a
group has been added with a group ID or
by default you can simply go let's see
the difference between a group at
okay it has been given 505 if you
observe the ty-cee so 505 it is a user
ID that has been already allocated to
heavy but at the time of creating this
user I said low for creating the default
group so it has a 700 so the next
available group ID is PI 05 so it will
follow that particular order I say the
next available group ID the newly
created group ok so here okay
he'll put 700 oops sorry this is the
user so I created a group called you
good okay so over the group idea one
that has been allocated so that is all
yeah we can change no IDs for the
correspondent Amin we can change the
group IDs and instant access pretty much
similar you can see if you can add users
to groups we have seen how to add groups
to users report using group mod or blue
part in terms of creation as well as
after creation similarly you can use
this trick Sanjeev passwd command in
order to add users to the who groups
okay then will the password used
now see if you have set up the password
to a particular group try a side of the
password to a group first okay and then
try adding a user to that group alright
see if it asks you for a password okay
similarly we can delete users so I'll I
and simply more these are all basic
commands renaming are in the group okay
just like same to user administration
yes / admin tasks right so all almost
all the comments sim same user ID and
group work so I just wanted to finish
password 18 policies today so has kept
few of the arguments for group edition
please go through the comments let me
know if you have any questions so all
the same guy from the commands are given
in the beauty then we'll see password
paging we will wrap up with this topic
so we have a command called CH eight I
use that for Munich media producer
called Sean ok see so changing the
etching information for John ok
surrender the new value or press Enter
for the deeper so this is mainly CH is
common this menu to set up if you want
to you know how long a user will be
active in the system ok you can set
those things when the phone can become
inactive if it take emergency have
created temporary users ok for some
people who
visited who want to perform some set of
tasks so you need not have to enable
these users for the entire issue so you
can set up the password or say if you
already said there are other features as
well like how often should the password
must be reset okay and it also says when
was the last time the password has been
changed we will just go through these so
whatever options you are seeing here you
can modify all those options so here in
a moment maximum password age you can
you can see the last modified date if
you want you can modify these things all
right then password expiration one
before the password gets expired is that
frumpy just like you warnings that you
see on a typical Windows machine before
your password gets expert it will ask
you to reset your password solo teaser
will be able to run this command and
execute all this tasks for you alright
so bye bye bye making changes by making
changes to this default values we can
and you will deactivate the existing
users in the system alright like that we
can so you can either directly go with
ch is cover and manually check what the
current or job let's see a change hype
in l.a upon usage on so it says all the
values ch8 hype until by default it
displays all the existing values for the
users so that you can first of all you
can check like this or go with default
CH is comment or we can also
individually modify the settings so here
to teazer can change password for any
user in the system okay so some of the
arguments that are available on this one
so say what the ways you can make the
changes so if you want to individually
make the changes you can go with all of
this not many two or three arguments so
using those argument you can make the
changes to the users okay so this is
where I will stop and we'll proceed the
next next session we'll go with tell me
there are few slides it will go ahead
with the tomorrow session and yes rajma
I one we ordered you you were asking for
yeah yes I this is a general question
maybe a command of a script or whatever
I don't know what I wanted to know is
the honor system a if I want to list all
the groups okay and all users under that
crew although i do that like say gr one
user 1 user to user tray next plane
gianni user x user while I I wanted to
be a TC Williams
you
this possible things in certain groups
okay can you see that groups bin know
what i did is i have taken a random
group okay okay you so the group name is
bin all right bend in the first line
they want still left side these are
valid user the bigger name okay then and
okay belongs to these two groups okay he
will also these tools so I said okay let
me see how many users are part of this
group so ordered it simply groups space
bin or will look groups space route
there is a group called note as well so
only route is part of it okay and any
other hope you remember I think there is
something called anything user he is the
only person who is part of that group
okay yeah I you can users groups come
and even that is normal again notice the
groups and the group name will reach all
the users right they were saying group
and then the list of research were part
of that group you're part of the group
or will when i mean i have taken system
is very confusing for you for modern do
is I will you take
so basically groups is the command
you're saying right groups is the common
look sir what it should do is it should
display buggin you also a particle what
is the argument for the group's command
it is the username within the group name
right groups group named Justin broke me
okay groups and glutenin okay the
group's a user is him ok you username ok
groups in the username for each user
name ok groups ok I think similar game
you have the role similarly I have users
ya think it is you I did not install it
some of the comments have not in store
ok you ID space you use it name it will
give you let me sing that for this part
of it
are using a virtual box or a vmware tube
using VirtualBox in his friend or
provincial looks yeah yes I'll see that
in the packages they vary but the
command code uid i will check that and
i'll tell you tomorrow there is nothing
like a user's because groups means there
is no users know right it will display
the user ID for you so the user who is
currently logged in what is the user ID
what is it group ID I forgot that
command I will check that i'll tell you
tomorrow ok ok no bong Sao groups is to
commit ok that ok and one more question
is say I have a sin to its laptop which
as I set up like three or four beams
every time I have to run some command to
disable a fireball which requires a
pseudo so what I do is I do in this menu
right we su boot on each VM and then
execute it to run that script if I want
to automate something which is which
should be run as a hoot and it be done
like any can I give su root and can i
execute a script which has means I would
be logging this as another user but say
user one say user Raj has has some
application I will be logging as Raj but
I want to run it as a root like giving a
password and like whatever I am doing it
manually I want to automate that how is
it possible yes it is possible ok so
remote machines you are saying they are
you're logging into the remote between
doing SEO to the route to user and then
you are running the script so the first
option as you have sent here you can set
up a cron job that will run the command
for you as the root users you can you
have the script you set up the karanji
automatically the crown will execute
that particular script ok no that is one
option or get an option giving you all
the second option is you create a user
granting Sulu access all right and then
set up that no password thing or you
need to ask the password as an argument
inside that script and then execute that
script ok even that you put it there you
give it to prom the Conway are
immediately execute that for you so
that's your second option ok ok so the
second option I think you explained it
but I just explained in the class today
so if the user Raj has to have a root
root as to execute something like that
he has to he has to be in the sudoers
file right yes he has to be less ubers
right I wish there is another there is
another other option as well I'll
explain that to you tomorrow so that he
could not cover today that were covered
today okay all right thing I think that
concept is also applicable for your case
we will see that and explain the topic
tomorrow I'll give you an example after
seeing that example maybe it will be
clear whether it is applicable for your
case or not ok that's fine actually yeah
that is i means uhhh so today in this
class human you I don't know I I told
might have I might have not followed
that but did you mention that if not if
say you sir ROG needs to be in the
school owes file whether there is a if I
have to
if I have to login as root is there an
option that no password and without
password did you cover that so I have
only that is what what I mean Prasad has
asked me to open or whether it is
mandatory to give passcode I tolling
that not to thank all the users even if
they have to learn truth they will be
asked to keep the password but it is
possible so there is a word called no
passwd inside this will do configuration
right if you said that you said that
then it will not to ask you for you put
the password but you didn't believe for
all the users of the system it if
recommended to enable let so far you're
the next meals if you want you can
contact option okay so okay so tenderly
any user X if they want to execute as
user why they might be totally different
boobs or anything but user exes wanted
to login as user wife with a password so
that kind of thing I am I am expecting
me a in this case boy to be Ruth yeah in
this case why happens to be rude but
generally also I wanted like X tomorrow
Adam Robert I think not an example one
definitely ok you know it will so clear
and certain i just wanted to know like
what means are you add in you is are you
a system of a unique system
administrator here in your put in like
currently no I have prior experience as
a system administrator ok also what it
meant ok that's fine what is your major
means I just wanted to know if you if
you are ok to discuss know correctly I
mean I just tell you but I mean
throughout my career have been working
on the next systems I have fire it will
experience but nowadays has mostly in to
distribute crystals no sequel technology
or muy bien dong so your
in the Big Data a area okay yes okay
okay happens I just wanted to know so
that you know i means i'm i'm i'm
basically into data warehousing and etl
i had a lot of experience on that i am
working right now on hadoop actually so
development i'm doing development on
high peak and some MapReduce all this
stuff so I wanted to have a good
knowledge on hoop administration also so
so I am exploring a lot on setting up
some cluster of my home on virtual
machines and knowledge so that is one
thing so that's why i joined this class
to you know to get a grip on so
basically if I have to yae means the
biggest showstopper for me is this
networking at home if I have like
machines how it should i configure all
the things there I'm I I wanted to have
a clear understanding on that I'm the
synchro is is like a just like that and
Linux a lot of its pretty
unfigureoutable at the at least it
basically will like how the networking
portion is done with it which some solid
kilometers so if I means even if I yeah
my idea is to set up a network even if
my even if I move to a different place
or if i take to these three machines and
connect to your hotel that three
missions should be able to you know able
to talk because something like that so a
mobile cluster wherein i can set up my
own you know what I Louis when the
networking topic comes and though you
will not get you will not have those
things in the presentation part but I'll
morally I can explain you some basic
simple networking
how what is a subnet okay what are
private and public IP addresses okay how
to create a very small basic network
level cover at that time open then
accordingly you can you can go ahead
with them okay and I'll make sure that
even if you move to a different place
you should be in a position to easily
configure your network ok Bo canonically
cover them okay that would be of greater
pleasure you can share me your email
ready for any questions that would be
great because i will be sending any if I
never any questions can you hear ya
email yeah it's nsk in this kid 10 10 10
10 10 10 yeah nsk so 10 10 10 okay so @
gmail.com I mean I guess that's I mean
if you point cursor on my name I guess
that's the idea that you would see right
I am NOT able to see or in the chat
window yes I'm not able to see the ID do
a chance coconuts okay or you can you
can always send your queries to this
supported you recover in main idea is
that ok so either way I will be
available ok ok just some basic
questions if I have I will shoot an
Union ok hope you will answer my
questions yeah Showtek neatly ok ok task
one and hold it that's all for today we
will see you tomorrow tomorrow what
would be the main objective on first
thing is there are some topics with
respect to publishing a little bit on
advanced security concepts
and then the next model I just don't
remember for one second you're here
other than this sui D&amp;amp;S GID part we have
some network authentication so this is
only limited to the client setup ok say
if you have an N a server or an ldap
server how do you configure your system
allowed to connect to that server we
hope you show an x over configuration
but it's not part of the course if time
permits i'll try that then we have su
IDs TRD sticky bit these functions which
i have already covered in the beginning
then we have next level of you know
security I mean the first one is the
general permissions rwx the basic file
permissions next comes su ideas clearly
and stick a bit then comes your ACL at
on the list then there is another level
it's about what hardware extraction
layer and all those ok and then we have
advanced to the next security enhanced
limits will you go till that ok ok so we
see access control list why these are
you install this may be the first half
way cover all these topics ok so example
eundel put one more in here in the Big
Data no sequel you are in the HBase or
how vertically MongoDB ok so how do you
mean sir you're in development or it
normally be a plain old on combination
I'm into architecture said I'll take it
said ok ok so are so my goal the exact
means I just wanted to know my I am also
I also go into a decline actual
architecture so my goal is not to you
know do like a system it will stretch
could create users and all but a high
level understanding as you know like for
architects it's this is important right
so do you do you do you strongly feel
that this is a good means you need to
have a lot of UNIX knowledge against
right yes yes definitely you I mean even
Hadoop the area which is there any open
source that comes out it would first
peek only say developed for linux
systems then it will gradually we moved
on to windows side right most of the
support would be on the next itself the
development would be on linux critical
flow you know it is our understanding of
the next system on how to configure of
the heads working on your nexus
