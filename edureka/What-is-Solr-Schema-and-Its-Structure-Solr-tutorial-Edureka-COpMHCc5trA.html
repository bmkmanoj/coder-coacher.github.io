welcome you all on behalf of at Eureka
to this very informative session today I
am a Tita Aurora and I have been working
in solar Lucene and related technologies
so been here for about nine years now
and I carry experience of developing
applications in social media news and
healthcare domains so I would be taking
you through a quick introduction on how
we can build you know better
applications with the Apache Solr so let
me just quickly go about taking up what
exactly and what all we will be covering
today in this session today so at enough
for this module you would be able to
understand that term but what exactly is
solar and what are the powerful features
what makes it so sought after by people
in the industry we would be talking
about how Dara is told and obviously
because um we would be talking about
data so there has to be some schema so
what kind of schema solar supports and
what are these structures and the what
are the basic features and how do we
achieve the big data or no sequel needs
using the solar cloud so I guess that is
a big question as of now we would also
be talking about how we can leverage
these capabilities which come handy with
solar and we can use the you know
compactness and the power of you know
Hadoop along with the solar so I guess
we all understand that what Hadoop is
needed for and what solar is needed for
and then we would be briefly talking
about the job opportunities or for the
Salar developers so I would also be
taking up a small demo as well so let me
see how quickly we can you know some of
things
so what exactly solar solar is nothing
but our open source enterprises over so
you can also say that it's a web
application I would say it is a no
sequel database sober as well so it uses
the Lucene search library and it extends
it further to provide very very powerful
features like face attained highlighting
special searching and stuff so we would
be quickly seen that as well so solar is
very very useful because it exposes
everything in the form of restful web
services so if you see here the query is
the web service the the restful api
which it has exposed so which makes it
very very easy for us to look through
the data which we happen next right so
solar gives you that are okay and it
exposes the many other restful services
as well so we're going to quickly you
know see through what all things come
handy with soul earlier so if if you see
here this is another homonym I'm
actually running another you know ok
another say a web service which is also
exposed by solar this is the UI which
comes handy with the solar so this is
the web service which is exposed browse
which you know then there's this nice UI
for you guys so you have this UI which
is basically the admin console this is
the admin console so you have hell lot
of features here you have the dashboard
which sure tells you that what is the
configuration of your system on which
you are running this particular instance
you have the logging feature available
then you have the code admin so this
level of logging is something you can
control
you have the gmx monitoring which is
also supported through solar then you
have the core admin which is going to
control that how many cores cores I
think I've just discussed that at the
bifurcates the data storage so that is
the essential
you know a feature which comes handy
with solar that you can distribute your
dataset in the form of Li collections so
you can have various cores on your drum
solo our instance okay then you can also
tweak in true what kind of Java
properties this particular instance has
you can also select the core you would
like to work on from here Nicole
selector okay and if you have just seen
I was actually looking into one of the
cores here so you have again okay what
is happening with my system okay so you
have the cores here so when I selected
collection one here you have the
overview of this particular core you can
analyze the schema of that particular
coal you can import data from some other
database through this feature you can
push in the documents through this UI so
all of these are the restful services
which are exposed by solar okay also you
can query through HTTP GET and receive
the text results in the form of XML JSON
CSV or binary results so as in how
they're required by you so this is all
only bases offer me bases UI okay so
putting the the documents inside a
particular core is nothing but indexing
okay I guess we are all clear about this
thing do we have any confusions
regarding this okay open says the score
is equal to collection oh well open that
is again totally on the use case which
you have so if you want to have say a
separate collection for each of the
category of product you have yes you can
say that my my collection one code is
going to have the products from the
mobile category say my collection two is
going to have the products from my
laptop category
things similar to that okay La Cage
there is the solar also provides trawler
kind of thing Oh rocket I think
essentially you're talking about how do
we basically extract data from various
formats is that what you're asking am i
right
is that right brackish so okay if that
is your question then yes we have the
extract we have the content extraction
handler which comes handy with salar
only so I'm going to quickly take
example of that as well meanwhile I see
that we've already reached a nine
o'clock which was actually designated
time of this you know webinar but I'm
going to extend a little bit if you guys
are going to bear with me is a finitely
extendable extend for say 15 minutes I'm
going to quickly wrap up the webinar
yeah okay okay so look and say is that
do we create a core according to the
Department anything again that is
totally the only basis of your needs so
if you want to say Index the employees
data which belong to the different
departments yes you can build V codes on
the different departments as well okay
all right so I'm going to quickly cover
the key features so again solar comes
with all the features which come handy
with Lucene along with that it provides
you with the advanced full-text search
capabilities as well so we have just
seen a quick example of that we pushed
in a document and immediately we could
query that document as well so this
gives you a very nice you know real-time
near real-time searches so along with
that it comes handy with optimized for a
very very high volume of web traffic so
considering that it has been so sought
after so you can understand that how
optimized this is for handling the high
volume of web traffic along with that it
provides you these standards for open
interfaces like XML JSON and HTTP along
with that it comes handy with the HTML
administration interface so I've just
shared with you the admin console as
well the server stats can be monitored
through GMX
so we have a complete you know say a
dedicated one and a half hour
session on that as well how do we go
about you know doing this as well any
real course we have near real-time
indexing which is a tactical with XML
configurations I think I have just taken
an example for that when I pushed a
document inside and we could immediately
retrieve it in the text results as well
it is linearly scalable Auto Index
replication is also provided so these
all the features are there in the solar
cloud which came after solar for so
these are all the companies or I would
say the brands which are you know using
solar so I think everyone can see that
all he respected and reputed brands are
using solar so brands like Apple NASA
AT&amp;amp;T Cisco everyone seems to be using it
so this is a the very very extensive
architecture so have you been in the
classes of solar I would have taken at
least an hour to describe what this
architecture is all about so because I'm
anywhere running short of time so I'm
just going to quickly tell you that
these are the you know a REST API which
I was talking about these are
essentially called a request handlers in
the solar terminology so we have admin
select spell we can have the custom
request handlers as well so for that we
would have to write our own servlets
then we have your request writers which
is basically you know telling you that
what is the format of the request which
comes to the solar so then we have the
update handlers here which again this is
a you know kind of distinguish between
the various content types which it can
handle along with that it has the search
components which are essentially the
advanced features which you know come
along with solar like the query search
component the highlighting spelling
faceting more like this is all like the
order suggestion or auto correction
feature then we have the clustering
debugging stats
these are all these sorts come
which come handy with the Salar
distributor search is again when we're
talking talking about the solar cloud
this takes care of the distributed
search so this talks about how the data
has been replicated on various charts
and how how the leader and the rest of
the nodes are managed so we have this
feature of ready-made he available in
the solar for so that essentially has
its own instance of a zookeeper which
makes sure that what all you know shards
are there and which node has you know
what chart and then which is the leader
node or for would shy and and stuff like
that so again because we're supposed to
be taking a little brief about how
things go about I'm going to quickly you
know give you a nice you know tweak into
you know the architecture then we have
these schema and configuration so again
this is something I would like to show
you so we saw the data directory which
consists of indexes here however if you
look into another directory here
configuration directory these are the
two most important configuration files
which are there the schema XML
anti-solar config.xml the schema XML is
going to describe that what all fields
can go inside them while indexing the
data and the solar conflict is basically
going to manage how things are what all
search handlers are there and um if you
look here if you look here the query
response writer and you can also define
the clustering which lbar on which on
the basis of which algorithm the
clustering is done basically okay so all
of these configurations are maintained
by this these two configuration files
the solar config.xml and the schema XML
so I think that they're pretty clear by
the name itself they have then we have
the update processors so signature
logging and indexing are the processors
which come handy with it along with that
you have the extract handler as well the
content extraction which comes along
with the solar so Apache Ithaca is one
of the libraries with which you can you
know parse the data from the documents
which come from various sources in the
various formats just a minute guys
okay I'm having a nice you know really
bad sore throat okay so then we have the
data import hallelujah so this data
import handle can handle he contain from
various sources like your sequel
database your RSS feeds then you have
the index replication again this part is
handled by the solar cloud okay and then
you have the advanced features like face
taking filtering search caching
highlighting analysis and query parsing
which are also the part of the
architecture and over here if you see we
have been talking about that solar
extends the architecture of Lucy any
features which come handy with Lucene so
over here you can see that the essential
the basic features are provided by
Apache Lucine only however solar has
extended the architecture of Lusine okay
this is the search process so I think we
have discussed about this as well so the
the QT is going to provide you with the
what is the query type okay then it is
going to redirect you to the stipulated
term request Handler so if you look in
the configuration file here let me just
say request Handler only so if you look
here these are request handlers so these
are going to decide that if you're going
to push your query or push your request
once select it is going to redirect your
request to that particular servlet okay
so this comes handy with them all the
configuration so you can choose your
custom solet's as well if you have any
complicated or complex features you want
to incorporate the dev type is going to
basically tell you that what query
Parcel are we going to use along with it
the query filter is going to define that
what all fields you would like to see in
your search results
okay so response writer again now we can
also specify the number of rows we would
like to see on a particular you know say
search results we can specify that from
which job you know index we would like
to start then wrinkly results if you is
nothing but the filter query which is
performed only results which are
returned by D main query then W T is the
response writer which describes like
what is he type in which you would like
to see the results okay so over here if
you see I can choose the type of my
results as well like whether I'm
actually wanting to see the results in
XML format I can do that as well so over
here if you see these are the type of
result sets which are supported by solar
so likewise if you're working on Python
Ruby or PHP applications you can
directly say that I can directly use the
results in the format the results are
rendered on the UI okay I think we have
pretty much covered the the velocity UI
as well so just in case you guys are
still wanting to have more insight into
it so I'm going to quickly say that this
is similar to the search box which we
have here but this is going to be more
interactive you know this thing the UI
so if I say that I'm looking for say
Samsung it is going to provide me the
autocorrection
of the field which is already there in
lee indexes and it is going to render
all the results of the documents which
are already there then it is going to
provide me with a nice face of sales as
well here so if you look here this is
the category of all the faces which come
handy these are the query facets we can
also filter requiring on the basis of
the ranges so these are the complex
features which come along with the solar
so you can incorporate all of these
features in your application as well ok
then we have these special searches as
well so this applies to all the
documents err which have the point
defined under them so if you look here
all the documents which have any point
define here they
and they have this location shown in the
inside here so this is another beautiful
feature it provides so it comes with all
the nice features you could think of the
searching face sitting highlighting an
autocomplete along with each your
special searching so I think you can
take the binary offer solar and you can
play around with this UI I think by now
I'm sure every one of us are clear about
what face I think is it is nothing but
grouping these search results in the
various categories so these categories
could be defined as well and these are
all custom defined on the basis of the
documents which are pushed in okay so
searcher are basically represented with
the index terms and along with that the
numerical count of like how many
documents are there any particular place
it is there so this is all which comes
handy with the the UI offer these solar
so this makes it very very easy for a
user to explore these search results and
it also helps you narrowing down the
exact search results which you are
looking for okay so over here I think
you can see that it's fun looking under
the books category I can the have faces
on the language price say binding as
well or the delivery time as well so
this is how my face thing works like I
think everyone of us are aware of for
how this works yeah so face it in the
oven I'm stressing more on face sitting
because we have this very nice feature
out here
so this is basically done in order to
narrow down the results so that the
customer could reach to the exact
document they're looking for so along
with that I would quickly take up what
all nice features we have on the Apache
cloud so we talked about the features
like fault tolerance high availability
so we know that these these features are
there in all the big data applications
so this then the solar comes along with
the capability in which you can you know
experiment with the how you can start or
the solar and the solar cloud mode and
you can have multiple
Nords on there on this so this gives you
the you know efficiency in the command
of the default tolerance system and
highly available system so it is very
very flexible and handling the
distributed searches and indexes so if
you look at few of the things here these
are so this is the zoo configuration
file which comes along with the my solar
installation so it is going to define
that whereas my data stored and what is
this single limit what does it take time
of each node okay and this is going to
maintain the a zookeeper data as well so
this is where all by things I maintained
and you don't have to use any external
feature for it
this comes handy with the zookeeper
instance however if you want to use any
external zookeeper you can do that you
can essentially give the path off for
the external zookeeper you are providing
okay so documents can be sent to any
server in the same fashion and then if
it is our write request it is going to
be redirected to the leader node however
if it is the year we get requests it is
going to be redirected to any replicas
okay so zookeeper is going to figure out
which one has the leader node which one
is it replicas so if we have the read no
earlier request coming in it can
redirect the request to any of the
replicas however if we have any write
requests we would redirect the request
to the leader node so this is all
managed by the zookeeper instance which
comes along with E so our cloud so this
is how the architecture of solar cloud
looks like we have millions of documents
here and we have millions of user here
this is the zookeeper instance which
comes handy with the solar installation
so this is centrally going to manage
everything I am listing out three
instances here because anyway my highly
available system is not going to rely on
one zookeeper instance so we are going
to take the possibility if these
zookeeper instance is going to go down
so we are going to have more than one
instances
to ensure the highly relevant system
then we are going to have the two
servers over here so each of my server
is going to have say multiple shots and
multiple shards or multiple I mean in
each you can have multiple nodes and
each node could have more more than one
shard as well okay so then we would have
a leader of each node here and then we
would have these replication in the
other servers so this works will be
similar man manner we have the sharding
conceptor works in and then we have the
web services which would be used to
query or send data to these two servers
are exposed by these solar cloud so
these rest web services are exposed in
the XML JSON and HTTP format so these
are sent to the load balancer which is
going to make sure that which server
should take up your request so I just
sum up their summed up what are they
what are all the capabilities of the
solar which comes along with e so our
cloud so along with that I'm sure
because I feel that all of you have got
the background of purdue how can we
leverage these capabilities which come
handy with solar with using the by using
Hadoop so I guess we all understand that
Hadoop is something which works on the
MapReduce framework and it provides you
with the efficiency in the format of
storage so what you can do is you can
tweak early solar capabilities by using
or storing your indexes on Hadoop so
with this you can have all the nice
features which come handy with solar and
you can have the flexibility and the
robustness of Hadoop in your application
because solar is going to provide you
with fast and efficient powerful or text
searching capabilities which comes handy
with a near real-time indexing and
searching capabilities through solar
cloud which is very very flexible gives
you a distributed they're searching and
indexing capabilities and it will do
things like automatic failover and stuff
like that along with that it is very
very suitable for him no sequel
placement of the traditional databases
and many situations so you can use
Hadoop in case of the flat file system
like I'm storing my indexes right now on
my file system so we can replace this
layer with the hadoo layer so we can do
that okay and we can do this scalable
indexing using the Hadoop Map Reduce and
the pig drops and then we can load the
index data into the solar so with that
data which is told only Hadoop cluster
or the Hadoop per instance is going to
be used by the solar so in all the major
Hadoop distributions like cloud era
Hortonworks mapper you can integrate
thee so large easily pretty easily so
this is the kind of architecture I was
talking about we can input the data in
any format I would like to push my data
in we can have the raw files and this is
going to be my HDFS which is going to
store the raw files and index files
which are converted by my MapReduce
Orpik job and then I'm going to expose
this you know distributed file system
through my solar instances which sit on
the top of leucine and my web
applications are going to interact with
it in the format of query and response
ok so this is talking about the job
trends which you could essentially you
know retrieve by learning this skill so
I'm not going to literally you know go
into the details of how this graph is
all about I I think we can pretty much
see that from Johnny to John 15 we have
seen such a big you know such a major
shoot any number of jobs or the number
of work what charm comes for the people
who already have learned this skill so
not for the reason off the job I would
say but it is very nice tool to have in
your skill set
