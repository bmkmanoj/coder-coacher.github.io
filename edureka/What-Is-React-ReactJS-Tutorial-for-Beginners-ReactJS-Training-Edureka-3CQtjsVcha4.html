session on react.js so in today's
webinar we actually want to build
understanding of what exactly we
actually and you know so I hope that you
having a distinct time understanding
details before we end and how exactly it
works so let's move forward now so this
is basically I joined up for today's
webinar first section talks about
JavaScript the second technician talks
about what exactly or why exactly the
edgiest is useful and the third session
focuses on what is really the post
section focuses on the virtual Dom in
the final section talks about the
different applications using the mj's so
let's no more head to the first section
that is JavaScript so what exactly is
our stood the Java step is basically a
language which is predominant in use for
the client-side implementation it
initially started off as a tool or a
technology for or predominant between
client-side validation but as the time
has progressed now it has moved into a
full-fledged technology language which
can be used for client-side as well it's
suicide implementation of spec okay so
in generally what happens is we
basically have a HTML which is
predominantly used for defining the
layouts and then we have CSS pretty big
scales the snide apart-er step along
with these two technologies then it can
also be used for enough performing
operation and manipulations on the HTML
CSS so when it comes to web applications
and browser implementations has very
strongly
it can also basically configure the P
and then you track how exactly different
type of events are going to be handled
in the web application and so on so that
was stuff is a pretty powerful language
and it has been included for many years
and right now the whole focus of da Jeff
has shifted more from a client-side
language to or more universal language
so what are the typically advantage of
the osram and the related thing the
first of area is efficiency
I think JavaScript as the technology has
lot of predefined path
and function return automatically by
default presented with the same book so
no matter which framework we use we will
already get some predefined
functionalities in place which a
developer can start using and start
building applications so this saves a
lot of time for the developer and he can
actually create workable gold and
deliverable implementation varies when
using doctorate papers so efficiency is
a very critical aspect the second aspect
is the security
so whatever diversity framework we use
they will be coming with lot of unity
for security basic limitation and also
different modules which can be
integrated with the basic application to
build security so when it comes to
things like authentication authorization
encryption cryptography digital
signatures and anything with which we
talk about all these things are
automatically available in majority of
the salsa frameworks and apart from that
many of the Java frameworks are
automatically or in general support the
third by an open source community so
developers keep on contributing here and
individuals who are actually working on
building the application can reuse those
functionalities in the sort of is no
apply the security related patterns into
the application itself the next part is
basically the cost part one of the most
critical factor in any implementation is
cost so the whole focus on open source
was basically to make sure that people
can actually start using implementation
without paying any therefore funding at
the very initial stage and so most of
the doubts of payment are open source
and typically available using it for
those open source repositories so
individuals can actually keep on
downloading features and lstart you many
of them are between the updated so you
can try using new features very very
easily and you don't have to spend any
type of you know in HT funding to buy
these papers and so from an overall
costing perspective this use a big
advantage because many times will have
the most critical factor this cross
section comment perspective avoiding the
hospital frameworks in general more or
less are open source and so this is a
very good feature for programmers going
to start using it
using it all from one end to end and
dimension perspective aspect so let's
let's talk about angular and so I didn't
even question from Sumida he wants to
understand how exactly who angular and
amberle differ from each so we'll also
try to enter this expression so I'm
gonna remember in general are two blinds
and NBC waveforms predominantly the
focus of both is ring box all signals
read applications and so when you talk
about single bit application it is
basically an approach in which in the
very beginning of the application a
single pane will be loaded which will
contain the home page and then there
will be the print the paths to access
different parts of the application which
will be different templates showing no
different visual representation
traditionally the web applications will
actually involve a lot of you know
requests going to the server after the
initial page was loaded and that will
take a lot of them but with the
introduction of the single feed
application approach the number of
requests the server got effectively
reduced and any side requests in
developing handle two attacks okay
so from the end user perspective to this
gave a very good advantage to the
consume on angular JS and amber both of
them support that nice an MVC approach
they were started by two different
groups of individuals angular both
family started by the Google team and
Ambrose started by the average
both of them have their own way of doing
the clients at NVC amber in general is
more framework which in terms can be
considered as a more into it solution of
excellency with all the typical approach
is predefined angular is something more
of a framework which also gives a
certain flexibility building another
solution in part of it and in terms of
the way the frameworks have turned up at
the amber has the slope angular has been
pretty fast sort of an angular 1 and
then shift to angle
now angle 4 and you know the way the
whole concept works is pretty badly
dependent also from a learning
perspective I think angular is something
which will be able to start building up
together pretty quickly for example you
will need some out of time to understand
overall concepts so from that
perspective or the angular is something
you know which will work for you pretty
fast and I think that's being the way I
am left popularizing increase
and now with large contribution from the
community and 300 is that I think anyone
who released trying to use science and
MVC is pretty much focused on angle now
let's talk about react and you so both
of them are again slightly different so
there more of you centric in the
solutions reactor is more of a library
you is still considered to be more of a
framework on the view side when the act
basically was inspired as a component a
driven library which basically was
defined to solve a single purpose that
is for a developer to actually think
about building user interfaces as
components and then combining together
to actually build not compression and so
that was the predominant focus you
actually press try to use the same
concept of component based development
but then it also has certain other
features like in terms of you know more
seamless integration with HTML templates
whereas reactor basically follow the
approach the other concept of a Jacek
which combined that statement in our
script and that someday will be used
when both of them are centric to view
based presentations meteor is quite
different media is a framework which is
the ten to entering for mobile based
application development and internet
actually combines technologies like
angular no J's and MongoDB internet to
actually help developers to have an
end-to-end framework solution the change
will build fast mobile application so
here you don't have to really choose
individual technology that each layer
they're already part of meteor it's a
single solution for everything so for
people who are actually focusing more on
mobile based limitation and quick
applications definitely materialism
very good choice okay so now let's move
forward and talk about why the ATS is of
the integers so the idea is basically
trying to introduce some very distinct
concepts so react in general is
introduced with the state management
tool but the idea is that the weight of
you is going to be represented and the
way the view will be changed is
controlled to a six or ten tosses okay
so if you have reason or if like a
neutral data or the year time get our
user input all of them will basically go
through some
as mechanism which will in turn of data
store store can be considered as a
representation of the data for the state
and this change in the store of the
state will be reflected in the review
the view by itself is not able to
control the weight you can change so it
has to follow a certain process okay
which typically is more towards the one
we take let's go and this whole process
of 100 data flow and I would say
updation in a certain manner only with
certain restrictions has made reactor
pretty popular so there are no
unexpected changes testing is more
accurate these are some of the key
advantages you get but react has try to
solve all the different aspects and I
made the whole technology much better
and better in terms of performance as
well as the use it of Columbia so this
is just a representation of the same
thing there so we can now move forward
so what is the main challenge with Dom
manipulation so Dom manipulation is
turns out to be very expensive and only
something which actually represents the
way the HTML looks like now
traditionally what is happening is that
changes to the Dom or very expensive
because you had to actually iterate to
the entire table structure to make the
model and this has been a challenge -
okay so when you have large Dom
structure this basically means that it
takes a good amount of time so
traditionally Dom manipulation has been
a very expensive and now I would say for
the first but react has tried to cheat
change that and will try to understand
how exactly it fraction change it so in
react basically there is an additional
you know they are in between which is
termed as the virtual Dom so this
basically sits between the browser
that's read off whenever there is a
change in the Dom structure first the
virtual Dom we try to understand what
that changes and it will only apply the
differential to the this approach has
not been a lot of other technologies but
reactive the first acknowledge to
introduce this concept which right now
is being adopted by many other thing of
his life and I think the example we just
is this was out you used so this
basically means that the changes happen
much faster so you have speed improves
here
whose it is yes sir and definitely you
get much much better performance
so knowledge more power so what is the
NGS so the NTS is this degree of
sentient the octave like degree which
was actually developed by Facebook and
it was basically used to develop
interactive as well as mobile based
applications and basically follows one
put template based structure which in
general is the combination of JavaScript
and HTML which basically helps it to
define the overall layout of the HTML
and also provide note that our step
paste which operation has been which
gives it a lot of power so this and so
obviously as I said we started from
Facebook button as Facebook found low
value into the world technology of react
they actually move this to the community
and now at this stage it is basically
maintain that open-source community to
keep on adding you know features - yeah
and you know a lot of people are also
building components and they're in a
contributing which you know new
developers can actually adopt and use
them for their own implementation as
well ok so let's move forward now so
what is really so the first concept as I
said was basically for the virtual talk
which meant that any change is happening
to the Dom structure will be determined
using something called as a different
fashion
so different algorithm basically means
that if first find out what are the
differences into the current Dom and the
changes which are going to come in and
then it will apply the patch of only the
changes into the clear top which means
that the whole process of norm updation
will happen much much faster the second
process is basically one way binding so
as I was saying that the changes into
the view and happen only in a certain
process so basically what happens here
is that there is an action basically
which determines you know what is going
to be the flow ok then you have
something called an escape which
indicate and what is the current beta
representation and what is the possible
future representation and then you have
something more there's a dispatch action
which basically applies action and the
current state and determines the new
state so in terms of technologies a
greater this is basically down nether
okay so but what happens here is that
the overall change to the state can only
happen through this process and no other
ways okay which basically means that
there cannot be unexpected changes to
the state and so the whole view changes
are going to be following only this
process which basically means that since
there are no unexpected changes so you
can ensure that if at all the problem
occurs in the way W it works then it
will happen only in a certain stage of
that process which can give you the
debug and so on so this also saves a lot
of time in terms of the testing process
okay so one way binding is one of the
key advantage in the Act which has meant
that it has helped developers to control
the view rendering and that option of
this technology has increased
tremendously and the third area is
basically the server-side rendering so
one of the very important aspects in the
JavaScript space is the initial render
okay so whenever the application is
loaded in many cases what happens is you
want the representation to be driven
from the server and then the further
rendering can be taken care at the
blindsiding now the reason why it is
important is because you can actually
use a lot of server-side features you
can make use of technologies like
caching cetera to basically store the
initial render into the cake and then so
whenever you make a request it will just
make a request either to the server side
or the key and render the data so the
initial load time of the rendering is
immensely than faster and this is
basically handed from the server side
end so if you see in this diagram you
basically are showing a combination of
browser via and no chips the JavaScript
based
server-side technologies which can be
used to define abis and also to help in
defining the overall layout from the
server so this is one of the key areas
where the actress has been very popular
in the recent times now let's move
forward and let's try to again get an
insight about the virtual Dom so we've
already discussed it let's say we
understand it
so in German what happens is so in the
diagram you see a model of view and at
all so typically what happens the model
gives a data to the view which in turn
creates a table okay don't be nothing
but the structure of the data
we'll be laid out then in the second
step we basically now what happens is
whenever the data is updated by the
model but you had to create a new Dom
for it so the compression process had to
happen multiple time which meant that
lot of additional data structures were
created and lot of memory consumption
was also getting to factor this
obviously puts a heavy load on the view
and makes processing work so I think one
of the key goals of any UI based
application is to get a very good
response time and if you spend time in
just the Dom manipulation or the Tom
operation then the user will basically
waiting for most of the time and he's
really going to get feeling that the
application is running very slow which
idea should not happen okay so that's
one of the key objectives of any of web
based application okay so with react as
we see that between the year down and
the browser we are the view we basically
have this boil tom which understands
that how's the Dom will be updated so
what happens here is that with react is
when the model gives a data to the view
if the Dom is empty we created it and
whenever the data gets updated react
will create a virtual Dom or they
compare it to the current thumb to the
previous one and only applied those
changes which are in difference okay so
this basically means that the process
happens much much faster here okay so as
I said once the changes are calculated
it will update along with only the
elements that have actually changed and
this is basically happening to a process
called as diff and patch algorithm this
basically determines and pattern
basically used to apply the changes to
the real time for the only elements
which are changed let's move forward now
react.js applications so these are some
of the organizations which have actually
adopted companies like Facebook and then
Yahoo or Netflix or then you have times
in many more but in fact there are
companies like Walmart and so on the
reason why it is complete adopted the
actors because they found a lot of value
in helping the develop but think about
building the overall UI is a set of
components so this is another question
which had come up in terms of what
exactly is a comp
based development right so component
based development basically means that
whenever you think about limitation you
think about offerings and you're in
react we're thinking about components
from a user interface
okay so everything in anything in the
you are a presentation will be built by
using small small copper okay so as a
developer you first think about
components we build them and then you
start building the UI using this company
one of the key r1 days you get here is
that they become reusable as a developer
once you've created a component first
time you can use them for all the future
ey implementation which are on the page
it basically helps you tremendously in
the mutability perspective that is one
of the chief Oh Caesarea soft again how
it works a lot of these companies have
actually adopted it because it on a lot
of value in this approach and it
actually spent and stirrup you know
saved a lot of that development time and
in many cases where people are
preferring to use an end to interest
based solution we take on is like no
change react works pretty well with the
whole concept of the server side and so
it helps speed up the world application
perspective which makes all the
applications much much faster and
quicker running that has been a type of
value-added writing that meant that you
know different companies have already
adopted and in fact they have also gone
and and changed things up this thing we
know technology stacked which they had
used in the past some of these companies
had to always acknowledge that so and
not that and BHP it so on and I think
now all of them have reacted I think
that should have a value it gives and I
think these companies have adopted it
and I think when more companies are
going to move forward at the time for
crystals so that brings me to the end of
today's webinar or the edges I think we
have tried to enough cover some of the
key aspects of DHS like what exactly is
the asked what are the different I would
ask the framework possible
what exactly is react is why the LDS at
it popular what is the concept of a
virtual no and then finally we talked
about different companies which are
actually using react.js based
applications okay so I hope everyone had
a good time in this webinar I think
there are couple of questions with
people that in which I think we already
tried to clarify if the receipt for the
questions
let us know and we'll try to get back to
you with a sponsor we really appreciate
if you can share your feedback and any
other comments on the webinar which will
help us in focusing on better webinars
in the near future so that's all from my
side so thanks everyone and have a nice
thing thank you bye I hope you enjoyed
listening to this video please be kind
enough to like it and you can comment
any of your doubts and queries and we
