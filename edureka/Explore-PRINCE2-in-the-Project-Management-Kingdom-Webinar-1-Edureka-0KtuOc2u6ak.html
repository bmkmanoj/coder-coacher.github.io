Prince true in the project management
kingdom on behalf of ago Rica I so that
welcome everyone of you into this
webinar training session I will request
anyone who is not able to hear or has a
multiple problems please do let me know
well in advance if I'm not audible or
are there any challenges that you are
facing across well if teams are no one
had any trouble so I'm kidding me no
audio slow videos issues so let's start
our webinar a webinar will be are you
know divided into two parts the first
part will be the webinar presentation
which is being presided by me the offer
will have 15-20 minutes of the equation
around sensation this is how we will be
dividing us at the next half an hour the
Prince to this is the agenda will be
talking about the history of Prince to
this principle the figures and numbers
the benefits the themes are Prince to
the processes the qualification
processor and the portfolio what is
Prince to prince who stands for projects
in controlled environment it is the most
world's most adapted project management
framework with having over a million
practitioners prince who provides
invaluable guidance which gives
individuals and organizations the
essentials of running a project and the
above the base Prince so is easy to
learn and flexible enough to adapt to
all type of projects from the
perspective of Prince true let us see
what does the definition of a project
stands for so according to Princeton
a project is a temporary organization
that is created for the purpose of
delivering one or more business products
according to an agreed business case
here the key word temporary stands for
that the project has a Stargate middled
it in an end time the second week key
word in wins in this definition is
organization here your organization is
not been referred as our companies or
dmn see what organization it is
referring over here in the definition of
project is group of people which are
brought together to deliver business
product the third important keyword in
the definition of prince2 is business
case and it is one of the principle
which has been the deciding factors for
principle of Prince struck by business
case it means that why this project is
being done what is the purpose what is
the benefit out of this project to be
done so that is how and that is why or
that is in which way the definition of
prince2 has been projected so what are
the key benefits of prince2 so they
keeping the faith of a prince of a
principle is it ensures projects are
delivered to agreed quality
within budgets and timescales quality in
terms of prince2 is a proven method it's
a globally recognized solution for total
success of a project budget it is well
flexible enough enough to fit in with
any budget regardless of the project
size when it meets says regardless of
the publicized it means the same to the
time skill whatever may be the desired
targets they are met on time and every
time and that is why is one of the more
seamless project management or
frameworks that we have the other
benefits of prince2 is it is among the
widely acceptable it is proven best
practices and governance it provides
explicit recognition of project
responsibilities and roles it has
product focus which clarifies water
project will deliver why it will deliver
when it will deliver by whom it will
deliver and lastly for whom it will also
careful design to meet the needs of
different levels in the management team
us improving the communication in
control prince2 is built on manage by
exception framework which provides for
the efficient than economic use of
management time vince russo this the
management intervenes only when the
individual or personal fails to meet the
standards set by the themes we come to
themes later on it also ensures that
participants focus on the viability of
the project
relation to its business case objectives
prinsloo also provides sorrow but
economical structure of reporters there
are only 26 reports in all which has to
be utilized for the Prince troop project
Prince to promote consistency or project
work and the ability to reuse project
assets prince2 also provides a learning
and continual improvement and it has the
last but not the least a great
professional community so they may be
the question that way arises why not to
miss Prince them why a prince who should
not be missed at this the answer is the
each and every project which the
individual all the organization is
working upon as lot riding on it there
has to be deadlines that up limit there
has to be solutions that have to reform
that's where it brings two pitches in
Thompson in the 21st century businesses
governments and business both benefit
from the true global based practice
standards delivered to only Princeton so
the question Thompson can a framework
which helps in bringing such a wide
variety of benefits is can be afforded
to be most opener
let us take a quick look of the history
of register so it goes back from 1975
were prompt to the project resource
organization management and planning
technique was formed by the organization
known as simple system Philippa
thereafter 989 prince2 was published by
the UK government agency and since then
there have been major revisions way back
in two thousand earlier our prints they
was friends and then a term to Prince
too thereafter the organization the
ownership for that to create a brand
name prince2 name should not be revised
thereafter and hence after whatever
revisions has happened till late Prince
to remain Prince to only it did not
change to Prince three pence per opens
fire so it's friends to being just for
the sake of marketing gimmicks is being
projected as one of the most widely
acceptable or is it really acceptable
framework in project management
so it was since first being developed in
1989 then so has been successfully
adopted by thousands of project managers
around the world French food has been
widely accepted in over 150 countries in
over 19 different languages in 2000 as
for the estimates prince2 exam was taken
after every three and a half minutes
only there are over 1 million prints to
practice nurs in over 150 countries
spread between 19 different packages
going by the figures you would estimate
that prince2 has the value which is not
turn stated to any given geographical
location
most of the benefits for the Prince to
their shown on your screen have been
already been talked about which is
improving the communication improving
the alignment improving the trust
influencing the organizational culture
uniting the teams and processes and
improved focus cost control and
effectiveness how as an individual the
important question is these benefits
that we talked about is mostly catering
to an organization but does it benefits
to the organization as well or not does
will it benefit me as an individual or
not is the quotient probably you might
have it while coming down the session
will Prince to be really beneficial or
just another certification program been
marketed by the team it's not that the
benefits of foreign individual in terms
of friends to our it off is recognized
around the world around the globe
properly since you seen it is not be
implemented and who's in 150 countries
it improves your position when
individual is certified as the prince2
practitioner the organization run a team
exist it don't worry that the common
dimanche which press to is using his
being commonly adapted from various
organizations which have been following
certain practices in project management
so there is no terminology in Prince to
as such which is restricted to Prince to
as such in totality
clearly understand your robe one of the
good things that I like about friends to
frame pockets in France to the role of
each and every of the team member is
defined and clearly different so there's
a role of the project board they're all
of the projects manager which has been
described there's a role of the team
manager there are the role of the team
members which has been clearly mentioned
but it has a more of a structured
approach it also helps an individual to
structure their project given their
conditions irrespective of the project
size you working the scale icity the
complexity we cha graphical location or
whatever were typical of business you
are you working it gives clear
documented process of how to close your
father it improves your delivery by
delivering the project well in time
within the scope within the expected
quality and with the clear business case
intent it also tells you how to initiate
approach rather how to start your punch
so individual and from the
organizational perspective prince2 has
the benefits
before we come to uh you know Prince to
where you might have also heard the
other certification program which is PMP
you would have might of the
professionals would be PMP certified to
the point is is Prince to yet another
project magnet certification or it has
its own value differentiation when it
comes to others had in comparison to
other certification programs and I must
say yes prince2 is different than PMP it
is not just another certification
program so let us see how is Prince two
different than PMP so Prince to is an
acronym stands for projecting control
and fun there is a prince PMP is the
acronym stands for project management
professional prince true is a structured
project management methodology which is
endorsed by the UTU cake of me PM is a
credential which is offered by PMI and
the another most popular project
management everything goes by us PMP is
a more of knowledge-based approached for
the clansmen whereas prince2 is a
process based approach in PMP you have
certain eligibility criteria before you
can attend or go for the PMP
certification in case of prince2 you do
not require any prior knowledge or
experience in project management NP MP
the East topic or knowledge area can be
referred to an isolation of others it's
like a plug-and-play mark
in Prince to it is more of an integrated
set of processes and themes which are
not isolated silence which can be
selectively applied in Prince to the
principles are non-negotiable so when it
comes to PMP it focuses more off or only
on the role of project manager whereas
we have talked about it earlier to
friends to define the roles of everyone
involved a project may be the project
manager maybe is the project port maybe
the project support team may be a team
manager may be a team road so everyone's
role is going to be descriptive in
princeton in PMP you have all the
detailed techniques which are well
documented and part of framework like
the port of poor technique bottom-up
estimation unwell embellishment prince2
does not include this so the specialist
aspects and the retail techniques are
not elaborated in the prince2 framework
due to the gendrich nature of the
principal thing so think of PMP as a
body of knowledge which is like a book
of coping whereas friends too is a
method like a recipe for me I hope with
this you would be able to got it love
that how prince2 and PMP are different
in their own things let us see the tree
integrated key elements in prints
through the prince2 talks about seven
processes prince2 talks about seven
themes and prints to talk about seven
principles let us see if what are these
principles themes and processors
so prince2 is based on seven key
principles i am repeating prince2 is
based on seven key principle which are
non-negotiable when I say non-negotiable
it means none of the prints two
principles can be equal is an exception
in gopis Republic you must have all the
principles in your project so that in
order to term your project as a prince
through project these seven principles
are supported by seven themes the
principal project is then delivered
through seven processes so everything in
prince2 is based on principles they are
the foundation of frame the themes on
the other hand are the aspects of
project management that must be
addressed consistently and throughout
the project pencil processes described
who is responsible who is responsible
for performing d things at different
points of project but is there anything
you know that means does not power yes
there are three things three main key
things which a prince who does not cover
them those are specialist aspects so the
industry or type listen work is not
included in Princeton prince2 is
entirely gendrich so industry specific
or five Pacific activities are excluded
from Princeton prince2 also does not
covers detail techniques so many proven
planning and control techniques that can
be used in support of prince2 theme are
well documented elsewhere so specific
prince to approach like product based
planning and quality
techniques are included but nothing
besides that prince2 also does not cover
the leadership capability because from
the principal Specter they think it is
not possible to embed the leadership
capability in a method it's a to divert
stop it s / Princeton you can have a
quick look on this integrated elements
before we move forward to the next line
okay I hope you have gone through it now
we'll have a quick look on what the
seven themes of Prince Rudolph's above
the seven themes are business case
organization quality Kris planning chain
and progress so themes in general are
the aspects which the project manager
should know Humanity project so the
first benefit of having themes as a
puzzle skills by business case it means
how to justify your project so project
manager should be able to justify why
the project has been undertaken and
throughout until and unless the project
finishes winds up they should be able to
justify and give the clear indications
of why this project is needed the second
is organization in organization the
roles and responsibilities are being
described in order to bring
accountability within the project
members
the another respect of Themis quality it
answers the question of how to ensure
the project is fit for purpose the risk
who is doing what in will so let's talk
about the risk analysis and management
are the key to any project successful
delivery planning the purpose of
providing the base of the actual outcome
this is where it has been described and
documented of which project team member
should be doing what kind of activity
when they should be doing it and how
they should be doing the change theme
gives the clear definition of
you
how a project conjugation management
issue management and change control need
to be managed need to handle the project
in a more effective and efficient manner
and the lastest appropriate the progress
of the project the another integrative
element of prince2 is the principles the
seven key principles which is defining
both in responsibilities managing by
stages managing my exception learning
from experience tailoring continued
business justification and focus on
products let us have a look on each of
those principles again before that I
would like to repeat the seven key
principles in prince who are
non-negotiable they actually have to be
implemented utilized during the course
of the project they cannot be any
negotiations on these so in defining the
roles and responsibilities prince2 has
defined and agreed the fulton
responsibilities within organizational
structure that will engage three people
it will engage the business it willingly
the user and it will engage the
suppliers the other principlist
management by stages it is of a ball
about planning monitoring and
controlling your project on a
state-by-state basis in managed by
successions prince2 defines the
tolerance limit for each project
objective
to establish the limits of the
delegating authority in learn from
experience a talk springs to project
team learns from the previous
experiences where the lessons are sought
recorded and acted upon throughout the
life cycle of the project tailoring is
one of the usps of prints talk which
were able not to find in many other
project management certification program
scientist or paper so tailing to suit
the project environment the prince who
is tailored Taylor to through the
project environment tailored to suit the
project size Taylor to should be project
complexity importance capability hundred
so what prince2 says is that based upon
your environment of your project or your
size or the complexity or the importance
or the capability and risk you can
modify how you have to handle your
project the continued business
justification needs to be answered at
each and every step until and unless the
project finished the question is is
there a justifiable reason for starting
the project that should remain
consistent throughout its duration
lastly but not least his scent
principlist focus on products so prince2
focuses on the definition and delivery
of of products in particular the quality
aspect of the product the principal
processes again as they were 17 seven
principles so there are seven processes
the seven processes are starting up a
project
initiating our project directing a
project controlling escape managing the
product delivery managing the state
boundaries and closing up project so
there are seven processes and as per
Prince to the processes stand for the
sack of activities which are performed
in a chronological order that creates
the define output using the define
inputs so these prints to processes are
a structure set of activities which are
designed to accomplish a specific object
so the seven processes that is starting
our project so this is more of a pre
project process so this process it
ensure that there is a business
justification for the project which also
answers the question do we have a viable
project in initiating a project the
project management manager build the
foundation which is necessary to run the
project so the project plan digital
business case is written the strategies
for managing the various quality etc or
also written in initiating a project the
third process is directing up project
this process is where the project board
make decision whether to go ahead with
this given project or not
so the project poor throughout the
project checks for the continued
business justification in the
controlling the stage the project
manager does day-to-day work of the
project which is performed at East age
following the initiation stage so at the
end if a defendant is decided at this
day whether to move ahead with the
project or not in managing the product
delivery this is where the product are
actually produced so the interest of
this particular procedural activity is
performed by the team manager by the
work which is allocated by the project
manager in managing a stage boundary the
project manager reviews reviews what
have used the project of this progress
of the stage an enclosing a project this
is where the project is actually
evaluating the acceptance of the project
product is obtained I hope by now you
would have an overview about the paint
the principles and the processes of
fenster now let us move ahead and
understand the qualification in the
exams which happens to be under
Princeton so the first days of a prince
to qualification is the Prince to
foundation exam benefit of the score
qualification is simple it confirm that
the individual has sufficient knowledge
and understanding of the Prince to
method to be able to work effectively
with or as a member of the project
management team within an wha
which is supporting Princeton so the
prince2 foundation exam it's a
multiple-choice examination questions
the 75 questions per paper in which the
five questions are on a trial basis so
in summary you need to attempt or you
need to have fifty percent of the right
answers of the remaining 70 questions
it's a closed post exam and the
important thing it is the prerequisite
for attempting thing the second level of
prince2 exam which is the practitioner
qualification let's have a glance look
on the practitioner qualification too so
the purpose of the practitioner
qualification is to confirm whether the
kandarians achieve sufficient
understanding of how to apply and Taylor
at the same time prince2 in a
scenario-based equation so successful
prince2 practitioner candidate should be
able to start applying the method of to
a real project but may not be
sufficiently skilled to this
appropriately for all situations
the prince2 practitioner exam on the
other hand is a multiple-choice
examination question it has eight
questions and in each of these eight
questions you have ten questions per
item each carrying worth 1 mux so in
totality the examples of 80 marks in
which 44 marks or third 55 person need
to be at them getting so that you are
certified as a prince to practitioner
it's a two and a half hours duration
exam with no additional reading time
also it's an open book but there is a
caster the book which is acceptable in
the prince2 practitioner exam is the
official prince2 manual only the prince2
practitioner certification is valid for
five years pause that you have to appear
for a registered practitioner Excel
which is again on the same pattern of
the partition example of one hour
duration only if maybe at the end of the
day for each one out there any
certification exam would fall down to
what are these financial benefits for me
as an individual in terms of my career
growth in terms of career respect the
answer is it was identify from one of
the reports population payscale.com that
the demand for crystallization data of
senior project manager profile the pay
bracket is between ninety two thousand
dollars per annum too close to one lakh
fifty thousand dollars per alan people
who are prints to certified the project
panel
us had the paper racket of at least 42
thousand dollars which ranges goes to 1
lakh dollars or one lacking fun so we
have seen that Princeton is not from the
numbers figures interesting to go for it
for an individual benefit or no class
will benefit but in terms of the
courier's in the paper brackets also it
is equally beneficial for individual so
how would a director as an organization
would help you out in certifying getting
certified repairs to Pakistan so there
is an upcoming bash of federica on July
levels which will be divided into four
week duration which is happening only on
saturdays and sundays which should be
providing 32 hours or online classes
with four make this and we are
aggregated dinners from people search
with having over 15 years of global
experience in project management so the
contact details you know if you want to
rush to and book it and get the drop
discount which I would see us on the
screens until valid don't you like
forests of 20 person please to the
nearest of your ETA Cass people and go
and book the exams go and book these
certifications the details is there on
your screen
yeah so I hope you know you would have
noted down the numbers contact details
whom to get in touch with how would be
our Prince to session conducted through
it the record different than in the
organization's so I'd Eureka have their
own live online classes they have the
recordings recorded in your LMS account
so once you do not get create an account
on a direct copy of a plate each of the
training session that you attend you
have the recorded sessions over there
available 24 crossing the 2407 you also
have the class support post-classical to
have lot of model wise questions clicked
on you might have certain project works
to be done and at the end of the session
in the expand you will get the
certification in half how the code
structure will be divided for the Prince
to will be having quite of six modules
it first we'll be talking about the
integrated elements the second will talk
about principle then theme then
processes they are tailoring at the end
we'll do a live prince2 practitioner a
steady to be served on the set
guidelines set by the Prince to body
with this a half done with my webinar I
would request now to each one of you to
please drop in your question so that
they can be answered in this session you
may go ahead and start asking your
questions on the question dialog box
which is available to each one of you do
you have any questions for me regarding
Princeton if you have where the quiz
each one of you to please both the
question the first question which you
got from is from mr. hurry this question
is do you provide classroom training um
hurry we do not the erica does not
provide the classroom training however
the experience in the corn line batches
are no lesser than the classroom patches
the benefit of doing from a direct eyes
you have three to four hours of the
session on each day so the one which is
starting on the eleventh of July you
will have three to four hours in the
morning they after on Sunday three for
us the rest of the day you have for
yourself or your family and for your
personal so the prince2 will be divided
over a period of one month and judge for
us obsession each day I hope I answered
your question
the next question is from mr. biscotti
the question is that each module has
exams separately when I say modules yes
the Prince to foundation has a different
exam and prince2 practitioner as a
different itself so Prince to as a whole
in terms of examination is divided into
two modules the Prince to foundation and
construct practiced each have their own
exam which again would be helped
supported through Eddie Rica to you I
hope I answered your question mr. bosch
worthy the next question is from mr.
durgesh how friends do better than from
other project management certifications
I would not say and I never said that or
i would rather never ever say that that
one certification is better than the
other certification it's basically on
the value which you are generating out
of each of the certification so doing
the Prince to certification has his own
benefits doing the PMP certification
that their own benefit doing any other
certifications like itl has his own
pelicans the individual has to see
whether those benefits are beneficial to
them or not in some way or the other I
hope I answered the question mr.
location if you still have please drop
in your question
the next question is from mr. Harkavy
for existing PMP credential holder can
the Prince to foundation exam be waived
off years they have come out with
something where the principal foundation
exam might be vapor but however I to get
an understanding of prince2 it is
suggested to at least go across the pens
to foundation module as well the next
question is from Mr curry what is the
price and how can i avail twenty percent
discount your pension I put your just
mr. hurry that please contact the number
which is available on your screen you
need to talk those idiotic casts box
they would help you about how would you
avail the 20-percent discount and since
it is valid till do life force only so
you have another three days to avail the
discard the other question we have from
the other participant mr. biscotti the
question is that this certification I
can do to online completely the answer
is true Eddie rake eyes yes the
certification can be done online
completely because a director provides
end-to-end support right from the word
go from the training to the post casa
port and to the exams as well the other
question is from mr. Hamid the question
is is the exam Proctor or unprotected
practitioner how can how we can refer
the mangle the quotient to it is the
exams if they are online are Proctor so
you would be continuously being
monitored for the exam that you're taken
so they would be aware what are you
looking at what you're not looking at it
so you may refer to the practitioner
book on an online or an offline basis I
hope I answered your question well miss
Rama the other question is mr. bhram
buzz-worthy how long the whole course
takes usually usually the word is
totally gendrich it actually I would
others it depends for an example if
you're going through the EDD dereka
teaching methodology it will take you
one month over the period of one month
to get yourself prince2 practitioner
certified professional I hope I answered
your question that's my expectation mr.
personally do you have any other
questions for me if yes please go ahead
if you have any other question from any
of the participant if he is please feel
free to raise or ask your query the
question from mr. Arun L what would be
the cost of the examination Aaron for
that I would request you to contact the
edori kasbah on the contact details
mentioned on your screens they would
help you out for the cost of the
examination do we have any other
questions from any of the participant
safe yes please feel free to answer to
get your questions answered I'll give a
minute more before we wind up this
session token' I think they aren t near
the questions coming from any of the
participant so with this we will be
finishing of webinar for the preference
to I hope you enjoyed the session please
do give in your feedback also the
people who are interested in attending
the upcoming Prince troop training
session would request you who are Bailey
