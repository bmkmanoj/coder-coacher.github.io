commands so you have create free space
which we already just know displaced and
then use nothing but shifting to that
particular key space or particular key
space let's say when I go for use and
then say that you know one particular
key space if we go and shift to that
particular or connect to that particular
key space and then alter key space is
nothing but you're altering a particular
key space with whatever you want except
exam you want to change replication
factor or you want to change change the
placement strategy like network topology
to simple strategy or simple strategy to
network topology strategy all that stuff
you can do it using up order command
okay so then you have a drop key space
which if you recollect it I have used
all this all commands like create as
well as drop views and I cracked the
same way you have create table alter
table drop table or also truncate table
use the name itself indicates truncating
to all the data and I have used even the
create index and will have to drop index
commands as an advantage so let's say
for example I want to create index but
equity is not thing since then only so
I'll show you from the date of center
that becomes more user-friendly for you
right so definitely not option I'm so
sorry for that the way you have a Java
in eclipse in pill since you even have
here intelligence so that it becomes
very easy for you to do any any commands
text to a one simple create key space
see here you could see I have just given
create an and just pressed control space
it gives me lists all possible commands
you could see here if not exist
this particular keyboard will tell me
whether in case if it doesn't exist then
only it you need to create it so I'm
trying to go over the same thing I just
create again first drop it one
particular one drop
space CG world demo so let me go ahead
and drop it okay so you could see that
it's been executed in six not five
milliseconds in the bottom it shows you
if you would have noticed it okay now
I'm trying to give you or create the
same one secure mm but the class I don't
want to be a great apology but it's
supposed to be as a simple static and I
want the replication
factor to beat mana so let me go in and
execute this so you could see it's been
executed as a minute exhibited it coming
as an error message here so you add if
not exist statement because it tries to
tell me that you know already there is a
problem we'll need a lexical demo is
already exist that's the reason you
can't recreate it so in case if you want
to ensure that in case if it is already
there it should not recreate it then you
can give just one small command called
if not exist it could be for even
inserts it could be even for your
updates it could be even for your
deletes as well
you can use that particular if not exist
any place wherever you want it I hope
that makes some sense you can think like
it's a conditional statements like say
you can even attach with drop key space
as well you can get capacitor or insert
you can attach it you can attach with
any any command okay so water lewis and
further proceeds and talk about
something called boxes which is very
very important for you to understand
okay try to talk about patches i created
even the bash demo as well so just let
me go in and make one table i'm creating
a table called users do i have to create
it on secure demo so i just said like 10
to secure demo has a key space now it
got created that's reason it's showing
me as a red line here in case if not
exist if i added then it will not give
you as a and or show you as a error the
same way i want to create one more also
you
let me go ahead and create it again so
you have both of the statements executed
so now you could see that you know there
are two tables now select star from
users let me just press it you don't
find any any data here that's fine
so you could also see that there is one
more table as well page new comas okay
so you have both the tables the reason
why I've created you would understand it
to be knitting within couple of minutes
okay so let me blow it and in first eggs
if you a batch or a create a batch and
run that particular batch okay
batches are in general useful so let me
just copy this particular statements
have a set of commands here you could
see that you know I have creating
inserting into users updating users
again inserting into use your extra
extra extra I'm a correct a different
different commands so in the scenario
I'm inserting you look to user 3 and
user for and I'm deleting the name of
the user to and as well as I'm setting a
different password foot user to okay
what's been said Emily are differently
so I think semicolons and Missy that's
reasonably showing me as a Harris so let
me put those semicolons in case if you
want to begin a batch you need to start
a command called begin batch okay
you need to start with the command and
called begin batch at the end of the
batch you need to say command called
apply batch in the retail whatever you
want you can give statements either
inserts updates deletes whatever you
want you can just pass whatever you want
so I have shown us today a mutations
together from the Java API using Java
API as a batch and then trying to
execute it am I correct the same way it
is from the sexual shell I'm doing as a
batch use using even cql sessions or
sequel Java API
also you can create a batch and then
execute it the way you have done
yesterday forklift API you can even do
for even cql API as well so let me boil
and execute this particular whole batch
so if you recollect the tab as if you
see very keenly I am giving totally six
commands
am I correct so if my commands GI
inserts one is update one is delete so
totally it is five commands I'm a clerk
so let me execute it you could see here
it is saying one statement successfully
executed the reason it's taking as one
statement ease though I am giving it as
multiple statements it is ending up as
one statement because it's back it will
have only one round trip with your
Cassandra DB it's not like for every
statement it's connecting to your
Cassandra server and then sending that
statement so either it sends all the
statements at one go to your customer
server exhibits it and comes up with a
response saying whether it is successful
or not but you have one small thing
which you need to very clearly notice in
case in case during the processing of
the batch in the middle if it breaks if
you throw an error message then it it
doesn't do rollback there is no concept
of rollback I am repeating again there
is no concept of rollback whatever it is
done it's done that's it
clear so people want to do it because
there is no concept of rollback if it
fails they will go ahead and Bri execute
the whole batch the reason being is
anyhow will not come if the existing
data already exists equal to the top new
timestamp because every time it is a
episode it's not the same way for your a
DBMS where you have a primary key if
already one row exists with the same
primary key if you want to reinsert the
data then it will throw you an error
message on effect that is the reason
they don't find it as on this problem
though it doesn't do roll backs they
just reacts acute the whole stick of the
what the board they want to execute so
we have already seen the create key
space and name and with what exactly
supposed to be or you could see here
very small differences from the content
here to the whatever and trying to type
the reason being is it is a newest
version of cql or data stacks Enterprise
Edition fourth that's the reason or the
new Cassandra has got a small change in
the strip in the commands that's the
reason it may differ from the what's
there in the PDF because it's been
created with cql two points you okay
well the older versions of your
Cassandra the PDF is been created or the
presentation has been created if you are
using one point two it will be work
without any problem all these commands
in case if you are using Cassandra 2.0
there is a probability that you know
there is you need to change few commands
so you know the way I've shown you just
now for create key space it's not the
same way like strategy gas and strategy
options but that's not the way I'm a
quick I have shown you like a class or
replication equal to a class supposed to
be what it's supposed to be on the
application factor what it's supposed to
be right correct so that's about a small
change in the syntax is the trick so
then use the mind is very simple you
then what exactly the key space you want
you can give it and you can go find
without any problem and in case if you
want to view alter alter these base
what's supposed to be name and with the
property is only you can change it I'm
repeating the gates once the key space
is created
you can't rename the key space I'm
repeating guys again once you create a
key space you can't rename the key space
okay so only what you can do is the
properties of it you can change it
properties of it you can change it here
and then to drop the key space
drop key space and watch waterville
supposed to become an and as I said if
not exists is important for you in in
the production environment when they
want to
while a you know people prefer to see
right if not exist because of the fact
that it doesn't have a blog of whatever
execution of the commands will not
contain any errors so that makes you
more comfortable when you are looking at
or interpreting the locks
whether you're successfully the whole
whole implementation rent or not now
let's come back here so we have already
discussed about if not exist drop table
truncate table so you could see here it
is drop table effect since it's not like
it's not existent correct you can alter
up if you did not exist so that's the
reason you can include effectors okay so
in the same way you can say create index
and the drop index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
