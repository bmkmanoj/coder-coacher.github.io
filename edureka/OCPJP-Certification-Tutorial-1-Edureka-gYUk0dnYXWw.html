one present today my name is vini and
I'll be the instructor for all of you
today we will be going to the basics of
Java and the name of the courses OCPD AP
certification which is powered by a de
liquor now this course actually prepares
you for an OC pjp certification what is
the OC pjp certification it is a
certification that is provided by Oracle
for the co Java experts okay you learn
Co Java thoroughly and after that you go
for this examination which is a paid
examination right so before taking up
the course you should understand why
should view actually prepare yourself
for a OCP ejp certification so let's
move on without wasting any more time we
come to why OC pjp 6.0 first of all
you'll be receiving a certification by
Oracle everyone knows that what Oracle
is it's a big company and if you have
got a label of Oracle then that would be
an excellent batch on your resume
whenever you'll write that I am Oracle
certified you'll get a preference while
seeking jobs okay
so excellent batch it will be acting as
a preference when you will be seeking
for jobs if you are a professional then
it will help you to switch jobs and it
will also take you a step ahead than
others so these are all the benefits why
you should actually take a OCPD ap
certification and if you want to take it
now you have understood that this
certification is very important right
now if you have to clear this it is
quite tough as well so if you want to
clear it you have to prepare yourself
very well hence you have to take this
course moving on we come to how to
prepare for OC pjp 6.0 first thing
understanding kochava concepts
thoroughly it is very important that you
are very clear with the kochava concepts
then you should solve the simulation
test regularly simulation test means
that these are multi mock tests like
your OC PAP examination the final
examination if you attempt many of the
papers like that on that
button then it will be very easy for you
to crack the final OCPD AP examination
okay so v NR course provides you 10 to
20 stimulation test so that you are very
familiar with the paper and you do not
face any problem while taking up this
final exam okay moving on you should
have an overview of advanced java
concepts why because just go java after
an OC pjp certification you'll
definitely get a preference in jobs
right you'll be hired but even then the
core java concepts are not good enough
for a company for that you should have
the advanced java concepts hence in this
course we also provide you advanced
concepts like RMI framework swing and
applets struts these kind of things will
also be taught in this course now
finally the very most important that is
continuous practice under guidance okay
in the course you'll get an expert that
expert will help you at every each and
every point wherever you face problem
you can ask all your questions to him he
will be available online throughout the
week ok you can anytime come online on
skype and have the skype support you can
ask for the hell and that expert will
help you at each and every step right so
I hope you are quite clear with why
should you take OC pjp and how to
prepare for that please try it right
down on the chat window if it is so I J
say sir is it really help for our job
exactly it will definitely help for your
job
an Oracle certification absolutely takes
you above everyone which says yes what
about the rest of you guys please be
interactive write down on the chat
window rj says ok so thank you Natasha
says yes that's good moving on now we
directly come to what is Java okay we
won't it missed any more time and will
come directly to the point
what is Java Java is not just a
programming language but it is a
complete platform for object-oriented
programming
what is object oriented programming in
everything revolves around objects
whatever thing that you'll be making in
this a kind of application of this kind
of programming in that you'll be
creating objects first and after that
you'll be doing all your processes right
so Java is an object-oriented
programming in which you create object
and everything revolves around an object
right we come to Jo Rita Java includes
two things one is JRE and the other one
is JDK gr is the Java runtime
environment in order to run a java
application you need the JRE installed
on your system okay if you see in your
system you have to go to C Drive then
the Program Files in Program Files
you'll find a Java folder in that you'll
find your JRE
because in most of the applications you
use Java hence you have to use this GRE
that is Java runtime environment
similarly there is a jdk jdk is Java
development kit now Java development kit
helps you to develop Java applications
hence let's say you have got the
knowledge of Java and you're a Java
developer so in order to develop a java
application you will install jdk in your
system if you do not have jdk you cannot
develop java applications
okay so all a few pieces right down on
the chat window are you clear with Java
JRE and JDK she was easiest what about
the rest of you see she says yes need a
stage yes sagar says yes are Jace's yeah
chris stages or this is yes Nana says
yes that's good moving on we come to
Java Virtual Machine you would have
heard that Java is the platform
independent language but do you know how
it is platform independent it is because
of JVM that is Java Virtual Machine now
first of all when you write a Java
application that Java file is actually
the dot Java file okay that is called
the source code when you compile that
file what happens that code gets
converted into dot class file which is
the bytecode bytecode is the
intermediary language now that bytecode
is sent to some other system your
application finally gets
into bytecode and that is sent to some
of the system to network or locally on
that new system what happens there is a
JVM present now JVM can understand
bytecode what it does it understands
bytecode it reads the bytecode and it
converts it into the machine language
that could be understood by that
particular machine so for your
information for every system there is a
different JVM that is for every
operating system for Microsoft but
Microsoft operating system Windows it is
a different JVM for Mac operating system
there is a different JVM for Linux there
is a different JVM right so but each and
every JVM can understand bytecode and it
will convert that bytecode into a
language that could be understood by
that particular operating system hence
Java is platform independent are you all
clear with this please write down on the
chat window why Java is platform
independent it is because of because of
JVM and bytecode some programming
convert into machine language by
bytecode no RJ I am singer I'm saying
whatever code you write okay that is the
Java code after that you compile the
code as soon as you compile the code the
next code that comes is called the
bytecode then your bytecode goes to some
other system there is a JVM present JVM
converts the byte code into machine code
that could be understood by your
computers by your system are you clear
now okay he says thank you you're
welcome
Leticia is clear that's good moving on
let's understand how Java works
it's the same thing Java compilers
convert your code from human readable to
something called bytecode in the Java
world bytecode is interpreted by JVM
that is it gets converted by JVM into
machine code in JVM there is one more
component that is present that is called
the just-in-time compiler
now both interpreter and compass test in
time compiler does the same job that is
they convert the bytecode into
instructions that could be understood by
a machine let's try to understand this
with an example that is with a diagram
then it would be clearer clearer to you
first of all the entire environment can
be divided into two parts the very first
part is the compile-time environment and
the second part is runtime environment
in the compile-time environment first of
all you write your Java source code that
is the dot Java file using the Java
compiler that is Java C you convert the
bytecode into Java bytecode that is the
dot class file this dot class file is
sent to some other system locally or
through network and it comes here in the
runtime environment as soon as it
reaches there there is a class loader
and bytecode verifier class loader loads
the Clawd class file and then the
bytecode verifier verifies the file
using the java class libraries once all
this process is done this bytecode is
sent to the chavier in JVM what happens
Java interpreter starts interpreting
your bytecode line by line it reached
the first line since the instruction to
the next level
second reads the second line and does
the same with the second line third and
fourth like this now there is a time
when your system fields start there's a
already used code that has been
repeating right now what it does it
sends that go to the just-in-time
compiler compiler converts that code
into instructions and it will save that
instructions into the cache memory
whenever that code is encountered again
what happens interpreter does not
interpret that code it just fetches the
instructions from the cache memory and
uses it directly okay when the entire
bytecode is converted it is sent to the
operating system and your application
runs this way your java application is a
platform-independent application so all
of you write down on the chat window are
you clear with this as I say is clear
sir sends me a smiley she should say is
the sava program take more time to
execute than an equivalent program
written in C and our C++ that is not
really so that's not the case tissue
nano says yes saga says yes closer and
if they say yes Chris says yes what
about your sheets you are
clear with it Shiva says yes she chooses
fine sir that's good now we come to the
basic Java syntax okay we will start
with the data types that you use in Java
but before that what is a class an
object so first we come to classes and
object as I told you Java is an
object-oriented programming so
everything has to be present in a class
and you'll be revolving around objects
okay so what is a class a class is the
collection of objects which have the
same parameter as their class you can
consider a class as a template you can
consider class as a blueprint using that
blueprint you can make as many objects
as you want okay
an object is anything that really exists
in the world let's say you created a
class now that class had few things like
this using that class you created an
object now your object will contain the
same methods the same variables that the
class contains right so it is just the
copy of an object but in reality objects
are the things that are present class is
just a structure using which you can
create your objects I will show you on
Eclipse that is the IDE for development
Java for developing Java applications
now what is IDE ID is integrated
development environment okay using which
you can develop your java application on
to your systems and this ID is called
eclipse so I will just create a new
project file
I go to new I go to Java project I will
give the name like welcome to all of you
so next and finish in welcome I have got
a source folder in this source folder
I'll add a class because whatever code I
have to write will be present within the
class in Java so right-click new I go to
class I'll give a name to the class Java
itself I'll add the main method those of
you are very familiar with programming
they will understand why I am adding the
main method main method is considered to
be the starting point of your
application whenever your application
runs it
Nichole's main method and water whatever
thing that is present in the main method
will get executed now this is your class
right here that is public class Java so
whatever is present will be present in
this Java class itself there is opening
curly brace and there is a corresponding
closing curly brace okay if I remove
this main method so this is your class
now whatever code that you write will be
present in this class itself if I paste
the main method outside it it will give
me an error okay
so point is it is everything that you
write methods variables whatever
functionality that you will be providing
in your application should be present in
the class so you have understood class
whenever you will be declaring a class
you'll be using a class keyword like
this so class Java now within this I'll
declare an object of this class first of
all I will face the main method now I
declare an object I will show you how to
declare the object write the name of the
class for fault that is Java give a
object name OB equals 2 nu nu is an
operator that will allocate memory for
your object finally again write the
class name of the class put the
parentheses and semicolon this way you
create the object of the class that is
Java ob new Java all of you are you
clear with this please write down on the
chat window that is how to create a
class and then how to define an object
of that class RJ is clear sir what about
the rest of you the taste says yes come
on guys be quick shisha says here she
was easiest cristes yes wonderful
ok then getting back to the presentation
I come to data types in Java
what are data types data types defines
the nature of a value in real world you
have got many kinds of value you have
got numbers you have got letters you
have got sentences so how to store those
values in your application how to define
those values in your java application or
java programming for that you have got
data types in Java data types defines
the
nature of a value whether it is a number
whether it is a sentence whether it is a
character right so these are the
different kinds of data types we need
different data types to handle real
world information as I said now long
integer short by double float character
boolean character used to store the
letters fluid is four decimal numbers
double is also four decimal numbers but
the decimal spaces are more than that
byte is per single byte short is for
small integers int is for bigger
integers longest for much bigger
integers right so these are the
different data types that are present in
Java to store your different kinds of
values Nano says what is the size for
boolean for boolean there is no specific
size okay there is no defined size for
boolean okay now using the data types
you actually define your variables okay
variables are the containers that story
of values and you'd give a property to
the variable that this kind of value can
be stored in this variable let's say
let's understand what is the naming
convention of variables how to name a
particular variable so you can start
with the letter and underscore or a
dollar sign these are the three initials
using which you can define your valuable
name letter underscore or dollar sign
you cannot start the name of the
variable using a number if you write two
and then then other letters then it will
be an invalid valuable name
let's see few examples of a variable
right here underscore this is a correct
variable name now this variable can
store integer of a long time so this is
a big number it can be stored in this
you cannot store a sentence or a word in
this okay in this variable because it
has been defined long string starting
with F completely fine float starting
with dollar will work adj I I it will
work so these are all valid are all
valid variables okay if you start any
one any of the variable with a number in
that case your variable will be wrong
we'll be defined wrong so all of you
please write down on the chart window
are you clear with this question
are you clear with this part the tea
stages are just a scale Shiva says here
Krishna Saga suggest shishu sages okay I
have a question for all of you on this
the question is what the name of a
variable is known as its what is the
name of the variable is it the
identifier is it the datatype what it is
the name of the variable all of you
write down on the chart window what do
you think
see she says identifier exactly correct
the name of the variable is termed as
the identifier of the valuable because
using which you can you can identify the
variable hence it is called the
identifier you will be using that
variable by its name okay Nana says is F
in float is necessary yes in Java you'll
be mentioning a float value using F okay
after that it is not really necessary
but you can mention it by using F okay
now we'll understand what are static
versus non static variables there are
two kinds of variable static and
non-static static variables are shared
out all across shared across all the
objects of a class there is only one
copy present okay there's only one copy
present of that static vample now can
anyone of you tell me what is the real
world application of a static variable
where can we use a static value do you
have any idea any one of you please
write down on the chat window if yes or
if you do not know you can write know on
the chart I will give you the example
Shiva says usernames okay if you put
usernames for any neutral it could be
saga says no I just is no sir
money deep says yes okay I'll give you a
very good example let's consider a
company like a dear acre in that company
there will be many employees working so
each and every employee will have a
profile in the company
but they will be similarity in each and
every profile that is every for every
profile okay every profile will have a
common thing that is the name of the
company right for ready Rekha and Eureka
will be common in each and every profile
so what we can do we can store the name
of the company in a static valuable and
that static variable can be used and in
each and every profile even if the name
of the company changes what happens you
just have to change at one particular
place and that change will be reflected
everywhere because there is only one
copy of the valuable present so all of
you are you clear with this the
application of a static variable please
write down on the chat window Haji says
yes sir now clear letici J's she say is
nice example sir thank you she was says
yes money team says yes sir Christa's
yes okay non-static variables are not
shared there is a separate copy for each
individual live object okay now static
variables cannot be declared within a
method this is one condition with static
variables that is you cannot define a
static variable within a method money
deep say is good one sir thank you now
let's see how to define a static
variable in this class itself whenever
you have to define a static variable a
static keyword is used okay right static
give a name of a variable anything let's
say variable itself okay okay one thing
static then the datatype let's say
integer variable int and then the name
of the variables equals to assign a
value if you want let's say one okay so
this way you will be declaring your
static variable that is static and
valuable equals to one now
never you have to use the static
available what you will be doing let's
say I'm I want to print the value of
this static variable so system dot out
dot println you'll be using Java first
the name of the class that is Java dot
then dividable like this so all of you
are you clear with it because variable
is a kind of property of the class okay
because there is only one copy you'll be
using the name of the class and then
divide by yes it is it is a kind of
global variable if you place this
declaration inside the main method it
will give you an error right so that is
why it is said that static variable
cannot be defined within the method may
I know the reasons in studying so all of
you are you clear with this please write
down on the chat window out to define a
static variable and now how to use it I
just say yes sir
okay money deep says tell me the reason
another why it should not be placed
within a method if you place that
declaration within the method it will be
confined to the scopes of that method
itself okay that is why you cannot place
the declaration of that method that
variable within the method you have to
place it globally are you clear now many
deep please write down on the chat
window F yes okay I receive yes sir
that's good moving on we come to
operators in Java okay now we understood
how to store values in Java but there
are certain operations that could be
done using those values so how to do
those operations for that you have got
operators in Java these different
operators have been divided into
categories there are basically five
categories that are present in Java one
is the assignment operator arithmetic
operator relational operators logical
operators and uni operators
okay we'll discuss each one of them one
by one let's move on to the assignment
operator first of all
assignment operator simply assigns a
value to a variable okay let's say you
have a variable that is X which is of
integer type so you'll write x equals to
5 that means you are assigning a value 5
to variable X it is quite simple to
understand you define a variable integer
X you write equals 2 that is you are
assigning a value to that variable and
you write the value that is 5 6 anything
and you put a semicolon so using the
equals 2 assignment operator you are
assigning a value to a variable okay I
hope you have understood if no you can
write down moving on we come to the
ultimate echo operator like additional
operator subtraction operator
multiplication operator division modulo
you all are clear with addition
subtraction multiplication can anyone
tell me what is a modulo operator let's
say the value of x is 5 and the value of
y is 2 what will be the result if I
modulo them if I write X modulo by
shishu say is remainder operator shishu
say is 1 exactly saga says 1 what about
the rest of you Shiva says remainder
chicken says van RJ says remainder
exactly correct if you write if X is
equal to 5 and Y is 2 and if write X
modulo Y it will give you a result 1 it
will give you the remainder between them
I come to increment and decrement
operator do you have any idea how to use
an increment and decrement operator what
does it do
come on guys it is simple question
please write down on the chat window
Arjun says add in for loop ok money
Beach says plus 1 exactly correct Shiva
says plus 1
shishun says increments the value by 1
exactly correct if you write x plus plus
and the value of x was 3 then this time
it will be for it Clemente s' the value
of a variable by 1 and decrement
operator what it does it decrements the
value of a variable Y of 1 okay so all
of you are you clear with an assignment
operator and the arithmatic operator the
pistes prefix okay I'll let you know
the post-op post-increment and
pre-increment
okay once we learn the if and else
construct then I'll be showing you the
operators as well okay okay then moving
on relational operators it is used to
compare two values like greater than
less than greater than equal to less
than equals to equivalence is used to
check the values of two variables
whether they are equal or not let's say
x equals to 3 and Y is also equal to 3
and if you mention x equals to Y it will
give you a result true because they both
are equal right not equal to we'll check
their value should not be equal right so
I guess you are quite clear with this
because this is quite easy to understand
greater than whether the value of X is
greater than Y or not whether the value
of X is less than Y or not greater than
equal to less than equal to equivalence
and finally not equal to moving on I
come to logical operators this is
somewhat logical okay that is it returns
true or false value based on the state
of the variables these logical operators
work on two conditions ok first
condition and second condition
conditional and we'll give you a result
true when both the conditions are true
ok conditional or we'll give you a
result true when either of the
conditions are true let's say first one
is true second one is true it will give
you a result true first one is true
second one is false it will give you a
result true first when is false
second one is true it will again give
you a result true but if both the
conditions are false in that case it
will give you a result false so that is
the conditional or widthwise and and
bitwise or works in the similar fashion
but they work on singular bits okay that
is 1 1 will give you 1 1 0 will give you
a 0 0 1 0 0 0 will give you 0 in or it
is opposite that is either of them is 1
it will give you a result 1 or it will
give you 0 not operator is used to
complement the values if you write not 1
it will give you a result 0 if you write
not
true it will give you a result false
eggs or operator can anyone of you tell
me
in how many conditions will an XOR
operator give you a result true in what
conditions if you can give me the
conditions as well tell me if both the
conditions are true and I put XOR
operator will it give me a true result
he is right down on the chat window she
should say is no what about the rest of
you sagar says yes money deep says yes
and no it will not give you a result
true and true in XOR operator gives you
a false result now tell me if it is both
the conditions are false will an XOR
operator give the result if both are
false shiva say is true she should say
is no exactly correct issue if both the
conditions are same whether it is true
or false in those conditions it will
always give you a result false for true
and true condition it will give you a
false if both the conditions are false
in that case also it will give you a
false result so when it will give you a
true result when both the conditions are
alternate first one is true second is
false it will give you a result true
first one is false second one is true it
will give you a result true so all of
you exactly it is true and false will
always give you a result true false and
true will give you a result true so all
of you please write down on the chat
window are you clear with logical
operators false false will give you a
false result Rajat RJ because conditions
are same right both the conditions are
same in that case XOR will give you a
false result money deep says FF gives
you f I just say is thank you sir okay
then moving on I come to statements and
blocks what are statements in Java a
simple statement is a command terminated
by a semicolon if you write name equals
to Fred and you put a semicolon so this
is one statement but if a block is a
compound statement enclosed in curly
braces
in a block you have your curly braces
opening curly brace and a closing curly
brace within that you can have multiple
statement as you can see you can find
one semicolon so this is one statement
second semicolon this is the second
statement and the third thing is blocks
may contain other blocks within them
that is the nested blocks let's see in
our program do we have them or not I can
find one statement one semicolon so this
is one statement this is the second
statement this is the third statement so
statements are present in Java that's
correct
moving on I'll search for a block I find
a opening curly brace and is a closing
curly brace so this is one block this
block contains multiple statements
within that okay I find another block
that is opening curly brace and the hair
is the corresponding curly brace so this
is one another block which contains a
block inside that and there are multiple
statements within that okay so all the
things that were written in the
presentation were quite true so all of
you have you understood what is a
statement and what are blocks okay
that's good I receive yes A's what about
the rest of you okay moving on we come
to flow of control Java executes one
statement after the other in the order
they are written that means if you write
ten statements from one two three four
five six till ten then first statement
will get executed first then the second
one then the third one fourth fifth six
seven in the ascending order
right so one statement gets executed one
after the other this is the way Java
executes the application if you want to
see an example I can show it to you I
will just removed
I'll just print numbers from one to ten
system dot println one I will copy this
line till five okay two three four five
and I'll change the numbers two three
three four five now if Java executes one
by one okay line by line then I should
receive an ascending order that is one
till five or else I could receive any
pattern so if I run the code now I
receive one two three four five that
means Java execute the statements one
after the other line by line I hope
every one of you is quite clear with
this getting back to the presentation
will come to much important part and an
interesting one we can alternate the
flow of statements okay right now you
saw that each and every line gets
executed one after the other but we can
alternate the flow of execution by using
if if-else and switch I will tell you
how to do that one by one you will also
go through looping concepts that is for
loop while loop and dowhile loop we'll
learn that as well first of all
understand what are the basic constructs
if else which statement for loop while
loop and do-while loop first of all if
else in if you place a condition okay on
the basis of that condition if the
condition is true it will execute the if
block okay execute these statements if
conditions are true if if the condition
turns out to be false it will execute
the else block execute these statements
if condition is false okay
so using which you can alternate the
flow if true only this will get executed
and else will be skipped if condition is
false it will leave the if block and it
will only execute the else block let us
try to understand this using Eclipse I
will come and I will just remove it so
I'll write if let's use the static
variable itself
I will check if variable is
equal now I'm using operators so all of
you please have a close look I am using
the equivalent operator so if I write
equals to one I place the flock and I I
have got the corresponding else block
okay
if the condition is true it will execute
the F blocks all right system dot out
dot println I will only mention true
okay I'll just copy this line and I will
paste it here and I will change the
output statement to false right fol SC
fals C now all of you piece I done on
the chat window if I run this code what
will be the result that I would receive
will both the statement get executed
will only one and if one then which one
all of you writes true that's good I
write I press ctrl f11 and on the
console window I can see true as a
result because what is happening it is
checking the condition right here if the
condition is true it only executes the
if block and it will skip this part so
that means you have alternated the flow
of execution if I just change not equal
to one now this time the condition is
false because variable is equals to one
yes money deep it will return a result
false I run the code and I receive false
this time what happened the condition
was false it skipped this part and
directly executed this one so all of you
are you clear with this each and every
one of you write down on the chat window
if it is then I will show you an
operator or an XOR very quickly
okay good
now I placed a now and operator now can
you tell me what will be the result if I
write this statement if I run this code
what will be the result I would receive
it is variable equivalence one when he
deep says true none who says true RJ say
is true it a say is true that's good
control f11 and I receive true because
both the conditions are true and will
give you a true result I will just make
one condition false saving the file
running the code this time one is false
so I am receiving a false result in all
the other conditions also I will receive
a false result in the case of
conditional and I will just change to
conditional are not tell me in and it
gave me a wrong result what if I change
it toward what happens this time if I
run the code Shiva is true so I can say
is false saga C is true okay
this time it is for conditional for I
run f11 it will give you a true result
because one of the condition is true for
Lu oh sorry
conditional Ord operator will always
give you a true result when either of
the condition is true so this time one
condition was true it give you it will
give you a result true it will only give
you a false result when both the
conditions are false that is right now
both conditions are false right now so
it gives you a false result in the
console window now finally I come to
exhaust this is the XOR operator not
tell me what will be the result that I
would receive be quick guys everyone it
is quite easy answer sheesh you say is
true sagar shiva Rajesh's sagar and c
VAR c is false and RJ is true okay I'll
go with Sagar and Siva
and the result will be false why because
both the conditions are false and you
are using the eggs or operator since
both the conditions are same it will
always give you a false result
even if I change both the conditions to
true again it will give me a false
result because both the conditions are
same but if either of the condition
becomes false it gives me a true result
right here that is one is false
second is true it gives me a result true
now I will make the first one true and
the second one false it will again give
me a result true
okay so conditions should not be same in
case of XOR operator then only it will
give you a result true so all of you
write down on the chat window
are you clear with this all the
operators the conditional operators she
can say is please explain again she
can't in XOR operator what happens if
the conditions are not same okay there
are two conditions always if first
condition is true then second should be
false then only it will give you a
result true if first is false the second
should be true if you want the result
true in case of conditioner conditioner
legs are okay if first is false
second is true it will give you a result
false if first is false second is also
false it will give you a result false
are you clear now chicken he says okay
thank you sir you're welcome
now I come to switch statement I will
show you how to use a switch statement
in a switch statement you pass an
expression it has a value okay and you
make different conditions for that if it
is first condition it will print this
one and it will get out of the loop if
it is second condition it will print
this one and it will get out of the
switch case okay
if it does not match is any condition it
will directly print the default block so
without wasting any time let's go to
eclipse and understand how to implement
an ex switch case so I will just comment
this part I come to switch case okay I
will define I integer variable for an
expression so I will write int key
equals to 1 I will make few cases till 3
case 1 if it is case 1 it should print
system dot out dot println
case 1 okay
I'll just copy this part I will make one
more case I'll I will change the case to
2 &amp;amp; 2
okay now what I am doing I am passing
key within the switch case okay so if
the value of key is 1 it will print this
one statement and using the break
statement it will get out of the switch
case if the value of key is - it will
only print this one and it will use the
break statement and it will get out of
the loop right if the value of key is
not one or two it will directly go to
differ and it will print default okay so
all of you if I run this code what will
be the result that I would receive
all of you please write down on the chat
window okay I received case one exactly
correct if I run this code only case
when will get printed if I change the
value of key to two and I save the file
and I run the code again I received case
two only since break statement I present
it only prints this one and gets out
gets you out of this which case now if I
change to five if the value of K key is
five what happens now all of you be
quick and tell me the answer the T says
case argument secured non final
variables that is not so this does that
answer your query in nitish I just has
default we've printed she shoes shriek
on Shiva everyone sees it ctrl f11 and
it runs the code so Nitish please write
down on the chat window if it is clear
to you
you
okay.i jesse is clearly t says yes
that's good
getting back to the presentation now now
will understand the loops how to use the
loop please run right without final key
even if I remove the final key okay
Sri can case arguments must be final or
not like you're talking about this one
Nitish Figgins I'll just run the code
and it is let me know if you're talking
about one to these things so it runs the
same okay yes it has to be constant okay
this values has to be constant
Nitish is that clear I hope it is please
write down on the chart okay thank you
now moving on we'll be understanding the
loops the for loop first of all we'll
see the working of all the three loops
there are three kinds of tube that I
used in Java the for loop the while loop
and dowhile loop will see the working
first of all and then we'll implement
all the three loops at once so in a for
loop you write for integer I codes to
zero I less than 5 I plus plus then you
have your statement statement 1 &amp;amp; 2 till
the time the condition is true it will
keep on executing the statement so first
of all your variable gets initialized
that is integer I equals 3 equals to 0
that is the counter variable after that
it checks the condition whether the
value of I is less than 5 or not if it
is true if the condition turns out to be
true it goes inside and execute these
statements right here after doing the or
it comes back and increments the value
of fiber one after an incrementing it
will again check the condition if the
value of I is less than 5 it will again
go inside execute the statements and
come back increment the value this cycle
will keep on running till the condition
gets false okay as soon as the value of
I is equal to 5 it will get you out of
you okay so all of you are clear with
the working of for-loop then I'll move
on to the while loop okay I receive yes
and clear sir that's good
moving on I come to the Veilleux she
should say is what's happened if the if
any of the case labor lives outside the
range of switch argument I if you do not
mean you cannot make place your case off
beyond the switch block okay you cannot
place it outside this which blocks
tissue everything has to be present in
the switch block all the cases has to be
present there this is the syntax you
cannot keep the case outside that yes RJ
I will give the answer first will
understand all the loop so I come to the
while loop now sheesh you just write the
code that you want me to implement I
will implement that okay just write the
entire line that you want to do it I'll
do it and I'll show it to you okay Nana
says what it none when RJ says what is
the difference between false for loop
and while loop I'll come to that point
let's understand the working first so we
come to while loop now we first of all
initialized the variable right here that
is integer I equals to zero we move on
check the condition when the condition
is true it moves in the inside and
increments the value sorry it moves
inside and executes the code after
executing the statements we come and
increment the value of I Shiva everyone
I would request each and every one of
you first we should come cover the
entire loops that is for loop while loop
and dowhile loop and when we come on
eclipse then we'll try all the examples
right shall I continue please write down
on the chart and if it is okay with
everyone okay that's good thank you
so I was saying that it increments the
value then it Akane's come back and
checks the condition if the condition
turns out to be true it will again come
back and secure the statement increment
the value of I and it will come here now
the difference between for loop and why
you first the syntax of for and while
loop is quite different
second thing is for loop and while loop
actually runs the same it will run for
the same number of times but there's
only one difference for loop should be
used when you are very sure of the
number of violations if you know that
your loop has to run exactly ten number
of times in that case you'll be using a
for loop but if you are not sure about
it in that case you'll be using a while
loop like if you want to run an infinite
loop for running an infinite loop you
should always use a while loop so RJ and
nunno does it is that does that answer
your query please write down on the chat
window and I'll move on
okay IJ Nano says clear I come to -
while you now when you write do-while
loop you will be using the do keyword
you open up the bracket you close the
brackets you write while keyword and you
check the condition in do-while loop
what happens first the condition is
initialized then it comes in and execute
the statements it will check the
condition sorry it will increment the
value check the condition if the
condition is true it will again come
back and execute the statement this
cycle will keep on going but there is a
difference between four and vile foreign
vile will run exactly the same but there
is a difference in do-while can anyone
of you tell me please write down on
staff and Oh what is the difference come
on guys be quick what is so different
about the do-while loop okay do value
what it does yes I shall explain it see
shoe says it will execute the statement
at least once exactly correct Shiva says
it first prints and then checks exactly
the T stays do-while will enter at least
once exactly correct she gon say they
checks condition first know it takes
candy
in last yes regard you are also correct
okay so the difference is it will first
execute the statement then increment the
value and then check the condition okay
but in the other two loops the condition
was checked first and then the statement
was printed so do-while loop will at
least run for once even if the condition
is false because the condition is
checked at the end okay let's see on
Eclipse how to implement them okay I had
a question on Swift case I will just
cover that first infants which are a
case for three to seven six system of
outside make any case that does not
matter like case four three two seven
six four three two seven six seven seven
will also work like this
okay break place anything that you want
to plane does that answer your query
shishu please write down on the chat
window she shoe does that answers your
query I'll just come in this part I've
done exactly same as you said hope it is
fine with you control seven now I'll
understand the loops
first of all I'll run the for loop so
for int I equals to zero this is the V
ride you place the condition then I less
than five and I plus plus I'm using the
same for example that is given in the
presentation I'll print the value of I
system dot out dot println I will place
I now all of you tell me if I run this
code she she says explain once again she
shoe you told me to place the case right
and in this but it will print outside as
you said but this won't come because
now if the value of key right here on
the table if the value of key becomes
equal to 4 3 2 4 7 then only it will
print this one that is outside or else
this case won't come you can make as
many cases as you want so how can we
execute without remaining number case 4
3 that does not matter it only checks
the value okay I'll just slide 4 3 7 3
but 4 3 2 4 7 ok I just write this I'll
just come in this for loop running the
code this time it will print outside
through an outside true is getting
printed because of the top right here
they fun is it now clear do you see shoe
and RJ I hope it is if it is not right
yourself you'll understand the concept
okay till the time you don't try it
yourself you won't be able to grab the
concept very easy now I was on for loop
now tell me if I if I run this for loop
what will be the result that I would
receive all of you be quick Shiva says 0
to 4 do you think she was correct
everyone please write down on the chat
window do you think is correct saga say
0 to 4 exactly correct I run the code I
received the value as 0 to 4 0 1 2 3 4
ok that's good I come to the while loop
now control 7 I come to while while loop
with condition I will define a variable
for it that is indeed your condition
itself you can have any variable equals
to 0 I'm initializing the counter first
okay within that I'll check the
condition this was my actual doubt she
chooses okay she shoe right now we are
actually confined with the time
constraint okay once you are actually in
the course we'll discuss each and every
topic in very detail right is that fine
so I'll have to move on with the class
he says okay so I take the condition and
place a condition like X is less than
five system dot out dot println I'll
paint the value of X and I will
increment the value of X X plus plus so
this way I will be running a while loop
so all of you write down on the chat
window are you clear with this if I run
this code what will be the result that I
would receive
exactly zero to four control f11 I
received the same result zero four and
now I will show you the do-while loop
do-while loop in this place of condition
X less than 5 the same condition system
dot out println same statement I'll
print X and increment X X plus plus if I
run this code I will receive the same
value that is 0 to 4
now just to check I'll make the value as
10 now condition is false X is not less
than 5 even then it will print for one
time that is 10 so all of you are you
now clear how to use for loop while loop
and do-while loop please write down on
the chat window ok I receive all the
essays now I will show you how to
implement an array itself so in order to
implement an array what you do you first
of all mention the data type
you mentioned the square bracket you
write the array name equals 2 you write
the new operator and then again you get
the dollar type open the brackets and
you give the size of the array something
like 5 so this way you'll be writing and
declaring an array money deep says for
each loop now within that I run a for
each loop itself so this is a for each
loop I place integer I array within that
I'll assign the value a double are now
this is the way I am assigning the value
in the array so I write a double are
brackets
I'll have to define a variable also in
teacher I equals to zero sorry
make it a different variable I will
place Z here equals to Z plus 1
within that I'll increment the value
also Z plus plus so all of you if I run
this loop finally what I will also print
the value of this that is system dot out
dot println I'll print I'll use another
loop for this if you use a for loop it
would do the exact thing so this is how
you use a for each loop in this help in
the value of array system dot out dot
println I'll print a values so all of
you are you clear with this how I'm
assigning a value what I am doing and
running the array now if I run this code
what will be the result that I would
receive everyone be quick tell me the
answer what do you think will be the
result if I run this code I'm assigning
the values that Plus Ones the first time
it will go one into the array shishu say
is one two five is a six no it will go
one two five two four six eight ten no
money deep it won't do that okay I'll
just run the code as I said you can see
I receive a value one two three four
five because Z it is not incrementing
the value of said we are only putting
one extra value or in the array so when
Z is zero I'll assign value one in the
array so all of you are you now clear
how to use an array please write down on
the chat window okay I see yes that's
good now what is a method method has got
five components right return type method
name parameter less and a method body so
this is a
type of method value to be returned name
of the method and you can pass any value
let's say there is an ADD method that
add method will use two integer values
to add the product so int X and int Y
will be required those values will be
used in the body of the method and you
can add those numbers right so return
type whether this method is actually
returning anything or not if yes integer
character it could return anything if it
is not returning anything it could be
void that means empty so all of you I
clear with the syntax T how to declare a
method please write down on the chat
window then I will go to eclipse and I
will define a method okay I come here
let's say our method is not returning
anything it is void
ABC not taking any input and finally
this so this is a simple method which is
not taking any parameter it is not
returning anything okay if you call this
method it will only print say I'm a
method okay it will print a statement I
save my file
we come to the main method I'll just
comment this part
okay I'll have to create the object of
this class I have a object that is OB
using the object I'll move this line
right here here itself OB and I use OB
dot using dot I can use the method as
well I put a semicolon now if I run this
code what I will receive I am a method
okay so all of you I clear with this
simple method then I will show you how
to return a value how to take parameters
in it RJC is clear so what about the
rest of you P side down on the chat
window okay that's very good this time I
will make a add method ad so I will
return I integer value I'll make it a
double D ad in this I'll write integer X
comma integer boy now I have to add a
return value as well I'll return the sum
of x and y so I you clear with this
method what I am doing in here I will
take two values in this and I just add
those values and I will return the value
that will also get an integer type so
this method is take taking two inputs as
parameter and one input as return type
okay it is giving an output that is a
integer value now if I call this method
from here that is ad now I have to pass
two values in it I pass five comma five
and I save the file I run this code I
receive okay I have to print this as
well system dot out dot println and this
so I place this call here in the output
method I run this code once again I
receive I am a method and receive the
sum of five and five that is ten exactly
correct RJ now every one of you are you
clear with this methods how to use them
how to call them please write down on
the chat window and then Phi
we'll move on to few interesting
questions that you will be giving the
answers okay the funds why so OB dot add
Shiva whenever you have to use a method
now this method that is ad method is
present in the class that is Java right
so when I have to use this Java method I
have to create a knob when I have to use
this ad method I have to create an
object of Java that is Java OB equals to
new Java using that I'll print I can
call the method that is OB dot ad and I
will be passing two values in it you
cannot directly use a method without
using the object of that class
are you clear Shiva please write down on
the chat window
okay then hopefully yes everyone are you
clear with methods please write down we
are already done with the race okay she
can say yes what about the letter G says
clear sir Shiva please tell me Shiva
says yes that's good Sakshi sagar shishu
when he says yes sir okay then a small
example of arrays saga says yes you
wrote this statement it created an array
in the memory array 0 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 because
the index starts from 0 and it will go
till 4 so there are 5 elements all
together now I run a for loop in detail
I could 0 I less than 5 I plus plus and
I am putting one extra value into the
array if I 0 1 will go in 0 position so
when for the first time one comes here
for the second time when the loop runs 2
goes in the array 1 position for the
third time 3 terms for the four times
four comes and for the fifth time five
comes in array for position so this is
how it works when you run your array
since that clear to you everyone the
execution how it happens really saga see
yes okay now these are some more
examples of an array you can use the dot
length property of an array to find the
length of the array line numbers are
coming or not in Eclipse no line numbers
are not coming you have to right-click
here show line numbers so this way you
can see the line numbers many be okay
okay one of you says yes sir that's good
now it's time for a few questions I've
got two three questions for you let's
see whether you have understood things
or not
please tell me the output of this
program right here if yes if you can
tell me that's very good if you cannot
tell me just right now on the chart I'll
tell you the solution if I run this code
what will be the output that I will
receive now these are the kind of
questions that will actually come in the
simulation test okay that is the real
OCPD ap examination so that is why we I
want you to go through these questions
so that you can understand the standard
of it money deep says no sir what about
the rest of you yet it is very simple
only kochava concept is present but it
is a bit tricky you just have to go
through it with a good concentration and
you will get your answer sagar gives me
an answer 49 do you think sagar is
correct
rj says no sir shiva says we didn't
create object yes we did create you as
soon as you write new eddie Rekha this
is not the normal version okay this is
not the normal index Shiva hence this is
also one way by using which you can use
the object so I use the class like this
new equals 2d like a bracket start go it
will directly go call this function and
I passed a boolean value test and the
value of x are jc7
I don't think so sagar your answer is
correct that is 49 I'll just show you
the solution everyone
so I'll just open question one right
here what is happening you have a
boolean variable that is true RJ says
congrats since as smiley for you saga
test that is the value I will just
changes to false true okay it is true
integer value is x 343 now it calls a
function that is go in go what is passed
first the boolean value true is passed
which is saved in B variable and then X
values pass which is saved in AI
variable you in the go function what you
are doing you're checking whether B is
true or not if B is true it will return
the value I divided with seven that is
343 divided by 7 which will give you a
result 49 okay that 49 years assigned to
Y and it gets printed around the code
and I receive the result as 49 so all of
you are you clear now if I change the
condition to false then our J's answer
would be correct that is 7 I save the
file or run the code I receive seven
this time because the condition was
false here it did not execute this one
it directly came to this one so 343
divided by 49 will actually give you a
result 7 so all of you are you clear
with this code with this example then
I'll move on to the second question I J
many deep everyone says clear she can
say is good burn that's good so this is
the reason I am showing you the quotient
so that you can understand the standard
of OCP JP and you should understand the
necessity that you should need practice
and you need a guidance you need to
prepare for OCP JP right I come to
question second now can you all give me
the answer you have to bring the output
that is Bar there is a space and then
twelve point three four five which of
the statement will exactly print this
one where the first one will print this
one or second one or the third one money
gives me an answer that's good and he's
correct he's saying that the third one
will print the answer what do you think
Saugus is third one Raj is a second one
no saga third one exactly many deep is
also got it third one will print I'll
just go to the code that is question 2
I'll just open it now I'll just print
the third one you can see the same
output space is given what is shown is
that if you write % i 7.3 F what it is
actually doing is it is telling you that
after decimal there should be three
values so 343 has been printed if you
write 7-7 means total number of
characters and spaces should be 7 money
D say 7 spaces and three letters exactly
correct if you counted 5 4 3 dot is 4 5
6 and finally 7 so 7 spaces and 3 values
after the dot so all of you are you
clear with this why the third one is
printing the exact thing please write
down on the chart window
RJ stays clear sir shiva says yes what
about the rest many deep says yes what
about the rest of you be quick guys
sagar says yes she can talk in that
skirt moving on i come to the third
question public ed Eureka mean this is a
two-dimensional array I told you one
dimensional array so now tell me if the
concept is clear to you what will be the
result that would be printed if I
execute this code
can you give me the answer the rest a
few those of you those of you have given
me the correct answer previously do you
have the answer to this one now there
sometimes what happens in examination
you receive questions which are out of
course so this is an out of course
question can you tell me sagar says six
no sagar just go through it once again
you are quite close Shiva says
compilation fails not the answer the
autumn says four no Gotham not correct
hardy says to Noah J it's not correct we
are left with three and seven saga c7
exactly correct saga that is the correct
answer
now I'll tell you how it is seven I come
to question three exact implementation
has been done right here now see how it
is divided a two dimensional arrays
something like this so you have defined
a two dimensional array in de jure X
with two brackets one way is this you
can also mention it like this right now
you have divided the first block so this
is the zero block this is the first
block and this is the second block so it
will come in the first part so when you
write - you are directly coming to the
second block okay and when you mention
one inside so first one is zero second
one is one so it is printing the result
seven four run this code control f11
okay I receive the result seven in the
console window are you guys clear with
it please write down on the chat window
RJ says clear Chacon says got it Shiva
once again okay Shiva what I am doing I
have got two blocks for the first block
I am defining like this this one is one
block so it is zero block
second at a second block and this is
third so this is third block now in here
I am printing the second block so this
is first here it is written too so it is
directly going to the second block first
then second values burnt so first one is
0 1 2 3 since it was born it fetched 7
and printed on the console window Shiva
is it clear now Shiva says got it that's
good what about sushi sushi are you
clear with it Gautham Devane gotham's is
okay
ok hopefully everyone has got it so
these are just tricky questions right
these are all from the core concepts
core java console but you need to be
practiced with that right we come to the
question for now now give me an answer
quickly everyone this is an ArrayList
again and out of course question
ArrayList is a dynamic list okay that
means you do not have to give the size
of the array list or you can take it as
an assignment if you want if you do not
have the answer I will give you the
answer for this rgeous is c ru this time
you have got the correct answer saga cc
correct absolutely correct you're
actually intelligent guys so I come here
I come to question foo source folder and
I go to add array card are ten now this
was the code what is happening I'm
defining an ArrayList this is the way
our a let's just define you are giving
the data type is integer that means
ArrayList a will contain integer values
so first of all you add a value 1 you
add a value 5 and then you add a value 3
then you call the collections array is a
kind of collections that is present in
Java so in order to sort
collection you write collection dot sort
and you pass the ArrayList within that
so when you pass it what it will do it
will sort it I'll just comment these two
lines first of all I will show you this
sorting I run the code before sorting
I'll also come into the sorting part as
well I run the code I received one five
and three okay right now they are not
sorted i will uncomment this collection
I will save the file I will run the code
again I received one three five so they
were sorted in ascending order finally
again I add a variable a dot add two so
when I added it will come in the end one
three five and it comes to okay then
again I call a reverse function what is
reverse function doing it will just
reverse it so when you reverse it you
should receive a result two five three
and one when I run the code I will
receive the same result that is two five
three and one that is the third answer
was correct so all of you are you clear
with this the collections the ArrayList
and the reverse and sort function
