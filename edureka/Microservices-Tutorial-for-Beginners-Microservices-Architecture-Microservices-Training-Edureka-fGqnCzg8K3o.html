Rica and welcome to today's session on
micro-services tutorial so thank you all
the attendees for joining in today's
session before we get started all the
features give me a quick confirmation on
the chat window
whether I'm audible or not okay I've
called a yes from Rohit Sakshi saamiya
Harsha and I've got a few more yeses -
okay so now we are good enough to start
so first let's start by looking at all
the topics we are going to cover in
today's session we will start by
understanding what was before
microservices that is the morning of the
kharka tech chure and then sees
challenges after that we will deep dive
into what are exactly microservices and
then learn more about its architecture
finally I will end this session by
showcasing a practical implementation of
micro services on Eclipse using split
vote so guys I hope that you're clear
with today's agenda
okay I've got many S's so let's get
started with it now many of you may
think why should you learn micro
services well I could justify by saying
that many multinational companies such
as eBay Netflix Amazon who will use
micro services in their company
structure not just a multinational
companies but the percentage of people
using micro services has also
tentatively increased looking at the job
opportunities the average salary of
micro services ranges from approximately
ninety seven thousand dollars per year
for a software engineer and the range of
a hundred and sixteen dollars per year
for a senior software engineer isn't it
great so now that you have a good reason
to learn micro services let's deep dive
into learning more about micro services
look at the scenario on the screen here
Alice watch TV shows using an online
media service called Media muqaam which
is similar to your Netflix or Amazon
Prime
so basically media mode is an
entertainment company which provides
streaming media and videos online it
consists of various genres of TV shows
with different languages just like
Netflix and Amazon
so in the past medium mo was also built
as a large monolithic application where
a team of developers would take lot of
time to build all the features in the
application on a single codebase
so here developers had to rewrite the
code for every part of the application
it's really confusing isn't it let me
give you a proper definition of
monolithic architecture monolithic
architecture can be defined as a
framework wherein all the features of
the system are put on a single codebase
and are under a single database so your
features such as recommendations most
popular content catalog are all put on a
single codebase and on a single database
now after decades of software
development there are a vast amount of
codes already present out there that the
developers can use as a base of their
application so why would the developers
want to rewrite the code again in a game
but here since media more uses the
monolithic framework this raises a
fantastic question about the challenges
about this architecture so now let's
look into the challenges of the
monolithic architecture by looking at
some scenarios scenario 1 assume that
the developers wanted to make immediate
changes in the application how would
they do this well the monolithic
application can definitely accommodate
these changes but the problem here is
that so developers must rebuild the code
for every small change they make in any
particular feature so even if they want
to update a small change in a particular
feature the complete system must be
reframed again look at the second
scenario where the developers want to
update all the playlists according to
the most popular TV shows and also want
to simultaneously update all the videos
to the HD quality in such scenarios
developers cannot scale the application
simultaneously instead new instances of
the same application must be created
every time a new feature has to be
developed or deployed coming to the
third scenario consider the scenario
where developers of this application are
comfortable with various technologies
like Java C++
dotnet C hash etc now in
situation even though they're
comfortable with various technologies
they still have to pay large and complex
application on a single technology that
is on the technology medium or was built
finally consider the situation where a
specific feature is not working in the
application in such scenarios the
company's system goes down because of
this problem in order to tackle this
problem the application must be rebuilt
retested and redeployed this means that
the application has to be built from the
scratch again so now all of you might be
thinking how will the developers of me
demo overcome these complexities well
developers decided to react attack the
monolithic application into multiple
individual deployable components called
as micro services so here is the million
dollar question what are micro services
micro services is an architecture
wherein all the components of the system
are put into individual components which
can be built deployed and scaled
individually this means that each
component is independent of each other
ok so well Rohit just asked me a
question if I could simplify the
definition of macro services so ro well
let me explain you with a simple analogy
you must have seen how bees build their
honeycomb by aligning hexagonal wax
cells they initially start with a small
section using various materials and
continue to build a large beehive out of
it these cells form a pattern resulting
in a strong structure which holds
together a section of beehive here each
cell is independent of each other but it
is also correlated with the other sets
this means that damage to one cell does
not damage to the other cells so bees
can reconstruct these cells without
impacting the complete beehive look at
the diagram on the screen each hexagonal
shape represents an individual service
component so similar to the working of
the bees each age IT builds an
individual service component with the
available frameworks and the chosen
technology stack so the recommendation
system can
on a specific technology the video
plotting team can build this feature on
a specific technology and so on just as
in beehive
each service component forms a strong
micro service architecture to provide
better scalability that is a particular
service can scale at its maximum without
impacting the other services also issues
with each service component can be
handled individually by the agile team
with no or minimal impact on the entire
application so even if any one feature
is down this does not close down the
complete application but only that
particular feature has to be rebuilt
so Rohith I hope I have simplified the
definition for you coming back to the
scenario consider the situation when you
log into your account or Netflix or
Amazon Prime what do you want see you
just see the recommended shows right so
similar to that when Alice logs on into
her account she sees a list of
recommended shows but after some
searching she finally gets her TV show
she wants to watch now what if Alice
wants a TV show with just a single click
how will the developers of media more
fulfill Alice request to fulfill Alice
requests developers of media mode
decided to shift their application from
a monolithic architecture to micro
services
but before getting into how did the
developers shift their monolithic
framework into micro services let me
brief you a little bit about different
parts of micro service architecture the
architecture consists of various users
who send requests from various devices
these requests are authenticated by the
identity provider and a passed on to the
API gateway API gateway thus acts as an
entry point for all the client requests
and passes the request to the specific
micro services to be processed
apart from the main components the
architecture has other paths also such
as static content which houses all the
content from the system service
discovery which acts as a guide to find
the route of communication between micro
services the content delivery networks
which is basically a distributed network
of proxy servers and their data centers
now all of you might be thinking how
will these paths work together on
application to process Alice requests as
request is first files on to the
identity provider then the identity
provider
thus authenticates Alice requests by
identifying her as a regular user on me
demo these requests are passed on to the
API gateway which acts as an entry point
for Alice to forward a request to the
appropriate micro services in this kind
of framework each feature has its own
working micro service handling their own
data these micro services also have
their own load balancers and execution
environments to function properly this
means that the most popular content the
reader uploading the search function the
content catalog all have the load
balancers handling the data and their
execution environments to perform the
functionalities so the developers are
divided into small agile teams such as
content team video uploading team most
running team search team etc each team
has its own functionalities like the
content team consists of millions of TV
shows that the application provides the
video pleasing team has the
responsibility to upload all the content
into the application the most training
team houses the most trending shows
according to the geographical location
of users and so on these small team of
developers they like each and every
piece of content with a metadata that
describes the searched content then
metadata is fed into another micro
service that is the search function
which ensures Alice search results are
captured in the content catalog the
third micro service tells the most
trending micro service captures the
trending content among all the media
more users according to their
geographical locations the content from
this micro service is what Alice sees
when she first logs into media moe so
these individually deplorable micro
services are put into specific
containers to join the application so
what exactly are containers containers
are used to deliver the core to the
sector where deployment is required this
means that they plug and play so if a
micro service isn't working properly for
the application then the developers can
take it out and replace it with a new
one by
before they join the application to work
together to still have to find each
other to fulfill Allah's request which
is basically how will they communicate
with each other when micro-services use
service discovery which acts as a guide
to find the road of communication
between each of ten micro-services then
communicate with each other while
stateless server either by HTTP or
message bus after micro-services
communicate within themselves they have
to deploy the static content to a
cloud-based storage service that can
deliver it directly to the clients wire
content delivery networks so Sakshi has
a question now what are exactly API is
doing that we've learned in the
architecture for a micro service
architecture to function the
infrastructures components must be able
to interact with each other so each
individual micro service must be able to
communicate with every other micro
service in the architecture as well as
with the applications and the websites
the power and the databases from which
to draw real-time information essential
for the functioning so when Ali searches
for her TV show the search micro service
communicates with the content catalog
service in API about what is exactly
Alice searching for and then these micro
service compare the typed words with the
metadata they already have stored in the
database then the most trending micro
service captures the most popular theta
among all the users of media Moe and
stores it in the database once the team
of developers captured the most type
words by Alice the analytics team update
the code in recommendations micro
service and compare Alice most-viewed
content and the Preferences to the
popular content among other users in the
same geographical region this means that
the next time Alice logs on to the
application
she not only sees the most popular
content but also finds a personalised
playlist which contains the shows she
has previously viewed this is similar to
how Netflix and Amazon work isn't it
so in this way Alice request is
fulfilled by the development team in a
quick manner as they did not have to
build the
clean application again and just had to
update the code to deploy this new
functionality now coming to the
practical implementation of micro
services let's look into how you can
create and run springboard projects on
Eclipse for micro services for this demo
I will be using Java of version 1.8 and
spring tools sood which is a spring
starter plugin so you can download the
spring Starke a plugin from eclipse
marketplace so this is an example
project which demonstrates the use of
micro services for a site offering ways
TV shows this project back-end is
powered by trade micro services to use a
service TV show service and the user
booking service let me show you the
project structure of each micro services
one by one so let's start with the user
service
let me just open all the files okay so
the user service has an auto created
Java file which imports various classes
and annotations we import springboard
applications so that it can trigger key
configurations for anyone Auto
configuration and others okay now Harsha
is a question on what does it exactly
mean by exclude data source Auto
configuration well this means that we
want to disable data source Auto
configuration move over to complication
and others for our application now I've
created another package for the
controller file and in this file I'm
going to import all the data from the
JSON file in the resources folder let me
just open it okay so I've started the
file by importing rest controller
annotation so that we no longer have to
add response body annotation to all the
requests papac methods after that I have
created a map object users which Maps
the keys to the values so our key value
will be of strength type and the values
would be of user type so basically I
have created an object of hash map which
is a subclass of map so if you observe
the JSON file you can see that ID name
email a mark onto various values such as
John J in a shock etc these fields are
then defined in the use of the Java file
under this package coming back to the
controller file the post construct
method is you so that beam is fully
initialized and you can use the
dependencies moving forward we have used
parametrized I preference for
typecasting basically the purpose of
this class is to enable capturing and
passing the generic type to capture the
generic type and retain it at runtime
you need to create a subclass the
resulting type reference instance can be
used to obtain a type instance that
carries the captured parametrize type
information at runtime after that to
read the JSON file from the resources
folder under the controller package I
have first heard of the class using
class loader and then read the user dot
JSON file from the resources folder then
a new object is created of file type and
a
put the name as fight after that all the
bytes are there from this object and
stored in a new object named content so
basically what are we doing at the end
is that we are retrieving the types from
the content and storing in the object
users now to handle HTTP requests I'm
going to create the method inside the
user controller class which can be
called when an HTTP request is made so
when I just mentioned the port number of
the localhost a message should return
use a service when I pass the request
slash users on the port number 8:08 for
the list of users should be returned
from the requested method in the
controller file now let's suppose I want
the information of any one user then I
will pass the request slash users with
the parameters as username to the port
number eight zero eight four okay so
there's a question from samya that how
do we set the port numbers for various
services to set the port numbers you
just have to go to the application
properties in the resources folder and
type spring third application dot name
is equal to your service name and serve
a dot port is equal to your port number
for the user service have put the name
as usual - service and port number as
eight zero eight four similarly I've
done for TV shows
like I've chosen the port number at 8:08
- and for use of bookings have chosen
the port number as eight zero eight
three after this I have also created
some files to handle the errors and the
exceptions similar to the user service
the TV shows and the user booking
service also have similar project
structure but have different
functionality the booking service
consists of all the information about
bookings of users and this service works
on port number eight zero eight three
coming to the TV shows service this
houses all the TV shows offered by the
side and this application runs on port
number eight zero eight two so now that
you know the project structure of all
the three services let's launch these
applications as spring boot app so for
that drag click on the project go to run
as and choose spring boot app
at the end of the console you can see
that the user application has started
similarly nonstick other two
applications so right click on this
project go to run as and choose spring
boot app ok so the tv-show service has
also started I can right click on this
project go to run as and choose spring
boot app the user booking application
has also started now there are three
applications have started let's go to
the browser and check if they're running
or not so open the browser and type
localhost 8:08 4 you can see that a
message has returned user service
indicating that I use a service is
working now to get the details of all
the users pass the request / users to
this port number so let's type / users
so you can see on the screen that the
list of users has been returned now
let's suppose I want the details of only
one user let's say John Smith so pass
the name John Smith as a parameter to
this request so John and this Co Smith
this gives us the detail of only one
user that is John Smith now if I want to
get the list of bookings done by various
users type localhost colon 8080 slash
bookings so here you can see that chain
has turned only one booking John has
gone for two bookings and Ashok is gone
for four bookings and suppose if you
want to see the bookings of Ashok type
Ashok underscore Kumar so you can see
that Ashok is gone for four shows model
family house Sherlock and why cakes to
see how the last service runs that is
the TV shows let's type localhost colon
8080 - slash TV shows
this gives us the list of TV shows that
the site offers you can see that each TV
show is given an ID and has parameters
such as title rating and genre so now if
you want to know who has booked a TV
show past the idea of TV show and user
bookings as a parameter to this port so
type localhost colon 8080 to slash TV
shows slash let's say we want to know
for this particular TV show copy the ID
and paste it here and pass the parameter
user bookings you can see the chain is
opted for this particular TV show so
well that's how you can implement
micro-services using eclipse and spring
starter plug-ins so thank you guys for
joining in today's session I hope that
you have learned something useful with
this session on micro-services if you're
looking forward for a thorough training
on macro services I'm glad to tell you
that we have a course curriculum for
micro service you can check out the
course curriculum on Eddy record code so
after you go on the site type
microservices
and choose this option microservices
architectural training
once it opens up this is where you can
find all the details about the course
such as course curriculum projects
description etc once you enroll yourself
into the course you will get access to
the learning management system which
will contain all your course content so
this is your learning management system
where you can access the class
recordings PPD's and other additional
documents and the best thing about it is
that you will be doing that industry
based real-time project on mitosis so
thank you guys for joining in today's
session have a good day
