and method overloading and overriding
okay these are the concepts that you
actually deal in group programming that
is object-oriented programming so we'll
just see how those coop concepts are
actually integrated are used in Java a
method is a collection of statements
that are grouped together to perform an
operation a method takes some parameters
perform some computations and then
optionally there's a returns a value so
whenever you want to create a
functionality okay mine sends me a sad
smiley now whenever you have to make a
functionality like for addition you want
to make a function for addition you want
to make a function for subscribtion or
any other thing if you want to provide a
particular functionality you can make a
method this way you'll be modular izing
your application okay you'll be making a
different method for that and by using
by making a method you can call that
particular method at many places this
way you'll be reducing the redundant
code okay you'll be reusing the code now
we'll see what are the things that are
present in a method methods have got
five components one is modifiers will be
discussing about modifiers in the later
part of the class modifiers are like
public private protected and there is a
default one whenever you miss writing
anything any one of them then in those
cases it will be taking the default one
now becomes your return type a method
can return a value it could be an
integer value it could be a string value
it could be a character it could be
float or it could return nothing if you
are not returning anything you'll be
mentioning void in place of the return
type that means this method will not
return anything
Ammy says is there any difference
between methods and functions now you
would have also heard of procedure ok
method is a general name there are two
kinds it is active methods is actually
divided into procedure and functions
procedure is the name
for a method which is not returning
anything which has a void return type in
that case the method is called procedure
if a method is returning a value of
whether integer or any value in those
cases that method is termed as functions
okay but they'll always remain a method
it is just a definition it is the theory
path that is a method returns anything
it is a function if it does not return
anything it is a procedure are you clear
I mean please write down on the top
window okay good now was on return type
so I guess you are understood with you
have understood return type that is it
can return a value or it cannot if it is
not returning any value in those cases
you will be mentioning void we come to
method name the third one method name is
actually the identifier of a method
using the name of the worth method we
can use that particular method okay so
it is the identifier of the method the
method name third thing is the list of
arguments or you can call the parameter
list now it contains different arguments
that is if a method needs certain values
on which it has to do the computation in
those cases you actually take values
right clear example if you are adding
two numbers the method is adding two
numbers then it will require two numbers
with as the parameter cell you'll pass
integer a comma integer B as the
parameter and those values will be used
in body of the method now we come to the
part that is body in the body it will be
providing the definition of the
operation okay that has to be performed
that means you can say that a
functionality of this particular method
will be present in the body of the
method that will be enclosed between the
curly braces okay so these are the
cumference okay before going to method
overloading let's see how to create
methods
so in this class itself that is test 1
and test 2 in test 1 I'll create a
method ok so a simple method integer
first of all void that is void
it is not returning anything as and it
is not taking anything okay in this
integer a an integer P
all of you can you answer this question
do you know what our constructors please
write down on the chat window
everyone yes we went through in the last
class I will be using a constructor here
I just thought of using it so I was just
confirming whether you are aware of
constructors or not
so instead of defining these two values
here I'll define it outside right here
in T and I'll call the constructor of
this class public sorry
public test one okay in this I'll
initialize the value of a equal to T and
this constructor will take two values
okay now this constructor is not
actually a method okay it is not a
method never confused with a method with
a constructor constructor will always
have a name that is equivalent to the
class name and it will not have any
return type it won't return anything
okay Arun I guess your question has been
answered
now I'll assign a value to a to a and a
value instead of a you'll get confused
I'll mention it X x and y X equals to a
and y equals to B okay and in the add
function I will simply add alprin system
dot out dot println I'll print a plus B
okay
the showing manera oh sorry
X&amp;amp;Y I'll simply print X&amp;amp;Y in that I'll
also mention a text that will be the sum
is okay and I'll add a plus sign between
them now I'm not passing any parameter
to this function sizes and constructor
is called as soon as an object is
created for the class exactly yes - ruff
thank you for correcting me now I am NOT
taking any parameter in this function
I'm not taking I am not returning
anything it has a functionality that
will print the numbers and test - class
remove all those things and here I'll
create an object of test one class so
test one
poby equals two new test one I'll use
the this one constructor that is test
one in this I will pass two values let's
say five and B second values also five
and I put a semicolon
I put save the file now if I run the
code will I receive anything right now
if I run the code anyone if you tell me
so I see a sternum he says no exactly
correct Tommy because I haven't called
the functions all right OB dot now I'm
showing you how to use a function with a
object
so I'll write OB dot instead of say some
55 okay
OB dot function add I put a semicolon
now it will call the function that is
present in test one class that is add
and I'll run the code and receive the
value that is sum is 10 the spelling is
wrong
okay the sum is 10 so we haven't passed
any parameter right here to the function
we only use the constructor to give the
values and using that I'm print
in their statement I am running this
function so all of you are clear with
this so I say yeah it does not print but
the value is stored exactly sign and I'm
an Astra for you clear why it is not
printing 55 it is actually adding these
were numbers these are variables and you
just used a plus sign if you place them
in quotes then in those case it will
print 55 I should have said yes that's
good now we'll make some changes this
time instead of using the constructor
I'll just come in this path and I'll
take some parameters in it integer a
comma integer B okay this time I'll
print MD okay I'll show you step by step
different things so this will take
values a and B I come here I'll just
remove these two values and in this I'll
pass 100 and okay 100 comma 200 so we
are passing two values in the method now
so this method is taking parameters to
integer values as parameters and it is
returning the sum it is printing the sum
it is not returning it is just printing
the Sun there itself so I will just run
this code the sum is 300 so you clear
with this part as well all of you be
quick and I will then show you one more
thing machine says how to break out or
exit a method it will automatically exit
it okay as soon as the functionality is
over the operation is over it will exit
machine now instead of printing hair
itself what I will do I will return the
value so I'll just put the return
statement but before that I have to
mention that what value will be
returning it will be returning an
integer value so I'll use the return
keyword and I will pass the value a plus
B
and I put a semicolon so it will return
the sum or you can define another
variable and you can write a plus B
equals to that like this integer C
equals to a plus B and put a semicolon
and finally you can return C over here
okay this is one way but why to add one
more line okay I'll just cut it I'll
paste it right here this is one another
way saving it I come here I'm passing
two values now what I will do I can do
one more thing here in C equal to zero
now this object will be returning a
value this value will be saved in C cell
right system dot out dot println I'll
simply print C I'm not pretending any
statement the Stynes
then the code I am receiving the result
300 are you clear with this now the
function is returning a value and you
are again coming back to this for main
method and the value was stored to this
available and we printed it okay instead
of making this line as well where you
can do you can sync simply cut it paste
it over here okay it is showing an error
let's see what it does type this match
cannot convert void to int oh we don't
okay we'll have to use it like that
itself now I come to test one java class
again it is returning a value it is
taking parameters now is there anything
that could be done it's a method if we
don't mention the return type will it
still run army says Oh bid or dad is an
instance method myung says yes it will
be an instance method exactly man now if
you don't mention the return type will
it still run I didn't get your point
Ami's sign says no it won't run is quite
sure I think you are saying that if I
don't mention we will have to mention it
if you do not mention it it will give
you a error either it either remove this
return keyword or mention a return type
a me she is okay this way you can return
any other value as well like if you want
to return a float value you can do that
but right now it will okay first I will
run this code for you now since it was
returning a float value you'll have to
save it in a float variable itself run
as 300 point zero cents we converted it
into float it is showing 300 point zero
this as well to float a follow 'ti
itself I'll change it to float F a
loyalty okay now I'll pass 100 point 10
or 1 and 200 point 1
okay change it to double or if you are
mentioning float just control that it
you can mention F okay so for a of
mentioning a float value you'll have to
use the F word sorry not the F word just
left letter okay how mine says can we
invoke the instance method like this
system dot out dot println OB dot add
how much a is there any thing like
typecasting in Java exactly there is a
thing like typecasting never change a we
have to clear X&amp;amp;Y also X&amp;amp;Y okay we are
not at all using X&amp;amp;Y right now in our
method may wish okay
they were just used in the first example
that I took you can comment it okay mine
is saying like this now Ashley Mike I
tried the same thing it is done but I it
is showing me an error right now okay
so if I write OB dot and and I pass 20 F
and twenty point one to point one s okay
it is taking it right here that time I
it was showing an error due to some
reason so man your question would have
on would have been answered now is it
okay good now I run this code now this
time this will be returning a float
value I run it and I receive twenty two
point one now I'll show you typecasting
as well so I'll change it to end and
here
okay now this will actually convert the
addition of a and B from float to end it
will be typecasting it and hair will
receive the result so I'll just run the
code this time I am receiving 22 now
become two method overloading bill that
says I joined now why were you late
Gulzar he was stuck somewhere that was
on method overloading we understood what
is a method how to use it now there is a
concept that is overloading a method
that means you're Ashley overloading a
particular thing you have got a method
that is add now you want to do some
other thing using the same method name
that will be termed as method
overloading now let's see what is what
this presentation has to say the method
or will the old loaded function must
differ either by the number of arguments
or operands or the data types okay so in
these three cases whenever you do this
thing the method will be considered as
overloaded function but the name of the
method will remain the same the same
function name is used for various
instances of function call okay more
senile computation right so you have to
understand it whenever you are
overloading a method the argument should
be changed either the offering operands
or the data types but the name of the
function will have to remain the same
whenever you are overloading the method
Nichols's arguments and operands are
same right yes it is used for the same
thing we will be using it right now
we'll understand it in the better way
now let's see this example the example
is saying that this is the same animal
class within that I defined a function
right here it is saying without
parameters now we come to the same class
now overloading can also be done in the
same class as well okay you can overload
a particular method in a particular
class I am showing you in an extended
class the example is of extended class
in Eclipse I will show it to you now
function in second class I extend the
animal class and I'm you again declaring
another function that is public void
function now this function is taking a
variable okay it is taking an argument
so it is changed you have changed the
arguments first one is not taking any
argument second one is taking one so
here we are writing system dot out dot
println the number passed is this ok so
we have got one class animal the second
class aquatic activating is extending
into class animal and we have got same
name function that is function in first
one as well as in the second one first
one is not taking any parameter second
one is taking an integer value moving on
in the main method what I did I created
an object of the second class that is OB
equal to MU aquatic now first I call the
function that is without parameters and
then I call the function with parameters
and I'm using the same object so this
function is defined in the superclass
and this function is defined in equity
class itself let's go to eclipse and try
to understand that okay I have got both
of these things in one that is there's
one more concept that is overriding okay
I have explained in the same class but
is public class animal in deejay
function int a int B and I am adding the
number and returning the sum I have
another function in same class but the
return type is different and the
arguments are different so it is
overloading the function that is a few n
this is giving you the sum of three
float into float variables okay and it
will return the sum now instead of
showing this I will make a new project
for all of you close all file new Java
project overloading okay and then I'll
come to overriding itself
new class animal instead of this I'll
just copy all those classes from
inheritance itself control C and I'll
paste it here
I'll make changes to it now in animal
I'll place one class so if you want to
use in the same class what you can do
you can use it like this in main method
what I'll make a change instead of a
critique I'll make an object of animal
class in IML OB one equals two new
animal I put a semicolon OB one dot I
can use function in de and V or the
double bond first of all I'll use six
and I'll pass seven in it and I put a
semicolon right here second I'll call
the second function as well
third as function double here I'll have
to pass twenty point one twenty point
two and finally 20.3 okay and I put a
semicolon
these are returning the values I'll have
to place the syntax system dot out
println as well so theta is out
similarly I will do it the same thing
here this out and I'll place the black
parenthesis and I saved the file so what
we are doing we are actually overloading
this function that is fun in the same
class and I'm using these functions
using the object of that particular
class okay I have got few questions army
says end function integer a flow
we in function float a integer B are
these valid overloading yes it will be a
valid overloading we'll try it okay I'll
just run this code now so it is giving
me result 13 but it called the first
function and second one gives me a
result fifth sixty point and the digits
twenty twenty twenty sixteen and it's
three four five six okay so it is giving
since we use the double one so double
gives you our decimal values tell these
many numbers so you clear with this that
is method overloading in the same class
now I will overload the method in the
different class in the extended class
you can also do that so first function
is to find out the second one you just
remove this control V okay so it is
overloading the function it is not
overriding it if I write override it
will give me an error okay it will tell
me to create function in super type
animal then only it will override so it
is not overriding it so this is a proof
for you now same name different
arguments and different return type so
be animal instead of animal object this
time I'll create aquatic object and I
save my file and I run the code I'll
receive the same result so all of you
are clear with this in inheritance I've
used it right now equity class has
inherited the animal class and I'm
overloading the function that was
present in animals so I change the
arguments now you can use both the
functions using the parameter list you
just have to change the parameters
machine says yes clear Okayama says in
function intend we in function into a
into B in C is this valid to for
overloading yes because the number of
arguments have changed right now Homer
says please explain it once again
absolutely I'll do that for you no more
what I have done I have a class that is
animal within that I have defined a
method that is function function is
returning integer value and to taking
two parameters as two integer values
okay
I am doing the sum and I am returning a
value that is sum I extend this I make
another class equating and I extend this
class with the animal class now since I
have extended it you must be clear that
I can use this function okay but what I
did
I want to overload this method I change
the return type to double function
double a BB and CC now this is taking
three double values instead of two
integer values so this method has been
overloaded right now now I return the
sum of these double values and I am
returning some in the main method I have
created an object of aquatic class using
that object I write OB 1 dot function
and I passed integer value 6 &amp;amp; 7 so it
will know that it has to use this
function that is why you are receiving a
result 13 in the second case I am
calling function again the name is same
but the parameters are different that is
twenty point one twenty point two and
twenty point three so it will call a
function that has been defined right
here the overloaded function okay that
is why you receive as well sixty point
five and so much I clear now Omar please
write down on the chat he says got it
thanks that's good now I come to
question that was integer function int a
int P float function int a int B in C
and what about this is this valid to for
overloading yes it is valid because the
return type has been changed I mean even
the arguably argument less has changed
is it clear it will be a valid return
type you have understood it well the
only question that has left he was
asking that int a and flawed P
okay these are the arguments I'll just
try cause this value to floor a fellow
eighty sorry two integer okay similarly
it is returning I will just copy this
entire part I come here I'll copy this
one I'll just paste in place of that now
you are saying float B I'll just remove
it acts V comma okay ah what I will do
instead of this I'll also print if
second one is what's called I'll sprain
system not out overloaded okay so say
over loaded Oh overloaded okay so it
will print - I come to the main one one
is integer first one and float okay so
six and second seven F here I'll change
the parameters to seven F comma six
sorry
comma six Saamy this was your question
right now on this code thirteen first
time it called the previous function
that was defined in animal class so in
it only returns the value that is 13 but
the second time you interchange the
arguments first one is float the second
one is integer this time it is calling
this overloaded function that is why you
receive of overloaded and the answer is
13 itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
