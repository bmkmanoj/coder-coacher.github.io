Java constructors you create a class
first of all and you have different
things within your class like variables
you have got methods in it so whatever
things that are present in a particular
class in order to use then you need to
create an object okay you can consider a
class as a blueprint and using that
blueprint you create different kinds of
many objects okay now how these objects
are created using that blueprint it is
used it is created by using the
constructor as the name suggests it
actually constructs the object according
to the class so a constructor is used in
the creation of an object it is a
special method with no return type okay
like if you declare a method there
should be a return type that it either a
method returns an integer value a method
can return a string value or if a method
is returning a nothing if a method is
not returning anything in that case you
place a void keyword that means it is
not returning anything but in case of a
constructor you never write anything
okay you just leave the return type part
because you do not have to mention it it
is a constructor is not a method you can
term it as a special method but actually
it is not a method now must have the
same name as the class it is in like you
are creating in class with my name let's
say we need the name of the class is
vini then you have to declare a
constructor for that now if you are
declaring the constructor the name of
that constructor should be beneath
itself that is what is written must have
the same name as the class it is in we
come to the fourth one that is it is
used to initiate initialize the object
okay if you want to initialize values
that are present with the variables that
are actually present with the object
then in that case you'll have to assign
user constructor and you can initialize
the value of that particular object and
say does a constructor actually returns
anything to the system
no Magma a constructor actually does not
return anything okay it is just used to
initialize the values it is used to
create an object similar to on the
blueprint of a class okay according to
the class it
it's an object of that class is that
clear okay now if not defined we'll
initialize all instance variables to
default value okay if you do not
initialize a constructor it is not
important that you have to initialize if
you do not do it what happens it creates
a default value okay if you do not
mention a constructor it is by default
and creates the object with the default
values now let's see a small code okay a
snippet
this was a class that was created class
- okay and within that you have got two
variables x and y within that you create
a method that is sorry you this is not a
method this is a constructor because it
does not have a return type so you
create a constructor within that class -
with the parentheses you open up the
places and what you are doing you are
actually initializing the value of x and
y that is you put giving value 10 to X
and giving the value 11 - bye now
right here you have got another class
that is public class class one now
within that you have your main method in
the main method you are creating an
object of this class that is class two
you are writing the name of the class
first of all now what you did you
actually created an object using the
name of the class euro the name of the
class as class two you gave an a name of
the object data so P equals two new
class two with the parentheses this way
created the object now using this object
you are using the instance variables
what our instance variables these this x
and y this will be considered as the
instance variable of this object because
in class you have declared two variables
right here now when you create the
object of this class the variables that
were present in the class are also
attached with your object hence they are
termed as instance objects okay so what
do you do you write o V dot X okay you
are printing the value of x and you are
writing o V dot Y that means you are
printing the value of y so whenever you
print whenever you
with this statement what it will do
initializing we are calling the
constructor that is refined right here
which is actually placing the value 10
to X and giving the value 11 to by
variable so let's check it on Eclipse
I've got examples for you already done
so I have a project right here so I'm
sure in the last class you were clear
how to create object how to create
projects as well as how to create the
new classes so we have got two classes
right here class 1 and class 2 as given
in the example okay so first of all I
just come in this part just don't look
at it you'll understand why I did it
okay so in class 2 first of all we go
here in class 2 we have got the same
variable x and y and we are initializing
the value of x by 10 and by 11 in the
constructor class 2 if you see the
constructor you only have this public
that means this constructor can be
called publicly the access modifier for
a constructor is always public like this
so up initializing we come to the second
class that we created that is class 1 in
class 1 in the main method what we did
we actually created the object of class
2 which we which is right here class 2
OB new class 2 now whenever you create a
class what happens you actually create a
constructor so first of all I will show
you the default constructor okay I will
just comment this part that means if I
am commenting these lines it is not used
it is not executed now in second class
we have got only two variables x and y
now we come here we call the constructor
in the second class we haven't defined
any constructor even though it is fine
it is not giving me an error because
whenever you do not define a constructor
for a class it takes the default
constructor and initializes the values
by default values
so if I save the file and run this code
ctrl f11
I received 0 and 0 because the default
value of integer variables is 0 if you
do not provide any value to the integer
valuable it will store 0 values so
whenever you create the object you call
the constructor class 2 which is a
default one what it does it assigns 0
value to X and 0 value to by now
whenever you print it right here you are
printing the value of x and y this is
the way by which you can print string
plus we can print the number so what I
did string has to go in coats and you
add a plus sign and then you write the
variable that has to be printed which is
OB dot X that means using the object you
are printing the value of x in the
second line using the object you are
printing the value of wire right here I
just uncommon these lines so I press
control f7
control 7 again now what we did we
defined a constructor the same one like
it is not taking an input it is not
taking any parameters it is empty and
our constructor does not return anything
hence there is no return type now we
have initialized the value of x by 10
and the value of y by 10 now the code
will remain the same in the class - I am
not changing a bit but since you defined
a constructor on your own this time the
values will be the value of x will be 10
and the value of y would be love and
that is value of x when constructor is
called is 10 the value of y when
constructor is called as 11 okay so I
guess you are not here with the
user-defined constructors now we will
learn one more concept in constructors I
will just get back to the presentation
and I come to constructor overloading
now we come to constructor overloading
what does the term actually indicate
what can you understand by the term
constructor overloading now you can even
overload a constructor word does that
mean that means you have your class
class too
you define two variables as you did the
last time and one constructor was there
which was initializing the value of x by
10 and Y by 10 there was another
constructor which was taking an input
that is it was taking input said I in
teaser said now whenever you pass that
number this that was assigned to X and y
both of them now in the class one in the
main function what you did you created
the object of class two using the first
constructor first of all that is class
two
so it actually calls this one and
initializes the value of x by ten and
the value of y by eleven now it again
create the object for the class two by
using the second constructor which was
taking an integer as the parameter so it
calls the second one and initializes the
value of x by five and the value of y by
five so that means you can have multiple
constructors status overloading means
you have got the same name so you are
overloading something on the same name
now this constructor is taking a
parameter that is an integer value and
whenever it receives the value it will
initialize the value of x as well as the
value of y Homer says good evening is
late in the class Nikhil says when we
write user-defined constructor do we
have initialized every instance
variables okay we'll come to a point now
first of all let me explain the
constructor overloading that is right
here class two in said X equal to Z y
equals two said we come to class one now
now I uncommon these lines so what I am
doing right here is I'm creating another
object now I come to win each question
why are you defining two objects I'll
just write it my uncle gauge okay the
same name this will give an error we
cannot define two objects with the same
name because we are creating an object
of the same class we are only using
different constructors okay but at the
end of the day it will always remain an
object of the same class so you cannot
name them same so I define an object for
class two again but I this time in the
constructor I passed a value five that
means I am calling the second
instructor which is taking a parameter
as input which is an integer value now
when I print the lines right here this
time the value of x will be equal to 5
and the value of y will be equal to 5 so
I'll just run this code ctrl f11 and you
can see we have got four statements the
first one says value of x when
constructor is called ten value of y1
constructor is called is 11 this time
when the second constructor is called
value of x when constructor is called is
5 and for the Y also it will be 5 okay
so this way we are actually overloading
and construct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
