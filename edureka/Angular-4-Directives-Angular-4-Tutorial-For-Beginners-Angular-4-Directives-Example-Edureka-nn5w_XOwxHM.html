and welcome to this first video of a
Draco's free angular course for beginner
in this video i'm going to talk about
angular directives so without doing any
further delay let's go ahead and
understand what is a directive as you
know angular templates are dynamic that
is they change with user interaction so
whenever they are rendered on your
browser all those rules or instructions
as per which your Dom elements got
change or your Tom predicates change is
given by directives so in a very simple
terms you can say that directive allows
you to manipulate your table so now
let's go ahead and understand what are
the different types of tera tip that is
provided by angular now the first one on
our list is called as component
component is an essentially a directive
with a template so we have a view
associated with our component as we have
seen in our third video where we have
learned about components in detail we
learn over there that a component
comprised of two aspect one is your
business logic that is the typescript
class where you write all those logic
and the second one is the visual part of
your component that I user see so when
our comprehend is being rendered on your
browser
all those element that is there inside
your template is being added into your
Dom tree now the second one is called as
structural directors as the name
suggests structural deities allows you
to change the structure of your Tom or
change the Tom layout by adding or
removing or replacing certain Dom
element with some other one so that's
how your structural directors work the
last one is called as attribute
directive that allows you to change the
appearance or behavior of an element in
your table for example you can go ahead
and change the background color the font
size the font color all those things can
be done using a tributary so let's go
ahead and understand each of these two
directives one by one so we'll start
with structural director so we look at
some of the built-in structural directly
provided by angular that is most
commonly used so the first one that
we're gonna talk about today is called
as ng for it is basically a repeater
directive that iterates over a
collection of data so let's go ahead and
understand what does that mean through
code for that I will open my atom ID and
I'll open my terminal let me go inside
my project and I'm going to generate a
component where I will be showing all
the demo directive example now as you
can see that our component has been
creative this is our component now let's
go ahead and nest our directive example
component inside our app component we'll
go ahead and do that quickly so I'll go
to my HTML app component template and
then I'm going to write AB directive -
example
alright let's go ahead and render our
application ng serve
now if I go to my browser and open a
localhost
4200 you can see that that the active
example component is being rendered over
here inside our app component basically
now as said earlier that ng 4 directive
is a repeater directive that it trades
over a collection of data so as to
demonstrate how ng 4 works let's go
ahead and create that collection of data
so in our case we're gonna go ahead
create a string array so let me create a
string array called as DC heroes which
will be an array of string containing
all those DC Comics heroes so I will
start with Batman then I will go ahead
fit Superman then Wonder Woman then at
last I'm going to go ahead with flash
now what I want is I want to display
Ichiro over here as a list so I'm going
to go ahead inside my template I'm going
to delete all this and then I'm gonna
create a test tag alright and here I'm
gonna use my ng for direct so as the
syntax ko as you can see it's stating
that let item of list we're item is
nothing but a looping variable so for
each view that is there inside our list
this item reference variable will store
that particular hero of the list that we
are iterating and this will be the name
of the list that we have inside our
component so I'll go ahead with TC
heroes here and this looping very well
you can name it anything I can go over
it with item as well but let's go head
with hero first to make it more readable
now what I will do I will use
interpolation all right now as you can
see we have a list of heroes all the
heroes that were there in our a now
let's have a closer look what is
happening over here so basically what is
happening here is your ng 4 which is
ready period directive it is repeating
this element for each hero that is there
in our list so basically whenever you
put your ng4 directive inside any
element that element will be repeated
based on the number of items that is
there on list on which ng 4 is operating
now apart from that you can go ahead and
do various things like you can go ahead
and say let I equal to index
so what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to provide index to my heroes and
then I'm going to go inside my component
I'm going to create a variable called as
index a property called as index will be
of type number and I'll initialize it
with zero now I can evaluate this
expression on the go using interpolation
as well so I'm going to go ahead and use
interpolation I am going to say I plus
one so as discussed in our previous
video where I told you that whenever you
put an expression inside an
interpolation it will evaluate that
expression and then finally the result
will be displayed on your project so if
I do that so in each iteration your I
will be incremented and finally you can
have a result something like this
so as simple as that guys now that you
have understood ng4 it is very simple
that's how you have to do it with the
syntax go ahead with ng for equal to let
the looping variable of the it travel
that you are having you can have any
kind of in trouble arrived object a list
whatever you want and then you
interpolate that or you do whatever you
want to do with that particular list if
you notice we are using a spec symbol
over here that signifies that it is a
structural directive so whenever you are
using a structural directive you'll be
using a spec so that's it guys that was
all about ng for let's go ahead to our
slide and understand the next directive
in our list which is ng if no ng F
allows you to add or remove an element
from the table based on certain
condition the condition can be anything
it can be state of your application it
can be a boolean property if it is set
to true then that particular element
will exist in our Dom so let's go ahead
and implement this as well so this time
what I want to do is I want to create a
button and whenever I click on this
button I want this list of heroes to be
removed from my Tom and then again if I
click it I want this list of here to
appear in our town so basically I want a
toggle type of functionality wait for
removing and adding the list of heroes
so I'm going to name it as Tauber heroes
all right now I'll go back to my
component class and I'll create a
property toggle hero flag it will be of
type boolean and I'll set it as true
initially
now I want to create a function toggle
Ito function
and what I want is whenever I click on
that button I said earlier I want to
toggle my hero list so whenever I click
it once it will be removed from my dorm
then if I click it again it will be
appeared on my dorm or inserted in my
dorm so that we can see it finally on
our browser I'm gonna go ahead with this
thought toggle here oh flag and then I'm
gonna reverse it each time when you
click the button all right now if I go
to my template what I want to do is I
want to use even binding to find my
click event with that particular
function that I created just not toggle
heroes in my component class so I'm
going to go head click
and struggled hero
now the next thing that I want to do
over here is I want to add njf because
now we have created our button we have
mapped it to a function but now based on
that toggle hero flag our ngf will work
so I'll go ahead and create a one more
def tag over here and then I'll put this
inside my def tag and here I'm gonna use
njf alright it wants an expression so
I'm gonna go ahead with my toggle hero
flag so initially it is set to true
so you can see the list over here as you
can see now when I click on this button
it gets him over America now you would
be thinking why not we can go ahead and
use hidden attribute so that we can hide
this particular element whenever you
want so far now this is a very simple
example where if we are just displaying
a list of a superhero which is very
minimal in nature but actually you can
go ahead and use this ng-if for removing
some component from being rendered and
that component if that component is a
computation intensive component then it
will affect the performance in a great
manner so that's why removing an element
from your tom is very important so now
that we have understood this let's move
ahead and understand what is ng switch
in this switch as the name goes it is
pretty much similar to any switch
function of switch cases that we have in
other programming languages so basically
what if if you want to display one
element and you have multiple element
and out of that you want to display just
one element based on certain scenarios
so for that you want to go ahead with ng
switch so let's go ahead implement this
as well so I'm gonna hit with ng switch
alright so as the syntax over here you
can see that we have a ng switch that
works on some condition expression if
that condition is satisfied for any of
the switch case that case or whatever
logic that we have put or whatever thing
that we want to display over in that
switch case will be displayed in our
browser alright so basically we have
four heroes so we want four switch cases
so I'm going to go ahead and duplicate
it four times and default cases I want
to show that none of the heroes have
been
selected all right now I'm gonna put the
expression that I want now I'm gonna put
real name of the hero so first one is
part man so I'm going to prove it with
Bruce Wayne and the second one is
Superman so I'm gonna go ahead with
Clark Clark and then we have Wonder
Woman so we have princess Dinah over
here then at last we have Barry Allen
for flash
all right so we have this for real name
of the hero corresponding to the hero
that we have in our array now let's go
ahead and create our condition
expression that will be evaluated so
what I want is basically whenever I
click on one of the dev tag over here so
I want to bind it with some click
function whenever I click it I want to
capture that hero and that hero will
finally be put inside my condition
expression in my switch case and that
will be evaluated for all these switch
cases so I'm going to go ahead with
click event over here so I'm gonna go
ahead with click event then I'm gonna go
ahead and bind it with some function
that I'll be created so basically what I
want I want to capture the hero that
I'll be clicking on right so basically
I'll be sending that hero so let's say
select hero say the name of our function
that will be creating a select hero and
we're going to pass the hero that will
be clicking on alright now let's go
inside our comment class now let's
create that function select hero that
accepts our hero
all right and I'm going to create a
property here as well
the property will be selected hero of
type string
and we'll say this door selected hero
equals to hero that's it now let's go
ahead and do one more thing let's
console it out and let's see whether it
is working or not see if I click on this
but we are having a problem it's saying
select hero is not a function
all right so we did a mistake over here
I guess now it should work and as you
can see if we have the console being
happening over here Superman Wonder
Woman flash everything we're getting
away so it's working fine now what I
want to do as you can see that we are
seeing all those four real names being
displayed over here because we haven't
created our switch expression the
condition on which your switch cases
will be evaluated so I'm going to go
ahead and put this condition over there
so our condition will be selected hero
now based on this selected hero it will
evaluate all those cases that we have
and here they have to put the cases
whenever the engine switch finds a match
with the selected hero it will display
that particular real name now remember
here it's a accepting expression and
expression over here it's expecting an
expression but in our case we're gonna
go ahead and use hard code values so
we're gonna use single quote inside
double quotes so as to go ahead with the
string value over here see for Monaco
hit with Batman so I'm going to use this
part man this which is a string value if
I would have used something called as or
like this if I'm gonna go ahead and use
something called as DC heroes and I'm
gonna say like this then it will work in
other cases if you wanna use a head with
a value with a string value then you
wanna use single code inside double
quotes so for that I'm going to go ahead
for Superman and then again Wonder Woman
and at last we have flash all right so
now if I click on any of this you can
see it is working our last case it is
not working again because we miss that
single quote that I told you if I do
that again now you can see it's working
fine if we click on any of this a hero
in the list
we can see fit his or her real name so
this is all about and they switch so
there are two things to remember over
here whenever you are using an
expression that is the property that you
have defined in a component will go
ahead with double quotes inside your
switch cases in case if you are using a
string value that you want to be
evaluated you want to go ahead and use
it inside single quotes so that your
switch case can understand that it is a
string and therefore evaluate it
accordingly so basically we have
understood all these three commonly used
structural directors ng for ng F and you
switch and you would have understood
that basically we are playing with the
structure of the Dom how the Dom layout
goes and how we can add remove or
replace a certain element based on some
condition using structural that no let's
go ahead with our next set of directives
which is called as attribute directive
so let's go ahead and see some of the
commonly used attribute actor provided
by angular the first one in our list is
ng style so whenever we have multiple
inline styles for a particular element
and you want to change the style of that
particular element dynamically based on
certain condition of your state of your
component then you're gonna go hit with
ng style so let's go ahead and
understand what does it mean actually so
let's say what I want to do is I want to
change the style of this real name
dynamically based on certain condition
so let's go ahead and do it so for that
I'm gonna create an object call as my
style all right then I'm gonna create a
function called a set style so basically
this will be responsible for changing
the style and here I'm going to modify
my my style or I'm going to initialize
it with some value now the value that I
want to change over here is can be
anything let's go ahead with very simple
simple functionalities so let's go ahead
with font weight right
as polled then we have color let's go
ahead and do one thing we'll set this
color parameter differently or we'll
have different color each time so we'll
create a function that will generate
random colors and based on which we'll
be changing the color of whatever
element or word or text that we want to
so let's go ahead and do that as well so
we'll keep it for a later on I will
implement it later on that function
let's do one more thing we're gonna go
ahead with font size and for now let's
keep it as 24 pixels all right now we'll
set it as a start random or we can say
generate random color all right now if I
go ahead and create this function over
here
generate random color
now let's go ahead and create our
function so for that I'm going to create
one property called as color which will
be of type string and inside my function
whenever it is called I'm gonna start
with
hache no basically a color hex code
starts with a hash so therefore we have
any slice it with hash now the remaining
digits basically a color hex code
comprised of six digits so remaining six
digits will be generated randomly based
on certain logic that we wanna provide
here and we're gonna use some math
function over here something called as
man taught random so let's go ahead and
do that so as you know that each digit
or a hexadecimal digit so it will be of
one to nine or it will be from A to F so
all those 16 possibilities are there so
you're gonna go ahead and create an
array called as letters and then you
know create an array where we're gonna
put all those 16 digits that is 0 then 1
then 2 p4
for 7 then 8 then we have got 9 then we
have got a then we have got B C D then
we have got e at last we have got F all
right now I'm going to go ahead with a
loop variable so that has to generate
each digit of that hex code let me show
you something that hex code in generally
comprises of hash tag F so these are the
six digits
what I'm going to do I'm going to take
each digit randomly from my array and
I'm gonna make my hex code or the color
code that I'm gonna return so I'm gonna
go ahead with my fall to there I'm gonna
quit with I equals to 0 then since we
have six digit I'm gonna iterate till
six I'm gonna increment my I all right
now let's go ahead with the start color
plus equals 2 because I want to append
whatever new or digit I'm gonna generate
and then I'm gonna go hit with letters
now I'm gonna choose the random indexes
so for that I'm gonna use math function
that is random I guess this is the
random function now this random function
in generally generates a random digit
between 0 to 1 so I'm going to coerce
and multiply 8 by 16 and then basically
we will be having a float number so I'm
going to convert it into integer so as
to refer to a particular index in our
array so I'm going to use something
called as mat or floor and I'm gonna
surround our mat got random into 16
functionality all right so this is what
I'm gonna do now let's console this
color as well so that color will be your
this dot color all right now let's go
ahead and return this color as well
now each time when I am changing my
style using this my set style function
it will be calling this generate random
color function and finally this new
color or random color will be generated
each time and will be applied to my
color attribute of whatever element
whatever text that I will be operating
on so now what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
create a button again now whenever I
click on this button so now what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna create a button
alright
and I'll say change style or let's keep
it down
and I'm going to bind my set style
method over here so let's go ahead with
our click event
and select a set style
alright now let's pine and go ahead and
use ng style over here so we're gonna
use ng style
now as you can see we are having style
over here and then some expression
instead of that we want to go ahead with
our my style object that we have created
just now so we're gonna go ahead with my
style so now everything is fine over
here so now let's go ahead and see
whether it is working or not so as you
can see though real name is being
displayed now once I clicked on chain
style we can see over there that a
random color is being generated and is
being applied dynamically on this text
now one of the interesting thing that
you can go ahead and do with ng style is
you can choose one of the inline style
among multiple styles so what I'm trying
to say over here is what we can do is we
can go ahead inside our function and we
kind of go ahead and create some
condition let's go ahead style toggle
flag okay let's make it as boolean and
then set it as true initially alright
then what I want to do is paste on this
style towel flag I want to switch
between different styles of that is
referring to have a different font
weight for example what I want is I want
to go ahead with this style toggle flag
alright and then I'm going to put this
and then I want polled and if it is set
to true I want to have it as pulled in
when they set to false in that case I'm
going to go ahead with a normal alright
similarly I'm going to go ahead and use
this over here as well
and I'm gonna switch between 24 pixels
and 15 pixels all right so now if I go
ahead and if I do this as you can see we
are saving the same value of her because
we are not toggling the style to IFAC so
let's go ahead and do that each time we
are clicking on that pattern so again
we're gonna go ahead with toggle style
toggle flag and we want it to be star
towel flap we want it to be reversed
each time we are clicking on button so
now as you can see we are having
different font size over here and apart
from that the text is being polled and
then being displayed as normal all right
so this is how you go ahead with your ng
style now ng class allows you to add or
remove CSS classes that to dynamically
that is why they are very much important
so whenever you want to play with style
that to dynamically you're gonna go
ahead with ng style and go ahead with ng
class now let's go ahead and create our
CSS class so I'm going to go hit with
dot style red and here what I want is I
want background color as let's say a
black alright and then I wonder text
color as
right and I'm gonna copy it over here
I'm gonna make it as white and this time
I'm gonna just change this to white
that's it now let's go ahead and create
one ice - tad
so change CSS class dynamically and then
again
I'm gonna add a button over here for
changing this style or I can add the
click event in h2 element as well but
let's go ahead and add a button and
let's say it has change CSS class
alright and then what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna create our property called as
current CSS class which will be of type
string and I'm gonna set it as style
read initially then I'm gonna create one
more function set CSS class and here
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna change the
CSS class to a different one so I'm
gonna go head with current law CSS class
I'm gonna set it as style white
go ahead and toggle it as well so we'll
do something as this dot current CSS
class equals because two equals two
style read now let's put it inside curly
braces and then we want to go ahead with
our else block and here what I want is I
want it to be reversed this dot CSS
current class is gonna set at the start
read again
let's console this out as well this dot
current CSS class all right so that's
what I am trying to say over here
let's go ahead in our template and here
we're gonna add click event over here so
let's go ahead with the click event
and I added birth cert CSS class that
function will be called whenever we
click it and now let's find our s2
element with ng class all right now here
I'm gonna put my current CSS class
that's the name of the class which will
be added to this s2 element and whenever
we click on this button it will be
change dynamically so let's go ahead and
see whether it is working or not if I go
and click on that you can see that it's
perfectly working so that's how you can
go ahead and change the CSS class or
choose among different CSS class
dynamically as well now the last word
we're gonna talk about is called as NC
model basically what it does it display
a data property and then whenever a user
makes some changes on that data property
it updates it as well so that data
property that has been updated by ng
model will be updated in all those
places wherever it is being used so what
I'm trying to say over here is let's go
ahead and oh let's create a very simple
example a cane we're gonna go ahead with
our h2 tag over here I will say change
text color using ng model all right I'm
gonna create a and put placeholder so
whenever you are putting some value over
there like red and color whatever color
that you are providing the text color
will be changed accordingly now as you
know using two-way data-binding that is
your ng model you can change that
property and whenever a user is making
some change on that data property the
value of that greater property it will
be reflected on your comm as well let's
go ahead and create that data property
so we'll go ahead and name it as an
forth color type string and let's
initialize it with red all right now
let's find it we're gonna use something
called as ngmodel over here and then
binding we'll go ahead with our property
that is and put color property and
remember as I told you we can go if you
have a single inline style that you want
to choose with you can go ahead with the
simple style binding as well so you're
gonna go ahead with style and let's
choose the property binding or here
because we'll be finding this style with
our input color data property and we
will be binding color specifically so
I'm gonna go ahead and find it fit input
color all right now let's go ahead and
see whether it works or not okay so we
are getting some error and the model is
not known this is happening because we
need to import a certain model called as
forms model in order to use ng model so
I'm gonna add or import this forms model
over here from add that I am gonna slash
forms and then I'm gonna go ahead in
mine poor Sarah of at the rate ng model
decorator and I'm gonna add form
smoothly alright now once I do that that
error will be gone so now let's go ahead
and change this to blue and it's working
red green so as you can see the two-way
data-binding is working over here so
guys that was all about your pelting
directives built in structural directive
and built-in attribute directives how to
use them now let's go ahead and
understand how to create a custom
directive that is how to create our own
directly from scratch let me open my IDE
again and let me create a new directive
so let's go to my project folder sample
and ngg directive he'll say up bold in
this case all right so our directive has
been created which we can see over here
so this is our directive now this is the
selector type that we'll be using
so let's go ahead and import the
dependencies that we require so first
one that we require is called as element
ref basically this will allow you to
access the properties or the attributes
of the element on which you will be
making changes and the next one that we
want is host listener so host listener
allows you to subscribe to any event of
a particular Dom element on which we are
working on or on which we are operating
now this is an important thing to notice
over here so what will do will be used
something called as dependency injection
so as to create an instance of element
ref so whenever you want to create an
instance of a certain class you can go
ahead and use something called as
dependency injection so let me show you
how to use it so your going to go help
with element ref and this will be of
type element ref right gets created a
private now what I want to do is I'm
going to use my at the rate host
listener so as to subscribe some event
so I'm gonna go ahead with at the rate
host listener and then the event that I
want to be subscribed for his bowels
enter and whenever I enter the mouse
over that element that is on mouse enter
I want this function to happen and then
what I want to do is I want to use my
element reference to access the native
element and from there I want to access
the style and from there I want to
access the font weight all right and I
want to make it as port as simple as
that so basically what I will be doing
over here is whenever I'm holding my
mouse in this list I want that certain
hero on which my mouse is to be pulled
also what I want to do is I want to
change the background color so that it
looks like you are selecting it so let's
go ahead and do that as well so this
third element
ref toward native element dot style
called round dot
I grow in color and my circuit as let's
go ahead and set it as gray all right I
guess
okay mr. taut over here now whenever I
move my mouse out of that particle
element I want everything to be back to
normal so let's go ahead and choose this
again so I'm going to go ahead and copy
this because again we'll be needing our
host listener this is a decorator that
add that host listener and it allows you
to basically that as I said to subscribe
to events of all those storm elements
that ghosts are directive whatever
active that we are using now I'm gonna
go ahead with my live event this time
mostly on mostly alright and then I'm
gonna make it as normal and I'm gonna
make it as initial alright so that's it
guys now let's go ahead to our list this
is our list we want to add this and
let's add our app app bold alright now
as you can see it is working whenever we
are holding our mouse and whenever we
are leaving that area it's getting back
to normal feet and whenever we are going
over there it's getting highlighted all
right now also what we can do suppose
what you want to do is you want to set
that color of the background dynamically
for that what we can do is can go ahead
and use something called as input all
right and we have already discussed
about it so I'm going to use a direct
input decorator and then I'm gonna
create some property on which I'll be
receiving my input so I'm going to go
ahead with property as background color
okay let's make this BG color because we
should not use the same name that is
being reserved already so we'll go ahead
with string all right now let's it set
to us distort peachy color alright now
let's go back to our template where we
want to apply our directive that we have
created just now now here we have a new
input property on which we'll be passing
the color that is called as peachy color
all right and we want to set it as let's
say true now let's go ahead and see it's
working right so this is how you can go
ahead and create your own custom
directive and remember that directive
that we have created over here is an
attribute directive so we were modifying
the property of our attribute of a
certain dev element over here so that's
why it's an attribute directive you can
go ahead and create your own structure
custom structural directive as well for
now I'm going to leave it as an exercise
for you
so you're going to go ahead and create
some structural relative and kindly
share your ideas in the comment section
below now let's go ahead and understand
this fundamental question why we need
directives well the answer to this
question is very simple the first one is
it provides you code modularity and
manageable so whenever if you have
created a directive and you want to make
certain changes to it you want to change
the color or the attributes in a
different manner set to a different
value you just have to go ahead with
that directive code and make changes
over there and it will be applied
elsewhere wherever it is being used
directives are reusable so basically
whenever we have written a directive or
whenever you have to implement certain
Dom manipulation functionality you don't
have to rewrite those course everywhere
wherever it is required you just have to
put it inside a directive and then
provide or apply that directive wherever
you want to instead of writing it again
so that's why directives plays a very
important part in your angular ecosystem
so finally guys we come to the end of
this session this video and I guess this
was helpful for you now in the next
video I'm going to talk about angular
router where I'm going to show how we
can lower PIFAN or navigate between
different different components in an
angular application so thanks for
watching guys see you in the next video
till then have fun I hope you enjoyed
