to the session of Android if you can
hear me and if you can see me can you
quickly acknowledge in the questions
panel great yeah I can see you guys in
the questions - all right I want you
guys to experience and enjoy the session
I said experience because whatever you
guys see on your cell phone whatever
happens on the cell phone that is what
exactly you guys are going to learn
throughout the sessions and this session
is going to be fun because it's more of
a workshop and more of practicals and I
am quite sure that you all will enjoy
this session guys this session has been
broadly classified into two sessions the
first one would be what is Android
studio so that you guys will get an idea
of what kind of IDE that you guys are
going to use and then we're going to
conduct Android stack No deliberately
I'm going to go a little bit slow on
this Android stack because this
encompasses the linux kernel's device
drivers and about the NDK like you can
even start coding in your C and C++
language and then comes your various
managers and on top of it the Android
programmer will be there so by the end
of the Android stack you guys can decide
whether you want to be the driver
programmer do you want to be an
indicator grammar or do you want to
write some service managers the way that
you all are going to see under the
managers or you want to be the
application programmers so this in turn
will create various verticals and you
can decide what is your passion and
where you want to be so I want you to
give little bit of prominence to this
particular session and I'm pretty much
sure that you're going to like this
Android stack down the line it may take
some time to digest even after the
session even in the next session you
guys can start shooting up the question
so that I'm going to clarify all your
loads on Android stack and the Android
free book after that the most important
thing that what you will be waiting
is to install your Android studio right
so we are going to talk about how to
install the Android studio now at that
point the word I would recommend you all
is to install the Java first and then
the Android studio and I'm going to walk
you through that then we are going to
take a deep dive into Android
programming and whatever the program
that we do it'll in compile your Android
the framework that is so religiously we
all say hello world when you start
learning something new right and that is
what we are going to do but for that we
have to have a kind of in-depth
knowledge in you with your Android stack
and with the android framework so often
that we are going to say we're going to
write a simple program with activity
after that we are going to learn the
activity life cycles now after you guys
learn the activity life cycle there is
where your first session ends and in the
second session I'll be walking you
through the various of the contents now
what exactly is the Android studio and
in fact this in turn is going to give
you all the ID and this is more or less
like your Eclipse ID initially the
Android started off with a Eclipse and
slowly the Google disown the Eclipse
that's about two years ago and then move
on to Android because Android studio has
got a lot of collective objects and
components and the Gradle and a lot of
other stuffs for unimaginable stuff in
this Android studio and there is what
we'll be using throughout the course and
anyway I would suggest you guys not to
use the Eclipse and please do not wander
from studio to any other compilers like
Eclipse right now it's all free it can
be downloaded from your net I'm going to
show you how to download and hear
Android studio Android itself is the
open source and it can be in fact if you
want to can install the complete open
source onto your system and you can
compile it you will get to see every bit
of the code and nothing is hidden from
view and you can walk into every bit of
the code you can recompile and you can
play around with that and the entire
stuff not the entire stuff about
certified it 80% has all been written in
Java like for you I
the UI meaning you being just a beginner
just an Android programmer you'll be
using the Android studio and you'll be
writing the Java applications and we
have something called as the Gradle
build in it and the Gradle build is
something it is phenomenally huge and
big and throughout the course I will be
explaining how to use it and how to
bring in the library how to bring in the
flavors how to bring the ProGuard and
there are tons of stuff that what you
guys have to learn from the Gradle build
alright so having said this let me give
you an introduction to Android like what
exactly is Android stack now let us go
deeper into the stack and let us try to
understand the Android architecture and
let us try to understand how that
literature works once if you get a clear
idea of how the architecture works and
your application that whatever you guys
are going to write will be mounted on
top of the architecture and that is how
you will start learning how to write
your applications so this architecture
happens to be the most important part of
your Android so you have to be a bit
focused on this architecture all right
guess so every ten minutes I will be
looking at the questions panel if you
have any questions if you have any
queries please to leave your questions
in the questions panel all right so I
cannot see you guys because I have
enlarged my screen and all of you are in
the background just in case if you want
me to mute you at any point of time
please do ask me to mune - Lu - so that
you can get your questions clarified
right so let us get into this Android
stack now this is how the stack looks
like and this is what you guys are out
to learn so normally being a developer
you guys will be sitting here on top
that is at the application level and
this is the area that where you will be
writing all your codes all your programs
right now I will be starting from the
Linux from the bottom layer and then
I'll be taking you all the way up to the
applications so let me tell you what
kind of an animal is Android and what
exactly is Android
right so let me talk to you right from
the Linux kernel now as I told you
Android is an open source platform for
the mobile development though Android is
been their scooped all from the Linux
and they have created your Android on
top of Linux now it consists the
complete stack of the Linux hardware as
well as Midwest now this is what we call
it as a Midwest wherein after the Linux
kernel we are going to see the hardware
abstraction layer here and then the
libraries and then the framework all
this comes into the middle bit and then
it goes all the way up to the
application level all right now Android
so it's based on linux 2.6 corners now
they're using this kernel to create the
complete Android system now let me say
if a company let me take a healthcare
company they want to use the cell phone
they don't want to use a cell phone the
way it is now they want to convert the
phone to the healthcare system like for
example it has to become the doctors
friendly phone they should be able to
see the heart rate they should be able
to see the ECGs they should be able to
get a lot of other informations from the
healthcare systems so the most of the
people in healthcare you know what do
they do they in turn they recompile the
Linux kernel they will try to take video
will try to scoop whichever the
components you want from the Linux
kernel they will put it into the device
and they recompile this particular Linux
kernel into their devices so that is how
you can bring in lot of additional
characteristics into your device or you
can eliminate whatever the
characteristics that you don't want in
do device now if you guys look into your
device it is not 100% of Linux that what
you guys can see in your device it is
only a part of it and the very minute I
talk about Linux kernel all it would be
excited about the process about the
scheduler is about lot of other stuff no
they have tweaked into everything the
process is truly not the process that
what you see in the Linux kernels when
it come
so Android as application developer the
process that what you see it'll have the
flavor it look more or less like a
process but lot of stuff is being
tweaked in by Android because they just
wanted to take what they want they don't
want the entire audits of the Linux so
they have completely they have tweaked
into the Linux so please do remember it
is not 100% of Linux what has been used
in Android now this Linux intern does
quite a lot for us and this in turn will
take care of the memory management
process management and networking
management and all that and doesn't turn
the literally take care of your hardware
as well as your device drivers so when
you have to deal with your camera no the
camera in turn will have a driver and
know you guys have to talk to the driver
from the libraries or from the a chin
layer this is a hardware abstraction
layer now for that in this library you
guys would have created the dot ISO file
now the dot ISO file has been created by
the NDK and that in turn can tweak the
hardware can take the information from
the camera and give it all the way up to
the application framework and then the
application framework in turn will give
that information to your applications so
this is how you'll be retrieving the
information from the hardware and it has
been given to this library where the NDK
in turn gives it back to the application
framework and then the application
framework gives it back to the
application for examples now let me say
that you want to zoom in or zoom out the
camera now let me say you're in the
application level all that you do is you
will have an API to zoom in now when you
zoom and though you are trying to deal
with the hardware now directly there's
no way that you can deal with the Linux
kernel now you have to talk to one of
the managers I will come back to it and
I will talk about the managers when I
come to this application framework and
you have to talk to one of the managers
and application framework and that
manager in turn will be talking to the
NDK NDK in turn would have created the
dot SEO library that in turn will be
talking to the camera driver so via the
driver you will be zooming into the
camera will be zooming
of the camera or you will ask your
camera to take a picture and that is how
you will talk to the hardware and better
so you guys can come from all the way up
from your application to the camera and
you can start taking your pictures all
we can start zooming in and you can do
lot of other activities now apart from
this now here the Linux kernel in turn
will help you to deal with all your
inter process communication at the high
level and this has the binders and this
Linux kernel has the job schedulers and
it has got lot motion to it now after
this Linux kernel now this is very
practically you guys are going to see
the device drivers and this is where
practically you guys will be talking to
the hardware now let me go one level up
from the Linux kernel now in fact we
have a glue between the library and
Linux kernels and this is ways you will
get to see something called as the
hardware abstraction layer now all the
dotted so files that what you write and
unit libraries can sit in your hardware
abstraction layers that in turn will
enable you guys to deal with the
hardware directly now when you guys come
to the library as I told you you will be
interested very exactly the Java works
and very exactly the C C++ comes into
the picture because many of you will be
the staunch C C++ dull because you still
want to be on Android but you would love
to write everything using C and C++ you
still have an option by you guys will
fit into this particular area into the
middle level area and you guys can write
all the programs now this green block
that what you guys are seeing here it
completely this block dwells with your
sequences you guys can write completely
the C and C++ part of the program and
this in turn will fuel your Android and
it gives in
Lloris power to the Android right now
when it comes to the surface manager the
surface manager is responsible for
drawing different layers of the screen
and different layers and different
windows now the surface manage
we'll take care of manipulating the
pixels and bringing the images bringing
the videos and it is suit that video on
to the relevant screen on to the
relevant frames and a moralist
predominantly at a very high level there
is of your surface managers will work
now when you come to this OpenGL
whenever you are trying to use the
OpenGL your device needs to have the
chipset that is a 3d chipset and it
needs to have the accelerations
accelerations in it and then you guys
can start using the OpenGL this can be
used by your camera and by your video
recorders and all that in turn will be
using your OpenGL right so if you guys
know about opengl n media is using quite
a lot of opengl and they do a lot of
animation kind of programs right and in
fact if you all have heard about the
life of Pi and n media guys they don't
they're a part of Life of Pi and there
is oh they brought in that amazing
graphics and all that this stuff has
been brought into it very similarly this
OpenGL will help us to bring in the 3d
graphics onto the smartphones and onto
the other devices like your tab and
which are the devices that you hold now
SGL happens to be this in turn will help
you for the two-dimensional graphics all
that has been dealt is assist you and
when we come to this media framework now
this is the space you will use your
media players you'll be playing the
audio you'll be playing the video and
all that and this is which you all will
get to see all the codecs sitting here
in this particular place in the media
framework now such as your h.264 your
AAC mp3 and mpeg-4
all those things will be here in this
particular area and those are the
collects what you guys will be using to
play your video and to Paul stock
whatever that you want to do you'll be
using this particular collects so
similarly we have a lot of further
rosters like your SQLite now when you
talk about SQLite and guys you would
have been quite familiar with this and
this predominantly this in turn will
help you at the course to write your
databases
right like creating database storing
retrieving all that is going to happen
right from this place and the WebKit
will take care of your browsers and now
if you look into this Apple phones the
Safari intern is using the WebKit and
the Google intern is using the WebKit
all these guys they use the WebKit to
get best out of the process so like this
we have various libraries and this
libraries or finally it is related with
Atlantic scholars so but from this you
have the application framework now
before I get to the application
framework we have something called as
the runtime library now the rent time is
very important in Android we use the
dalvik virtual machine now the dalvik
virtual machine helps the smaller
devices like your cell phone and all
that and this dalvik virtual machine can
make the program run in the limited
environment with a limited memory with
the limited CPU capabilities and with a
limited battery alright now this in turn
is called as DBM the dalvik virtual
machine is called as DBM and all the
codes that what you write here it will
be in form of a bytecode and that in
turn will sit in form of a file or in
form of a jar file and eventually you
will get to see all the files as the
text files now normally the text files
are used to run the application the
process in the smaller devices and it is
going to work very efficiently and that
is what your dalvik virtual machine is
doing on top of it Android has got
something called as an ERT and top of
your Android runtime that happens to be
the Android runtime and that happens to
be a very interesting addition plug-in
that what Android has gotten now when
you run when you compile your program it
doesn't really compile the program all
over again what are the lines that you
have written it just picks up those
lines and it compiles that lines so
second time when you are trying to
compile your program your program is
going to work much faster and that is
where your ERT will come into the
picture that also can be called as your
just-in-time compiler
so when it comes to the core library
that has this got all the collection
classes here and that's about your
Android runtime and going back to this
application framework and this plays a
very vital role and displays a very
important role for our application
development now whenever you write an
application your applications now you
may write hello world or you may write
an application to make a call or to
receive some data from the browser or
whatever the kind of applications you
right now under this application
framework what you see here is not
predominantly their call to the managers
called as activity manager packet
manager window manager telephony manager
content Troyer managers resource
managers and so on so forth all these
managers will be watching you and in
turn will constantly they will be
providing the informations to you right
from the hardware level and whatever you
asked for all the information is being
carried out to the hardware and from the
hardware they'll be bringing up all the
informations for you and this is how
this applications framework is going to
help you to write your applications now
for example if you write your activity
normally in Android the applications
with what we write is called as an
activity now immediately the activity
manager will swing into action and he
takes the complete control and activity
managers is the one he manages the life
cycle of the application oh guys give me
a few minutes I'm going to take you deep
into this life cycle of this
applications and he is the one he is
going to manage the lifecycle of
application though when you start
clicking on various applications on your
mobile now activity manager is the one
he's going to hold the back stack and
back and forth he will allow you to
navigate the applications and he is
going to give you a smoother experience
and this is what more or less the
activity manager will do now package
manager is an integral part of your
Android though this guy in turn will
keep track of how many applications were
there in your emulator how many
applications are running in your
emulator what kind of permissions has
been given to that application
all that has been taken care of by the
package manager package manager happens
to be a kind of brain to your
application now all the applications
identity and the resources or the
resources meaning the application
details like whether it has got the
right permissions where is it been
executing is it being held or what
exactly is happening on your activity
all that information is being held by
the package manager so as you have the
telephony manager know for an instance
you're watching if a couple of pictures
from the gallery all of a sudden a phone
lines they call lenses now how exactly
that can happen because the telephony
manager has to get a call right from the
lightening colonel right now this in
turn will be checking on the IRS and
this in turn will be checking on whether
I received a call or not the very minute
the call is received and the hardware
abstraction layer will pick the call
where the libraries and then it is the
telephony manager this is a call for you
and this telephony manager gives the
call to the application and that is how
you guys will be able to pick the call
right from the hardware level right and
you call you talk and when you terminate
the telephony manager knows that you are
terminated and it goes to the colonel
back that the call is terminated now
very similarly you have content
providers now I am giving you an
overview on couple of managers because
you've got lot more managers and what
you see on the screen and we will be
working while writing programs and we'll
take you deeper into it now we have the
content providers now the content
providers is all a very interesting
stuff know for example if you are
writing your application in SQLite now
whatever the application you write lives
in a sandbox it cannot be seen or it
cannot be shared by the other
applications at that point of time the
content provider in turn is going to
create a wrapper on top of your SQLite
on top of your application sandbox and
the content providers makes the data
available to the other process across
the sandbox and there is a whole idea of
using
the content provider and this is how
normally we use the content providers
right for example the context now the
context is what you have in your phone
can be used by the other applications
there is a container order for example
your SMS SMS lands into your cell phone
and the other applications may want to
read all the SMS and displayed in the
application again it uses the content
providers so like that we use the
content Reuters then we have the
location manager now this is a very
interesting stuff now we write
everything related to the Google Maps no
Google Maps completely relay on your
location manager and this location
manager is a very interesting guy and
know for example you want to write an
application wherein you're driving now
at that point of time you want to be
told
very exactly is that I am driving as a
snow now if you register with the
location manager the location manager
will notify your application that this
is the X comma Y coordinates that where
you're driving now again you can ask the
location manager hey can you tell me the
DNS places around you know as of snow
that where I am driving then it pulls in
all the nearby places and it tells your
application that you are passing by a
pub you are passing by a hotel you are
passing very Hospital and so on so forth
now you guys can even write an
application where if you are interested
in having a lunch in a particular
restaurant and when you are passing by
at that time the location manager will
quickly post a message to you're saying
that you're passing business restaurant
is your favorite food you want to stop
by and that is how interesting you guys
can make your applications to be using
this managers now we have notification
manager now this notification manager
plays a very important role now it is
not that already you guys would have
seen like if you have a missed call on
your cell phone and when you wake up you
go to the notification area and when you
see you will know that you have a missed
call you have missed SMS and all that
now it is not only used for your SMS Zen
for the call now the notification
manager can also be related
to the hardware now it can be healthcare
hardware or it can be any of the other
all this that in turn can start pumping
the information to the notification
manager and the notification manager in
turn will start giving it up onto the
screen it does do that these are the
messages that what you have received
from the various devices right so this
is all you get a lot of information from
the hardware devices now guys I told you
now to your phone you can bring in you
can attach a lot of other gadgets also
for example in fact I was working I was
consulting a company there we wrote an
application for a smoke analyzer and
that was a different board all together
now that board cannot go into the cell
phone now what did they created a
separate board and they added that board
where the USB drive into the phone and
it can be used where the Bluetooth also
now when you take the breath alcohol
analysis from the driving guy and this
board in turn will analyze the alcohol
level the breath alcohol level and then
immediately it notifies and the data
will come to the notification saying
that you know what kind of alcohol that
is consumed and from this the data will
go to the server data will go to the
cloud and lot of things will happen
so the notification manager can listen
to the phone as well as into the various
hard ways where has been plugged into
this phone right similarly you have the
view the view happens to be a very
interesting part of your Android
programming and this in turn will give
you the core view to the application
guys and using this you can start
creating your own widgets your own
events and you can do a lot of
interesting stuff using the view and
anyway you are going to see this later
now to give you a brief idea of what
exactly is happening in the Android spec
and this is what normally happens in
Android stack and I just know you guys
are sitting here at the application
level and you are writing your
application now let me take you a little
more deeper let me give you a kind of
experience with this particular stack
now imagine you guys are holding the
phone on your hand
now the
app that what you are trying to see here
happens to be your phone now what is it
I am trying to do in this diagram this I
am trying to bring in this Android stack
now you saw the various layers of
Android stack here this is a formal way
of looking at Android stack but I want
you to understand how exactly the stack
works on your phone when you are holding
your phone how exactly the stack is
related and how exactly the stack works
on your phone and that is what you're
getting into as us now
now when you hold the phone on to your
hand imagine as of now you are looking
into some pictures now you are looking
into the gallery now when you scroll
down when you see dawn you have
something called as activity stack in
this activity stack it holds the running
applications now in phone you all will
see many of the applications it is
getting executed meaning it is running
on your phone and or a switch it can be
the gallery can be the phone it can be
calendar browser and lot more
applications will be running on your
phone no I just know you are watching
some pictures now whatever the
application is running on your phone
that is what stays on top of the
activity now in the activities that you
all can see the gallery is on top of the
activities tank that means your
application gallery is running on your
phone as of now now let us assume when
you are watching some pictures a call
comes in there is a beauty of phone
right that the priority that what
happens on your phone when I call comes
in it so happens that the call cannot
magically it cannot land onto your phone
now we have the managers to the right
out of this managers y'all can see
window manager broadcast manager
location manager and telephony manager
now as I told you in the previous slide
this is a mid 11 and this guy in turn
will be talking to the NDK and where the
hardware abstraction layers and he talks
to the Linux kernel and he receives the
call he gets a call and he gives it to
you
what exactly happens here now you had
you been watching the pictures right you
are on gallery now the call came in now
the gallery is being pushed below the
stack meaning
it will go just down down the browser
because I don't have so much space to
accommodate all the applications imagine
this gallery is being completely pushed
on below the stack under the browser now
this phone is what is the active
application now now the phone as search
is going to come to the top of the stack
in the place of gallery the phone is
going to sit and you are going to pick
the cause and when you are done with
that call you're going to tell the
manager again the manager knows that you
are done with a call and the manager in
turn will you disconnect the manager in
turn will go tell the hardware that
you're done with a call the very minute
that you are done with a call now the
phone in turn is done and the gallery
what is there in the bottom of the stack
has been brought back to the position to
the first place like the way that you
are watching the pictures and the phone
has been pushed down the stack now
whatever is in your Android whatever
stays on top of the stack only that
application is alive only that
application is running the other
applications are not alive and it is all
there in the stack and we are going to
go and we're going to take a detailed
look at it later now this is what I want
you guys to understand now whenever you
click on some applications like let me
say that you guys are going to click on
calendar now the calendar is going to
come to the top of the stack and the
calendar be working and you click on
some other application that is going to
come to the top of the second that will
be working and this is all when you
click on the applications and this is
all it is going to come to the top of
the activity stack so here guys I want
you to get familiarized with when you
are start writing your application what
what components is surrounded by the
application that is very important for
us to know now we have something called
as the manifest dot XML in manifest XML
we have the launcher we have the default
we have the action we have category and
we have the data now here this in turn
will live in form of an intent filter
all this the launcher the default
launcher means your main activity and
action is the name of the activity the
category is whether it is the launcher
of the default or whatever is been
stored and the data in turn will have
the schema of the activity don't worry
about it I will be going deeper into it
when we start writing the program's all
that is being stored in the manifest now
for example like you have so many
applications like gallery phone calendar
browsers so on so forth every
application has its own manifest and
every manifest has a launcher it has the
action it has the category and it has
the data and it every application has
this and this will be updated by all the
applications now all this information is
held by the package manager now guys you
know the packet manager also comes under
the manager and the packet manager knows
that how many applications are living
inside your phone and how many
applications are there and which
application is running actually and
which application is in control all that
information and publishers and all the
other informations is being held by the
package manager right so that's all the
manifest is ingrained into the packet
manager so all the application Spanish
this has been stored in packet manager
so the package manager literally knows
how many applications of this in your
device so but from this we have the view
this happens to be a different object by
itself now when you are writing an
application now we call activity as an
application now you get to see the
screen don't get excited just by looking
at the screen the screen that what do
you all see in your cell phone
happens to be this view right now when I
talk about my app this is where the
activity will come into the picture no
actually when you see your application
you can imagine two layers one is your
application layers and top of it the
view sitting there to show you the
screen right the views is going to act
as an interface with your application so
that is how the view is imbibed on top
of your applications so the view intern
has a subclass called as the surfaces
now if you want to bring the picture
onto the application or if you want to
bring a video on to the application to
display you need something called as the
surface flinches and that happens to be
a subclass from the view and that is all
you're seeing it under the view and
while writing the media players and all
that and we are going to go to the
surface printers and we'll see what it
does now part
that you have something called as the
use permissions so these use permissions
is used under the manifests so for
example you're downloading a square from
your Play Store and your phone does not
have the camera in it and you want to
download a camera application right so
you're going to goof up if you are able
to download the camera application and
when the camera application shows up and
you will start clicking on camera but
your phone does not have the camera
right so in this situation now in use
permission while writing the program you
have mentioned that the hardware
whatever the kind of hardware that this
device is going to use so my cell phone
is using the camera my cell phone is
using the network Wi-Fi all that is
present if you say so
now such a Google intern the Google Play
Store in turn will let you download the
application which has the camera on it
the application which has an network in
it the application which has got the
Wi-Fi in it just in case if you are not
using this potion's when you are trying
to download it from the Google Play
Store the Google Play Store first we'll
go to the use permission area and checks
this particular word for camera if it is
not there the Google intern will not let
you download any application related to
the camera now this is how the use
permissions will work the use
permissions will help you to download
the applications from Google and use
permissions will request for the
permission to use the camera as well as
the Wi-Fi and all that from various
other managers and you'll be using it in
your equipment no coming back to my app
that you remember your application by
default is a threaded application no
don't come to the conclusion you all may
something may ring in your mind you all
may feel oh you and Java also has it by
default now somehow you guys manage
writing application not using much of
thread in Java because you all tend to
avoid threads in Java but in Android it
is a must and if you don't use thread
most of your applications will not work
right so it is very important so here
they have gotten 30% of the Java thread
the rest is all the Android related
threads the Android trade has got the
message queue it has the handlers it has
the loopers and so on so forth
everything is this inside it and that's
something very exciting and interesting
we will be looking at it when we write
the state applications so please try to
understand right on day one the first
hello world program that word you're
going to write it will be running by a
thread then the most important thing
here is the logcat logcat has been very
well named because the logcat is curious
about everything now when you are
running your application the logcat is
monitoring watching your application
every variable that what you are using
in your application the logcat knows so
using log ket you can start watching
your application on which state my
application is in what exactly which
part of my application is running why my
application is sluggish and all the
other informations that you can start
getting into the locket now the logcat
is going to help you only in the debug
mode when you are in the debug mode if
your running applications like gallery
phone calendar browser or all the
applications will be this but one
applications will be running now the
phone will be running in the default now
probably the browser also is running in
the default mode at that point of time
the logcat can watch it can start
dumping the information of all the
applications like gallery phone calendar
browser and so on so forth so that many
a times you can use log check to know
why your program is sluggish now you
will get to know why your program is
sluggish is not because of your program
because somebody is holding the view for
a ransom some bad application is sitting
there making your program sluggish all
that you can figure it out using your
locket in fact while writing the program
I'm going to talk more about log cat now
after that you have the file manager
this happens to be a very interesting
part of your Android application now
this in turn happens to be an integral
part of your Android and no one can lay
their hands into the file manager now
this happens to be the internal file
system now whenever you create an
application now let me say you are
writing a gallery application now this
lives in a sandbox nobody can see nobody
can retrieve the data from the gallery
nobody can use it when it is there in
the sandbox
now this is well guys the content
provider is coming and it has made the
data whatever is available in galleries
plural so that all of you can use the
data from the gallery now such
applications will sit inside the file
manager so that it cannot be shown to
the other users or the other users
cannot see what is happening inside the
file manager for example it comes under
the package names of what you write then
for example if you are writing your
rescue light database that database is
going to be there in the file manager
and if you are writing anything related
to the shared preferences that is going
to be under the file manager all this
data cannot be seen by the outsider and
this is going to be common to the
process that what you are running and
those are the data is that what sits
inside the file manager then comes the
emulator this is something interesting
now you guys would have been writing
programs on Apple phone and now for the
heck of it you want to write a program
and Android that doesn't mean that you
have to buy a phone the Android in turn
is going to give you an emulator you can
run I would say the emulator is going to
act as 95% of your phone and you guys
can run your applications try it on the
emulators right now for example Android
from version 5 the new phones will come
up with version 6 version 7 and so on so
forth now every six months we cannot
spend 30,000 50,000 to bite the phones
is that right
from we cannot go on buying version 5
and 6 and 7 and so on so forth so in
this situation you can create an
emulator from version 7 and you can
write your program and you can stimulate
the entire thing in this particular
emulator so you need not have to buy the
phone you can run all the programs on
the emulator but emulator in turn cannot
run most of the applications like your
location managers cannot run on the
emulator the call managers cannot run on
the emulator and the sensors cannot run
on the emulator because it has to happen
with the real DSPs intern is going to
sense and get the information for you
all that will not work on the emulator
this works only on your regular devices
so a couple of stuff will not work on
emulators be aware of that and there are
ways to simulate it or
so that we'll see it later know this in
turn will give you a complete idea of
what exactly is your application and
what exactly is happening around you is
what is that we have seen roughly till
now
now most of you will be focusing on the
UI and you all will feel that if my UI
looks good my application is good and
you will feel really happy about it
and you all will feel that you have
written a fantastic application because
your application looks good on the cell
phone when it is executed on the phone
what next
when you are done with writing the
application that gets under the hammer
that goes to your manager and then the
manager will scrutinize your application
using your device monitor and it has
something called as your DDMS if that is
what you call it as a device monitor now
it puts your application under the
hardness test and it checks your
application for the performance analysis
and it takes how much of the memory your
application is hogging then it checks
the hierarchy view and the trace you in
turn will show you why your application
is sluggish
which part of the applications is going
running really slow and how much of
backing your application is consuming
the battery historian this at another
place that where you can see the
activity of your battery when an
application is running all these things
have been checked by your manager using
your DDMS guys you will be learning how
to write in your DDMS and how to go
through all these levels and how to
check your application in the following
sessions and know your manager in turn
will mark your applications and is going
to send it back to you saying that
character all this and come back to me
and unless your application runs through
the hardness test unless you get 100%
Android result your application cannot
go out of yours build level like it
cannot be given to your clients the
manager in turn is going to stop it
because the user is going to get a bad
experience then you get the bad
experience and they will not use your
applications and the bad name for you
comes and this is this happens to be the
most important thing in your development
cycle and this is what you guys will be
learning
on the line no guys in fact I've been
talking about the application level now
let me go back I've been explaining
about the application that what you are
writing
and you saw the application framework to
the right you saw the managers were
sitting and helping you to do what you
have to do and the library intern was
streaking into this kernel and you're
getting all the back and forth
information and this is what you guys
have seen so far here but we have not
seen the hardware yet and we have not
seen the red blocks yet
now before I want to the hardware I'd
like to know if you guys have any
questions and if you before I head on to
the hardware and before we start the
application and I want you to get
yourself clarified so please do let me
know if you have any questions in the
questions panel or please do let me know
if you want me to unmute you guys I'm
going to unmute your hand you all can
talk to me and you can get the concepts
right and then we can want the next
concept can I quickly see an
acknowledgement from you if this concept
is clear tell me yes if the concept is
not clear to you if you have any doubt
oops say no and or you guys can ask me
to unmute you all right
I can see lot of you answering so let me
read this oh yeah I can see a question
from Neil he is asking me what is the
difference between the aft and JIT
no the aft in other words is called as
JIT
yeah t means it is the Android runtime
and JIT means it is just in time no LT
has been got into this Dalek that is a
Dalek virtual mission as a kind of
plug-in didn't you need not have to
recompile the program all over again
no if you modify your program with about
three or four lines now you need not
have to recompile all the thousand lines
of your code all over again
now alt in turn will help you guys to
compile only the three lines of code
then that means imagine you're going to
take couple of milliseconds to compile
your program and your program gets
compiled and just-in-time compilers is
more relevant to the ERT
that is just in time now whatever has to
be compiled
you compile only that and it executes
your program so when you're compiling
your program for the second time it is
going to be the speed will be amazing it
is going to be really quick and really
fast normally in the other applications
in your Regency or in Java platform on
very very earth you have to recompile
the complete code but Google has come up
with a fantastic idea why is that have
to recompile the complete code I will be
comparing only the lines report you have
changed and that is where the air T
comes into the picture
is that clear mean or do you have any
other questions great so great you can
ask me to unmute or if you want me to I
will unmute you guys or even this
questions panel is fine and if you have
the simpler questions then we'll start
clarifying it in this questions panel
now let me move from here to the
hardware level now let us see what is
waiting for us in the hardware level now
as I told you when a call comes in magic
cannot happen it has to happen from the
hard rest no the telephony internet has
to go talk to the hardware all right so
I didn't have much of space in the
screen so that if the hardware has been
pushed on completely after this now guys
y'all can see this ADK now the green box
that what you saw this library is that
what you are seeing here there is a
surface manager OpenGL SGL SSL free type
WebKit SQLite and all that this
libraries and the hardware abstraction
layers now this two layers has been
taken up by your NDK now indicate turn
is going to deal with the libraries know
you know prominently I'll be hearing the
dot EXO files now the dot iso files are
the files that in turn can mediate with
your hardware as well as to the upper
layers and that is what has been written
using the native development kit and
that is what the NDK means you now the
NDK means it is a native development kit
using the native development kit using
your C++ you'll be writing your
application says that in turn can tweak
between the hardware and that in turn
can take the information all the way up
to the user on to the topmost layer that
is application layer now guys
do not ask me Wow C++ is reloading and
right so let me write C++ so will my
application is going to be faster
compared to Java because normally to say
Java is about 17 times slower than your
C++ now my application will it be 17
times faster even that is considerable
stuff that what I can do for my
application that is what you all may ask
me but Mans it is you know now the speed
will not increase just because you are
writing it in C++
now NDK happens to be a different
subject by itself though when you get to
indicate you will get to know when to
use your C++ and why it will be faster
why it will be slow and how that in turn
can talk to the hardware and how it that
in turn can talk to the application
layers and all that you will understand
only in any case in this SDK Android
development you guys will not be
learning much about NDK but as and when
it is necessary I'll be giving you a lot
of ideas lot of thoughts provoking
thoughts and I will tell you why NDK and
why it comes into the picture and how it
talks to the hardware all that I will be
talking but all this will happen only at
the superficial layer now the way that
you guys saw in the library is just
remind you the media have got in this
framework SQLite other jail and all that
and everything is pertaining to your
libraries now comes the glue the glue
happens to be the HL this happens to be
the hardware abstraction layers now
whatever the dot is so files you write
and that in turn is passed on to the
glue and this in turn will talk to the
driver and the driver in turn will talk
to the hardware and he gets the
information gives it back to the glue
from there it goes back to NDK from
there it goes back to the managers and
from the managers it will come to you
that is where you guys are sitting no
apart from that there's something very
interesting for you when you are writing
your Android applications all of a
sudden for no reason your application
may crack and your application may say
that please rerun the server to bring
your applications up now here you have a
very thin bridge between the hardware
and the software list and that is what
is this
now this I'm calling it as running
server keeps the above free-market
points know this in turn will be running
a constantly consistently a server will
be running on top of the hardware and
that in turn will keep the user know
whatever the diagram that you see all
that is at the bones of your server and
this is alive this is intact and this is
working because it bridges on the very
minute you burn the bridge this
application is going to collapse and
everything is going to die your Android
studio will not compile your Android
studio will not work right so that is
when you have to rebuild you have some
adb commands to rebuild the server and
we can restart the server so your
application will be up and running so
this is the server it is going to build
a bridge between the hardware and the
software right now but from that we have
the Linux kernels
now let me talk about the Linux kernel I
have given you enough information now
this in turn has got limited amount of
information now all the information that
what it has in your android device is
not jukniene meaning it is not 100% of
linux the entire thing has been tweaked
and they're using what is required for
your devices and that is all the scooped
the Linux they have recompiled the Linux
on your devices and that is how they've
gotten the Linux on your devices and
this is all about the Linux kernel and
hardware and guys you're seeing the
runtime ERT NJIT that is the
just-in-time compiler and the core
library all that is sitting here as a
part of it and this is how the complete
architecture looks like now this can be
called as the Android stack or it can be
called as the architecture know when you
are writing hello world you cannot come
to the conclusion that oh I am writing
my main and I will use something like a
print statement to say hello world
that's not the way the Android books now
you want to say hello world now so much
is going to happen in the background and
this is how the Android is going to hold
your Android description to execute your
application right
now you have been closely monitored by
your managers closely monitored by the
window managers activity manager packet
manager and even the power manager power
manager is the most important stuff for
example you guys are writing again when
you are reading a game you don't want
the game to be switched off after 30
seconds because that is what you guys
would have set your phone to right
because after 30 seconds you switch off
the screens now using the power manager
you can ask the requester power managers
keep my application on all the time now
this power manager will never let your
application sleep so that now here under
gallery phone calendar browser you
imagine your gaming application here
this gaming application is a hard nut he
is sitting on all the time after you
complete the game you would have a
slipped off now at that point also the
power manager has kept the wait clock on
and this application is consuming all
the battery in the background and he
becomes a culprit for your battery
drainage and that is how you can use the
power manager power manager in turn can
keep track of how the battery is being
used and battery historian cabe can keep
track of who is hogging the battery and
what is happening with the battery and
things like that guys let me tell you
something when you are writing Android
programming this is yet another assembly
language I would say because you just
can't write the applications like the
Java program no you have to be so
critically here to watch every line that
you write for your time and space
complexity if you write a bad code that
in turn is going to give create an
impact on the memory that in turn is
going to create an impact on your
processor that in turn is going to
create an impact on your battery now one
line of code so much is going to happen
so guys please do remember that you have
to write a good code and you have to
take care of your time and space
complexities alright so I don't want to
bore you with too much of theory now is
the time for us to get into Android and
say hello to the world let us take up a
simple program and see how to write an
application
you know what I want you to keep this
diagram probably a printout of this
diagram next to you for a couple of days
and weeks so whenever you are writing
your applications I want you to check on
this I want you to elaborate this
printout I want you to go to the
developers site and see what is
happening I want you to start marking on
a lot more information on your windows
manager packet manager broadcast
locations and all that and I want you to
explore this and I want you to stick to
it when you are writing your
applications so please do not think it
is like Java all right now let us take a
quick plunge into our installation now
first you guys the really curious to
know how exactly to install your Android
studio though in fact I'm going to give
you two steps to install Android studio
just in case if you are not able to
install it if you have any problem you
can write to supported it a recorded
cook those guys in turn will swing in
for action and they're going to help you
how to install your studio
so you have got support from both ends
so that is the beauty of your ad rekha
now it's a mandate for you to install
the JDK and then come to the Android
studio all of you will be wondering oh
my god what is that he is taking me to
the jdk screen no this is a mandate now
when you click on this the JDK now this
is a screen that were do you can see and
if you are using your back please click
on em right here on Mac OS please click
on this and download the JDK or if you
are using your Windows 64 or 32 click on
either of this and that in turn will
help you to download your windows the
JDK for Windows right once if you are
done with this the next thing that what
you have to do is you have to install
the Android studio so the second slide
that way you are heading to is going to
be installation of Android studio now
just by clicking here at
developer.android.com this in turn is
going to take you on to the developer
studio developer.android.com and this
you are going to get this button
download Android studio 2.0 too and you
click on that for the Android store to
download now the Android studio
a shell will download in a couple of
minutes but installing the SDKs will
take about couple of us for you don't
get desire tent and this may take about
three hours for you to install all the
SDKs now let me take you into the
Android studio let me show you how the
Android studio looks like and what you
have to do after installing the Android
studio let me move on to that
now I have by Android studio
intentionally I have not loaded my
Android studio I have to go all the way
back to my launch pad and I'm going to
click on the Android studio so that all
of you will get an idea of how long it
takes for this Android studio to load
now if you have what I would recommend
is minimum 12 GB RAM and about your
Intel i5 or i7 processor and 2gb RAM
should be good
16 would be great but what I'm using is
Mac I'm using 16 GB as I'm with the SSD
drive in it now when you click on the
Android this is what your Android studio
is going to look like now even before I
take you on to the application
development and I always show you how
exactly to install the SDKs into your
application now you all can see start a
new Android studio project we'll come
back to it within a minute now you all
can see open an existing Android studio
check out blah blah blah all these
things so please go to configure because
I'm assuming that you are running the
Android studio for the first time now
click on the SDK managers later on I
will show you when you're right inside
the Android studio I will show you how
to get to this SDK manager there also
now when you click on the SDK studio
this is the screen you guys will get
into now if you really want to please
start installing from the honeycomb
honeycomb is slightly latest you can
install from your ice cream sandwich
from 4.0 till the nugget all right now
click on the show package for details so
what you saw was an extract right so if
you want to know more about what exactly
is there in marshmallow what exactly is
there in lollipop what I'm supposed to
install now click on the show package
details and then you guys are going to
see a lot of stuff now wherever you can
see the tick mark now let me do anything
I'm not using much of the nagas desist
now now let me take you to la leaper now
here watch the Google APs
please install this install android
platform 22 and source for the android
22 now if you're writing applications
for your TV you can install it or
you're writing application for the video
can install this then you please install
your Ihram and Intel here and that's
about it and you're ready to go and
please install this also all the errands
and your Intel right and you are ready
to go very similarly you're going to see
the same in all the other variations
also for a KitKat you're going to see
the same stuff and you can install the
whole lot of stuff right there by
clicking on the top right there is
something very important for you
so part from that please move on to sdk
tools in sdk tools please install this
your intel 86 emulator know when you're
running emulator the emulator works
because of this emulator accelerator
there is Intel 86 emulator accelerator
what you see here please install this do
not variable to NDK because you'll not
be reading their decay programs and then
please install the Google Play services
here you all can see this Google Play
services and anything related to Google
you install everything down the line
when we all right the Google application
Google Maps and all that and we need the
Google Play services and also install
the Android SDK build tools see make and
ll DB Android Auto app a stimulator
documentation for Android SDK install
all the barriers that you see the tick
marks and whatever that I've installed
please go ahead and install all the
things in your system right so this in
turn will take three hours for you to
install do not get disheartened and once
if you are installed you are ready to go
with your Android write this is very
important for you guys now guys are you
clear business do you have any questions
with the installation part
all right so I presume that you're okay
with this now let me go on to Android
let me click on start a new application
now all if I guess that all of you are
waiting for this time and y'all are
really excited to see how to write your
first application and it's really very
interesting every step that what you're
going to go through will be very
interesting now here we have to give the
application name now you can give any
name that you want now let me call this
as my first
at right and so here you can give your
company domain here and this happens to
be the package name it can be anything
that you want as a habit we all say calm
calm dot a dareka dot
training dot my app right so like this
you can give your own packet name it can
be separated by the various dots when
you give your company domain when you
give this and that is what it is being
treated as down the line as the packet
name and it goes in the reverse order
now you all can see this is my app
training ed Eureka calm and my first
step my first app is application name
that has been tagged at the end and this
happens to be the packet name and guys
you know this is the namespace in Java
and this happens to be a unique packet
name so that it'll not clash with your
other applications down here you all can
see the folder that been exactly that
you are creating your first application
it is this in your ad Rekha sessions 3
and in your my first step no I don't
want this to be under session 3 now let
me just go to a Dre cuz it is on to the
first session right so now let me click
on it a Raqqah and I'll say next say ok
and I'll say next right it's an oregano
now you guys are curious to know why
when I have my nog advised that I have
to use my jellybeans that would be the
question what you have in your mind
please note by opting to jellybean it
says by targeting APA 17 and later your
app will run approximately on a 7.4
percent of the devices which is
prevailing across the globe right now
this is being suggested by the Google
Play Store now because I don't get about
this I want to go up all the way to my
noggin now from 4.3 jelly bean to 7.0
let me say now please note here you all
can see by targeting API 24 and later
your app will run on less than 1% of the
devices that happens to be the latest
devices not many people even will be
owning the devices so what is that
you're going to gain out of it like you
don't want to make little money order
for your product like you want the
maximum people to use it so this for the
testing purpose for the compiling
purpose and for your personal reasons
you can use this but when you are
releasing this into the Play Store I
would not suggest you to use the latest
versions because your
know that it is running for less than 1%
now let me come back to lollipop
now lollipop is 40.5% because it is not
latest it is getting a bleat and lot of
people are moving towards the other
zones other versions and now the
mashmallow happens to be the running one
currently this is what people are using
but inside as of now but still you all
can see only four point seven percent of
the people are using your marshmallow so
let us fall back to the older that is
your API 17 4.2 now guys if you are
working and the concepts called as the
job schedulers and when you're working
on services and so many other concepts
and Devin highlight they will recommend
you to use the versions about 21 below
21 it will not go there is what they
recommend keep an eye on those things
then again after this you Android is
asking you whether will you be writing
your application in phone or tablet now
I said yes I will be writing an
application with my cell phone and
tablet now not with my wave or TV or
your desk so I'm not clicking on
anything I am going up to the next now
there is this is where you all can see
the template and you when you click on
this you're going to see an awesome
application coming up in front of you
though you have done nothing now the
framework of Google Maps is going to be
working for you it just by clicking on
this now we are not interested in any of
this because we wanted to learn the
application right from scratch we want
to experience it right so let me click
on let me pick on empty activity let me
say next and now it says the activity
name that what you are choosing is going
to be the main activity the project name
is the first step and this is going to
be the main activity let it be because
this is going to be the internal name
that what will have it for others
external is these people cannot see this
now once if you are creating an activity
though initially I told you the activity
has been enamoured by the view on top of
your application what you see is the
view under the view what you see what
has been mounted is the activity
all right so the most important thing
for you to understand here is this is
the activity and the layout name layout
name activity underscore main in turn
will be referring to the view okay that
is what you have to remember now I will
take you back to the PowerPoint and I
will show you how this will look like
now in this case you're going to see a
beautiful screen the beautiful screen
appears only because of the activity
main now the core part of the job the
work course is the main activity this is
where you will be writing your code to
take care of it right so we are almost
done and let me say finish now he is
bringing up the Android studio this will
take a while now it depends on your
system and configuration this may come
up in a minute or it may even take about
three minutes for you guys to see the
screen so don't get deserted now let me
close I don't want the tips now and when
you select on the tips and is going to
give you a lot of steps to write your
applications all right guys you're right
there with your Android studio and I
told you I promised you that I will show
you where the SDK manager is right
inside the studio if you have forgotten
or at any point of time if you want to
install you want to upgrade your SDK
please watch this down arrow here and if
you leave the cursor for a couple of
seconds it is going to show you the SDK
manager and click on that and this will
take you back to the screen set where we
came from right so you should be
familiar with this stuff right so that's
from here you can go back to this SDK
screen and that is what I told you
earlier now it's time for me to
introduce to the studio and in fact if I
run this application this application is
going to say hello to me now I'm not
interested in seeing my hello but I'm I
want to understand what exactly this
studio is all about and how the
applications is organized in this
particular studio now to the right
whatever you guys are seeing happens to
be the place that where you are going to
write your source code and to the left
whatever that you are seeing happens to
be the most of this happens to be the
resource related stuff right now this re
s is where all the resource related
information is present right this
in Java in my apt or training that ad
record at concerts my first step you all
can see this main activity when I click
on that this is your activity this is
what you're seeing here now it is all
open to the right now this is your first
application now you're hardly seeing one
on create function right inside this and
nothing much apart from your extends app
compact activity all right now the most
important thing for you to understand
here is like what exactly is the
resource and what kind of contents or
they in resource let me give you a
bird's eye view on this now when I click
on the layout guys this is what you also
on the screen you saw the main activity
and you saw the activity main.xml this
two files that you saw while building
the project and you all can see it all
over here again now when I click on this
activity main now this is how your
emulator is going to bring your screen
up now this is a display it is not the
emulator you are just watching the view
and this is how it is going to bring up
the view and it says the hello world for
you now when you click on the text and
this in turn shows you how exactly it
says the hello world and it talks about
the layout what kind of layout that you
have in your application this will be
discussing about this layouts in detail
in the next session because almost half
the session is going to go with the
layout itself and we will redesign the
professional applications at that point
now we have the relative layout as if
now inside that we have the textview in
the textview we have said the hello
world and that is how you guys are able
to see this hello world now to give you
little more explanation to it let me go
back to the design imagine this is your
phone you're holding it in your palm
when you are holding your phone on your
palm you know what your skin is hugging
to the phone when the skin hugs to the
phone and it is eating up this
particular space also right this edges
now just in case if you get a button to
the edge and if you have a button the
way you're holding the phone the skin in
turn will press the button the button
may get activated and there's a reason
we would prefer to give this
space on the phone right so can you see
the space from the under screen between
the starting area to the hello world
there is a little bit of space this
space on top and very similarly this
space is going to run through all over
this screen now how do we do that now
let me go back to the text
now here y'all can see the layout is the
relative layout I'm going to talk about
it later
now this line has been generated by
Android so don't worry about this this
rule lines is generated by Android no
this XML this line is generated now this
line also is generated by Android so
don't worry about this now the other
immediate stuff that what you guys are
seeing here is the identity now if at
all if you want to refer to the relative
view you can refer to it with an ID name
called as the activity main this I'll be
teaching you in details later
by using this idea can refer to the
layout now inside the layout you have
now let me push this line down you have
two important things that happens to be
the layout height and the layout bit and
then the layout height now when we talk
about the layout width and height now
this is a width and this is the height
the white screen that what you guys are
watching here this is the height and
this is the width what we are talking
about now here we say match the parent
that means take up the complete space
how much ever is the size of your phone
let the whitby of the same space how
much of us is the size of the phone they
have by height take up the complete
height is what you can say or you have
an option to design to choose how much
of the screen that you want to use as
the width now let me say 200 DP stands
for the density independent pixels I'll
be explaining this to you soon now let
me go back to the design now you all can
see when I am here in this head over the
screen now the blue screen represents
how much of the screen that you're
gobbling up that is the 200 DP that
means on this white screen you're going
to use this space as the 200 DP that is
all the screen you requested forth as
the width for some reason now when you
say match parent it uses of enticing now
just for an example if I say 350 now
I'll go to design
so this is almost you know it is even
going beyond this screen right so can
you see the bus and this is ridiculous
so it there you can even say 500 that
that is meaningless so better stick to
the size of the screen all right so no
it is not
350 it is 3500 I have a given right
there is a meaningless effect 350 should
be reasonable yeah you have almost come
to the end of the screen a little bit of
space has been left and 3,500 or should
read the screen right so you guys
understood what exactly a meant by this
now you know what I press control space
and no let me delete this and press
control space is no solution now this
guy in turn has to automatically bring
up the match parent sometimes it happens
in the emulator when it is buggy
sometimes so it happens so I just got
the match parents to be back now all you
learnt is hard to use a complete screen
now I was talking about the lead space
now I am coming to it now this is where
you guys are going to use it now you all
can see the padding bottom left right
top 16 DP now that is the padding that
what we are talking about the padding to
the left is 16 DP padding to the top to
16 DP right now that is what is that we
are trying to allocate in our
application now this is what it is now
when I click on this or when I hover the
cursor on top of this line it shows you
something else it is not 16 DP says at
dimension activity underscore vertical
underscore margin now when I click on
this now you are not able to see the 16
DP the 16 DP is considered up in a file
called as the activity vertical margins
right so it is this in the folder called
as a dimension now let us quickly go to
the resource let me click on the values
and you already see the dimensions right
this let me click on the dimensions and
let me click on 1 us no obviously you
guys may ask me what is this supposed to
be you have two dimensions here do not
worry about it and I will be talking
about it later
now let me click on the first dimension
and here you all can see the activity
horizontal margin is 16 DP and the
vertical mulch is 16
now if you want me to change I can
change this to 36 DP as the horizontal
margin and 36 DP to the vertical margin
now always keep the data in the data
area this is a data area so don't try to
bring the data don't try too hard code
the data in your XML files and that's
how it says I dimension that means it is
going to the folder dimensions inside
that you have the dimension XML inside
that you have activity vertical margin
and you changed it completely now now
when I come here it will not be 16 DP
now I'll just show you on the screen you
all can see it been pushed a little more
inside because the 16 I made it to 36
and that is all y'all can see in the
screen so it has been pushed a slightly
inward alright now I have to go back to
the dimensions and if I have to get this
back I have to change this to my 16 DP
so this is how you guys can change your
dimensions and this is one way of
looking at it now you guys have learned
or exactly it is and then the tool
context you need not have to worry about
it even without this your application
will work and as of snow is just giving
the package name right this you know
what I can even delete this and it will
not create any problem my application
will work so let me bring this back let
that be this now this is all the
relative layout is created now the
relative layout is asking for the full
screen and you are giving the padding of
16 DP around yourself now you want to
bring in the hello world
now let us recreate this guy now you
want to create a hello world dish so I
want to bring in a text widget I'll type
in the left diamond bracket and I will
type T you all can see this texture and
I'll select that now this is asking me
how much of it's that you have got in
your hand and I'll say that content what
is the meaning of wrap content if I have
to say hello world how much our hello
world takes that is a width able to use
and what do you mean by the layout
height now I will again say wrap content
now let it take the height of the
letters as the height of my characters
is what is that you are trying to say
here now next what you want to do is I
just want to say hello world so for that
I'll
texts I just type D I please come down
and click on the text and y'all can say
what you want to say here now I want to
say welcome to Android to the world
world of Android this is what I want to
say now the very minute I finish typing
welcome to the word of hand roid
this is ello bulb he is giving me a
gentle reminder hey something is not
looking good can I help you
is what this guy is asking me let us
click and see what he is asking for
no it's he says extract string resources
let me show you once again now here when
I click on this it will bring this bulb
and it is extract string resources let
me click on this and he is suggesting me
that now there is source value now
values welcome to the world of Android
on top you are able to see the resource
name now this is what will be treated as
a key this is what will be treated as
the value and he is showing it up to you
and he says that can you put this to for
you in the strings file is what he is
trying to ask you and you are happy
about it because somebody is ready to do
all the work for you heavy work for you
and you just say ok the very minute you
say ok you all can see at string you can
see the variable is as good as your data
variable welcome to the world of Android
you can see this underscore write this
and it has been placed in string let us
go check right there in string and y'all
can see this line is generated for you
know if you want to manually if you want
to generate it's free easy use this type
string now I just type a string I out
the string and in the name I'll say
hello instead of hello what can I say
let me say hello Eddie Rica hello hello
Eddie Rica now this is my key now I just
want to have a value here I'll close
this the very minute I close this and he
completes it with the string and then is
where you can have the value I will say
hello hello Eddie Rica right this is the
value that what I can bring in so this
is so physically you can bring in the
strings into this particular area so
please keep all the resources under the
sources folder and even if you try to
write something right this it will not
create any harm for you nobody is going
to kill you and it's still the
application will work but down the line
you guys are going to be into trouble so
all of you will be wondering what kind
of trouble is that now if you write your
application like this is my word right
now I can understand this and you can
understand this when this application is
compiled and it has been sold in Japan
they won't understand what you are
trying to say or in tally they won't
understand what you are trying to say so
they will prefer to have this in
Japanese language or they would prefer
to have this in Dutch or in French no to
do so to have all the declarations
declared inside the string if you try to
declare anything of this sort this
becomes a hardened it for you and this
words cannot be changed and this is
going to remain in English forever so
when we get to the chapter of Lucas I'm
going to talk more about this and data
will be explaining how to convert this
into Japanese or Chinese order to Hindi
or into any other language so here we
created one more string right so press
control space now y'all can see hello
I've named hello Eddi Rekha welcome to
the world of Android no I want to choose
hello Eddy Rekha right so that guy came
in here when I go click on my design and
you all can see this is hello Eddy Rekha
right there if you want to change if you
want to give change the text size you
can just type text size no guys please
to remember I use the
density-independent pixels I told you
that I will be explaining it shortly to
you now for the text do not use the
density-independent pixels no I just
want my text to be of 3030 SP in size
for whenever you are using it for the
text please use the SP because this in
turn will take care of your internal
external lead and the width of the
character all the scenarios would be
taken care of it here now let me briefly
talk about this DP now when you are
using DP your application will be
mounted on your tab or on to the small
devices a
range for north 7-inch phone or 5 inch
phone and all that now every phone the
pixels are different now which if you
are using 10 pixels the 10 pixels may
mean different and 3 inch phone 10
pixels is different in your 7-inch phone
and in your tab but if I am using it as
10 DP and DP is going to look alike and
all devices that what you are trying to
use and that's the reason it has been
treated as the density independent
pixels anyway we are going to go deeper
into it in the later session I just
don't want to leave you at this point so
I just gave a brief explanation to this
so when you are using the text please
use the SP do not use the DP all right
so let me show you how it looks like wow
this looks slightly bigger no let me
color it up it's fairly simple this type
text and you all can see the color and
in the color you have so many colors and
you can pick any of the color that you
want right so you all can see the color
at the right panel here and you can
click on the design and you all can see
this color right now you can create your
own colors also but do not do that I'll
tell you why later so this is how you
guys have used the texture and I think
we have come a long way now let me also
do one thing let me also teach you how
to create a simple edit control and a
button and let us compile the program
now before that I will show you how to
create it's simple edit text now there
are two ways one is you can drag and
drop now let me do one thing because it
is relatively off let me convert this to
the linear layout now by converting this
is the linear layout we are requesting
all the widgets to fall one below other
alright so that is what I want now let
me do one thing let me bring in a button
now now I just type this and I will type
B now the button is right - no the width
you know what the width I'll say match
parent take all the screens of the
parent height let it be the wrap content
and here the name of the button text so
here I will say
I'll let you push this guy down right so
here you click on this text and here you
can give the name of the button so while
giving the name of the button you can
say push me the name of the button and
again this guy's coming in and he says
hey do you want me to help and I'll say
button push me I can even change if you
want to and that's what it is right so
you have the button right - now we have
let me go to the design and I wanted I
picked up the linear layout - I told you
that I wanted the button to be one below
the each of the right and the hello
ready record I just wanted the button to
be below the eight breaker that's all I
wanted but now it is not happening so
now let us go back and see why now
normally the linear layout the default
characteristics of linear layout is we
have to use something called as the
orientation when I type or the
orientation comes in now please check on
the vertical by default it happens to be
the horizontal orientation when you
don't give anything it is horizontal now
you are picking up on vertical now you
are done with this now I will go back to
my design and you all can see it Arica
and push me is just below the Erica
right so it is all one below the each of
the y'all can see alright guys so it's
time for us to compile this program and
see how it works now let me click on
this play button
now before I compile the program like to
ask you do you have any questions in
creation of the file and about the
resources and like we have just seen how
to create your resources we have not it
walked into the main activity now first
if you have any questions let me clarify
on the resources and then I want to the
main activity and for the compilation so
guys do you have any questions here so
far
okay Swati Chandler is asking me a
question that is what is the role of SDK
and what are the tools placed inside it
Swati you know what I would prefer to
answer these questions later because
we'll be getting distracted from the
flow we are in the flow of creating a
small application and making it to work
and let us talk about the SDK is and let
us talk about the APS at the later State
right please to remind me later or by
end of the session I'll talk about this
DK's or if you can wait for the other
session nothing like it and if you are
still curious by end of the session I'm
going to answer your question so I am
pushing your question to the end of the
session because I don't want to break
the continuity here okay so yeah the
rest of you are cleared with this now
let me go back now you guys have learnt
how to create your application now when
you're writing a simple application that
is all the things came automatically to
you you hide the main activity and
you're extending app compact activity
now guys now you're extending your
activity activity happens to be a part
of your android know like swathi the way
you are asking me the kind of API is is
present inside there is ZK now if you
come here into this main activity you
are extending the F compact activity
right you're under the hood of the
activity and if you want to know what
kind of ApS are available for me please
press ctrl o by pressing ctrl o and
you're going to see tons of functions
what is existing under your activity and
this or the API is and you have a PA
coming under the relevant banner for
example if I take my locations you have
relevant API center locations if I take
the content providers you'll have
relevant functions under the content
providers so like that it is very
well-organized and I'm going to talk to
you about it in detail later just to
give you the gist of it because I don't
want to keep you thinking so I just
stick you to this particular point all
right so smarty I hope that you're just
getting the insight of the API
like what you have been asking for now
this odd create function that what has
been created there is more or less like
a constructor for your application right
for the main application so this comes
in by itself
now then after that I'll be talking
about the bundle very spoons of give me
a few minutes then you are going to the
super and you are trying to give all the
saving senses to the parent that is AB
compact activity I just now don't bother
about this this is more or less like
your Java scenario now then you are
calling something called as the content
view though guys I told you very clearly
that you have two different layers when
you are writing the application and this
main activity happens to be the course
now let me write a comment we take K of
core business logic no when you are
practically looking at this line this is
related to view okay no what I want to
say here is following line brings in
view on top of the activity no this is
what exactly is going to happen now the
view has been brought on top of the
activity now if I take this line on the
activity does not even know about the
view this is what it means
no activity is an independent
application by itself now to do that
anyway you saw the setcontentview
function now it is all then when I tree
type it it is all there and it says
integer layout resource ID now let me
click on this now you guys know that
this is where you have got your text
that is your hello aid Eureka is sitting
right here isn't it no I want to get
this and I want to print it in my main
program now let me show you how to do
that now after writing setcontentview
please type are all four resource
whenever I am typing or it gives me the
package name my Abdur training that is a
record calm now I will say dot when I
say all dot you're right here in
resources and when you say dot you are
going to get into the resources now what
do you want inside the resources you
want drawable you want layout with map
value and where do you want to go I want
to go to layout no guys don't worry I
will be talking about the mipmap
drawables later as a snow I am
committing this now I want to get to
this layout now here I'll say all dot I
just type L now you all can see the
layout this package name confirms that
you are in the right track now
the layout is ORS and I'll say inside
the layout I'll press ordered layout dot
now whatever the files is existing
inside your activity main it is showing
up everything now here I just want to
pick up activity main that is a file
that I want to pick now that is very how
the texture and what is it is in the
texture that is what gets printed onto
the screen right now what we can expect
here is
a director here when the program is
executed and this is what you guys can
expect now how is that we can run this
program no we have a small catch here
now even before you run this program we
have to bring in the emulator onto the
screen the right now let us see how to
do that now I am just clicking on the
play button now it says it is
initializing the ADB now here already I
have couple of emulators sitting here
but I want to create my own now let me
say create new virtual device now I came
here to create my own emulator guys you
know what you can create a TV as
emulator or the wave or tab or the phone
now I am in my cell phone let me stick
to my phone now what kind of init
emulator you want now here you have a
very high density emulators and it has
got a big screen like 5.7 inch or if you
want the smaller screen you have filed
the 44.0 and you have all the screen
sizes and you have the resolutions and
you have density now when you buy the
phone you want to buy the best of the
phone right so you always go in from the
biggest screen and HTML hdpi and things
like that it because to bring up such
devices it may take a while right so let
me moderate t select this is Nexus 6
right now 480 also is too low I don't
want okay let me sell like Nexus 6
alright
so I will say next now when you have
pick the Nexus 6 now what kind of areas
that you want now here which mission
that you want now here you know pretty
well that by selecting 7.1 17.0 you know
you get the very less number of hits
so you'd prefer to go in with the
lollipop 5.1 and this is what i'll say
no in marshmallow it says it is there in
your system but you have to download
this download the SDK but anyway I don't
want to let me go to the lollipop 22 and
let me say next
alright now you have got the Nexus 622
now here you can call this as my
emulator or your company name whatever
the name that you want to give it can be
given here so this emulator what you are
trying to create and then like it is
asking you that hey you have opted to
this you want to change all you want to
change the logic up to anything else or
you want to change Bedford it is potater
do you want to change due to laptop I
mean the landscape now let it be
portrait and then the emulated
performance all that is it so don't
bother about all these things then go on
to the show advanced settings so this is
interesting you all may get excited by
looking at this it says the same stuff
here now comes the interesting stuff now
you will get to see the ramp say well
we've got the ramp I can control it and
do not jump into the Zen type the answer
is here because every phone has its own
limitations and you have to know about
the phone you are working on the real
device the emulator is all real devices
for you and it is going to pretend like
a real device and it is going to
stimulate all the hardware what is
present in that device by changing it if
there is a conflict between the hardware
and between you emulate does not come up
so please do not H all this unless you
know what you are working upon right now
you have the various things again the
try it out you can play around this
later
now I'll good my finish now this is
emulator you wanted you have gotten my
emulator Nexus 6 and API is 22 let me
say ok now at this point of time you are
likely to get an errors if you have not
installed your emulator in you SDK right
so be aware of that so it's very
important for you to install it that I
have shown you how to install it now
this will take a while because this is
almost like your cell phone and it takes
all the time to come up because you are
almost booting your phone all right
so congratulations you have written your
first application and you all can see
the hello ad Rekha and you all can see
the push me button but there is no
relevance to it and you guys have not
done anything with this push me button
right so what is that you want to do
with this push me button now just by
clicking on push me and let me print
some text right saying that somebody
clicked on
button right so let's do that now here
it's a while that we moved out of the
PowerPoint now let me go back to the
PowerPoint now this is where viewers and
you learned how to install this and we
moved on to activity and here you all
can see it serves as an entry point to
the user interaction each activity has a
layout file where you can place your UI
and application can have different
activities now we have just created one
activity now while writing your
application you can have as many
activities that you want now
the activity that what we have created
is a very crude one and to the right
that what you are trying to see here is
you have a facebook picture and you see
this email or phone and password login
and a lot of other information so there
is this activity and just to show you
the activity and we are trying to show
you what how the activity will look like
right now getting back to the features
of an activity all activity interacts
the user in order to do some things such
as dial the phone take a photo email or
view or map now guys we have already
written a program we already have a
button just by clicking on the button I
am a telephone or I may ask my button to
take a photograph or I may receive an
email or send email whatever I want I
can do that now all this happens inside
the activity now you all know that the
view has enameled on top of the activity
as you all can see in this diagram to
the left you all can see the view you
all can see a calculator so obviously
the calculators have you beneath that
you have an activity that in turn is
going to do all the calculation jobs
activities were presented as floating
windows or embedded inside another
activity in fact this floating windows
we'll talk about it later
in fact that is called as a widget as of
now we are writing a simple activity and
we are learning how to use a simple
activity but on top of the activity we
can bring in a widget or we can bring in
as many activities that you want right
now if you are using a calculator and if
you go click on the gallery the gallery
is going to sub mount on your calculator
and so on so forth you can
bring in any number of activities on top
now an application consists of multiple
activities that are loosely bound to
each other now when you have an activity
now you need not have to call this as
the activity ABCD is calling B B is
calling CC is calling T no not necessary
now B in turn K and call a B in turn can
call D or B in turn can call C C in turn
can call B so like this the activity in
turn can call each other however it is
required no guys please be a race
activity is not just your main activity
or the screens or it is not that like
functions you're going to call the
activity and we have got lot more to it
now end of the session you guys will
understand how to create a component out
of the Android Android it is just not an
application Android has got much better
behaviors and beautiful stuff been
ingrained into it all those things that
you are going to see so that we are
going to loosen up the tightly coupled
applications and we are going to make
all this activity as a component by
itself there is what you'll be learning
as we progress now comes the activity
lifecycle so briefly I have told you the
meaning of activity lifecycle that is in
the previous diagram they told you when
you are with your calendar then your
phone call comes up the calendar will go
to the background and the call is there
on top of the stack and you are going to
take the call that is what you all have
seen is it right now let me take you in
the realistic way how the activity
lifecycle will look like for you now
when you start your application now the
activity is started all right then it
calls the function called as oncreate
now you guys have already seen the GaN
create function in your applications and
there is on create that you have called
that means the activity started and
uncreate has come in in oncreate we have
displayed the textview and an on create
we have displayed the button this is all
that we did what next now this in turn
there is call on start because the one
create happens to be
a kind of constructor function whenever
the activity is created only then the
control will come to the oncreate though
otherwise whenever you recreate or when
you re scheduled your activity or when
your activity is called all over again
that in turn will call on start the
control will never go to on period again
always after that the control will come
to on start when the activity is active
all right now I'm going to go deeper
into the on start and I am going to tell
you how this on start is going to help
us down the line now we have something
called as onresume this also I am going
to explain in a minute from now then
your activity is running now hello
iterator program that what you have
written is going through this process
activity launch and it comes to oncreate
and we are not overriding on start or on
resume and if at all if you are all
reading this functions and it will go
through this on start on resume and it
will let your application work and even
without this all start on resume your
activity is going to run when I compile
the program now let us go back to the
application let us compile and see how
this application will work and then
we'll come back to this diagram now I am
back in my application now I have
created the emulator and now this
activity is running right no this is all
that you guys have seen now you know
what I want to trace did I really come
into this on create how do I know if I
really come into this on create you all
will tell me yeah yeah you came in
because we all can see the hello every
record it your you have come into this
particular function now say your hello
ready record in print so how do you know
whether this particular function has
been executed or not no for that we have
to bring in the log we have the log cat
that what you guys have seen now that
comes really handy here now you know
what I'm going to do I'm going to say
log dot D so this D stands for debug
I'll be explaining this to you
now here's to the log we always give a
tag something like this or it can be
your name also and here I can say a
string okay
oncreate and this is where you landed
and this is all you can write a log
function now just throwing up an error
and it says that now when I click on
this it says Android util dot log please
click on alt and enter to get rid of
that error now he brings in the relevant
library and he is out of the errors now
when you are using this log D this is
for debug this tag in oncreate will be
displayed to you in one particular color
because you said that I want to see it
in the debug mode now guys I just want
you to experience this now the log in
turn has got various elements to it
now let me say log E this means it's an
error all right now let me say log W
this means it is the warning and let me
say log information for I for
information right so like this you have
the logs and you have got various
parameters to it just by you know let me
remove this just by using so all that it
does is it changes the colors and it
displays it you let me run this once
again and show you how it works
now you all can see the program is
coming up now the hello Eddi records
printed no you want to see the log when
exactly the log is present now guys come
down to Android monitor here at the
bottom left corner of the screen where I
am holding my cursor click on the
android monitor now that's where you are
now when you see this log I told you
this is not just displaying your
application this in turn can display all
the running applications in your
emulator it can start showing all the
applications data now what do you want
to do you want to tell this log that hey
I am interested only in my application
don't show me the junk so in that
situation you come to the top right
corner at the bottom y'all can see that
I am clicking now show only selected
applications or firebase no filters when
you click on no filters all the
applications will start throwing the log
on this particular area so let me click
on show only selected applications now
you have to search in this junk for your
messages now instead if you can come
here and type your tag tag is what you
give it here right that is your key when
you give the key right here now if it is
verbose in verbose it brings everything
now you know oh you have given debug
edit warning and I write so verbose is
right for you
now you all can see the messages right
here now you all can see the debug is in
black color error is in kind of rustic
red and warning is in blue and I there
is the info is in black color no this is
how y'all can see the logs alright now
when we are talking about the activity
lifecycle let me bring in the properties
into it now here we have the oncreate
now next we went into on no I am just
typing on L typed capital S y'all can
see this on start right this is what you
guys saw right I am going to click on
this now I am going to bring in onset
now so that what did your
see on resume isn't it no I am just
going to bring in on resume and then you
saw the application was running right
after that your activity was working
know if you want to check on the
activity life cycle there are two ways
to do it one is you can go through the
diagram of what I am taking you through
where Erika or the better way like if
you guys are very hungry for the data
and you want to be really very
professional y'all can go to
developer.android.com now this is your
Bible and this is where you ate all the
health and here I can type in activity
in life cycle when I type in activity
life cycle here and this is the ultimate
place for you all and this is where all
the API is in all the libraries arrived
from and this is where we take
everything from and this is the diagram
that what you guys have seen in our
powerpoints also that we saw activity
launched head on create on stored on
resume and this rate activity is running
in our diagram we came till here right
I'm going to go back to my diagram then
we need on pulse on stop and on destroy
let me bring this in and then I will
explain the meaning of on pause stop and
destroy to you now let me go back now I
want to bring in my on pass on pulse
right now I want to bring in my on stop
you know what I can press control oh no
now I will type in here on stop s t.o.p
you all can see this on stop here this
is yet another way of bringing it on
stop and then I can have something
called as on destroy now I am going to
bring it in the regular way now got all
the events which is pertaining to my
activity now let me put all these guys
in a remark so I block the entire thing
I hold my control and the forward slash
to put remarks for all the three lines
right so it goes into the remark now I
just copy this and I will put it
everywhere right I'm just going to copy
it here and on start and on resume and
I'm going to say hey this is where you
guys are right so
all that I have to do is start making my
changes now here I'm an on start now
here I am in on resume right so here I'm
in on pulse here I'm an on stop here I'm
an on destroy this intern consists of
your activity life second now whenever
you run your program no let me rerun the
program I'm going to show you some magic
happening here now let me see it all
over again
now so far use only on create right now
let us see what exactly is going to
happen right so you all can see it is
reassuring the screen and you're going
to get to the application all over again
yeah and it flushed the screen and you
all can see as I scroll down now you all
can see because you ran the application
all over again meaning
Yury compiled it you ran it from the
beginning you came to on create you came
to on start you came to unreserve and
your activity is running is that clear
to you guys now these are the three
function events which gets called but
you didn't see the other part of the
program running at all for you right now
this is what you saw in the PowerPoint
this is what you saw in
developer.android.com/design stuff that
is on create on start and on resume is
that clear so far
were you able to understand the flow of
the activity so I quickly want to see an
axe from all of you so Neal says yes
however this all right so this is no I
just want to show you something very
curious now before that let me take you
back to the idea raker presentation now
activity launched and next is uncreated
then comes on set then your own resume
now comes your running activity is it
clear no ways you know what
now you may opt to click on some other
application or a call may come in now
what should happen to your application
which is running now I told you all in
the first session that your application
is going to go below the stack is it
right now
watch what happens now when some other
application comes and it can be a call
or you would have clicked on some other
application another activity comes into
the foreground then your activity gets
the control in your activity application
that what you are getting the on pulse
is getting called
that means when some other application
is coming on talk the on pulse of your
activity is called now whenever it calls
you're on pause it's your time to save
all the temporary variables where you
feel the data you are going to lose that
kind of data can be stored in your own
purse and I'm going to go deeper into it
later now that is the the temporary data
will be stored in your own purse right
in your activity then user navigates to
the activity meaning he goes to the
other activity now the other activity
will receive the resume and then the
other activity will start working for
you then the control will go to on stop
now that means it says that your
activity is suspended meaning your
activity has lost the scope completely
now some other activity has taken over
you know what though the other activity
is running now when the other activity
loses the focus when he is done with a
job though your stop will go to on
restart because you want to come up all
over again right then you are calling
your own start then you will go to
unreserve now in on resume though you
can bring back all the variables that
what you hide in the temporary variable
back to the application and you can make
your activity running and this is how
your activity can be brought in right
later on now just in case when all the
applications are there on your phone it
may so happen that one of the
application may be hogging the memory or
one of the application has not been used
for a long time now
perhaps the ayat priority when it needs
the memory let us see what exactly is
going to happen now here you can see the
app process gets killed no this is days
in the hands of Android though whenever
it feels the application has not been
run for a long time
and whenever it feels Android needs the
memory and it will go kill the
application and the process will be
killed
meaning one of the ideal application
process will be killed no that is what
will happen then the control will go
back to the activity now you are back to
the oncreate now you have one more
possibility here then you click the let
me go to my oh I cannot go from here
yeah when you click on at the bottom of
your emulator when you click on the back
button now the control will go to on
destroy and the activity gets destroyed
completely no if you want to start that
activity you to start all over from the
beginning again now this is what is your
on destroy this comes into the picture
when you click on the back button on the
emulator right alright then no this is
the activity lifecycle now let us
quickly jump into the program and see
how this works so far you have
understood the flow now let me explain
it through the code how it really works
I will be mapping everything through the
code after that let me see how much that
you guys are able to follow this right
now here after the destroy you all can
see your activities shutting down now
let me quickly go to the code now you
all know that you have come to on create
on start and on resume you know what I
am just going to click on this rectangle
and let me see if I have any
applications now unfortunately I don't
have any applications here
so what I have to do is I have to have
some other application or the best thing
to do would be I'll change the
orientation when I change the
orientation also the same thing happens
right I change the orientation now when
I change the orientation it went into on
post mode and it went into the on resume
mode it went into the on pulse mode and
it went into the start resume pause and
stop right now let me change the
orientation once again
alright so y'all can see okay now let me
do something instead I will compile one
more application so that you will have
it as a reference so you all can know
how exactly this emulator is what
so let me pick one more application
okay some application so that I can show
you how the stack is working and how the
earrings are working
No yeah it is loaded it takes a while to
load also now anyway I don't want to see
the contents of this app and let me just
say okay all right so you have some
application so I don't care what it does
and how it works in all this now I can
no I'll go to my Android monitor now
Here I am just going to click on see now
you all can see the other application is
coming now let me go give my tag now
here when I click on this rectangle now
you can see the stack of activities
right now this is the first activity and
on top of me the other activity came now
I'm going to click on my first activity
now when I click on the first activity
again it came to on start and it came to
on resume is that clear to you guys so
when I override my application with
another application now again it regains
the control from your on start and on
resume now let me do this again I will
go back by clicking on this rectangle
now I am going to click on location
tracker when location trackers came up
now you all can see my application came
in to unpause and onstop right it went
to the pause mode and my application is
stopped as of now now to gain the
control back now I am going to click on
this when the location tracker is done
with the work now let me click on my
first step now again you all can see
you're back in your on set and on resume
is that clear to you a scan a quickly
see an acknowledgement or if you have
any doubts you can ask me to unmute and
I can clarify this to you any questions
so far
all right so this is how you can see
your application running and this is
what it means to be the lifecycle of the
activity now you're eager to know what
exactly happens when I click on the back
button let me click on the back button
now so I just clicked on the back button
though you know pretty well that the
control has to come to on destroy is
that right now watch this the control
came to on destroyed
now all this vine you never saw control
coming to on create it is all on
start/stop resume pulse stop all that
you are able to see now we have come to
on destroy that means your application
is completely destroyed now if you bring
in the application all over again now
you can see the applications here let me
click on my first app now when you click
on the my first step you all can see on
create your can see on start and you all
can see this on resume right now because
you started the application all over
again
now it goes into start and it goes into
resume alright so do you have any
questions at this point
great so so far we have learnt how to
create an application and how to create
the lifecycle of the activity and we
have learned how to create the button we
have seen about the lifecycle of the
activity now let me move on to my
virginal app so so far this is what we
have done now let me move back to my
slides now this is where your left all
right so now if you want to watch we
came to uncreate on start on resume
activity is running when some other
activity is coming up we went to the on
pulse and uses a navigation to the
activity we went to the on resume the
other activity came up and our activity
went to the on pulse then it went to on
stop and then we went when the other guy
is losing the control when he is able to
lose the control you enter on restart we
went on start and again you enter resume
and you started running your activity
now just in case if there is any
priority or if the Android needs
memory and add to the air priority need
memory at that point of time Android
will kill one of the existing ads from
your best series of apps and then it
goes and calls the other activity
whatever has to gain control because
you're not able to execute one an
activity because you are running out of
memory so at that point of time the
Android kills the app which is not being
run from a wrong a long time and it
loads your application and it starts
your application and after that when you
click on the back button you guys are
going to hit your own destroy that means
your application is completely killed
you saw that and that means your
activity shut down all right now that's
about your activity life cycle and this
is what you guys have learnt so far so
it's time for us to sign up for the day
