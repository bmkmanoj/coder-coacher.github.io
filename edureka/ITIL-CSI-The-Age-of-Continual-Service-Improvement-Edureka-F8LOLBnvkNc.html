in this edition of webinar good morning
good afternoon good evening in whichever
timezone you are thanks for joining for
this edition today we are going to talk
about ITIL si si si si stands for
continual service improvement this is
again an intermediate course that an
overview of that but primarily we are
going to talk about some practical stuff
right how can you implement continual
service improvement in your
organization's and get benefited out of
it so for the next 45 minutes or so
we're going to talk about some practical
stuff of how do you implement continual
service improvement before we begin a
brief introduction about myself my name
is Suraj GP I would be a facilitator for
this webinar I've had over fourteen plus
years of experience as a service
management consultant practitioner
trainer certified itíll v2 service
manager expert PMP CGI tee ISO 20000
lead auditor and also happy to be an
instructor for Eddie Rica delivering the
foundation tin
itíll expert courses so this webinar is
delivered through Eddie Rica so we will
get started as to what is the agenda
looking today so we're going to talk
about the following objectives as we
have in every webinar I would strongly
encourage you to post your questions
using the question panel and as and when
we get time during the logical breaks we
will we will talk and get more details
and discuss about it if you wish to
speak then you can raise your hands and
then we can unmute to do that but that
we will do it at the last so I encourage
you to ask questions and we will be more
than happy to discuss and
cover during the course of this webinar
so today we are going to talk about
introduction to CSI which is continual
service improvement and why it is
important in organisations we are going
to talk about the principles behind that
the continual service improvement
principles the processes methods and
techniques that are being used generally
as part of continual service improvement
how do you start your journey in
continual service improvement like it
could be your small size organization it
could be your medium organization of
large enterprise irrespective whether
you are in IT or you're in manufacturing
telecom insurance whatever vertical and
what are the next steps and Q&amp;amp;A yeah so
these are the objectives that we would
cover in the next 45 minutes or so
and we'll give some time plenty of time
for Q&amp;amp;A so that we can address your
questions and if you have your own
practical issues or challenges that you
are facing implementing continual
service improvement then we would also
address that so I spend a lot of time
with my clients working with them in
their continual service improvement
journey it need not be based on ITIL
ITIL is one of the framework it could be
based on lean it could be based on a
child it could be based on Six Sigma and
various of the frameworks and
methodologies right so in our section
today we would not we would talk about
CSI in principle right in the fulcrum of
it so we will be talking about different
methodologies frameworks and best
practices that are actually helping to
enable your organization's on continual
service improvement right so if you
start to introduce CSI so continual
service improvement is one of the core
volumes of ITIL Version three
so like any framework the ìtell version
is evolved from version 1 version 2 and
version 3 and the current version that
is running in term
of item version three is 2011 right now
whenever I talk with people asking what
is si si they come with a very quick
answer it is continuous service
improvement now the question I want to
ask is is it continuous service
improvement or continual service
improvement what's the kind of
difference that we are talking about I
think it's very much important to
clearly differentiate between si si in
in the context of title right now if you
look at continual versus continuous now
continuous mean you are you are going at
a speed let's say from 0 km/h 21.02.2013
vis part of target have you reached
there and then look at mechanisms to
improve to the next D next target right
so you do a step by step approach to go
to the planned or the future model of
operation so that's why the step change
is called the continual service
improvement the straight-line that we
talked about from zero kilometers to 140
kilometers is your continuous service
improvement so in any of the time that
you work you cannot do a continuous
service improvement you can only do a
continual service increment where you
step up look at what change you have
done whether it has received the results
and then make amendments and then take
on to the next model right now many of
you would be aware of the quality
methods right the Deming cycle I have a
next slide that talks about it
being cycle which is primarily talking
about plan do check and act right so you
plan something you have an issue you
plan to fix that particular issue you do
something that is you do an action for
that do you check whether that action
has addressed the issue and then you
improve further that you act on it right
as I told you when you talk about
continual service improvement it's not
about just idle titleist IT
infrastructure library as a framework
what is lean now if you look at
manufacturing sector and lean is coming
typically from the Toyota Toyota kind of
companies where they are talking about
how do you minimize waste how do you
make sure that you improve productivity
right so we are talking about
optimization as part of continual
service improvement now what is agile
right agile is doing things much more
faster efficient in small increments
right so instead of you looking at
developing a whole product like earlier
using the waterfall method where people
used to spend time and requirement
analysis requirement analysis design
build test and deploy people are talking
about incremental improvement talking
about Minimum Viable Product that is
useful for you and then slowly you
improve on the features right so that is
another way of looking at continual
improvement Six Sigma is primarily
looked at the manufacturing sector so
you will look at number of defects per
million right so we are talking about
Six Sigma as a methodology to improve
the service at the end of the day
whether you you you use itíll you use
Li you use agile or Six Sigma what we
are doing is you are executing and
delivering business one so that's the
whole point that we are driving as part
of continual service improvement now
this is what we just talked about in the
Deming cycle right so it's talking about
plan do check an act it's a site
right if you look at this particular
graph you have a time scale that is
right from today to a week to a month to
a year and then maturity level is
probably if you are very familiar eyes
with CMMI you talk about the level zero
to level five so level zero being not
existent to level five being optimized
right so you go to that level so you you
if you look at it over a period of time
the maturity also improves and then this
is the step change that we are talking
about so from here to the next step you
see what we need to achieve you see
whether we have achieved that position
and then you keep on improving over a
period of time right so you are looking
at mechanisms where the there is a
baseline established that bare minimum
you need to say I need to meet 95
percentage of my SLS or service level
agreements so you have a baseline and
you look at it and after some time you
start improving on that and then go
further on to it right so that's the way
of looking at a Deming cycle now why is
CSI very important in organizations
right why are on the on the earth of
talking about lean agile Six Sigma ITIL
how is organization getting benefited of
CSI right that we need to understand
from that perspective right from an
organization standpoint be it a small
midsize organization or a large
enterprise right what we they are doing
is they are looking at delivering
business value right what we are talking
about delivering business value in the
form of improving productivity right
productivity of people who are working
on that so you have far more efficient
to do it instead of two people doing a
job there is one person who is doing
that so you're saving that one FTE or
one person effort you're optimizing cost
right
that could be cost that you are spending
about hundred dollars in producing
something if you're able to produce it
at 80 dollars right then you save about
$20 right and that will improve
your bottom line the next one is
resource optimization how efficiently
are we using resources now resources can
be infrastructure resources hardware
resources software resources people as a
resources right organizational assets
anything of that show and then primarily
customer satisfaction because your
customers are satisfied then they they
give you more business right so
invariably they the organization's are
using these best practices frameworks
and methodologies to implement those
frameworks in improving the way things
are things are going across right so so
importance of si si is primarily looking
at these parameters of cost resource
productivity and customer satisfaction
so there is a belief that if you are
able to target on these elements then
it's of great benefit to the
organization it means improve people
morale its improved business that means
lot of expansion and scope lot of people
getting promotions and so on and so
forth right so there is a cyclic in
nature of why si si is is important in
organizations being delivered now when
it comes to an organization right so
organization has got a large way of
looking at what are their prime goals
right so you could be a telecom company
you could be a manufacturing company so
you have a vision mission goals right so
you look at at a top like we need to be
the top 10 telecom companies in the
world right so from there you start with
your overall strategy and from that
strategy you need to come to the next
level of tactical layer and then to the
operations layer right so an easier way
to cascade from the top to bottom that
means from the high level overview to
the to the bottom level how it relates
is depicted by a balanced scorecard now
typically this has been how goals are
cascaded from the top level
organizations to the to the various
business units and then to the
individual departments to take care
right so the balanced scorecard is
is a methodology that was defined by
Robert Kaplan and David Norton in 94
where they are dividing into four
quadrants the first quadrant is the
financial perspective there we are
talking about how much is the bottom
line top line profitability and all that
stuff right the second one that we are
talking about is the customer
perspective right what are my customers
looking at it
what kind of how are they using our
existing products and services what are
their expectations as part of doing it
for example Apple or Samsung they are
releasing different versions based on
what the customer needs it could be the
look and feel it could be features
functionalities different apps so you
start thinking from a customer
perspective us what is my customer
needing and which market are you
addressing right then the next two
things is primarily from an organization
perspective learning and growth
perspective that means how are you are
training and developing your own people
in terms of skills in terms of
competencies to deliver something for
example you might be a traditional
infrastructure provider and then you
move to a cloud-based offering what kind
of skills that you need to do do you
need to get them cloud certified for
example you are opening operating on a
service desk so you need your people to
be trained on ITIL you need to get
people aware of all the processes all
the best practices the next one is the
business process perspective or
operational efficiency right so you have
your own inbuilt process tools and
policies and frameworks that you up as
an organization delivering business
right what you need to also think is how
can I improve my underlying process how
do I bring in more process efficiency
how do I bring in more effectiveness so
these are four different quadrants in
which the goals get cascaded from the
top to the bottom right so that's a
easier way to understand what goal are
we achieving and how can we achieve the
goal then use the CSI
as a process to go and achieve the
target that you have envisioned in this
particular balanced scorecard okay so
this is one of the mechanism to cascade
from top to bottom now what is the
approach that you need to think about
when we talk about CSI right so it
always starts from the top so we talk
about what is the vision of the company
right so you need to understand as a
company what is your vision mission
goals and objectives so what is your
goal do we need to be a top 10 telecom
company do I need to be a top 10
manufacturing company do I need to be
tucked in in this particular region or
in the world so you can have your own
goal and objective as a company and then
we need to understand where are we now
ok I need to be a top 10 manufacturing
company or a telecom company where are
we now so we are in 20th or 50th
position ok how do we know that so you
use an assessments so it means you got
the maturity the capability of an
organization using some of the processes
and say ok I have been ranked in the
kind of Gartner by Forrester or by any
analyst at this particular position
right so my simple example could be
let's say you are playing tennis and you
watch tennis right they have seeded
players so they ranked 50th in in
worldwide as juniors or seniors or
individuals or doubles right and they
keep on improving the ranking as they
play the tournaments and they register
the lot of wins so so you need to have
an assessment as to where we are now and
then understand where do we want to be
right where do we want to be so if I am
in the 20th position how do I go to go
to the 10th position right you cannot
really jump from 20th position to 10th
position so you need to go from 20 to 15
15 to 10 and then go up the value chain
so your target as where do you want to
be is to have measurable targets so how
do I go from the top 20th position to
top 10 position how will I be measured
will I be measured on profitable
will I be measured based on customers
will I be based measured based on the
number of geographies that I operate and
so on and so forth right then how do we
get there okay we know the targets how
do we get there so that means you need
to go straining we need to invest on
people you need to do marketing you need
to come up with better products and
services so we need to come up with all
those ideas plans and strategies as how
we can become the top 10 player that
means you can look at your competition
like between Apple and Samsung for an
example Apple and Samsung are closely
watching each other or how they are
playing in this market if Samsung comes
up with some positions how do a pill
look at it right so so there is a
constant need to keep your eyes and ears
open as to what the what the market is
all about and how do we get there right
so you come up with a service
improvement plan and processes and do
that so did we get there how did we know
we do get that of course you need to
have measurement and metrics right in
terms of profitability in terms of
growth in terms of market share and all
that stuff depending on what kind of
measures or outcomes that you're doing
and then keep the momentum going so it's
a very simplified approach to start with
the vision where are we now
where do we want to be how do we get
there and do you know we have got there
and start continuing you so the
artifacts that will support the items
vision for business where are we now
with assessments where do we want to be
with measurable targets how do we get
there again use the service improvement
plan and do we get there right so this
is the typical CSA approach that is
useful for organizations to keep
improving on their products and services
now where do you start your journey
right should we have understood approach
where do you start now I have a
different corollary as to people say if
you don't if you don't measure anything
you cannot improve anything right so I
have a couple of corollaries in in the
way that we do so first if you want it
desperately you have to measure
right it could be that you want to be a
topper in your school or academic
colleges so what you want is know how
you're performing in a particular class
and then look at when it goes to your
board exams and TOEFL or GRE or SATs
course you you will perform right so you
need to measure it now if you measure it
you better want it right so measures
work now what we have observed is in
order to achieve something your
behaviors will also work for example
let's say you are getting a grad school
you're aiming for something you are
about getting 80% in your board exams
and you want to get about 95 in order to
get medical admissions right so what you
do is you get up early in the morning
you spend a lot of time preparing for
your exams preparing taking some notes
going to the library so what happens is
because you have fixed a particular
target of moving from 80% to 95% you
start doing some behavioral aspects of
spending more time reading more books
spending more time in library to do that
so that's what is the corollary
assistance so if you don't need
something don't measure I know a lot of
reports go in organizations every Friday
they send dashboards they send reports
which have no use at all so they measure
some parameters which is not at all
being relevant so the question is don't
waste time and money in reporting
something which is not meaningful right
so report which is very relevant which
really addresses the target that you are
focusing upon in in the context of an
organization so these are some other
things that you need to remember when
you start your csa journey now the third
and final most is you need to be in
control right you need to know how are
you improve it I know I'm just trying to
correlate a real-life example now I'm
going to run a marathon which is about
42 kilometers right now if I need to do
42 kilometers first I need to know how
do I start what is my level so can I run
a kilometer
can I run
three kilometers can I run five
kilometres so slowly I need to have a
schedule where it moves me from three
kilometer to five kilometer to ten
kilometer I have to run that and slowly
start doing half marathons which is
about 21 kilometers and then slowly
improve right so you have to be in
control of that you cannot just go pound
yourself to reach to a target then in
there right so it has to be a mechanism
to to deliver things very meaningfully
and efficiently right so it's important
to understand that you need to follow
the way things do it in a step-by-step
manner to get control so you have a
strategic vision which is the vision
from the top we talked about balanced
scorecard which we need to validate come
up with targets and metrics is useful to
direct you whether you are in the right
track if I need to run a marathon of 42
kilometers where are we today when will
you reach 5 kilometers 10 kilometers 21
kilometers 42 kilometers have you done
it before what's the kind of routine
that you need to do what's the kind of
diet that we need to follow all of them
right so you need to have targets and
metrics that measure you to get to that
level right the next one is evidence to
justify what is the evidence that you
have reached that goal can you give me a
dashboard of how much runs did you do
how much data that you covered and then
look at ok if I need to reach this one
how what changes I need to make because
I am not making substantial progress so
if you want to score 195 in the board
exams and but here we are only scoring
about 60 you need to do something
radically changed right otherwise you'll
not be able to meet the 95 percent
target so you take the corrective
changes improvements to intervene and
make those stepwise improvements to look
at what changes you are right so is it a
step-by-step process yes
route through humanity it is a
step-by-step process properly define
look at where you are what needs to be
achieved and then you you move on that
okay so hopefully that answers your
question in the in the context of
service improvement right now this is
the mother of the service improvement
process which we call it as a seven step
process right we spend a lot of time in
our courses to give examples of it so we
just have about an hour so I will go
into the the building blocks right so if
you look at the the plan-do-check-act
which is the Deming cycle so it's a
continual improvement right so we are we
are talking about mechanisms to improve
step by step so so first you do is you
talk with your identify the improvement
strategy so you look at your vision your
business needs your goals right
define what you want what you will
measure and then how will you going to
get data right so what data are you
going to talk about are you going to
talk about your customer data your
performance data your availability data
your capacity data what are you going to
measure right what is your goal right so
you have to collect the data so defining
what you're going to measure in terms of
service level agreements in terms of
performance goals all that combined with
gathering the data is important which
will be formed as part of the data part
then how frequently will you process
will you do it monthly reporting will
you do it and biweekly reporting what
tools are you using how accurate it is
right so you will use a lot of tools you
will use a lot of mechanisms to register
close the data and see where you're
improving it's simple like going to a
doctor the doctor asked is okay can you
do the periodic test so I want to look
at your blood pressure I want to look at
your sugar your cholesterol I want to
look at your treadmill test and see what
you're good at it and what you are not
do it and then come up with the analysis
right so you're looking at a mechanism
to analyze the information what is a
trend you are looking at it are you
below normal sugar or over and above
your cholesterol levels or BP where you
need to change and you present the
information in terms of reports right
what Action Plan so for example let's
say you are having an over cholesterol
so people say okay you need to reduce
your fat right there is a high good
cholesterol and a bad cholesterol so you
need to stop taking those stuff you need
to have a fitness regime that means you
need to do 45 minutes of exercise you
need to concentrate on a diet on some of
the steps that you take in order to
achieve the target right so that is what
you will present you will implement
those improvements based on your
dietitian based on your physiologist
your doctor your your general
practitioner and then you keep on
improving right so it's embedded as part
of data information knowledge and then
you get wisdom now why do you think you
go to a practitioner or a doctor because
the doctor knows exactly what's your
problem just by giving you symptoms or a
period of time as you process your data
you know what kind of improvement is due
to that right I have had instances where
I've actually spoken with some
manufacturing people who were there in
the system for 30 40 years and just by
the sound of the engine they will tell
you where the problem lies
right so they are people who are
mastered in terms of what is really
going across behind the system right so
those level of details can be improved
as we step do this seven step process so
it is very easy looking at identifying a
strategy for improvement define what
will you measure gather the data in
terms of who is going to collect the
data what is going to be data what is a
goal that we are doing it how frequently
are you going to process the data
analyze the information that you have
present the information in terms of
reports and then see what action needs
to be improved and then you take the
improvement occur so I'll take a pause
here to see if we have any other
questions at this moment with what we
have discussed so far
I wrote though I I think hope you have
clarity on the step by step process okay
any other questions from anybody from so
far you have seen so we will more and
please feel free to post your question
as it comes in
so what we saw in the seven step process
right this particular process can be
implemented in all levels right so you
talk about strategy level so you're
following the same seven step approach
then you go to the tactical level as I
talked about from the the business the
the big Enterprise to business units to
individual departments and and teams
like you have a you have a
infrastructure team you have an
application team you have a payroll team
your HR team you have a finance team so
you you cascade those seven step process
starting from the the top level to the
next level to the next levels that's why
you see a continual spiral of CSA of
seven steps from the strategic level to
the tactical level to the operational
level right so it's not that stops at
the top level it goes to the next level
middle level to the bottom level so
everybody are aligned with the overall
approach we saw the balanced scorecard
on that front as well right so it's
important to cascade improvements from
the top to the bottom so that you are
able to achieve the goals that was
directed at the top level right so
vision mission goals you remember so
those have to go have operational goals
they have to go of tactical goals that
will invariably align to the strategic
goals that are set by the company so how
do we start so you can start with a
simple register which is called a CSA
register where you log all improvements
it could be productivity improvement it
could be cost improvement it could be
resource improvement it could be better
efficiency just write something and say
what will this idea help to improve
certain things and then there is a CSA
manager who records all the improvements
so it could be strategy level
improvements it could be tactical level
improvements it could be operational
level improvements they just start
looking at what are the improvements
what is the prioritization that we need
to look at it what is the cost effort
benefit that is arrived
when we implement those improvements and
then they manage track and report
success right so you can start improving
in a very small man
make small improvements and then slowly
get the momentum to improve over and
over right in all departments so that's
where start simple get some quick wins
report improvements and do that so
people use a simple spreadsheet to
record it there's something called as
Kanban which is talking about measurable
pulling work streams and looking at what
specific work that we will do who are
the people who are expert in doing that
work and making those arrangement
it could be agile when we talk about
backlog we talk about Minimum Viable
Product in order to release a product
features so it could be any other stuff
right so there could be different
mechanisms you register the improvements
and then use those mechanisms to improve
and deliver the improvements that is
needed to achieve the business
objectives so it does all has to align
with the overall business objectives of
delivering something it's more of a
cultural right it's it's important that
people think it's all about tools it all
both processes no it's all about culture
right everybody within the organization
right from the service dispersion to the
CIO to the CEO of the company will have
to have an attitude of improving
something it could be having a better
workplace it could be better improvement
in terms of knowledge sharing and then
stuff right so you can follow lean agile
lean is you know eliminating waste agile
is being more nimble quick swift in
adopting to changes you can do training
so you are right now you can attend the
training and make improvements in the
processes the measurement and reporting
exercise right anything that you cannot
measure you cannot improve so you have
to measure report meaningfully and set
realistic targets I know a lot of people
think very ambitious targets of
achieving the moon it cannot be done so
make sure that you give yourself time to
realistic fix the the correct moment
correct things and then take it forward
meaningful representation of your
metrics roll out the seven step process
that I talked about at strategy level
then you go to the tactic
level which is the next business unit
then to individual departments right
important is to communicate talk with
people what do they think they might
have a great idea which you should
foster that and give a environment where
everybody is able to share and learn
from each other and do that right so I
had an experience of doing a
gamification workshop where we used to
come up with a game and look at
improvements in a particular game and
then look at how do we improve this
action item and then deliver this as
part of the ongoing basis I have a slide
that will talk about it in a new course
so essentially these are steps that you
need to inculcate when you start your
journey of continual service improvement
any questions okay this seven scrub this
seven step process works in a loop
absolutely right it's it's it's a
continual basis and you do it in
strategy do it in design you do it in
transition you do it in operations and
CSI so it's it's a continual waste in
every every place if in any step there's
a question here if in any step there is
a problem then it can be reversed I mean
we can move into the before step yes
absolutely that's where you need to know
what is the deliverable out of each and
every step if certain step that you
envision some result he's not coming
then you need to look at and say why is
it not coming
probably the input was wrong because of
which the output is wrong so you need to
look at the input look at what is being
done where is the gap and fix the gap so
that you run it it's like you you you
are filling a bucket with water and the
bucket is supposed to fill water and
suddenly you see the water is not
getting filled then you look into that
bucket and you feel a hole is there
because of which there is water draining
so your step is you is going to be look
at that fix that particular hole so that
you are able to fill the water right
it's the same mechanism that you will do
as part of this exercise
hope that answers your question
okay so going on to the next one is
governance right I have had experience
doing a lot of consulting engagements in
Hong Kong Singapore China and Indonesia
where a great idea is just not about an
idea it's about how do you facilitate
those ideas how do you make sure that
the good ideas are captured easily you
know you cannot write big documents
people ask to stick idea it has to be
very easily you know written in the way
that people can capture those ideas
right so what we do is we enable
mechanism with speaking people can just
write an email write a word post you
know in an email or put it into a
Dropbox or write it in a piece of paper
we had different mechanisms to capture
ideas right what we did was we we
collected all these ideas into a
think-tank pool and then we formally
registered as part of an exercise but
you cannot expect all the people to
register it formally then they will not
be interested so keep an exact mechanism
which is easy for people to fill in and
give a rewarding mechanism right what is
in for them just by giving their idea so
acknowledge them in terms of the forum's
in terms of giving awards in terms of
recognizing people and straw flat and
then category is initiated by size in
terms of small medium large and then
work with a client right it's important
that when you work with your customers
they are the best trusted advisors they
give you a lot of inputs if we just
listen to them you learn a lot of things
I know I've had some fantastic
experience of working in with clients in
Singapore where the clients used to come
and say this is how I want you Suresh
that you think I think you can help us
and then we we work with them in a joint
initiatives and then it is win-win for
both of us right so you need to look at
the working mechanism how we can work in
consensus with the team to deliver
something meaningful right and make sure
that you drive and initiative from start
to completion don't people are very good
in starting they do campaigns they do
workshops they do an email
everywhere and stuff and they stop there
I mean we have to make sure that you
have to complete the cycle because once
you start completing the cycle and see
results then the momentum starts getting
built up automatically right so benefits
have to be tracked and show this is how
we improve productivity this is how we
provide cost efficiency and so on and so
forth right so it's important to get the
governance model in place so that you
are able to capture those ideas and make
it to a tangible results yeah it's a
practical CSI that there's an example
that I picked up when I was delivering
in consensus with the IT some of UK so
you have typically design phase where
you before you have the build
you have the requirements then you do an
integration with the processes tools
then you do a pre prod which is
basically a staging environment your
user acceptance testing and you delivery
right now there are three aspects one is
it could be pure delay like the design
time design team took about two weeks to
three weeks and that impacts the
integration part the pre-production date
and the delivery phase right there's a
peu delay of buffer that deliver that
that that gives that delays the whole
project from say one month to two months
right because they are all interlinked
there is a non-value-added fact where
you think this design effort there are
some efforts that you're doing it's not
adding value to it can we eliminate that
can we bypass that so that we are able
to eliminate the non-value-added so that
we can compress the timeline right
then there could be value-added effort
that we can focus upon that when you
start focusing on those effect it
actually gives you a better result right
so that's where we come up in the
concept of a child to come up with a
Minimum Viable Product to chose this is
Howard it works a simplified example
could be a particular person is going on
a bicycle right now a bycicle
is good for him because he he enjoys
doing it and but he thinks that he can
go faster and he has to press hard then
you give him a motor motor cycle then
he's very happy because he is able to go
fast and he's going to be going across
and then he introduced him to a car
where he then realizes that to the next
level so if we just take him to a car he
does not understand the value right so
you need to slowly introduce the changes
improvements so that people are able to
get value from the existing product or
service before they go on so when you do
si si look at what are the components we
are creating pure delay what are the
non-value-added effort that we can
remove what are the elements that can
add value and focus on those elements so
that you are able to get meaningful
results for for your aspects right so so
that's the way that you need to do
practical continual service improvement
right and this is an example that I have
playing a game and I am going to have a
link which I wrote a blog as to what is
in for you as an IPS an expert in
playing Apollo 13 Apollo 13 is a game
that we play in in in order to teach IT
Service Management as a principle right
so it's like the Apollo 13 movie where
you the crew go to the on a NASA space
you know shuttle they go there take
pictures and they come back the the
essence of this particular game is to
take those people who are going to - the
- to NASA to the moon to take pictures
and how to use IT service management
principles to bring them back safely so
we do four rounds typically to do this
workshop where we also have this matrix
so I just wanted to show you some of the
metrics so how how is the crew safety so
we have a safety target that has to be
at least 50% crew safety so in the first
round this team has gone to about 90%
and then they went to sign if
percent to seventy eighty percent and
then they drop right so you have this
process measures process core total cost
solving rate all the stuff that is
measured where you visibly able to see
results moving from round one to round
to to round three to Round four
right so in that way this gives you an
understanding of where you're doing gold
what we need to do to improve that right
for example in this solving rate first
round they only were able to resolve
about a 30 percentage of the target and
then we came up with some improvement
measures okay what went right and what
went wrong and then they came up with
the suggestions of what areas that you'd
improve in terms of better collaboration
in terms of better communication in
temples of press better process design
and then they improved it two hundred
percent you see there is a significant
improvement by learning what is not
working and implementing those
improvements and achieving results so
this is a very practical way of seeing
how you can assess the situation look at
your target and make those step changes
step improvements and reach and improve
your productivity your cost efficiency
improve your ability to deliver better
customer service going on and on and on
so I would encourage you to go through
this block we will be sharing this slide
as well as the webinar presentation and
I would encourage you to go through it
and and see how this was a great
experience sharing for for the games to
understand practical si si
so this chunk should do you have any
other questions that we can take a cross
so I don't see any other question of
this woman so I think everything is good
so what are the lessons learnt so we
going to the ultimate plan of what did
we learn as part of implementing
continual service improvement right the
the aspect to our senior management
support right we need to get senior man
in the support so if you don't get that
support you cannot really deliver things
right and si si is just not about just
fancy ideas
you're not trying to build a moon go to
the moon what you are trying to do is
make some small changes so that your
your work becomes a lot more easier the
business-as-usual becomes a lot more
easier right so coming to an office
delivering a project attending a meeting
everything has to be improvised right
that's what you want you don't want to
have build high funder stuff you want to
have something which is very easy and
which need to align with company vision
vision why because if it's not aligned
with the vision or mission the company
is not interested to support it the
senior management is not going to
support you they are not going to invest
on training and and projects and giving
you
awards and recognition right so start
something which what he can deliver so
start small and build a credibility and
then building momentum in delivering
something meaningful of course right
continuing on that communicate please
communicate with your internal and
external stakeholders right it could be
your own people your employees your
subordinates your seniors your project
managers and and also your customers
your customers you get your customer
satisfaction survey you can get your Net
Promoter Score Y sub customer you know
implement any of the strategies any of
the methodology you they give you a lot
of insights for for your stuff that you
use it for improving the way things are
working in this context right the the
next aspect is looking at your networks
and relationships right looking at CSI
as an internalization culture that means
develop ideas and think tanks to see how
best you can you can deliver those stuff
right what are the aspects that you can
focus upon make it simple so that people
are able to give you ideas suggestions
that you can easily use to deliver
something meaningful and in your sea as
a journey so finally what are the next
steps right so knowing about now what a
CSI what are the methodologies what is
the approach what is the seven step
process what are the governance model
what is the kind of culture that you
needed or understand what is
customers well how what are the
customers wanting you to do in terms of
your organization in terms of a business
clear goals and objectives which has to
be aligned with your organization's
goals remember if you don't start with
the top you cannot really cascade that
particular business goals to IT goals to
activity base to do that so you need to
participate from the ground right it's
not about top level under the ground who
are the people your services people your
departments your project managers your
incident managers your system
administrators your all of those people
process owners everybody have to work
together to make this happen it's a
collective team effort that we need to
do kis stands for keep it simple stupid
which means just simplify all this
processes make it very very easy to
follow because if you just get it more
bureaucratic it's not going to fall fall
in place right so keep it very simple
even your service even your service keep
it very simple measure the value of
improvements right you need to measure
how you are getting value from the
improvements and communicate and
celebrate right if you communicate well
and you were to celebrate your wins come
on come on we finally met the target go
for a team outing go for a dinner
outside enjoy the sweet moments that you
have achieved and then build that
momentum it's quite infectious to play
with a kind of d'emic so we spend a lot
of time doing team bonding working
together achieving a goal and then stop
so it has to be fun right it's not about
always work things be fun you need to
enjoy and you need to celebrate it for
you as a company as a part of your
resources so that they are all motivated
to deliver being well so with that I
come to the end of my presentation today
on CSI in action hope you got some
learnings in this process I have 10 more
minutes opened up if you have any
questions please use the question window
to post your questions and I will take
it up from there as I said we are doing
these workshops we are doing I will be
facilitating the
courses we will be shortly launching our
intermediate courses we have all the
subs lifecycle courses lined up I will
be facilitating some of these sessions
you will get some practical advice of
how to implement so I strongly encourage
you to enroll for the foundation
intermediate courses whether you can we
can know more of it right so I see
someone raising the hand let me see let
me unmute Debashish Debashish
go ahead you are unmuted Dabish you're
unmuted you can ask a question delicious
is able to hear yeah yeah yes yeah yeah
good yeah yeah I was able I was going
through your webinar and what I found is
like you are explaining the CSA process
very well explained and very much under
stable but I am NOT able to correlate
the ITIL and CSA I mean how they work
together or how they are associated okay
so that's a good question the British so
item has got five core volumes right
that means service strategy that means
you start from a strategy so continual
service improvement is one of the core
volume so what you do is let's say they
start with the strategy where they are
rolling out new services right from the
new services then you say ok if I need
to roll out these services how do you
decide so they come up with the design
aspect of architecture process models
policies then you transition that
particular service right so they talk
about a module called service transition
so it could be for your products it
could be for a service so itíll talks
about service transition and has volume
3 so where you do build test and
deployment right so we are talking about
change management you talked about
configuration management of an
infrastructure and release and
deployment management then we talked
about service operations where you have
delivered a product or service and it is
up and running right then we come to
service operations where you say oh I
have an issue with my server I am NOT
able to receive emails that is coming to
the operational aspect right
the next volume in item is continual
service improvement okay they say that
this is not working why is it not
working how do we prevent that from
happening
so that is where CSI will focus on
improving aspects art strategy level
design level transition level operation
level and the continuous over so
continual service improvement is
encompassing all the four five core
volumes of strategy service strategy
service design service transition
service operations to deliver something
hope that answers your question
negotiation right yeah okay so that's
better that's a that's a little cycle
that we are talking about and we are
just talking about one of this volume
called continual service improvement but
they are all tied together and they you
can make improvements in strategy you
can make improvements in design in
anything but this is just giving an
overview of continual service
improvement at this time any other
questions
do you have any other question because
you are still your you can put your
hands down if you if you have done that
yeah okay I will just see if I have any
other questions more idea on
gamification you can you can send a mail
to the supporter ad Rekha and then they
will they will be able to connect with
me and then I will be able to provide
more insights on that so write a mail to
support at a tier a card or Co and then
they will be able to do that the next
question is is there any full form of
item so ITIL stands for IT
infrastructure library so we are talking
about network storage database server
all those stuff you know so how do we
define best practice processes or ITIL
stands for IT infrastructure library it
is a framework or a best practice to
manage manage infrastructure related
stuff so I answered the question for
dabassisst next one from soon on how KP
A's and SLS are related to this and any
suggestions to improve
that in that area suggest from beginner
point of view okay so Cape KPI stands
for key performance indicators right so
let's take an example and SLS again SLA
is a service level agreements now let me
give an example very basic example so
none now let's take an example of offer
availability of a service let's say you
are going a transaction in ATM and the
ATM says ATM says that it will be
available 100 percentage of the time
okay let's take an argument say that any
ATM should operate hundred percent so
that is your SLA with your customer
right now you go to let's say a city
bank or an ICC bank and give your and go
to the ATM Center that ATM Center is not
dispensing cash it's not working so then
they took a report at the end of the
month they have they see they have been
only be able to provide 80% availability
as opposed to 100% availability right so
your service level targets or service
level agreement talks that you need to
maintain hundred percent but when you
took a record report you're only able to
manage 80 percent now this is where the
continual service improvement will come
in picture you say I am an 80 percent if
I need to improve from 80 percent two
hundred percent what changes that they
need to make do I need to improve my
infrastructure do I need to improve my
process with irony what is the data that
I've got okay
this month I've got 80 percent what does
the last month data so you do the seven
step approach that we talked about what
are we going to improve what do we
measure what data we got it where are we
here today and how do we improve so it
is all about CSI when you're talking
about metrics so metrics and
measurements are nothing but your key
performance indicators and service level
agreements hope that gives an idea a
Sunan hope that explains you how KPIs
and SL j's are related with the
continual service improvement or
improving from the existing target to
another target
so Row 2 this is not a software so gave
me fake
is just the principle it's more of a
game that we play physically so you can
when you click on the link there is a
link there is this it reaches to the
website and then you can contact us from
there and we can we can give you details
to that so the blog that I wrote has got
introduction of that and what
gamification is all about and those
thing about so you know I'm asking about
okay framework so ITIL is basically a
framework it's not a software it's just
a framework meaning some best practices
like for example people say follow this
process so it's just like process guide
links I can say it's not a software its
guidelines are best practice of doing
something okay so hope that explains
what what it is yeah so any other
questions for for what what we have
discussed so far any question so far
what we have discussed okay so if there
are no more questions thanks a lot for
your time please take your time to fill
the feedback a short feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
