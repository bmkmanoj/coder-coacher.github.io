day car and the topic for today's
discussion is the Google cloud platform
popularly known as TCP so without any
further delay let's go ahead and look at
today's agenda
first of all we'll be starting from the
basic needs of cloud computing and the
stand what cloud computing is then we'll
learn about the various cloud services
and their providers moving ahead we'll
understand what is TCP and the reason
behind choosing it next we'll learn
about the various services provided by
DCP and the different regions and zones
where it is present and finally we will
see how to create an account on GCP and
learn how to create a project and work
on it so let's have a look at a
traditional e-commerce scenario here we
have a retail company which wanted to
expand its business by starting home
delivery creating a website and creating
an app the company was doing great while
expanding his business but then their
website and hab had an unexpected rise
in traffic and things called a little
bit out of hands for them they faced
some problems such as scalability issues
increasing the number of systems
increasing the number of staffs they
faced several problems they needed
systems that are fast and up 24/7
moreover they required additional
security features for their customer
visiting the sites and app these
requirements don't come in cheap do they
let's suppose that the company even
bought hundred servers to handle the
traffic but later realized that at a
time on an average only 50% of the
servers were used a test for sitting
idle very frequently the number reached
70 to 80% that seemed like the waste of
money and resources so what do you guys
think is the solution to these problems
if your guess was cloud computing then
you guessed it right so cloud computing
is exactly the perfect solution to these
kind of problems let's see how cloud
computing is basically getting the
services you desire on your computer via
cloud it is the on-demand delivery of
compute power database to its
applications and other resources that
cloud service platform why I internet
with a pay-as-you-go pricing it is the
use of remote servers on the internet to
store manage and process data rather
than a local server or your personal
computer you don't need to buy a
thousands of so
systems to work everything is managed by
the cloud service provider so cloud
computing providers offer their services
according to different models of which
the three standard models were NISD our
infrastructure as a service platform as
a service and software as a service so
let's begin the infrastructure as a
service it refers to online service that
provide high level api used to
dereference various low-level details of
underlying network infrastructure like
physical computing resources location
data partitioning scaling etc
infrastructure as a service is where the
consumer can deploy under an arbitrary
software which can include operating
system and applications the consumer
does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure coming
on to platform as a service the
capability provided to the consumer is
to deploy on to the tower infrastructure
consumer created or acquired
applications created using programming
languages library services and tools
supported by the provider the consumer
does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure
including networks servers operating
system or storage but has control over
their deployed application and possibly
trance affiliation settings for the
application hosting environment when we
want to software as a service the
capably provided to the consumer is to
use the providers application running on
a cloud infrastructure the application
are accessible from various client
devices through either a thin client
interface such as web browser or a
program interface the consumer does not
manage or control the underlying Flour
infrastructure including network servers
operating system storage or even
individual application capabilities now
there are various cloud providers in the
market let's have a look at these
providers as you can see we have digital
ocean VMware Rackspace Google cloud
platform Amazon Web Services Microsoft
Azure join it
IBM cloud and Telemark so there are so
many cloud providers then why go for
Google Google cloud platform is a suit
of computing services that run on the
same infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end-user products
such as Google search Gmail Google
photos and YouTube we all know how big
is the database of Gmail YouTube and
Google search and I don't think in the
recent years
movers over has ever gone
this is the biggest in the world so now
let's have a look at some of the
features of GCP what really gives it an
upper hand over other vendors first of
all it is cost effective they are no
upfront costs required plus you get
discount for consistent uses of
resources you pay per second which is
how a plot should work
it is highly scalable it can easily be
scaled according to your needs with
virtually no cost
now custom machine type is a feature of
Google compute engine that lets you
easily create a machine-type customized
to your needs with custom machine types
you can create virtual machines with the
optimal amount of CPU and memory for
your workloads now coming to Internet of
Things DCP has an IOT specific
intelligent platform that unlocks
business insights from your global
device network Google Cloud IOT is a set
of fully managed and integrated services
that allow you to easily and securely
connect manage and ingest IOT data from
globally dispersed devices at a large
scale
you can even process and analyze and
visualize the data in real time now
coming to API platform an ecosystem GCPs
cross cloud API platform enables
businesses to unlock the value of data
deliver modern application and powerful
ecosystems coming on to big data
analytics DCP provides fully managed
data warehousing batch and stream
processing data exploitation with added
Hadoop and spark specific configuration
and reliable messaging now comes one of
the most important feature of Google
cloud platform which is the Google cloud
EA it provides modern machine learning
services with pre 10 models and a
service to generate your own tailored
models their neural net based machine
learning service has better training
performance and increased accuracy
compared to other large-scale deep
learning systems major Google cloud
application include machine learning
photos the app the voice search
translate and inbox which is this part
reply
now finally TCP is surveillance this
doesn't mean that there are no servers
used by Google so let's understand first
what server less means serverless
is a new paradigm of computing that
abstracts away the complexity associated
with managing servers for mobile and API
backends
they are no upfront provisioning just
provide your code and data and Google
dynamically provisions your resources as
needed application with rapid time to
market and unpredictable scale
requirements benefit the most from it
so here we can see that Google has the
highest growth rate and is breezing
rapidly as compared to the other cloud
providers now let's understand what is
Google cloud platform and what are the
various services provided by a Google
cloud platform is a suit of cloud
computing services and management tools
offered by Google alongside a set of
management tools it provides a series of
modular cloud services including
computing data storage data analytics
and machine learning now moving forward
to the services offered by TCP here are
the major services offered we'll discuss
each one of these features in detail in
later in the video but let's have a look
at these services first firstly we have
compute storage and database service
networking big data service we have
certain developer tools identity and
security we have the Internet of Things
we have the cloud AI which is Google's
machine learning service and finally we
have the management tools and the data
transfer tools so Google cloud platform
services are available in locations
across North America South America
Europe Asia and Australia these
locations are divided into regions and
zones you can choose where to locate
your application to meet your latency
availability and durability requirements
regions are independent geographic areas
consist of zones location within regions
tend to have a round-trip network
latency of under just five milliseconds
so let's have a look at the various
location where these servers are located
and the number of zones for that
particular region here you can see that
there are a total of fifteen regions
with at least three zones in every
region a few cloud platform services are
managed by Google to be redundant and
distributed within and across regions
these are mainly the global resources or
the multi regional resources now
regional resources are resources at a
redundant II deployed across all the
zones within a region for example app
engine application this give them higher
availability relative to zone of
resources zonal resources operate within
a single zone if a zone becomes
unavailable
although zonal resources in that zone
are unavailable
till the service is restored
now let's go ahead and see how we can
create an account on GCP
first of all you need to go to
cloud.google.com here you have the
option to try it for free all you need
to do is sign it with the Google account
you need to accept the terms and
conditions of Google
and after that you have access to all
the cloud platform products with a $300
credit which can be used across for a
span of 12 months they are no auto
recharge after the trial ends and after
that you agree the terms and conditions
you will be directed to this page now
just go to console
here you will find a dashboard which
includes all the summary of the various
Google platform services that you are
using as you can see on the left hand
side we have the project info resources
traits we have the API is requests on
the right-hand side we have the platform
status billing and error reporting and
at the bottom we have the news and
documentation which can also be used so
let's go ahead and look at the various
services offered by Google in detail
starting with compute GCP provides
scalable range of computing options you
can tailor to match your needs it
provides highly customizable virtual
machines and the option to deploy your
code directly via containers Google
Cloud compute engine delivers virtual
machines running on Google's innovative
data center and worldwide fiber network
Google App Engine is a platform for
building scalable web application and
mobile IOT backends App Engine provides
you with built-in services and API such
as no sequel database memcache and a
user authentication API App Engine will
scale it or application automatically in
response to the amount of traffic it
receives so you only pay for the
resources you use just upload your code
and who will will manage your apps
availability now who is kubernetes
engine is a powerful cluster manager who
monitors engine should use your
containers into clusters keep them
healthy and manages them automatically
based on the requirements you define it
is based on kubernetes the leading opens
was container system giving you the
flexibility to take the advantage of
on-premise hybrid a public cloud
infrastructure coming on to Google Cloud
container registry it's a private dock
repository that works with popular
continuous delivery system
it runs on cloud platform to provide
consistent uptime on an infrastructure
protected by Google security you pay
only for the storage and Internet you
use nothing else finally coming to the
Google function Google computing has
made possible fully serval as modulus of
computing where logic can be spun up on
demand in response to events or
originating from anywhere with Google
functions you can construct applications
from bite size business logic build to
nearest 100 millisecond only while your
code is many
now coming on to the networking services
with virtual private cloud vbc network
you can provision your Google platform
resources connect them to each other
using Google or global network and
isolate them from one another you can
also define fine-grained networking
policies with cloud platform on
on-premise or other public cloud
infrastructure you can scale your
application on Google compute engine
with the Google cloud load balancing
distributed load balance compute
resources in single or multiple regions
close to your users and to meet high
availability requirements cloud load
balancing can put your resources behind
a single IP and scale your resources up
and down with intelligent auto scaling
coming on to the content delivery
network also known as CDN Google cloud
seeding leverages Google's globally
distributed edged caches to accelerate
content delivery for websites and
applications served out of Google
compute engine cloud CDN lowers network
latencies offload origins and reduces
servicing costs Google Cloud Internet
allows Google cloud platform customers
to connect Google via enterprise grade
connections with higher availability or
lower latency than their existing
internet connections now coming on to
Google Cloud DNS it is a scalable
reliable and management authoritative
domain naming system service running on
the same infrastructure as Google it has
low latency high availability and is a
cost-effective way to make your
application and services available to
your users cloud DNS is programmable you
can easily publish and manage millions
of DNS zones and records using this
simple user interface command line
interface or API
now moving forward to stories and
databases Google Cloud Storage redefines
what the industries can expect from
online storage by providing an undefined
offering across the availability
spectrum from live data tapped by
today's most demanding application to
cloud archival solution now cloud sequel
is a fully managed database service that
makes it easy to set up maintain manage
and administer your relation my sequel
or post really sequel databases in the
cloud now sequel offers high performance
scalability and convenience hosted on
Google cloud platform classic QL
provides a database infrastructure for
application running everywhere
Claire BigTable provides a massive
scalable no sequel database suitable for
low latency and high throughput workload
it integrates easily with popular big
data tools like Hadoop and spark and it
supports the open source industry
standard HBase API cloud bit table is a
great choice for both operation and
analytical applications it can be used
for user analytics and financial data
analytics as well the Google Cloud
datastore give you an elastic high
available document-oriented database as
a service it is fully managed so you do
not need to deploy update configure or
manage your database solution
persistent disk is a high-performance
block stone is suitable for virtual
machine and container storage it offers
unmatched price to performance ratio you
only pay for the capacity and you are
never charged for provisioning high-ups
now the Google cloud platform you can
focus on finding inside tiles and
managing your infrastructure and you can
combine cloud native services with open
source tools as needed both in batch and
stream mode here is where big data comes
into picture Google bigquery is who was
fully man is low cost analytics data
warehouse bigquery is surveillance there
is no infrastructure to manage no need
to guess the needed capacity or over
provision and you do not need a database
administrator you can focus on analyzing
data to find meaningful in say Google
Cloud Data proc a man is SPARC and
Hadoop service is used to easily process
big datasets using the powerful and open
tools in Apache big data ecosystem
control your cause by creating manage
clusters of any size in about a minute
and turning them off whenever you are
done
now Google Cloud Data Lab is an
interactive notebook based on Jupiter to
explore collaborate analyze and
visualize data it is integrated with
bigquery and good cloud machine learning
to give you easy access to key data
processing services now Google's cloud
pub/sub is a service large scale
reliable real-time messaging service
that allows you to send and receive
messages between independent application
you can leverage the flexibility to
decouple systems and company hosted on
cloud platform or elsewhere on the
Internet now coming to machine learning
Google cloud auto ml is a suit of
machine learning products that enables
developer with limited machine learning
expertise to train high quality models
by leveraging Google state-of-the-art
transfer learning and neural
architecture search technology Google
Cloud tea POS are a family of hardware
accelerators that we will design and
optimize specifically to speed up and
scale of machine learning workloads for
training and inference programmed with
tensorflow
Google cloud machine learning engine
makes it easy for you to build
sophisticated large-scale machine
learning models that cover a broad set
of scenarios from building sophisticated
regression models to image
classification it is portable fully
managed and integrated with other Google
cloud data platforms
it also offers powerful video and image
analysis along with the best speech and
text recognition coming on to identity
and security Google Cloud Identity and
Access Management which is the I am lets
administrator authorized who can take
action on specific resources giving you
full control and visibility to manage
cloud resources centrally for
established enterprises with complex
organizational structures hundreds of
work groups and potentially many more
projects the cloud iam provides a
unified view into security policy across
your entire organization with built-in
auditing to ease compliance processes
now coming on to monitoring tools stock
drivers delivers real-time monitoring
and logging across GCP Plus useful
diagnostic tools manage your apps on GCP
with the web-based console mobile app or
closed-shell finally coming to the
developer tools grits our platform
provides a collection of tools and
libraries that help you develop quicker
Google Cloud SDK is a set of libraries
and tools that you can use to manage
computing resources and applications
hosted on Google cloud platform with the
cloud SDK you have interactive
command-line tools to manage your
virtual machines to class equal
instances and your deployments so let's
go ahead and look at the various
resources and the services provided by
Google here you can see on the left-hand
side you have a tab on which you have
the computer services the storage
services the networking services stack
driver and various developer and
management tools here you have the big
data tools you have the IOT services and
also various other services so first of
all let's go ahead and create a VM
instance this can be done in the compute
part just go to the compute engine click
on the VM instances click on create as
you can see here you can provide the
name for your instance select the zone
your instance should be present
according to your needs you can also
select the Machine type and every other
machine type has a different billing
amount here I'm going to select the
small one you can also select the boot
disk image what would be the base OS of
the VM you are going to create here I'm
selecting cent OS and then you just need
to tap on this create button and within
minutes I should save within seconds
your instance will be created as you can
see the instance was created within
seconds now let's go ahead and fire up
this instance
it's a virtual machine having the base
image of sent OS 7 so let's first update
the system
as you can see here we have the virtual
keyboard or we have the settings we can
change the color themes the text size
the font you can upload or download a
file very easily now sent OS seven comes
with a pre-installed Java 8 let's go and
check if that's the case here
there's no Java so let's install it
so within seconds I have Java installed
in my system similarly you can install
any of the frameworks you want to
install VM as you do well in a similar
manner in your local machine now that we
have created an instance let's go ahead
and create a cluster in the Big Data
section under data proc you have the
cluster option these clusters are mainly
used for Hadoop and spark purposes of
the Apache framework in the similar
manner you can input the name of the
cluster select the region where it
should belong and the zone you have the
cluster mode which is single node one
master zero Workers standard you can
easily deploy one master N and number of
workers and highly available which have
three masters and a number of workers so
this is the master machine which is one
CPU and 3.75 GB memory I don't need this
much of space and 100 DB is fine now for
the replication factor which is defined
here is 2 which is minimum 2 you can
also set the disk image size of the
replicas let's go ahead and change this
now just tap on create and within
minutes you will have your cluster up
and running
so while the krauser is being created
let's go ahead and check out the
dashboard here you can see in the left
hand side in the compute engine section
I have five instances of which one is
the VM instance which I created just now
and the remaining four are the cluster
instances when is the master and three
are the worker nodes you have the
billing estimate on the right-hand side
the API is the CPU uses
let's go ahead and check if the art
cluster is created or not
yeah you can see the cluster is created
and suppose I want to submit any type of
job you just need to go to the jobs
submit a job
select your cluster unit select the job
type which is Hadoop spark hi-fi spark
spark sequel or Pig you can enter the
main class or the jar the arguments you
want to pass or the job files needed to
submit a job and this you need to click
on the submit button and the job will
start running
we'll learn more about these features
and services in the upcoming videos
