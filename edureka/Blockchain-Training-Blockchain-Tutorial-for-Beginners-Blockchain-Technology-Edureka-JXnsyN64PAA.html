and welcome to this blockchain training
session now without wasting any time
let's move forward and look at today's
agenda to get a better understanding of
what we'll be learning today
now since blockchain and Bitcoin system
are extensively being used as a mean of
transaction we need to first try to
understand what is the current existing
monetary system and its various flaws
because if the system is slowly being
replaced by a newer system there must be
some issues with respect to that then we
try to understand how can blockchain and
Bitcoin help overcome the challenges
that are faced by the current existing
system as well as what is a blockchain
once you understood this we'll start
deep diving by understanding the various
blockchain concepts as well as how a
Bitcoin transaction takes place once is
understood how the Bitcoin transaction
takes place we'll may want to discuss
the various blockchain features as well
as understand where blockchain is being
used finally no session is complete
without a practical understanding so
what we'll be doing is we'll be doing a
demo where and we'll be creating Bitcoin
wallet and we'll be transacting bitcoins
between them so I you guys clear with
respect to today's agenda can I get a
quick confirmation ok so I seem to have
got a confirmation from leap Tison IJ
rahul should pass Stephani jeans frost
it's good to see that you guys are quite
excited for the session so let's begin
by the first topic of today's session
that is the current existing monetary
system now before we go into the
existing monetary system let's try to
understand how the monetary system as a
whole has changed over time the first
system that came into existence was the
barter system where you exchange one
kind of good with respect to the other
instead of any fixed monetary as such
then we had a universal ledger system
where we use gold coins for exchange of
goods now there was a certain value set
for each good and then they would be
exchanged with respect to gold coins
then came the age of flat money here
what we did was we exchanged paper
currency which were cheaper than gold
coins in exchange for any kinds of goods
as required and then came the age of
digital banking now to online banking
and digital banking it became quite easy
for us to purchase as well as sell our
goods as per requirement now the current
system that is existing and the one on
which bit
as well as all cryptocurrencies are
based is the decentralized digital
market now here you have a decentralized
form of monetary system where not one
single entity controls the governance of
the money as such we will be talking
more about the decentralized money
system ahead but right now I hope you
guys have got a simple understanding
with respect to the change in the
monetary system
okay great it's good to see that you
guys are following now let's try to
understand how creating actually happens
with respect to current existing system
what happens is all the trades or
transactions are such are kept inside a
book this book or ledger is offline
where and all the details are completely
stored and only people who are
associated with the bookkeeping can view
this not anyone can view the book now to
give you a simple example we can only
see the transactions that have been made
by us or involve as part of our private
accounting ledger this is same as your
banking report wherein you can only see
all the transactions related to your
account as such for this reason we
actually trust a third party or a
middleman to facilitate as well as
approve all our transactions usually
it's either a bank or a financial
organization to which you're associated
as such okay but again there are certain
issues that are present with respect to
the current existing banking system and
we will be talking about few of them one
by one now before I go ahead can you
guys give me a quick reply as to what do
you feel is wrong with respect to the
current existing system okay so I seem
to have started getting answers it's
good to see that you guys are being
quite interactive now let me just pick
out a few of them here I can see fake
currencies yes definitely that is one of
the major concerns high transaction fees
with all transactions definitely that is
one of the problems that most of us
space because in today's monetary system
almost every transaction requires a
certain added transaction fee and not
every one of us is comfortable taking
that as well apart from that I can also
see buying frauds definitely that is
another issue so let me not go into that
let's come back to our slides and let's
see what we have here now the first
issue is double spending now to those of
you who are not familiar with what
double spending is now spending
basically is a fraud that is part of the
digital currency system here by using
fake digital certificate you can
actually initiate transactions when you
don't have sufficient but apart from
that the chances of pay currencies being
part of the transaction is also another
major concern as we have seen as well
then we also have the issue of standard
transaction fees now let's see here
Chandler is sending ten dollars to Joey
but there is a standard transaction fees
two dollars that is associated with it
now it may not seem a huge amount here
but let's say when you're dealing with a
large transaction then it becomes a
problem as well and if you look at the
example here according to SSN and CNN
money's report in the Year 2015 JP
Morgan Chase Bank America and Wells
Fargo on 6 billion from just ATM and
overdraft fees apart from this the
overall transaction fees collected in
2015 is estimated to be close to forty
two point five billion dollars now
that's a huge amount when you look at
forty two point five billion dollars
from only this United State in one year
now again this is from different kinds
of transaction fees and these third
parties as well as financial
organizations meet their revenue just
like this another problem is the
transaction delays there is a certain
delay with respect to every transaction
that we make now let's say you're
sending money to a relative in US then
again it takes about two to three days
again the earliest is almost one day but
then again there are certain additional
transaction fees that you have to pay to
get a process faster so the time delay
that comes with respect to transaction
is another major concern apart from this
one of the main concern when you're
trusting a third party or a band as such
is the financial crisis now most of us
might remember the 2008 financial crisis
that had happened because most financial
organizations had lent out their money
as subprime mortgages to people who
couldn't afford to pay the this in turn
led to a huge financial crisis where the
value for real estate hand drop and that
led to almost 11 trillion dollar worth
Christ's apart from that you had close
to 10 million people who went jobless
with respect to that thing now this is a
very huge number and this was mainly
because we had put all our trust into a
third party and given them all our money
who in turn went and try to get a profit
out of this and caused a trouble for all
of us as well now these are some of the
major challenges that are part of the
current existing banking system and
let's try to understand how bitcoins and
blockchain help overcome these issues as
such but before we go ahead I hope you
guys are clear any questions to you
okay I see a lot more problems here but
let's not go into that right now as we
have discussed let's keep these for
itself in our mind and move forward with
respect to that slide because any system
that is there at present will have
certain amount of flaws with respect to
that and as I had mentioned earlier this
is one of the key reasons why Bitcoin
and blockchain system is so extensively
being used as a parallel system for the
mon free solutions okay thank you Frost
so moving forward let's try to
understand how blockchain and bitcoins
help solve these issues now some of the
major issues that we have talked in the
previous slides are highlighted here
there is the centralized power system
there is the private ledger system
double spending and prone to hack so let
me just summarize this once again
centralized power basically means that
one central authority governs the
complete monetary system so this could
be a federal system or it could be a
global system as well one single
Authority controls all the power with
respect to that certain monetary
solution that is part of the existing
system now with respect to the private
ledges as we have talked every
transaction that you make is only
visible to you the other transactions of
those involved with that organization is
not completely visible to you and it's
not completely transparent now let's say
you are paying fifty thousand dollars to
a bank you are not completely aware who
exactly gets this money and what exactly
they are doing with respect to at the
same although it would give you some
amount of satisfaction if you knew who
exactly is this money going to but again
if the system was available earlier then
I am quite sure we could have avoided
the 2008 financial crisis web subprime
mortgages where lent out then comes
issue of double spending as we have
discussed earlier now spending is an
issue with the digital system where by
using fake digital certificates you can
initiate transactions when you don't
have sufficient balance so let's say I'm
sending every one of you five hundred
dollars but at the same time I have only
two hundred dollars in my back by
creating fake certificates then I can
ensure that all of you get this money
and that exactly is the challenge of
double spending as well finally comes
the issue of prone to hat every now and
then we have heard about how the
accounts of certain people associated
with the financial organization or a
bank
have their account hacked and certain
data modified this could be their money
being transferred out or this could be
distributed somewhere else and so forth
now the first challenge of centralized
power is getting hacked by using a
decentralized power here blockchain
system uses a distributed ledger system
where anyone and everyone who's part of
the system gets the access to the ledger
and has the complete access and power
with respect to the system as well apart
from that we follow a public ledger
system here all the transactions that
are part of the blockchain are
completely visible to everyone who's
part of the blockchain
then comes the issue of prone to hack
blockchain system is completely
immutable too hot and no one till date
has been able to modify or hack the
system as such now you might have heard
about certain organizations which are
associated to Bitcoin and blockchain
getting hacked but the core technology
of blockchain has never been hacked as
such it's only the application built on
the blockchain or the Bitcoin system
that gets hot as such apart from this
the issue of double spending was one of
the key features that gets solved as
part of the blockchain solution because
while building the blockchain system
itself this was kept in mind and till
date there has not been an issue of
double spending as well so either as
clear with respect to how a blockchain
and Bitcoin can help solve these issues
any questions with respect to the same
okay so I seem to have a question here
from a jet adays asked me if the ledger
is probably can't everyone find the
details with respect to the people
involved in the system okay that's very
good question
so let me just address your question in
this way since you're part of the
blockchain system only details that you
get as part of the blockchain system is
the transactional details that is how
much is being transferred from food to
who but what happens is even this data
that gets transmitted is completely
secure and encrypted no one can actually
decrypt this data and identify who is
sending to whom we use a public key
private key encryption system here which
we'll be talking ahead the slide but the
identity of everyone involved in the
transaction remains highly secure as
well although there are certain
blockchain systems that use account
based system but Bitcoin blockchain
systems is something that does not deal
with
on details assets here only the details
with respect to the transaction is - I
clear now again ok good to see that all
of you are clear but still there is one
flaw that we have not talked about that
is present in the current existing
system which gets tackled by the
blockchain system and this is the issue
of transaction fees in blockchain system
you either have to pay zero transaction
fees or very minimal transaction fees
now I will be showing you how minimal
the transaction fees is when we are
transferring from our blockchain wallet
to our personal wallet but just to give
you an idea it's completely left you if
you want to add a transaction fees you
can add if not you're completely free
not to add as well some systems do add
at times of minimal transaction fees but
this is very very less when you compare
to the actual existing system okay so I
have a question here from Shilpa Shilpa
has asked me why should there be a
transaction fees if the option of zero
transaction fees is available so get us
a very good question Shilpa let me put
it in this way at a given instance there
are millions of Bitcoin transactions
that happen will be as I have mentioned
this is a distributed system that is
spread throughout the globe okay so at
the given instance there are millions of
transactions that keep happening so here
you need to initiate a transaction which
needs to be verified as well so if you
are attaching a fixed transaction fees
with respect to your transaction then
what happens is your transaction is
picked up on a priority now although all
transactions do get solved but if you
add the transaction fees then what
happens is your transaction is taken up
on a priority level does that answer
your question Shilpa okay that's great
now that you understood how the issues
with respect to the current system can
be tackled by the blockchain system
let's try to understand what exactly is
blocked now blockchain is the core
technology or the spine behind Bitcoin
cryptographic system in itself
originally introduced in 2009 by Satoshi
Nakamoto as part of a white paper the
blockchain and the Bitcoin system was
one of the key factors that led to the
idea of decentralized digital currency
system now it was only in Jan 2009 when
the first Bitcoin and blockchain system
was implemented although it is still a
mystery as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is it
is good
that he is a Japanese man who was born
in 1974 but then again these are just
some of the rumors that occur but one
thing is for sure
Satoshi Nakamoto is one of the most
interesting man because he not only came
up with such a complex system he also
holds close to 1 million bitcoins as
part of today and which is close to 2.4
billion dollars so that's a huge amount
and the mystery still remains
apart from that blockchain in itself is
a technology which is a publicly
distributed database now in these
databases what you're basically storing
are encrypted Ledger's but then you
might be wondering what is present in
these letters as I had mentioned earlier
the ledger in itself actually holds a
set of transactions which are verified
and validated and have been completed
after the previous block was created now
every new block contains multiple
transaction details now these
transaction details again are hashed and
encrypted and stored as part of a block
so every 10 minutes as per the current
time a new block gets created and and
you keep grouping up this block it tends
to become a long chain and it is called
the blockchain in itself now right now
even why we are speaking in this session
as per we going in the slide it says you
can expect a new block to be created and
the blockchain system to keep growing on
as per the current standards and once a
block has been successfully added to the
blockchain the work on the new block
start and you keep building up the
blockchain system now moving on let's
talk about the three basic fundamental
factors based on which blockchain system
was built the first is the cryptographic
technologies here you use a public key
private key cryptographic to ensure that
no one is able to identify the user as
well as you use various hashing
functions which make the blockchain
immutable that is you cannot modify
anything that is part of the blockchain
now why does this happen we'll be
discussing a bit later now you might be
still wondering even though it is a
public system can I not make any changes
with respect to this to make some money
and let me make this clarification right
now even though it is just transaction
details even if you're trying to modify
a small part of it let's say even a
single trans
if you're trying to modify it does not
get implicated as part of the blockchain
and this is mainly because of how
effective the hash function is apart
from this we also use a peer-to-peer
network wherein we maintain the ledger
across every system which is part of the
blockchain this in turn completely
ensures the consistency of the ledger so
let's say even if you're making a
certain transactional modification in
your system this does not get
implemented across the blockchain system
because majority of the people who are
part of the blockchain system actually
have the original copy and even if you
want to make the modification system
permanent as part of blockchain system
you need to have at least 51% of the
resource that is part of the block state
system now to make it quite simple up
now if you want to make a modification
with respect to any data present in the
blockchain then you need to have more
than 51 percentage of the global
resource associated to the blockchain
and as I had mentioned blockchain is
something that is distributed throughout
the world and is something that involves
millions of people so imagine having
more than 51 percentage of the resource
that is being used by millions of people
a huge number it and who's exactly why
blockchain system is highly secure as
well apart from this the blockchain
program in itself has various protocols
which ensures that any tampering or any
change with respect to the blockchain
system is not allowed so we'll be
talking about each one other one by one
let's talk about the cryptographic
technologies yeah so as I had mentioned
you using a public key crypto graph here
here basically you're going to use two
keys one is going to be private and the
other is going to be public once you've
encrypted your data using the public or
the private you can be crypt this data
using the other now basically what
happens as part of the blockchain system
is that you send the details of the
sender that is you as well as the
receiver along with the amount of
bitcoins that has to be transfer and
this completely gets hashed to give you
a specific hash value apart from this
this also a digital signature which is
again a hashed value
combination of your private key as well
as the amount of bitcoins you sent so
what you need to do is that you need to
decrypt both these values and compare
them once this is correct
then you can be ensured that this
data has not been modified and as I had
mentioned earlier this encryption is so
secure that even if you change a
specific semicolon or a comma and is
associated as part of the key then it
makes a huge change with respect to the
hash value associated so there itself it
identifies that this has been tampered
and this transaction is not cut okay
then you have the peer-to-peer network
now again peer-to-peer network is the
collection of different nodes associated
in the blockchain system here you might
be wondering what exactly is a node node
is anyone associated with the octane
system it can be me it can be you but to
give you a general idea
anyone who's associated the blockchain
system is called unknown now there are
different kinds of node and we'll be
talking about them as far as the next
session but just to give you a simple
idea we are a complete node that is
anyone who has the complete blockchain
downloaded to their system and has the
complete ledger as well is referred to
as a full node apart from that there are
also special nodes called - now - are
basically the people who validate our
transaction as well as work on building
a new block now remember the term of
minor because this is something that is
important and we'll be talking in the
upcoming slides now coming back to a
peer-to-peer network a look at the
example here let's say a or an D here
identify that there is a transaction
between Bobby and Cindy where Bobby is
sending Cindy five bitcoins now what
happens is once key is identified it
then what happens is a broadcasts it to
both B and C that has been verified
Bobby has enough balance to send it to
Cindy so you can go ahead with the
transaction and I approve of this apart
from this one Bobby and Cindy have got
the green signal they in turn will
transmit this verification signal across
to all the nodes that we are connected
to and this keeps getting propagated
throughout the network so this is one of
the major factors that helps when you're
in part of a peer-to-peer network you
don't have to manually send it to every
signal when you send it to one specific
node they keep propagating it to all the
nodes that they are connected to okay
clear to hear any questions with respect
to the first two factors okay so I have
got a question here from beep-beep is
asking me what exactly was the digital
signature key well
come back to that we'll be talking about
that in the next slide don't worry okay
AJ has another question here are they
asking what exactly gets propagated here
okay I get it so what gets propagated
here is a digital signature telling
everyone as part of the network that a
transaction has been taken place and the
ledger needs to get updated that is you
need to do that five bitcoins from
Bobby's account and it has to be updated
in Cindy Circo so that's exactly what
gets propagated and everyone who's part
of the block kit gets this propagation
data okay does that answer a question RJ
okay haja has another question here
ideas ask me can I not modify this
signal and propagate okay that's a very
good question onion so let me clarify
this again so let me take an example
here it's a so let's say as far as the
propagation one of the nodes in this
case let's say this node I'll call it D
and I'll call him Dave okay so what Dave
does is Dave gets the signal that Bobby
has transferred five bitcoins - Cindy
okay now what he'll do is that he'll try
to modify this he'll try to make it such
that instead of Cindy it should go to
him that is five bitcoins have to be
transmitted today instead of Cindy okay
no as you can see this already being a
propagation that takes place now what he
is trying to modify is the signal that
is coming from Bobby but at the same
time let's say here e let me call it
Eddie Eddie has a signal okay let's say
AJ you're part of the blockchain so I
will say I will call this AJ then let me
add frost here
Frosty's ass okay so what happens is d
he modifies D is Dave he tries to modify
this signal that is coming to him and
he'll send the updated signal to s that
is Shilpa here okay
so there's also been a signal coming
from day of to Shilpa okay so this
propagation takes place he is this is
the modified propagated signal but then
what happens is Shilpa gets to signal
one is coming from a Jeb okay which has
the correct data that is being
propagated by Cindy that is 5 bitcoins
has to be transferred from Bobby to
Cindy but at the same time she is also
getting another signal from Dave that
says 5 bitcoins has to be transmitted
from Bobby to Dave now this leads to a
conflict so what happens is she requires
a clarification with respect to a 3 when
you look at the actual transmission only
Dave is the one who's got the modified
transaction details but everyone else
who's part of the blockchain network has
the correct details that is the
transaction has to be between Bobby and
Cindy and not anyone else
so what happens is this false
transaction gets neglected that is this
transaction gets neglected and the
correct transaction gets stored as far
as this ledger does that answer your
question now again I clear with respect
to how it works out okay that's great to
see so any other doubts with respect to
how the peer-to-peer network works are
you guys clear with respect to the same
ok the good tissue that you have
followed with here now apart from this
as part of the peer-to-peer network we
use a distributed ledger then to help
you understand how the distributed
ledger works let us take an example here
now here what happens is Andy is giving
Bobby $10 Bobby in turn is giving Debbie
$3 and Debbie in turn is giving out
Cindy $1 okay now if you are storing
this on a central edger there is just
one copy and this is something that is
not accessible to Ella let's say if
something happens to the central copy
let's say it gets damaged or if someone
modifies this then it becomes
problematic but if you are using a
distributed ledger system everyone who's
part of the system has a copy of this
thereby in itself ensuring that even if
the one copy present is get corrupted or
gets destroyed there is no problem and
everyone else part of the system has a
copy even if let's say Andy loses his
copy of the ledger
he can request it from Bobbie Debbie or
Cindy or let's say Bobbie doesn't want
to pay back and either $10 he just tries
to modify what is part of his ledger
then so Andy can check with Debbie and
Cindy and ensure that the distributed
ledger cannot be modified as such so I
hope you guys are clear with respect to
how the distributed ledger system works
how it's better than the existing
central ledger system
okay so I have a question here from
Rahul Rahul is asking me can anyone
actually download the distributed ledger
for blockchain system definitely not now
all you need to do is that you need to
sign up the blockchain and then you can
download the complete blockchain which
has the complete transaction details of
path from 2009 till date okay so this is
completely accessible to anyone and all
the transactions which are part of the
blockchain is completely viewable by the
public does it answer a question at all
okay that's great so moving forward
let's try to talk about the digital
signature now this is one of the major
reasons which ensures that the
transactions in itself cannot be
modified or tampered with now what
happens is you first feed the data it
basically has the public key of the
sender public key of the receiver as
well as how many bitcoins has to be
transmitted into a hash algorithm this
in turn will give you a specific value
of hash which you are going to encrypt
using the private key once that it gets
encrypted then you're going to add it as
a digital signature to your document now
as we have discussed earlier this
document has a public key of the sender
public key of the receiver the number of
bitcoins and the digital sign network
then you broadcast it across the
peer-to-peer network waiting for someone
to verify this
once you have broadcasted it it is going
to be received by your special what
their job is is to actually take the
data present in the document hash it and
as well as decrypt the digital signature
and hash it as well if the hash values
that is obtained from decrypting as well
as hashing the data present then you
compare these two hash values if they
are the same then you can ensure that
this is a valid transaction and has not
been tampered with so either is clear
with respect to this how this works out
yes Thailand you can definitely decrypt
using the private key as well but what
you need to do is that you need to
encrypt it using the public key so as we
have discussed this is an asymmetrical
process if you're encrypting using the
public key you can be tripped using the
private key if you are encrypting using
the private key then you can decrypt
using the public key okay that's great
so moving forward let us talk about the
blockchain program in itself locks in
basically was an implementation or a
solution which ensured that we
transmission
of bitcoins can happen as well as
different decentralized two currencies
can use the same solution to establish a
parallel transaction system apart from
this blockchain concept can be
implemented using any programming
language that you wish and blockchain
originally was written using C++ and
Java today has evolved into different
programming languages but again the most
popular and preferred programming
language to write the blockchain program
is solidarity and this is one of the
most secure programming languages as
well okay now what we'll do is we'll try
to discuss how a Bitcoin transaction
takes place and what are the different
steps involved in this before that I
guess here to hear a doubts to hear the
Jain seems to have a question your dream
is ask me can anyone create a blockchain
definitely James now if you attended our
previous session on blockchain tutorial
session there what we have done actually
is that we have created a private or
normos blockchain and we have tried to
execute a certain transactions as part
of the object so you can check out our
blockchain tutorial session to get a
better understanding of the same
okay that's great so let's try to
understand how a Bitcoin transaction
takes place but before that I am quite
sure all of you must have the question
as to what is a Bitcoin Bitcoin was the
first decentralized digital currency
introduced Lamarck as I had mentioned
earlier it was 430 Nakamoto in 2009 who
introduced the concept of Bitcoin and
blockchain together another major thing
is that it uses various cryptographic
technologies to control its creation and
management now what do we mean by
creation and management now it is a
digital currency so you might be
wondering can't anyone just created as
per their required the answer to that is
no to create a bitcoins is not quite
easy it is not something that one single
entity can do now this is mainly because
the various cryptographic technologies
and mathematical algorithms associated
with creation of Bitcoin gets complex
day by day now there is a limited number
of bitcoins that you can create and that
has been believed to be in 21 million
bitcoins now what happens is that if we
do not put this restriction on the
creation and management of bitcoins then
it becomes problematic and we over
exhaust this now if there was no
specific restriction then what would
happen is maybe go the week over the
next week or even today itself people
would have mined all the 21 million
bitcoins and as on date close to 14.5
million bitcoins have been mined
it's only because of these restrictions
with respect to the creation of bitcoins
has this process being decreased because
every given day there are new people who
get involved in the creation of Bitcoin
system and the resources that are fold
in the Bitcoin creation system keeps
growing day by day so these controls
that are being added to the creation and
management are something that ensures
that the last Bitcoin gets mined only by
21:40 I guess clear ok Shilpa has asked
me how do you keep control so they
should have to give you a better idea
there are lot of mathematical problems
that you need to solve as well as you
need to work with different algorithms
so the complexity associated with all
this keeps changing on a regular basis
so over a fixed time what happens is all
the miners associated in creation of
bitcoins
come together and decide on the
complexity that
needs to get modified and this is
something that is more like a democratic
situation where everyone has a work so
based on the word of majority the
complexity is set and according it is
being planned but as I had mentioned
with the going complexity it is believed
that the last Bitcoin is only going to
be mined in 2008 what does it answer a
question Shilpa okay that's great now
apart from this all the bitcoins are
created and held electronically into a
peer-to-peer open logistic that is the
bitcoins even booth are created are
going to be held as part of the ledger
system itself and this ledger is
completely pure to pure everyone who's
part of the network gets a complete copy
of this ledger and this whole system the
whole system of peer-to-peer network is
known as block G finally when we talk
about the ledger in itself this is
something that gets produced by solving
mathematical problem so this is what I
was talking about earlier so you have to
solve different mathematical problems to
create a new block which has the
complete transaction details and that
requires a different amount of resources
so again it's not quite easy to create a
new block or modify an existing law and
this in turn ensures that the ledger as
well as the blockchain system is highly
secure and immutable so you guys clear
with respect to what does a Bitcoin
okay so beep seems to have a question
you heard I like this question peepers
asked me why does the value of Bitcoin
change okay deep so let's take a dis pip
if I have to speak statically in John
2017 itself the value of Bitcoin was
close to $1,100 today's that is on 7th
July it's somewhere close to $2,800 now
this is mainly because of the beliefs
that people put in a system now the more
people invest into the system the more
the value keeps changing with respect to
that same so bitcoin is something that
runs around a no trust system where you
don't need to put your trust on a third
party and it's something that is
governed by mathematical principle okay
so this in turn increases the value and
the more the number of people come into
the system invest their money and help
the system grow more will the value of
bitcoins on blockchain keep growing day
by day so does that answer a question
deep okay a J's asked me can anyone
purchase bitcoins definitely AJ will be
talking about how you can purchase
Bitcoin and from where in the demo part
they will also be seeing how you can
transact using bitcoins so I request you
to be a bit patient okay they're going
forward let's try to understand how a
Bitcoin transaction takes place now
let's take an example here where James
has to send Kevin 500 bitcoins okay the
transaction is something that's going to
be part of a new block which is going to
be validated by - known as Lisa and
Robert so if you guys remember we had
earlier discussed about - these are
special notes whose rows involve
validating transactions as well as
creating new blocks for the blockchain
system again now what will do is let's
try to look at the ledger in itself so
this is what the sample ledger looks
like okay every transaction holds the
details of the transfer currency from
one account to the other that is in the
transaction details what a be specifying
is who is sending to whom as well as how
many bitcoins are going to get
transferred as part of this transaction
okay here you are not going to store the
balance explicitly what do I mean by not
storing the balance explicitly so let's
take an example of your current bank
account here what happens is there's a
complete history of your credit and
debit that gets
just and then a current balance that is
shown with respect to a safe however in
the Bitcoin blockchain system you do not
hold a balance sheet but there are
certain cryptocurrency systems like
aetherium which hold an account based
balance system but Bitcoin blockchain
system does not hold the balance
explicitly so you might be wondering how
do I know if a person has sufficient
bath so what you do is that you check
the blockchain to see at any point does
this person have sufficient balance to
initiate this transaction let's say one
of the transactions part of the
blockchain is where someone else is
sending James 500 bitcoins so that means
I can be sure that he has enough balance
to standard so what you do is you check
the complete transaction history that is
associated with James to see if he has
sufficient buckets okay are you guys
here okay that's good to see now here
what we'll do is that we will consider
the third entry that is part of the
ledger to be James so let me just add a
J here so this is James and this is
Kevin okay so as you remember James has
to send 500 bitcoins to Kevin so what
happens 500 Bitcoin should get deducted
from James's account and has to get
updated into Kevin's account so once
this transaction is validated then the
ledger also gets updated with respect to
the same so earlier where it was
thousand 342 and Kevin had 12 dollars it
gets updated to 1842 and Kevin's balance
gets updated to 512 okay so here
explicitly balance is not stored this is
something that gets calculated every
time the Bitcoin transaction gets
recorded okay this is just to give you a
simple idea of how things work out as
far as the blockchain system and how the
ledger works okay now to give you an
overview of how the transaction as a
whole works out is that first James
initiates
a transaction request okay
simultaneously - were called a special
notes try to validate this transaction
okay
so whichever block has this transaction
detail they try to validate it that is
thus James has sufficient balance and
they both are basically trying to solve
the same problem so they are arrays in
between them
okay once they have identified that he
has sufficient balance that is the block
gets validated then the money gets
deducted from James account and get
added to Kevin's a car now here what
happens is since each transaction has to
get validated this ensures that the
problem of double spending does not
occur okay so even if he tries to
falsify by sending two transactions
since each of the transaction gets
validated one by one by the - the issue
of double spending gets off are you guys
clear okay so Tyson is ask me what
happens if each of the miners get one of
the transactions that's a very good
question Tyson so we will take that up
as part of the next session where we
will be talking about how double
spending gets solved as well as how a
blockchain system validation takes place
so there we'll be talking about how the
transaction gets validated in detail as
well as how the problem of double
spending completely gets annihilated
okay but since you have asked this
question Tyson let me put it very simply
for you so what happens is that both of
them actually validate one of the
transactions which is maybe one in a
million case that both the transactions
are verified and validated at the same
time and this gets created to a new
block then what happens is they have
start to propagate it as part of the
network so that way everyone gets one
copy of transaction that is being
validated by Robert the other by Visa
now whoever creates the next block
whichever block we have used previously
that is if they have used Lisa's block
then the transaction approved by ISA
becomes valid and the transaction
approved by Robert does not become bad
so this in turn eliminates the problem
of that spin I know it's not very clear
we'll be talking about it in the next
session as I have mentioned but I hope
you've got a simple overview now okay
that's good right now again I expected
this question from you as to why would
minors actually validate these
transactions now we had talked earlier
about our transaction fees but in the
blockchain system the transaction fees
is quite minimal so validating a
transaction in itself is not quite
helpful
but for miners who create the new block
they get an incentive of 12.5 bit cuts
so if you create the next look of the
blockchain system you get an incentive
of 12.5 bitcoins as part of a reward so
this in turn is ash which a lot so going
by the present rate this is somewhere
close to $35,000 for just mining a new
block easy way to make money right now
it may seem a huge reward to just mine a
new block but it's not quite easy as you
think given today's resources no
individual can completely mine a new
block okay so that's exactly why you
come together to form something known as
a resource pool where different miners
come together form a group and then try
to solve the next mining block these are
how much resource we have all put in to
mine the new block the reward gets
distributed as such so even if let's say
five miners have come together and mined
the new block each K 2.5 bitcoins now
when you say 2.5 bitcoins this is close
to almost five thousand to six thousand
dollars so that's quite useful
definitely so as I had mentioned given
the individual resources no single
person can mind the new block as much
but the Bitcoin system definitely
rewards you for helping out the
transaction as well as mining the new
block as such once the new block gets
created it becomes the permanent part of
the blockchain and as we have seen the
blockchain system keeps growing and new
blocks keep getting added to it so any
doubts trivia
okay so James is asking me where does
this Bitcoin get stored so James you
have a special wallet called a Bitcoin
wallet which can be used to store these
bitcoins now basically there are four
different kinds of wallets now I am NOT
going in detail right now we will be
talking more about this as part of the
demo so basically you going to use the
special wallet called Bitcoin wallet to
store these bitcoins so all you need to
do is that you need to give the private
eight where the bitcoins have to be
transacted once you do that you can get
the Bitcoin to work once the mining is
complete so Deepa's ask me can i mined
bitcoins using my computer definitely
beep but again as I had mentioned it's
not quite feasible for a single user to
miner Bitcoin now there are a lot of
things that you need to take into
consideration okay you need to take into
consideration amount of electricity that
you're going to be spending you need to
take into consideration on what of the
source that you are putting okay even
the processor as well as time that
you're investing in computing is another
major factor here so again there are a
lot of things that come into picture so
what I would sell instance you check out
the Bitcoin feasibility calculator it is
available online where you just enter
certain details and then you can see how
feasible it is for you to mine bitcoins
but again as I had mentioned mining
using your system is not quite feasible
okay you have special devices known as
Bitcoin miners which are used for mining
bitcoins okay deep is ask me how is a
Bitcoin miner different from our system
so to put it quite simply basically is
the difference between the processor
your Bitcoin miner uses a specific kind
of processor which makes it easy for you
to solve the mathematical equation and
mined the Bitcoin resource now I am NOT
going to go too much in detail with
respect to this we'll be talking about
this in our next session they will try
to mine bitcoins using our system first
and we will try to mine it with using a
Bitcoin miner second there okay
definitely great
moving on let's try to understand how a
Bitcoin transaction takes place on a
higher level okay so what happens is
someone actually requests for the
transaction so you can either send a
transaction to someone else
or you can also request a transaction
when you do this it gets transmitted
across the peer-to-peer network that is
everyone who's part of the system gets
the details with respect
publicly the Seavers publicly as well as
how many bitcoins has to be transmitted
once this gets really dated then this
validation signal gets propagated
throughout the network and it gets added
as part of the new block once the new
block gets added to the blockchain
system then it also gets verified and
the transaction complete signal gets
sent to the user okay so I hope you guys
are clear with respect to the flow of
the blockchain system any doubts with
respect to what we have discussed still
here
okay it's great to see that you guys
have followed till here so now let's
talk about the various blockchain
features
now in any blockchain system all the
transactions which are validated get
included as part of it the information
here basically is the time at which the
transaction is taking place the date on
which the transaction is taking place
the people involved as I had mentioned
here is the public keys as well as the
amount that is being sent with respect
to access all these informations with
respect to every transaction is stored
again you might be wondering how can you
store so much data so again all of this
gets combined and hash to get a specific
value which in turn gets stored as part
of the block now each node has the
complete copy of the blockchain so as I
had mentioned earlier once you sign up
for the blockchain network then you can
completely download the blockchain
system thereby ensuring you have a
complete copy of the blockchain
distributed let a person this as I had
mentioned miners are special nodes who
verify all the transactions associated
with the block by solving various
mathematical paths
now again you might be wondering what
this mathematical puzzle is and how is
it solved so for that we'll talk about
it in the next session which completely
deals with doctrine mining and
blockchain verification also the
mathematical principle associated with
law chain completely ensure that all the
nodes are automatically and continuously
in a state of agreement with each other
that is all the values which are present
as part of the blockchain are same with
respect to everyone who is part of the
blockchain
so again as I said this is mainly
because of mathematical as well as
cryptographic techniques involved in
creation of a new block as well as
verification and validate so even if you
try to modify one specific transaction
or even a block as a whole it is not
quite possible because everyone who's
part of the blockchain has the complete
copy so even if you try to change it is
not completely reflected as we had seen
a previous example when we are talking
about the peer-to-peer network now there
are mainly three types of lock chains
that can be implemented the first is a
public blockchain now here everyone
who's part of the system could
completely view the ledger as
well as a dandy block of transactions
that is you can verify in transaction
and add the new block okay an example of
this is the Bitcoin blockchain system as
well as the EPDM - and fat combo chain
system so these are different
cryptocurrencies that are being used to
work then you have private blockchains
now here the difference is that all the
permissions that is to either validate
or add a new block is kept to a central
organization only people who are part of
this organization can view and add
transactions but generally what happens
is people in the Internet are allowed to
view this but this is not the case
always there are certain organizational
boxes when you can't see it unless you
have the required portion so it's not
completely accessible to the public as
well one example of this is multi chain
and you also have block stack which is
another popular private blockchain then
you have something known as a consortium
block consortium blockchain is some word
between the public and the private
blockchain here what happens is that the
control is not completely restricted to
one central authority but with selected
groups of nodes who have the access to
either write or add the new block but
again the ledger as itself is something
that can be viewed by the public or can
be restricted to people who need access
to this okay and examples so these are
ripple and r3 so depending on the need
an organization can set up one of the
three types so who can give me an
example of these three systems apart
from what is mentioned so you can take
your time think about it and give me an
example with respect to the three where
do you think these different kinds of
block things can be used
okay banks can be private and consortium
that's a good answer Tyson what do you
think about a public blockchain see you
don't need to restrict your thoughts
just to the banking of it now as I had
mentioned you blockchain is something
that is growing beyond the banking
domain system as such financial monetary
system is just a tip of the iceberg
there are different orbits now if I have
to give you examples with respect to
that same so let's take an example of a
supply chain blockchain here what
happens is that you can establish a
consortium or a private blockchains
wherein only people who are on the
governing board can decide to modify and
but anyone who's associated to the
blockchain can see the complete details
so even your suppliers as well as your
demanders can actually get an idea of
what is happening with the goods where
exactly it isn't which stage of the
whole process is it now one example of
the same system is IBM's doctrine system
which has made a drastic change with
respect to the supply chain market as
well and to know more you can check out
IBM's video on IBM blockchain where you
get a complete idea of how blockchain is
being used by them now
another idea with respect to the
consortium blockchain that I can give
you is with respect to the healthcare
system so what your organization's are
trying to implement is that they're
trying to establish a consortium
blockchain where people with selected
access mainly doctors can view the
complete records of patients which is
present in the blockchain so this
ensures that if a customer is admitted
in a different Hospital you don't need
to completely send his record details
across he can directly access it from
the blockchain given you enough
privileges and it ensures that this is
not completely tampered as well so try
to think about different domains where
blockchain can be used for parts from
banking and the domains I have mentioned
so tomorrow when you come back for your
next session I hope you guys have a few
answers at least okay
definitely that's good to see that you
guys are in interest okay now moving
forward let's try to look at knock chain
use case now as I had mentioned
monitoring system is basically just tip
of the iceberg lock chain is something
that is being used across different
Dermott okay now one major domain web
block chain presently is being used is
supply chain management
apart from that block chain is also
being used for the election system okay
so here what is happening is that using
the digital signature anyone can sign
into the blockchain and cast their vote
thereby ensuring more number of people
come in and vote for their candidate as
well as both frauds do not happen apart
from that these are some of the
different domains where blockchain can
be used let's say in terms of industry
flows you can change the way you
interact with your suppliers you can
also identify your real time capacity
you can even have a peer-to-peer trading
system so your network service
management can improve your demand-side
management can improve again your cell
service maintenance your asset inventory
tracking all these are different domains
where blockchain can be implemented to
improve the efficiency as a whole now as
I had mentioned your assignment for
tomorrow is to identify at least five
domains where you feel blockchain can be
implemented and improve the existing
system okay so please do not pick up any
of the domains that we have discussed as
far as this session okay that's great
now let's move forward to the last topic
of today's session that is the
blockchain demo now what we need to do
is that we need to implement a digital
transaction between different Bitcoin
wallets what we need to first do is that
we need to set up one desktop wallet but
is taxed as well as we need to set up
one online Bitcoin wallet that is
blocked it once you've established these
two bullets we are going to perform a
transaction between both of them and
then finally we'll verify okay first
what you need to do is that you need to
set up your best of wallet jacks so for
that all you need to do is go to Jack's
dot IO and download the digital world so
this is your Jack's home page all you
have to do is just click on get tax free
and you get redirected to the download
page okay now here what you need to do
is that you need to just select your
device since I'm using a Windows
I'm going to specify windows and it's
going to download now it's quite easy
for you to install Jack's I will be
showing you how to install Jack's as
well so first go ahead and download this
warrant great so now that you have set
up your Jack's wallet let me just show
you how to install blockchain wallet as
well so for that this go to blockchain
website and here just click on the
option get feed Bitcoin wallet okay so
this is going to redirect you to a new
page for signing up so first start by
giving your email id then specify a new
password
so once you've specified your password
this click on I have read the Terms and
click on cutting
this in turn will give you a wallet
identify always store this number so
this is quite easy for you what you need
all you're going to see is welcome so
your wallet is getting created
automatically so it's quite easy process
okay so now what are you doing is that
will be initiating a transaction between
my Bitcoin wallet to my Jack's desktop
world okay so let me just show you how
it's done so as you can see here there's
a specific amount that's already loaded
into my Bitcoin system as to how you can
purchase bitcoins there are different
sites for you to purchase bitcoins now
if you are in India there are different
sites I would recommend that you use
either their pay or local bitcoin by a
dot in but again as I had mentioned you
just need to Google up and you can find
different website that will help you
purchase bit cups okay now what we're
going to do is that we're going to send
this complete amount from my block chain
to my jax wallet okay so here you can
either specify a request to receive
amount or you can send it directly so
what I'll do is I'll send it and what is
going to ask me is that it is going to
ask me this private key so for that come
back here you can copy this from here
and just paste it so now let's say I
need to specify the amount okay so what
I'll do is I will specify the complete
amount that I have that is 0.12 and then
immediately it tells me what is the
maximum piece I can set just click on it
and this is the maximum piece that I can
set now if you see the standard
transaction fees that is added to this
is just four rupees okay I'm sending
almost close to two thousand six hundred
and it's asking me of four rupees
transaction piece so this helps you
identify it better okay
apart from this let's say if you have to
perform this transaction on a priority
then you have the option of setting it
on priority but that means I have to
again reset it and then here you can see
that the estimated time also changes
this gets confirmed between zero to
sixty minutes and this taking again sub
transaction fees of forty one rupees so
it's not much when I consider the
standard transaction fees that buying
stick okay so what I'll do is I'll set
it on priority and I'm initiate this
transaction okay just click on send
bitcoins
and the transaction is being processed
come back to Jax and let's wait now if
you see here the transaction has been
hided and my Bitcoin wallet has been
updated with respect to that safe but
there's one thing here it tells me that
this transaction is not confirmed that
is there's a specific time that it takes
for it to get country so this has to be
verified and validated and has to get
added to the blockchain and only then
will this transaction get confirmed so
again as we see this heartbeat set as a
priority and it may take somewhere close
to one hour at marks to get confirmed
now this is just the maximal situation
there are times where it gets confirmed
instantaneously as well okay so let's
just keep waiting
now one thing you can do to check the
status is to go to this arrow mark here
and you can see we block confirmation is
still pending so to get more info just
click on this and you will get
redirected to the page which gives you
the update with respect to the status so
here you can see it requires three
confirmations with respect to that same
and it's still not yet confirmed so if
you click on View Tree chart we will
show you how the transaction is being
converted and how it has to get verified
so let's wait for the final confirmation
and then let's conclude the session
okay so if you see here the transaction
has been confirmed and if you check in
Jax you can find the Bitcoin wallet has
been updated with respect to that same
okay so let's go back to our slide and
let's conclude the session
we first talked about the current
existing banking system as well as the
various issues that were there as well
as we talked about how Bitcoin and
blockchain system can solve these issues
then we moved on to talk about the
various blockchain concepts and how
blockchain can help you achieve the
solution to this then we talked about
Bitcoin transaction as well as the
various blocks it features and finally
we saw a use case and a demo on
blockchain transaction so any doubts
with respect to today's session any
questions that you would like me to
answer
okay seems like you guys are quite clear
