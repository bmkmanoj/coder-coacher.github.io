are the various ways of storing
information under the device so if you
all remember right so the Android
storage comes up in four segments one is
the internal storage then the other one
is the external storage then we have the
shared preferences and finally we have
the sequel I'd database there are two
ways of storing information under the
device all right first as my application
rights information on to the internal
storage can anybody tell me what is the
internal storage folder here if you all
remember I told you about a folder which
says data data am I wrong here if I say
that the data rate of hula is my
internal storage for the application am
I wrong here to say here I say SD card
right so I say the data data folder is
the one that is actually where my
application resides right so whenever I
talk about an internal storage I mean
that my application will make use of the
data that is present inside its folder
structure I hope everybody gets it
correctly it's like the data that is
present inside its folder structure is
the one that I talk in terms of internal
storage however sometimes what happens
is that I need to have data which is
huge in memory for example I am making
use of or sake clicking images I am
clicking images i'm picking images on
our device that is holding a camera of
eight megapixels in that case if i am
trying to hold an image an image of mine
will be consisting of around 3.5 to 4 mb
is that correct whenever I use the
device camera which is having a very
high resolution camera I might be
getting the images which might be of the
size 3.5 to 4 MV right so should I be
storing those images inside my internal
storage or should I be storing goes in
is onto my external storage is my
question for everyone ratchet says
internal promises external all right
Richard and provide tell you the pros
and cons of both alright if I do it lose
a store of these images under the
internal storage it is going to make my
application slow first thing and
secondly it will load my application
with some data I hope that is correct
now if I talk about the external storage
saving then in that case if I do it on
the external I'm not loading my
application and not in a way my
applications performance is very good
but only one condition matches here
which says the user has access to the SD
card or the external storage so whenever
the user can delete any file my
application might get crashes I hope the
difference is clear to everyone between
the internal storage and the external
storage proper ratchet with the monster
need anyone having any doubt chef let's
close this up and now let's talk about
the internal storage first of all so as
I said you can save files directly on
the devices internal storage by default
whatever files that you are saving to
the internal storage are the ones that
are private to your application dollars
they are private to the application
because they reside inside the
application folder that the application
folder where the application resides is
inaccessible to the user right so when
whenever the user uninstalls your
application these files are
automatically remove I said whatever the
application gets an uninstall these
files are automatically removed all
right that's correct with them on what
the man says the memory gets cleared
because the reason why it the memory
gets cleared as whenever you have an
application uninstalled the complete
application folder gets removed from the
memory all right so that is why at all
so gets wiped off how are we going to
use it up first of all you will be going
to call an open file output method with
the name of the file and the operating
mode so the operating mode has to be
like if you want to read the file if you
want to write the file if you want to
append any piece of information to an
existing file so these are the various
codes of operations that we can work on
so that this returns a file output
stream so this particular open file
output method it does to you a fire
output stream and you can write or say
read anything on to the file output
stream let me show you an example for
this go on of the internal storage is
here let me go back to main am I hope
everybody can see this may not exhibit
failure so I'm having a text box I'm
having a text view which is holding the
name then I'm having an edit text which
is holding the input for the name and
I'm having a phone number which is
molding the pitch will be holding the
phone number then I'm having a button at
the bottom which says save information
right so whenever I will be clicking on
this button save information I'll be
storing something back onto the internal
storage now let's go here on an internal
storage file I have few text views here
I have if you all see here in my main
door XML I have also placed to text view
at the bottom which is not holding any
text at present because that I will be
reading back from the internal storage
and then showing out on with the help of
these text views right I create to text
views text you name and number so these
are the ones that will be used to see
back information whatever has been read
back from the file system create the
necessary but button references create a
text rename textfree number here i have
created a mutt method which is going to
read the file for me alright so i will
just commend this method because first
all we have to write something out of
the file then only we will be reading
that from it so have the button safe
click listener inside the button save
click listener what am i doing is I'm
just checking whether the phone number
that has been encoded is greater than 10
digits or not if it is greater than 10
digits only then I'll be moving inside
otherwise I'll just phase of toast
notification and i will return from here
I say name number being picked up from
the Edit boxes right then i create a
bufferedreader object all you can see is
a bufferedwriter object here so i have a
bufferedwriter object inside the
bufferedreader object i give it a new
bufferedwriter which is going to take as
an input the open file streamwriter open
output stream rider alright so this
opened out this new open output stream
rider if you see here it does me an open
output screenwriter right inside this
I'll be opening a file for output mode
alright so here I say I open a file
which is user info alright i open a file
to write something on to the file so i
have given it a name which says user
info here i'm using a mood the more that
i'm using here is the world more try
table so that everybody can write on to
this file system all right let me know
if there is any query here tell these in
these two lines all right rajat says
please explain the bufferedwriter so
whenever we write something on to a file
system ratchet we actually write it buy
it buy buy so the object that we make
use of in order to write any information
out of the file as the bufferedwriter so
that i just write it buffer byte by byte
so that i have some buffer i write that
before i have some bupa write that but
buffer so it's like whenever a flight
file is being written and is always done
with the help of a byte array i hope
this is clear to you now Roger so here I
say a buffer turn right at object do or
right on the buffer a rider object right
what write the name that is being picked
up and then
adding an end of line separator so the
end of line separator is the new line
separate or series / in all right
similarly I do a writer dot right number
plus the end of line separator again a
slasher / after the number once I am
done with the writing I say just close
the right off of me alright so that is
what I'm doing here I hope this is clear
to everyone any person having any doubts
here any person having any queries any
questions it's go here then and let's
run this up so now I i think i can close
the second emulator because it was
actually open up only to show prabhas
example here
here i have the internal storage right
so let's give it a name so example i
give so many same here i can give any
contact number if i try to save
information it will raise a toast
notification because my number count is
less than 10 right so here i say 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 and 0 right click on save
information it will save the information
for me alright once i have the saved
information where high where I have to
find it up all right where can I use
phone in text fields any UI in that case
I think there is an option let me just
go here
if you see here there are various input
types all right so i can just choose the
one to them here if you see here problem
i can choose the 144 nail all right
let's depart now alright alright so in
this case it will take only inputs for
the phone number let me show you that
can we also write directly using the
file output stream Sameer all right so
Nina's asking me here can we use it
directly using the file output screen I
have to check that so maybe has never
done that alright I have to check that
because i always use it up with a
preferred writer so here i say and now
if you see here all right i'll just
since this does not support the virtual
keyboard in this case of snow up I it
will open up only the input mode where
then you can just key in the numerical
or say the numbers all right in this
case whenever the virtual keyboard will
be getting open up it will show you only
numbers because the input name is for
all the inputs right I click on save
information what is that one two three
movers all right I have messed one
number here all right as I click on save
information now it will save information
for me now let's go into the DDMS
perspective here alright go on to file
explorer here go on to data and under
the data will find another folder which
says data then we have to find out the
package all right the package that we
working on is comedy is not samples
here we go we have the files information
so this is the file that I had written
user info let's pull this out let's pull
the smile out go onto my desktop here
let's open this file up with the word
pattaya and you can see that the
information that is getting saved or the
filers the name and the number alright
so we have written back information onto
the file but we haven't read back from
it so let's see the reading back
information from the file system alright
so in order to read back I have to
uncomment this read align the foil
method here which i will just uncomment
i'll just show you what am I doing here
whatever I am doing for writing
something on to the file system I will
be doing just the opposite of it in
order to read back from it I'm saying
instead of the bufferedwriter but which
object am I you using is buffered reader
right I am instead of the output stream
reader i will be using a object which is
inputstreamreader right open file input
just the name of the file because now i
do not want it to have anything from the
right table mode I just want to read the
file information create a string of a
parameter line here create a counter
object alright so the counter will be
the one that will be holding the number
of lines that i am reading back from the
file system i say while i equal to read
it dot print line that is i'm having
something one of the file i'm reading
till the time I get a null file dollars
file is empty de all right so I place it
up in the line where it wearable so it
is a single line being pinned up very
single first every single time I check
whether my counter is equal to 0 my
counter is equal to 0 that means i am
reading the first line
right so I say the first time the first
line that I'm holding up is the textview
name so i am reading back the name from
the first line i'm doing an increment to
the counter so next time the counter
becomes what so when it becomes one what
am i doing is I'm setting up the value
to the textview number because now my
name one is already being picked up
alright so the second value that will be
picked up is going to be of the number
all right because I know that only
contains two lights so that is what my
counterparts let me show you that
and even see that whatever information
was stored in the file system has been
picked up from the file system alright
so I'll let you all take a look at ritas
read the line method if you have any
queries here you can ask me or the chat
window here you go all rights I mean I
guess you were logged off sometime back
so anything that you are not able to
understand you can spawn back onto the
chat window you want me to go through
the writer again the mayor process of
writing information out of the files
ratchet as i said samir i'll just see do
it because i have majorly worked on the
bufferedreader and bufferedwriter was
writing something out of the file system
but i'll just check if i can reuse the
way the parameters that you are talking
about all right and I'll get back to you
on this to not work so we can take talk
about it all rights such as you're
talking about this particular one the
bufferedwriter all right rich it as I
said whenever you have to write some
information on the file system or say
out of auto flat file right so debate it
has done is that you have to write
information on to the file system byte
by byte so that is why we make use of
objects which actually allow us to do
this kind of a phenomena right so a
bufferedreader object what it does is it
buffers of the complete text for me
right and it provides me an output
stream all right if you see here I'll
just open it up for you here can you see
this up it provides you with an out
buffer of 8192 whites all right so it is
riding it might but white onto the file
whenever I call the right method on to
the bufferedwriter so that is what the
bufferedwriter does here
alright any questions till you have you
can still respond back on the chat
window proper rhythm and if you have any
questions you can also respond back on
the chat window alright so let's move
ahead then so we have talked about the
internal storage all right registered or
a null wait for you sameen has again
gone offline I just don't know if there
is any connectivity issues at his end
please explain the stream and the right
method if you see here ratchet what is
being done here is in the output scene
writer if you see here alright I'll just
explain to you in a fourth more better
he killed if you see here it actually
creates a new output stream writer write
as the target stream to write the
converted characters I will get him a
point whatever has to be written out of
the file has to be written with the help
of these output stream writer because it
converts the character onto a byte array
or say a by three Richard alright so
that is what is being done with the help
of the output stream writer and if I
have got the byte stream then I just
call the vital dot white and whatever
value i have to write up on the file
system if you see here file output
parameters one is more readable and
there are many more i'll just show you
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
