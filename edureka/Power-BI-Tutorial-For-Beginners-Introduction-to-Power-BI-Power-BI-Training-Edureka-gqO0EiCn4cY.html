webinar on power bi in this session
we'll be discussing about various
concepts of business intelligence
we'll also understand why to use power
bi when we already have MS bi let me
tell you this session will also include
a lot of practicals and examples of
power bi among our participants here
that is you we have a well rounded
representation across different
geographies including India USA UK
Singapore Middle East we have signed a
who will be taking us through the
session he has a rich experience with bi
and has worked on multiple tools in bi
domain I welcome you sign over to you
now I all wishing a very good morning
good evening and good afternoon to all
of you joining in from across the world
I hope you can all hear me loud and
clear just going and sharing my screen
in this moment get to hear nowadays data
signs all of this has to do with bi so
so it's a very broad domain which kind
of covers all the later technologies
that really like to understand from the
whole class to just to set expectations
up front we are going to discuss power
bi and we are gonna initially start off
with broad concepts of bi at a very high
level I'm going to go ahead and show you
what the overall overview of a bi
project is right we hear terms called
ETL and please understand these are dual
agnostic now many of you would have
worked in different bi tools like you
have MS bi a Max or bi you have tableau
your informatica your ab initio you have
so many BI tools out of the market and
obviously in the visualization
standpoint you have tableau Spotfire
power bi for beer of course and you have
click view there's so many BI tools out
there at the market but the broad
concepts remain the same ETL then we do
reporting data warehouse the
fundamentals of a data warehouse these
concepts remain the same right so the
idea is to first take you through some
of these basic concepts and then
eventually go ahead and get deep into
power bi really to show you the
capabilities of power bi and how power
bi can make business diligence very very
easy because the whole point of bi up to
this point and this is the intersection
of traditional bi and modern bi the
power bi is more into the realm of
modern bi advanced bi where we are in a
self-service bi the way we like to call
it okay but then you have made a great
move from the world of traditional bi
and traditional bi we use tools like
sequel server integration services SSIS
msbi that we call it informatica Cognos
so these kind of software's are
difficult to use right
I mean you invariably have to invest a
lot of money you have to recruit
software engineers and invariably it
what it means is that the next time when
the CEO of an organization wants a
report when the CEO of an organization
wants to report how they performed over
the past ten years
they cannot build that rapport because
Cognos or SSRS
these reporting tools are difficult to
use you know it's difficult to develop
reports if it is not meant for end-users
and this is where a revolution has
happened around visualization and bi in
general where you know tools like alter
X power bi QlikView tableau these kind
of tools are really taken the market by
storm and which is where we we are
slowly getting into the realm of
self-service bi right which is and the
meaning of self-service bi it basically
means you are putting bi in the hands of
the end users so the next time the
management wants to build a report they
don't have to wait for the IT team to
get involved then they just open up the
tool and this is build a report from
scratch this is build it themselves so
that's where that's where if we're at a
very very interesting Junction right now
where VI is so easy and it is so readily
available in the hands of literally
everyone and it which is the reason why
so many of you from different background
you know you may be freshers you may
have worked in the organization or a
different technology but I mean it's
just amazing to see the curiosity around
around bi in general and as I mentioned
that a lot of these terms that we that
we see through being thrown around
machine learning analytics data signs
are no creative analytics all of this is
part of the wider bi canvas okay so I'm
going to go ahead and quickly take you
through a section where I briefly talked
about the msbi and a very basic overview
of what is bi and in general the BI
architecture okay so all of us have an
understanding of what is the data
warehouse right and I just wanted to
bring this up just to give you an
understanding of how additional bi works
and let's take an example of msbi in
general msbi stands for Microsoft bi
okay so how it typically works is and if
I quickly bring this up so this is how
creational bi used to work okay so let's
say your organization ABC and ABC is the
company and essentially so you have
stores around the world and you're
you're a pharmaceutical company let's
say you have retail stores across the
world where you sell your met
okay so you have data that is being
generated so so one two three four these
are all the retail stores and this is
the company ABC right and company ABC
basically a pharmaceutical company and
these are the retail outlets where it's
medicine the medicines that ABC
generates ABC producers are sold so each
of these retail stores will generate
their own data right so retail store one
will have its own data as to at the end
of the day how much of how much of sales
were made retail store two will have its
own data okay at the end of the day how
much of sales were made so that kind of
stuff okay so the idea is that you have
these pockets of data you have these
pockets of data from different different
places you can have hundreds of
thousands of retail stores across the
world and you can think of the enormity
of the challenge right you can think of
the anonymity of the challenges and how
are you going to do any analysis on the
data like tomorrow if the company if the
management of ABC wants to know how have
we performed what has been our total
sales over the past one year you can
imagine how it has to pull in that data
from all these different sources these
are the sources all these different
sources it has to pull in that data and
then finally do a reporting to its
management right you can use any kind of
reporting tool and you know when I say
reporting from now on reporting can be
done even using the simplest of tools
like Excel okay by the way not taking
anything away from Excel and I slowly
get into power B and I'll say how power
bi has gradually evolved from Excel
Excel by the way has very very powerful
reporting capabilities okay
so for some of you who have not exploded
you have some really cool things you can
do in Excel in terms of power view and
power map we'll talk more about those
kind of things when we get into power bi
as such but then this the broad picture
right you're essentially this is where
you're bringing in data from multiple
sources and this is the part which we
call extraction you are extracting that
data from multiple different sources and
you're loading that data into the
company ABC servers okay so this is this
the part which we call a data warehouse
okay and just to give you a more
granular picture of what we are doing
these are all my different sources so
these are all the retail outlets that I
have and these are all the different
sources I have one two three four five
six you're doing the ETL part ETL the e
stands for extraction the T stands for
transformation and the L stands for
loading okay so this is the ETL that you
are doing right you're extracting your
data you're transforming your data and
then you are finally loading that data
into a central data where
house okay why do you need that because
now the data is readily available with
ABC to to its reporting if you're not
done the ETL you can just imagine what
challenges you will be facing so you
will have some data let's say company
retail store a be a retail store one
stores it and an excel file the very
small shock it can be a very small shock
which they don't invest much in
software's or databases and all they
have is an excel file they just have
Microsoft Office and in the store their
data at the end of every day they'll
record their sales in an excel file okay
it's a very simple method of saving data
we say it aloud to has data stored in
sequel server it'll log to 3 as an
Oracle retail outlet for has in db2 and
so on and so forth it'll up I might have
some of these data store in some flat
files ok so there's so many different
kinds of sources are there then we call
it heterogeneous sources the different
kinds of sources of data that you have
and you're trying to pull in all those
different sources you're trying to
extract the data you're trying to do
some transformation and then you're
trying to load the data into a common
format into a sequel server data
warehouse I'm taking sequel server
because I'm just giving an example of
msbi but I mean it can be anything that
that data warehouse that that database
it will be a sequel server it could be
an Oracle it could literally be anything
ok and finally you're doing reporting on
top of it so you ting use the excel
using SSRS using power bi you can use
click view we can use tableau and
finally I think reporting on top of it
so that's the broad picture I don't want
to get too much into the other stuff
right now but I just want to give you a
broad picture as what ETL is whereas the
broad bi
story unfold so this is how this is how
bi works in a broad way so you do ETL
right this is the extract transform load
and SSIS is one such tool right this is
we call it sequel server integration
services ok we use a visual studio shell
to develop an integration services
solution similar other ETL tools are
people would have worked in ab initio
ok ab initio is an ETL tool a very
expensive tool by the way informatica is
an ETL tool ok so you have a lot of
different such ETL tools out of the
market right so you can do to that ETL
na Tien is primarily used to do that
kind of you know trying to you try to
merge that data and you're trying to
bring it in one common format so
transformation is a very very important
part of ETL so E is the extraction T is
the transformation and L is the load and
the objective is basically to take all
that data from different different
sources apply some common business rules
in the transformations and finally load
that stuff into a call
a common platform which we could be a
sequel server it could be an excel
equivalently anything but the idea is to
bring it in one common platform instead
of having them in heterogeneous sources
and finally once you have them in one
common platform it's very easy to do
reporting and now now the company's
management can we can connect to that
data warehouse and they can do reporting
they can easily find out how they're
performed over the past one year a we
call it a single version of truth right
so a lot of different terminologies that
go with data warehouses again I won't
get too much into the details of it but
then this is what we call the single
version of truth so anything and
everything that come that has to do with
company ABC is there in this data
warehouse so people will not go back to
any other kind of source you know if
everything resides in that data we're
also all reporting happens from this
data warehouse that's the ideal picture
right that's that's traditional di so
what I'm explaining to you is
traditional VI this is this is another
another image that I wanted to bring up
and in general this is this is this is
what we have chiara sources you're doing
the ETL and you're loading the data into
a warehouse and in traditional VI you
also have a concept of cubing okay and
finally you are you're doing reporting
from that particular data all right so
that's that's a very broad overview of
BI in general that I wanted to talk
about and just to just to quickly talk a
little bit about some of the value
addition that bi brings to the table so
one of the things that you have is
obviously you have boosting productivity
so it's great for productivity as in I
mean just this example that I showed you
you're having all that data in it at the
tip of the fingertips of your management
right so the management wants to know
that hey what did I how did I perform in
over the last 10 years so you have a
ready-made place you have a ready-made
storehouse where that data is stored and
now you can easily connect that to a to
a reporting tool and you can you can do
visualization from that and just to also
relate it to a bit of practical right
now and even before I get into power bi
per se just to get it a little bit of
practical and just to show you how this
actually works I'll quickly open up my
sequel server management studio and let
me let me show you something cool here
I'll open up a sequence of a management
studio and what I'm going to show you is
I have an adventure works data warehouse
loaded there and I'm going to try to
connect Excel to that adventure voice
and I'm going to show you how how
quickly you can do reporting simply by
using Excel and that's also bi right
that's also bi NID end of the
a you are doing something you're built
you built a database or data warehouse
whatever you want to call it okay that's
another discussion by the way OLTP Ola P
very of online transaction processing
online illogical processing so you're
storing that data and now you're know
you're leveraging your data you're doing
reporting on your data okay so I'm going
to quickly go ahead and connect to my
sequel server just to give just to show
you that adventureworks data warehouse
that I have here right now connected to
my local instance of sequel server I go
to my database you might be wondering
okay all this while I'm talking about a
digital warehouse how did I come into a
database now please understand friends I
think this is where a lot of people get
confused a data warehouse if our
database okay so one of the things I
like to say here is all data warehouses
are eventually databases okay all data
warehouses are eventually databases all
databases may not be data warehouses
right because the platform that we are
right now is sequel server that's an AR
DBMS right it's an AR DBMS isn't it
there's so many other kinds of our DBMS
products out there is db2 does Oracle so
in our DBMS everything in the database
right it's a it's a storehouse of data
now data warehouse is a special kind of
database right so that's that's a very
different discussion where you know
there's a very different kind of
modeling that happens in databases we
typically have the concept of
normalization where you know if 1 and F
2 and F 3 and F we rigorously stick to
the ER model the entity relationship
model whereas in data warehouses you're
really going into the reals of what we
call dimensional modeling so when you
open a data warehouse you still have
tables there's no rocket science here is
nothing alien here you still have tables
just the same way that you find in
databases you can still right-click it
and still do a select optical still
write queries and these are going to be
transact sequel queries because I'm
using sequel server of course ok you can
still write queries but the idea is that
this is a dissertate of warehouse and
you can see very interesting you can see
these are dim fact you can you see the
dims packs and stuff like that yep this
is where maybe the modeling is done very
very differently ok let's dim packed all
right so guys I understand this might
sound a little bit esoteric for some of
you again my apologies if I'm going a
little too fast but then again this is
just to give you guys a background by no
means this is something that we can you
know
cover in a day's time or even hours time
but I just wanted you to give you a big
picture a very big picture overview of
your bi in general data warehouse in
general just to show you what a data
warehouse looks like just to show you
how data warehouse is different from a
database at a very high level and then
finally connected to power bi and how
Power View has improved and what all
stuff what our capabilities power bi has
right so don't try to get too deep into
you know the concepts of data
warehousing it's a completely different
discussion it's a course in itself ok
so let's not get too much into that but
the idea behind opening up sequel server
is just to show you that you know this
is the stuff that you have out here
right and what I'm going to show you now
is how you can open up Excel and how we
can connect to this data warehouse on
how we can generate simple reports right
so the point that we have mentioned here
boosting productivity so this is this is
exactly what we are trying to do here so
I can I can open up a simple Excel
workbook I can go to data you can go to
from other sources you can connect your
local instance of sequel server and you
can see how easy it is to do reporting
ok I select windows authentication I'll
select my picture box data warehouse ok
so you can select multiple tables you
can say enable selection of multiple
tables so probably I want to select my
let's say I want to select my team
product and I want to also go ahead and
select my Packer internet sales click on
next click on finish this we created a
new workbook and essentially is going to
be like a pivot chart that I'm going to
have or you can simply create a pivot
table whichever we want to do it and I
can see I've connected this data from my
adventureworks data warehouse or idea is
that you've done your ETL you store that
data in your database house and now you
are doing reporting on it and here I'm
just giving an example where I'm using
Excel to do that reporting the same
reporting can also be performed by using
tools like tableau you can connect
Spotfire to that data warehouse and you
can also connect power the power bi to
that data warehouse ok but ultimately
what I really wanted to drive here is
that ultimately what you are doing is
you're adding value to the business by
better visualization of the data so so a
you're storing your data properly and B
you're doing good reporting proper
reporting on your data ok I'm going to
go ahead and take sales amount if you
want to analyze your sales based on
color you can see that it's so simple to
do so now all of a sudden you see ok
these are different colored products and
this is how my total sales has worked
across different colors obviously you
can go ahead and build charge different
kinds of charts on this data this is a
pivot table you can give you can
probably keep number one more category
for size and now you can see that I've
broken them out into rows and columns
all right so this is again bi right
because it's boosting productivity so as
a manager as the management of the
company and what I really wanted to
drive here and the reason why I wanted
to show you the excel is because this is
difficult right I mean you can't expect
the management of the company to open up
sequel server 2 and go ahead and write a
query or for that matter you can open up
a difficult reporting tool req sequel
server reporting services or even Cognos
and essentially go back and write a
report there develop a report there it's
not feasible right and this is where
tools like and that's traditional VI and
that's traditional VI traditional VI is
where you have to actually go out and do
coding there are instances very up to
actually literally go ahead and do
coding the light the realm of Excel and
what we have done here is what we what
we call sets of is bi ok this is what we
call self-service bi where it's so easy
to connect your data and it's so easy
for the end user to generate
visualizations the way they want ok so
that's what we really mean by
self-service via and that's was
basically the objective of me to show
you this kind of stuff here so going
back to the slides again obviously to
gain sales and market intelligence goes
without saying helps in winning
customers I mean obviously if you have
good hold of your data I mean if you
can't you can relate to the example of
the pharmaceutical company ABC which has
retail stores across the world I mean if
it has a hang of how it is performing
you know real-time data points of where
it's sales are coming from which stores
are performing the best it knows where
to where to invest its money on so if it
knows retail store 2 is not performing
well it knows that the next time it
invests the retail store 2 is going to
be Stargate so next marketing budget a
major chunk of its marketing budget will
go to was retail store 2 so it does help
a lot in terms of in this kind of
analytics so the whole idea again it's a
broad picture through all these decks is
what we are trying to achieve is that a
bi in general is something that you're
building a building a complete solution
an ETL solution plus a reporting
solution to make to add value to your
business and for the management to make
better decisions and that's where it all
ends so it you're ultimately you're
helping your management may
better decisions through a proper
extraction of data proper storage of
data and proper visualization of data
right and and in needless to say the ROI
if I look at point number five needless
to say the ROI is very very high here
and especially in today's world of sales
of his bi traditional VI was different
traditional bi was where as I told you
you needed people with IT skills you
know you needed people with skills in
people had to understand coding Visual
Studio but but including the
self-service bi world with tools like
power bi coming into the market anyone
can get into this right anyone can build
a quick dashboard so some basic
analytical skills you can start building
some really cool graphics from scratch
and literally in minutes right literally
in minutes you can open up an excel file
and it can literally develop charts maps
in minutes I should actually say second
and I'll show you how it is in second
all right
so actionable information is a very very
important part and this is the reason
where I say better decision-making
ultimately bi is something that that
really enables business to make better
decisions and which is where the term
actionable information is reporting so
you have data you have a huge amount of
data but nothing is useful none of the
data is useful if you cannot use it
right so you have to convert that data
into actionable information based on
which the business can make decision so
any information based on which you can
make decisions is actionable information
right and that's where that is per bi is
really really helpful now coming to
power bi just to just to take a quick
leap into power bi and just to make a
gradual into power bi power bi
first thing a self-service bi okay one
of the best things about power bi is the
IT involvement so previously how it is
to work is as I initially mention it the
business has to build a report it has to
involve the IT team it has to raise a
request the IT team will do its own
requirements gathering it has again the
typical waterfall model you will go
ahead and prepare a report specification
document
today's agile model things are different
but then again there is a lot of IT
involvement where you know they'll be
requirements gathering you have to build
a replica I have to run it through the
user so it's a very cumbersome process I
mean put yourself in the shoes of the
business owner and think about it if you
want something delivered right away you
will not get it because the IT team will
they will have their own constraints
they will have their own priorities and
they will have their own development
effort right so and this is where power
bi and tools like power bi really make
bi accessible to the end users and which
is why I use the term self-service bi
okay it's about making bi accessible to
the end-users just to resume our
discussion here as I was mentioning
machine learning is a big component of
power bi and and again the initially
when I started off I mentioned that
machine learning data scientist at all
these are all components these are all
the broader canvas of BI if you take the
product and was a bi technologies all of
it is a part of BI and machine learning
is is a big part of power bi because it
makes machine learning accessible to
end-users
so all this while you know we hear the
term our you know whenever we have to do
machine learning use tools like RN
Python whether to do complex coding in a
or to know about packages but then
machine learning becomes so much
accessible in power bi and I won't
exactly show you but I'll give you a
basic flavor of I'll give you a basic
flavor of how you can do that kind of
stuff when I get into the demos of power
bi all right so guys just to take a
quick pause right now I've been getting
a few questions at this moment I will
take up a few of your questions we're
gonna have a logical break-in sometime
okay we have a lot of questions that are
coming in I will try to take your
questions one by one so Andrew just to
take you take your question we are going
to see how we can get this slide across
to you all right so we got our come back
to you on that we got to send you a an
email to all of you who have your email
ids we're going to send a process email
to all of you and try to understand how
we can share particular deck all right
so i'm going to come back to you on that
so so krishna krishna had a question
difference between bi and i don't really
have the full question from your krishna
you want to understand tableau is that
what you are trying to understand i mean
power bi on tableau right so power
behind tableau they're both very very
powerful tools I'm not sure how many if
you follow the Gartner survey but power
bi is yet to catch up just to I mean
nothing against power bi but power bi is
a very powerful tool is a very capable
tool but tableau is clearly the market
leader when it comes to BI they know
they know second thoughts about a power
bi is very close to catching up but then
there are capabilities the tableau has
which
no bi tool in the market has today of
course click cents is a tool which is I
mean on a tap are I will say as per
Gartner survey but power bi is catching
up very very fast very very fast ok and
when I talk about power bi and again
this is something that gradually we can
talk about in the slides also when you
talk about power bi and it's not
something that happened all of a sudden
okay you have to understand that power
bi has been there for a long time and
you'd be surprised to know how you'll be
surprised to know how power bi has been
there for a long time because it's only
recently that we get to hear about power
bi right if we surprised to know that
the power bi was there for a long time
how come how come we did not have a
course on power bi the reason is because
no one knew about it I'm sure how you
would have heard the terms power of
query power pivot power view on power
map I'm sure if you have used Excel or
even if you have not used Excel people
you might have at least heard these
terms right if you open up Excel it's a
very simple adding that you have so how
it is to work is in Excel power query
power pivot power views these are all
add-ins if I if I go ahead and open my
Excel to you and again I am using an
Excel 2013 which is a advanced version
but actually it's a 2016 so if you see
in my data pane you have something
called a new query okay I have power
people so I have power papert's added in
but these are these are add-ins that I
have okay these are add-ins that I have
that that used to come in Excel okay and
whenever you have to build a power bi
solution you had to go to excel you know
you have to build your own query using
power query you have to build your own
query and then you go ahead and build a
model you build a model through which
you establish relationships okay so this
is stable it is a stable B this is table
C and then you establish relationships
okay how are these tables related that
kind of stuff you do in PowerPivot
powerpivot is where you define the
relationships between the different
tables and finally you come to power
view and power map where your area
representing that data whether you're
representing that data so these come as
separate add-ins as part of excel and
these are adding starting from 2010
version it started being available to
excel users as add-ins that that's power
bi i mean that that's why power bi
started okay it is only very recent
airing in 2014 is when power bi was
launched where Microsoft incorporated
all these different add-ins so
the historical way in which people used
to build their solutions
Microsoft incorporated these add-ins
into one product which they call the
power bi desktop I talked more about
power bi desktop I'll show you some
demos of some cool stuff you can do this
is what I have the power bi desktop I'll
show you power bi desktop in a while
okay but then this is what it is it's no
different it's no different from what it
was five years back okay
of course they have been improvement
there with improvements in the
performance but but the underlying layer
remains the same it's still power query
still power view it's still power map
and power paper that that makes the
power bi which were nothing but Excel
add-ins right so that's what I wanted to
talk about in terms of the history of
power bi and so soon l absolutely saw
tableau is not bi it is a reporting tool
I think it's a very good point even
power bi you know I did mention I did
mention a few instances where I said
power bi tableau these are all reporting
tools absolutely I think the more at the
more modern terminology that gets
associated with them are visualization
tools right so we call them
visualization tools reporting will be
more from a very traditional bi
standpoint but you're absolutely bang-on
that these are reporting tools is very
limited ETL capabilities okay I talked
about ETL extract transform load where
you do a lot of transformations a lot of
data churning that kind of capability is
still very very limited in in power bi
and even tableau tableau stream being
the market leader has very limited
capabilities in terms of ETL the
specifics of transformations and data
turning capabilities okay and and which
is where there is still a huge amount of
dependence on tools like informatica and
my MSB IMS bi is also hugely popular
just for that ETL part just for this ETL
part I think it's still hugely popular
so just to perform this part to bring
your data to do that ETL and to load it
into a data warehouse is still use tools
like exercise informatica ab initio and
stuff like that once you have your data
here there that's where the real power
of you know excel tableau and all the
reporting visualization tools come in ok
so not exactly that I mean again power
bi will not exactly be very limited in
capability is still very advanced so a
lot of stuff which you could not even
have imagined you could have done you
can still perform and as I will show you
it has very very good recommendation
capability so you can just you know take
the data set or
matically tell you stories about your
data as you can just just upload a table
just tell power bi okay here is my table
and Paul will automatically generate
visuals for you which which probably
will be unimaginable even a couple of
years back and as that's what the
machine learning component really comes
in and this where we we were discussing
about the machine learning flight that's
what the machine learning component
really comes in so it is able to predict
just by looking at your data it is able
to predict how your data should look
like if we look at a few of those kind
of demos also going forward you know in
a while just trying to take up a few of
your other questions here all right so
Danna Danna is a system administrator so
hi Jana power bi is your first bi
interest I think we have a lot of folks
who are picked up and this is where the
real power of for self-service bi lies
you know it really makes bi accessible
to everyone I mean you may not be from a
bi background and the reason why I
really started with traditional bi it's
not to not to really discourage you but
just to give you the broader picture I
wanted to also involve folks who have
worked in bi but for those who have not
worked in bi who have no understanding
of bi you don't understand what is the
fact table dimension tables it's
absolutely fine is great to know it but
with basic analytical skills you know if
you have a basic understanding of data
if you have a basic Asiatic sense of how
to represent your data I think you can
you can make an amazing career out of
out of data visualization in general
which is which is by the way a
tremendously valuable skill in today's
market ok it's one thing to it's one
thing to store your stuff here where you
can see nice and it's a nice SMS
management studio or you can open up
toward an Oracle where you can you can
interact with your data to sequel
queries but for the management this
makes no sense you know they they hate
this kind of stuff what they like our
cool charts cool graphs you know give
some maps interactivity that's the kind
of language they speak and that sort of
skills anyone can pick up and those are
the kind of skills which are hugely in
demand in today's market so something to
answer your question power bi is for
business analysts not for a developer
well um I'll try to take that little
differently power bi something which is
meant for all kinds of users so a it is
definitely meant for business analysts
your bank on there you get your data
points you give your data so a data
analyst can look at you that data and
they can basically I mean business
analysts will have an understanding of
how to present the data
there's business analysts of people who
have domain knowledge they know how to
best represent their data right
so absolutely business analysts that are
primary user group right but even
developers have a lot of value to
identify our bi right so how are
developers involved because you have AP
is where you can actually do custom
coding
I'll show you there's an are visual
ready can actually do a lot of custom
visualization can build custom
visualizations so indeed it's it is a
paradise for developers if you really
have an interest to get deep into that
that aspect so it's a tool which is
basically for literally for all kinds of
user groups yep so self-service bi does
not really limit it to business analyst
all right so moving back to the decks
and this is what I'm really meant by
machine learning I'm going to come back
to this part when I show you the power
bi service and getting to the demos
exactly what kind of machine learning
stuff you can do but broadly that's what
it is I mean it's really suited for
machine learning you have all your data
and using power we have to connect to
that data and it makes machine learning
easy it's very easy to and just to give
an example just to give you a very
simple example right now you might have
heard the term linear regression okay a
people who would have done data science
who would have studied data science
before or who would have worked in data
science before you might know linear
regression yeah it's very easy to do
linear iteration in R okay you don't
need to write any kind of code for that
purpose so all you do is build a line
chart so you have your trend for the
past five years so let's say you have
sales values for the past five years and
you want to predict how will you perform
in the next year that is something which
is a default feature in our just it's a
default feature in power bi where you
just go there and you have a prediction
tab where you can just go ahead and
enable it and that's a linear iteration
done so it shows you exactly how much
you're going to sell in the next year
again it's predictive analytics it's
linear regression there's a huge amount
of mathematics that goes around it which
is of course a different domain
altogether but then going by a simple
linear regression where you know just
trying to kind of look at past five
years data and plike trying to plot the
next year by arriving at the y-intercept
and the slope I mean that that's
something that power bi gives to you by
default okay
that's a very simple example of machine
learning I want to take but still that
still that's really an example of
machine learning right mobility you have
something called power bi mobile where
you build a dashboard in power bi so you
have the power bi desktop component
where you build your dashboard
okay so this is the desktop component
that I showed you this is the text of
component where you build your dashboard
then you upload that dashboard you can
basically upload that - go to something
we call a power bi service right so just
to just to take you to that architecture
briefly this is what we call the power
bi service right so a power bi com so
the way it works is when you folks try
to access this link for the first time
you may not have power bi service enable
because you have to create an user
account okay so how it's going to work
is you have to create an user account
for the very first time again I can go
ahead and show this to you just in a
while how it works and just so that you
guys can also practice you know any in
your own time it's really cool I really
encourage all of you to go ahead and you
know spend some time here you have to
create a user account you can see that
when I go to power bi dot microsoft.com
it's basically change you can you can
see AB dot power bi comment now is power
bear at microsoft.com it takes you to
the default link click on sign-in and
when you try to sign in it will ask you
for your credit credentials right or if
you don't have it then you can you can
enter your work email address so make
sure this is very important you can only
do it using your work email address ok
it will not allow you to enter a gmail
address or an Outlook or hotmail or and
Yahoo that won't allow ok it has to be a
work email address or and/or an
educational institution if you're part
of an educational institution if you
have a college ID email ID you can enter
that ok but Microsoft is very specific
that it they've made it accessible only
for folks from organizations and you
know folks from educational institutions
so you can use it for free ok so note
that outlook Gmail all these are blocked
so you cannot cannot enter those details
here ok so very easy you can use it for
free it's a trial version I think it's
Reiter's for 30 days you can extend your
trial
the free version will be there but it's
pretty easy to sign up okay I want you
to that once you do that this is this is
the space that you get this apology I
service we call it the power bi service
this lives in the cloud ok this lives in
the cloud there's your cloud and so what
you do is you build your stuff here
that's the desktop that's the decline
tool you build your stuff here and you
upload them to the surface
ok that is basically the model of a
power bi and and what you do from here
is all the users all the users are going
to access your dashboards from here so
if at a quick give you the quick picture
again that's your Dex your desktop right
that's just your computer where you're
developing the solution right that's
your that's your laptop where you're
developing the solution that's what we
call the power bi desktop
that's my power bi desktop client tool
after you develop the report you upload
that onto the power bi service I will
probably give the implication of a cloud
that's a power bi service test is in the
cloud and it is from that service that
your dashboard is accessible to all the
end-users okay now those end users can
view your dashboard in different ways so
they can either view your dashboard in a
mobile device or they can view your
dashboard in a browser or whichever way
they want to they can view it but but
broadly the idea is that you have the
power bi desktop and the other power bi
service is the two of the most important
components of power bi okay and finally
the you're making your dashboard
accessible to end-users through links
and now they can access that it is of
the power bi mobile device or through a
browser whichever way they want to
access it okay it's kind of
client-server you can think of it as
your client as your that's your server
so it's servers in the cloud but then
one very very important point to
remember is power bi is it's a cloud
service it is not on-premise okay so
people who will have come in coming from
other kinds of reporting tools like you
know sequel server reporting services or
Cognos that's the first question that
you might have is ok so is this
on-premise I mean is this an on-premise
setup answer is no because this service
this service lives in the cloud
ok so it's a cloud service that's not a
very very important thing ok so the
software the desktop is a client tool
but then the server that the stuff where
the place where your reports are
uploaded that that's still in the cloud
ok unlike other reporting tools like
SSRS and Cognos where you have an
on-premise set up inside the
organization when I say on-premise I
mean to say let's say let's say your
company ABC ok so company ABC will buy
its own hardware they will invest in
their own systems and they will set up
the server in their own company inside
their own premises that is what we call
on-premise ok so company ABC will own
their hardware they'll basically own the
entire set up so unlike that in power bi
you know even if I'm a big organization
like Google if I want to do I want to
leverage power bi for you know Google
stash ports I don't have the option to
have an on-premise set up I still have
to upload my stuff in the in the power
bi service ok and that has been one of
the one of the major limitations of
power bi in general where it's still not
on-premise and something is in the works
and you know it's still
it's been a service so lot of data
security for CIOs particularly get very
very nervous where whenever concept of
you know uploading your data on to the
cloud comes up because you can see that
you're developing all your stuff here
but ultimately you're you're uploading
all your stuff to the cloud and whenever
things when whenever people talk about
the cloud there are always questions of
data security that comes in I mean
there's a lot of improvements around it
a lot of stuff you can do and it's not
exactly the data is insecure but then
still that mindset where power bi has
not been able to separate so even even
tableau even QlikView you know it these
have their own server setups in a
tableau you have the tableau server
version you have the tableau online
version but you still have the tableau
server version it still has the
on-premise variant but all bi does not
have a power bi is completely a cloud
service that's another very very
important distinction between some of
the other advanced visualization tools
and power bi where lags in the race it
is still a cloud service and people
don't like the cloud okay people like
you and me we love the cloud because you
know it's easy for us right if you have
to do some development just go up to the
cloud and I'll put some stuff together
put it up there show someone and that's
if your work is done but for an
organization I mean the cloud that's not
a way to work right you need a dedicated
service you need to control security you
need to own everything but that's not
the case in the cloud service right so
so you don't own the cloud Microsoft
owns the cloud right and Microsoft has
access to your data and that really
makes people nervous all right so that's
that's a very broad overview of of the
very basic III component of power bi the
power bi desktop and the power bi
service so to answer your question
vamsee absolutely you can
so bumpy's question is so other
dashboards accessible only to the cloud
so that is you need web access well yes
and no so I mean again I'll just quickly
show you a few demos where
accessible to the cloud absolutely yes
so you can even upload your - ports here
and you can share the links with other
users and they can they can obviously
access that through the web ok and as I
said it could be either consumes with a
browser or you have something called
power bi mobile so once you go to the
you know the power bi service once you
have the service up and you have to
create the account just the way I showed
you a while back if you got this
downloads button and you can get your
power bi text off from here so cities
are all free downloads once you have the
service off you can you can basically
download these stuff for free so just to
briefly talk about a few of these
component so one is of course you have
the power bi desktop which is the client
tool data gateway is basically used for
refreshes scheduled refreshes so let's
say you're connecting to an on-premise
sequel server okay so far bi one of the
great features of power bi is it can be
used to connect to a whole variety of
sources okay if I just go ahead and
quickly show you what kind of sources in
connect to so I just give you a demo in
a while but then it can connect to a lot
of different sources and the sources can
be on premised they can be SAS sources
they can be as your cloud so different
kinds of sources any kind of source you
can imagine Bobby I can connect to it as
one of the real benefits of power bi
okay and data gateway is basically used
for scheduled refreshes okay so if you
are connecting to a cloud source if you
are connecting to any kind of source
which lives in the cloud it could be a
flash source and as your whatever cloud
source you have you don't need a gateway
you can still schedule a refresh and
that refresh will happen without you
installing you know any additional
components but then especially if you
are trying to connect to an on-premise
set up and I say on-premise and let's
say if you're trying to connect to a to
a local instance of sequel server or an
Oracle database in those kind of
scenarios you need a data gateway to
schedule your refreshes so what do I
mean by scheduler refreshes so your
dashboard lives on the cloud right you
have uploaded your reports here so
everything lives in the cloud and now
tomorrow your data has changed but you
want your reports to refresh
automatically so that is what a
scheduled refresh is all about okay make
sense so so you want your data you want
your data here to be to refresh
automatically or to be in sync with your
original database let's for the data
gateways use but probably for mobile
again as I said if you want to be on a
mobile device you can download it here
Bob Bob we are publishing for excel is a
very close integration between Excel and
power bi okay you can actually go ahead
and insert your I don't know component
in I don't have the component installed
here but if you have the component
installed you will see an option here
when you build something when you build
some reports you will see an option
where you see publish to power bi so
this is basically what it means so you
can directly upload power bi to power bi
from excel and which is where Microsoft
is trying to really close the gap you
know between power bi and Excel so for
instance I mean if you can bring excel
dashboards to power bi and
- RBI - supposed to excel and eventually
the kind of the big picture will be to
make them one of the same product okay
that's some of the things that I want to
talk about at a very high level the
decks that are really things that we
have mostly covered I'm still going to
go ahead and talk through it
anything additional stuff is there so
obviously the lower upfront costs and
one of the one of the reasons why we say
a lot up front cost is because you're
not really investing in a complete set
up right all that you are paying for is
a very nominal fee per month okay
because you're just using the service on
the cloud you're not really paying
anything for the additional software so
just just then the reason is because the
cloud service okay it's a cloud service
you're not really paying anything for
the server you don't have to already
invest money in a complete server box
and you know invest money you know in a
management team invest money you know in
an administrator team to take care of
your server the upfront costs are lower
because you know the server is with
Microsoft Microsoft maintains the cloud
and you don't have to pay anything for
that so all you pay for is that you pay
a very nominal fee I think the the fee
right now it stands at nine dollars per
user per month I think nine point nine
nine dollars per user per month that's
all you pay for proper getting a full
license on the cloud so can power bi
connect to redshift absolutely yes it
can and I'm going to just give you a
brief idea you know in just in a while
what the capabilities and what kind of
stuff you can credit to API so
integration I touched upon this
customization and user friendly very
very user friendly indeed one thing I
did want to cover here think of Cortana
integration this is a very very very
nice neat feature that you have in power
bi in case you are wondering what is
Cortana Cortana is very similar to
Google's Google now an apple CD I'm sure
you guys will be familiar it is a
personal assistance right and Cortana is
Microsoft's Microsoft's personal
assistant right Windows 10 you get it in
Windows 10 by default so it has a very
close integration with power bi so you
can directly from within Cortana you can
query stuff like okay what was the sales
for the past 10 days I mean it's
literally very very cool stuff you can
do with Cortana there job trends I
already talked about the you know the
the future of power bi is very very
bright right now especially has picked
up a lot so needless to say that it's an
extremely extremely
hi in-demand tool in the job market
today we have talked about this in
general I think there's this basic
visualization concepts right so
aggregating data visualization data
sharing data which is the power bi
service component and analyzing data
which is again so these three components
are basically part of your reporting and
this is basically more the
administration part where you're sharing
your data setting user access who you
want to share with create groups create
workspaces and stuff like that
who has permissions to edit your
dashboard and stuff like that so some
people answer your question what is
Cortana Cortana is like it's like a
personal assistant so you can ask some
cool questions like when do I have my
next meeting and Cortana will tell you
when you have your next meeting okay so
it just like just like Google now just
like Apple CD so if you ask Apple Siri
some kind of question okay I mean how
far is yeah got it yeah I'm sure you
would have used Siri at least I've heard
of CD is very similar to that it is
quite a nice Microsoft product it's not
as popular as some of the others but
then it's catching up yeah different
uses of power bi is something that we've
talked about the probably is really
targets all kinds of user groups
components of power bi something that we
briefly mentioned this comes from the
history of power bi basically where
these are all extant components for
query power pivot power view and power
map by the way power query I do want to
mention one thing that it's a very very
powerful language that it uses behind
the scenes that is called the M query
language okay so I M as in Mumbai M if
we call it the M query language let us
all that they call it is no there's no
full form for it okay and it's a very
very powerful query a query language
that Microsoft has to query and
transform a lot of these data sources
okay so you can actually do a lot of ETL
using power query you'll be surprised to
know and we were just now discussing a
while back that you know the
capabilities of ETL are very limited
indeed they are if you compare it with
you know top-end ETL tools in the market
today like you know informatica SSI
years then the capabilities are indeed
limited but then when you use things
like power query you get a lot of stuff
I mean you can actually do a lot of
coding and literally nothing is out of
reach so in that way it is still a
pretty pretty good ETL tool okay power
bi service probably a Q&amp;amp;A probably a Q&amp;amp;A
is a very very good feature I'll show
this to you again so what happens is it
uses natural language query you know
and generate information about your
about your data so you can you can
probably upload a data center power bi
and you can ask questions like what are
my seals for the past ten months and
probably I will automatically give you a
report just imagine how powerful and how
machine learning is working there okay
so it can predict just by looking at
your sentence it knows what you're
asking and it will it will just churn
out the dashboard just from us in simple
sentence so if you just ask us power bi
give me the sum of sales give me the
give me the sales over the past ten
years power bi knows that over the past
ten years the line chart it's a trend it
will give you a line chart automatically
display that chart for you so it's a
very very powerful feature we're going
to look at some of those things in a
while
absolutely absolutely and also Q&amp;amp;A
school only the data is model correctly
so which is a very very important point
also so if your data modeling is not
right
Q&amp;amp;A can go for a toss absolutely correct
yep so these are stuff we have we've
talked about real time updates so
dashboards popular SAS Solutions s means
software as a service so the power bi
can actually connect to a lot of these
kind of SAS sources like scene sports
and stuff I'm going to going to show you
all the different other sources you can
connect to and these are real time ties
put updates or whenever and this is
again applicable only when it is
connecting to SAS sources or on any kind
of cloud sources so whenever data
changes it can automatically update but
then if it's an on-premise or so you
will still need to go ahead and set up
the data gateway data gateway something
we looked at awhile back okay and this
is what we are mentioning here so secure
live connection to your data sources
on-premises and in the cloud so you can
connect to data on the cloud it can also
connect to data in reciting on-premises
like sequel server database and stuff
intuitive data expression using natural
language query that's basically Q&amp;amp;A and
it does have a very close integration
with Azure and stop okay
process in power bi we've basically
talked about this in a brief way so you
look at your data you do the ETL ETL is
basically performed using the power
query okay and just going to show you
what power query is in a why and just to
just to also give you a brief idea about
power bi a text or Excel just come back
in a way just to just to show you just
to open this up and this is why power bi
text I'll quickly fire this up so just a
while back we were discussing about
power query power paper power
you and power map these for the Excel
components right and we have evolved we
have evolved it the power behind us so
we talked that those were those were
what existed a couple of years back
right but Microsoft what they did is
they packaged all of that into the power
bi desktop tool and now you don't live
no longer have something called a power
query you don't have something called a
power paper of course they are there in
Excel you can still do that stuff in
Excel but the bundled all of that in
power bi desktop and that's what they
marketed as a separate product and this
is what you get is the power bi desktop
the first page that you will see when
you try to login for the first time is
what you will see and you can click on
get data when you click on get data you
can see the wide variety of sources that
are available here okay so this is your
power bi desktop the first view of your
power bi decks and we can see there's
this huge collection of sources you can
connect to the files all the defect of
the files databases as your online
services you know some of the SAS
services that you have Salesforce Google
Analytics Facebook data you know you can
basically if you know your Facebook ID
to put in your credentials and you can
you can analyze your Facebook data a
Twitter data is also there a lot of
stuff you can do here okay
so Google Analytics with say of a
Facebook page and you want to analyze
you know how many hits and stuff
happened so you can even quickly build a
dashboard out of that line charts how
many user hits happened yesterday how
many happened today you can do a lot of
cool analytics there and one more very
very interesting thing that I'll show
you in a while this is very limited so
you can see the on number of online
services are still pretty limited here
I'll show you from from the service and
the power bi service you get even a lot
more options so we just show that you
know why but this is on the desktop you
can get your data and you can still have
access to so many services the same
stuff you can perform from the service
also if you click on get data click on
services and you can see a much more
wider selection of things here okay you
can see does the oh these are all the
different sass sources that I have out
there okay
we call them content packs this is the
call content packs so when you when you
see when I click on get data it is the
content pack libraries it is a pre build
dashboards which someone has developed
for us in also it is a dashboards along
with datasets that someone has
configured for us and all that we are
doing is we're just connecting to that
stuff and I just want to show you as you
can see this
so much this so much so so probably a
desktop you tend to do it from probably
index to the options are limited you
still have some of the same information
here but then the options are pretty
limited here but then if you try to do
it from the online service from the
online service you have a lot more
different options I wanted to give you a
quick example just to and so far we've
been discussing and talking and talking
but I just wanted to show you something
I wanted to click on Bing and want to
show you something really cool here so
being when you click on get now so what
we did here was very wet to services and
whatever you want again just click on
get now so let me go to Bing here real
quick on the magnetics of internet
search activity really cool stuff and
and maybe you want to look up something
I mean I don't know I mean you might
want to look up something maybe you want
to look at Microsoft you want you might
want to know how many people search for
Microsoft across the globe and some
really cool lytx can come up just click
on select Microsoft anything any search
term that you want to include click on
add and and essentially this dashboard
Microsoft has already developed for you
and all that you want to see is
pre-built dashboard being being
generated for you yep you can click on
go to dashboard and you can see that you
know in in a matter of seconds you get a
get a pretty good dashboard from
Microsoft it's really cool the activity
that you're seeing right now yeah you
can see the 20,000 hits literally by
tyne okay it's a dashboard that you're
seeing and the still haven't go to the
internals of the report and so you can
see that there's a high-level view how
many hits happen last week week over
week change 3.7 percent increase this
week top languages in which people have
searched
ok obviously English is the majority 69%
because it's a treemap I will talk about
few of these things in a while we call
this a tree map ok you can see a New
Spain which is directly querying data
from the net is showing you its news
items and finally of a map chart a very
beautiful map chart where at the darker
the color the more the hitch okay
the darker the color the more the hits
also very clearly people from the United
States and Europe have searched for
search for Microsoft the most ok yep
so you can probably click on India and
you might want to know more about India
and just interactivity probably is
disabled yep so it's where you can build
a very quick quick - port here in power
bi
alright so very simple to remove their
sports you can set Chico here you can
remove it but then let me keep this for
the time being and quickly come back to
the
and this is what I wanted to show you
basically in power bi and slope under
the desktop here and you can see the
three tabs mainly the three components
so first is your data pane it's the data
pane second is the relationships pane
and the third is your report pane and
again it might be a little confusing for
all of you initially especially if
you're starting out to understand what
is the desktop what is the service I
understand it might be a little
confusing but just remember that desktop
is where you do your you know heavy
lifting all your heavy all your heavy
development happens in your desktop the
service is where you're doing very
lightweight development okay service
still has amazing capabilities to
develop reports okay if I should quickly
show you can still go to the service you
can still click on a dashboard you can
still click on edit remote and it you
can still build charts and graphs using
this okay
so I'm in the service it just imagines
the cloud service it's a SAS software is
a service so you can access your
software you can acts certain things
directly from the cloud without
installing that in your desktop but then
the capabilities and are very limited ok
if you want to do some more powerful
modeling and stuff you need to use the
text of tool and which is where you have
the data pane and data pane is like your
power query this is where you are
getting your query your doing the
extraction this is your cases the
extraction and transformation layer is
the E and T of the DL extraction
transformation where you're getting your
data and you're transforming your data
and the relationships tab is like a
power paper so this is your power pivot
where your modeling put is your modeling
tab okay and finally the reporting tab
lists the reports where you're
developing visualizations which are your
Power View and power map so that's where
the components have been replaced by
okay so in Excel we had we had something
called get and transform data so which
is again something that you might find
in 2010 version you had something called
get and transform data which we are in
excel and which is not which is what we
call the data pane or queries window in
power bi relationships is what is power
pivot and reports is what was initially
for view and power map that is how those
add-ins have changed into the complete
package power bi text of tune oh great
questions on deep do we can we have
self-service ETLs well it's already
there in the market I don't know how
many of you have heard about the tool
called all tricks altered X is a very
very powerful ETL tool by the way I mean
just incredible in terms of escape
and I don't think from my understanding
from my experience I don't think there's
any competition to Alteryx in today's
market right now the adoption is very
less the adoption is very less but then
all tricks is indeed an amazing tool an
amazing tool yeah I mean I would
definitely recommend you guys to I mean
if you can learn it wonderful I mean
it's again a kind of ETL to ETL when you
hear of ETL and we hear of tools like
informatica ab initio we think of
complex tools or which you need
developers but then when you use tools
like all tricks use just developing
workflows yeah you're just developing
workflows where you know you're just
saying alright so this sort it just a
bit like a work placing sort and it can
just sort by itself
I mean it is magical it is magical the
kind of stuff you can do in all tricks
yeah all right so as the next steps guys
we're going to have some quick demos
right now I want to take a quick couple
of minutes pause trying to set up my
power bi environment for us to get
started with a few demos right now
I'm going to take a quick pause and
we're gonna get started with demos after
that it's so ETL stands for extract
transform and load high ETL tool I
spelled we had Alteryx so I I spell it
as a SPE ry X I'm going to go ahead and
pick that across the chat window for all
of you to kind of get a hang of that
tool yeah so I call it all tricks all
right so I do have a few questions right
now where I mean folks are trying to
understand its power bi is an extension
of Microsoft bi msbi in a way yes yes
and no because it's not really msbi and
when we talk about Microsoft bi we
really mean to say max obeah is more
from a very traditional platform it's a
very traditional stack of tools which we
call msbi
you know if you have heard of the terms
SSIS sssss RS sequel server integration
services a sequence of analysis services
and sequel server reporting services
they're basically part of the MS
bi-stable
but then a power bi is a very different
it's part of the Microsoft stack of
course I mean is part of the Microsoft
stack of BI tools but then it's not
really an extension of MSP I won't I
won't really say that it's not really an
extension of msbi by by any means
because here the 2016 version of a
sequel server that got released
a few months back I don't know how many
of you follow sequel server deeply but
it's an amazing product I mean if you
have seen SSRS if you worked in sequel
server reporting services before that
the capabilities that sequel server 2016
SSRS 2016 prints to the table are
immense are just just amazing kind of
stuff you can do and if you know
Microsoft acquired datas in a few years
back and a lot of capabilities of data
ended up coming to SSRS product in the
2016 release so so in that way they are
separate products I mean please
understand SSRS it's a very different
kind of mindset it's tabular reporting
ok it is more like reporting from a very
reporting standpoint not very
exploratory standpoint but then when he
comes to power bi this were from we come
together from a very exploratory
standpoint stress analytics as we call
visualization so so they're two very
very fundamentally different schools of
thought okay all right so coming to a
few other things that I wanted to cover
all right so that that's my power bi
text off file that I have open just now
probably a text up I've opened at this
moment hope you can all see my screen
back and science command you just to
quickly go over it again as my data tab
as my relationships tab and that's my
that's my report tab and I have a few
data sets that I have created here for
you I wanted to show you a few things
and maybe later on if you get some time
I'll touch upon it and this is what I
wanted to start off by saying how to
easily import data into power bi so this
is the GDP data that I have you can see
this my country Y is here Y GDP data
that I have yep very simple there is it
CSV file okay and I can very easily
import the data into power bi and how do
I do that
and no matter of seconds literally in a
matter of seconds I can generate graphs
and charts from it okay so if you miss
your initial window of get data you can
obviously can always come here you can
get data click on that and we'll take
you to the same get data window so it
all will give you a list of all your
sources in streamline based on file or
whatever other stuff you want to connect
to
so this gets a nice on text or CSV file
yes now when you do that you can change
it GDP is trying to establish a
connection to GDP and you can see that
CSV file it tries to get the origin it
tries to set the delimiter okay can set
a custom delimiter also
by default the delimiters comma okay if
I try to set something else you can see
that the preview will not work correctly
you can see the delimiter is comma the
delimiter is what separates those
columns okay that's what I call a
delimiter so delimiter is comma the CSV
file and the data type detection
basically means that essentially when it
imports that data into power bi these
these will all be columns right country
region year and GDP they will all be
columns so power bi will try to predict
what is the correct data type of that
column so for here for instance will be
text right here it referenced as we did
here it will be a number it will be a
whole number or a decimal number so
power bi will try to predict that based
on the first 200 rows so so the more
data you give so if you say in the
entire data set the performance will
will get compromised so so that's why I
typically it depends again is from a
performance optimization standpoint
against a but then you can say only
entire data sits evaluating the whole
preview it takes some more time but then
the CSV file has very limited number of
rows I can probably to that okay and
then once you're done with that you can
click on edit and when you click on edit
so if this time is still at the query
window is still the gate data window and
the gate data is still power query and
you click on edit you basically be taken
into the the power query interface it's
very similar to the power query
interface where and you can see it opens
up in a different window
it's a query editor okay so this is
where we were initially we clicked on
get data and this is where I am right
now when I click on edit when I click on
edit query this is where I land up and
you might be wondering what is even a
query in the first place
every individual table that you every
individual table and I say table
essentially it so it's a result set that
you put into power bi it treats the
table and that's basically a separate
query we call it a query in power Vapi
or power query terms okay so this is
what a query you can see GDP is what I
imported and that becomes a separate
query
okay so you can do a lot of stuff and
you can see so much of stuff you can do
here and this is this is the complete
transformation layer so we have done the
extraction extraction was gate data and
this is where the transformation layer
so you can do a lot of transformation
stuff here you can see that this ABC ABC
means is the default data type that is
being taken okay if you want to change
it you can give them this click on it
it's so easy you can just click on it
and you can change that effect but it is
on a fairly good job to guess okay it
should be
see this is also ABC that's fine I'll
leave it as it is right they can see
this pretreated as a decimal number this
is so this means a decimal number if you
want to treat it as a whole number you
can go back and convert it directly from
here okay so it's very very easy so you
can see that and trying to change it but
let's just keep it as it is okay so so
this is very simple so you can rename
your columns you can even right click on
it you can rename your columns you can
rename your stuff you can say country
name but I can say country whatever it
is whichever we want to rename it only
the last column doesn't look pretty good
so I'll probably go and rename it in
this call of GDP okay and very
interesting you will see here very
interesting applied steps okay you can
obviously change the name of that whole
query probably can go ahead and set a
GDP underscore data say changing the
name of the whole query now we become
GDP underscore data or you might want to
remove that in the scope calling a GDP
data and you see applied steps at every
point in time whenever you perform any
kind of changes in your query that will
be listed out of steps in your in the
query editor interface so these are
steps you can see the first step was
source second step was used for soil
headers it's an option in power bi you
have an option in power bi to use first
wells headers you can do that but then
power bi is intelligent and sharp enough
to figure out that okay you know what
these are my header rows so let me use
them as header row so it will
automatically do that for you it
automatically applied this step for me
you changed your type if you remember I
went here and change my GDP to I change
my type and finally I rename my column
say at any point in time you want to
remove a step you can just click come
here you can see the remove button you
see her GDP I rename the while back
person last step I want to connect if
you want to cancel that step if I want
to undo I can I can just click on it I
can click on delete and you can see GDP
becomes GDP underscore P P okay I can
come back here I can rename it back and
you can see the new step will be can be
applied a lot of cool stuff you can do
in that way
alright so so isn't that interesting
it's very interesting I believe so you
can see that I have this nothing much to
do I'll show you a few other complex
examples where you can really play
around with your data and try to really
do some more transformations on the
other types of very very simple example
is want to give you a free flavor at
this moment
that city of queries done this together
the query section your edited your query
okay that's a power query section and I
talked about the EM query language if
you want to if you want to add custom
columns and stuff you can you can of
course add a custom column and this is
where you write the EM query language so
when you say add custom column a Kathy
custom custom column formula and this is
where you really type in the EM query
language so it's a completely different
language and you know you can do a lot
of stuff you know typical stuff like
details addition operators a lot of
those things are similar but in a lot of
other capabilities that you have here
okay alright so once you're done here
you can come here you can close an apply
you can close an apply please understand
it's a separate query editor window that
I have it's not exactly power bi text it
opens up as a separate window in
addition to power bi desktop so I'll go
ahead and close and apply my queries so
once that is done it will try to you
know read in so I try to incorporate
those changes pull in your data it is
only when you apply your query will it
try to pull in your data can see they
spread to pull in your data and then
this is my data tab as I said data is
where you are trying to you know get
your data trying to edit your stuff so
this yo get data tab again if you want
to go back and try to edit your queries
again you always have the option to come
up here again see edit queries and you
can go back to that same query editor it
can make your changes here okay
close it I don't want to make any
changes and I can come to the
relationship status the other time I
mention relationships with your power
pivot if there's no real relationships
I'm creating here because this is a
single single table I have here so
there's nothing much I am doing in terms
of relationship slowly give you a few
other examples where I'm going to show
you how we can create relationships in
power bi which is this is where it
really the power bi desktop tool it
really becomes very very important in
terms of its capabilities where you can
do some very complex modeling you can
have 10 15 tables and it can you can
relate them you can do some very complex
modeling here in power bi desktop and
finally other reports tab where you're
basically going to create charts and
graphs
okay they can do something as simple as
and how do you create simple charts here
it is very easy you know creating
visualizations and power bi that's
basically that's one of the main main
usps of our bi access that is visuals
and how easy it is to create visuals in
power bi just to show you just to show
you a few options and just click on
country it is click on country it it
also
matically knows that country is you know
it's just looking at that name of the
column the column name and it
automatically predicts that hey country
is geographical data you know not
exactly saying is geographical data but
it is a political data it's just by
looking at that name column name it's
able to figure out its geographical data
okay
there are ways in which you can
obviously there are ways you can do it
again it's like the advanced discussion
where you can go ahead you can change
your types go to modeling tab you know
you can see that data category the
things you can do here you can to be
more specific and you know for power bi
to be more accurate in terms of data
representation you can always go back
and set this data category tab to you
know a country or a city or whatever you
want it to be okay and to be even more
specific even before coming to this step
you can probably go to the query section
in even before coming here you go to the
edit query section and now you can go
back and say this this get it this is
this is a text write this the text but
you might have scenarios where you have
geographical columns right so so in that
case you might want to go here and I
might put a city or data types that way
all right but then data category is
indeed a very very important thing where
you might want to set it right so
country you might want to come up here
in the modeling tab you might want to
set a data category as as country so now
it knows that that is indeed a country
so so it doesn't make a lot of
difference so Microsoft is I mean is
still sharp enough to figure out you
know countries and it pretty much lists
of the same way but it does make some
difference and and the other thing you
will notice a small blow bike and will
come here by default okay and of course
you can when you click on GDP it is just
display the countries as it is and click
on GDP will automatically try to
incorporate the data here and you can
see some big larger circles here and you
can see that what it basically means is
that the bigger the circles the more the
GDP and how neatly it has done the whole
thing you can set your colors you can
set a lot of different properties here
you can see that right now the the size
you can see that as and when I click on
items you can either click on items here
because he automatically when I click on
it it knows that GDP I want to represent
by size so it automatically brought the
GDP field here but I could have I could
have just tracked and dropped it here
okay so it's very very easy very very
intuitive in terms of how you want to
visualize your data okay if you want to
add some color components to where you
can my go to
GTB of the color saturation field and
now in addition to in addition to be in
a larger in size you're making it making
it color saturating acid on now now the
bigger the circle the bigger the bubble
and the darker the bubble the more the
value is okay so you can set some pretty
cool properties that way there's so many
options you have I mean from general map
perspective is there's a lot of stuff
you can set this is a color scale that
you have of course it's a diverging
scale that you can set you can set a
diverging scale where you know you start
with a minimum of let's say let's say a
blue and then you go to a center point
of let's say let's say your center point
is something like a red and finally your
let's say the higher the value the
greener it is let's say the the lower
the value the redder it is and let's say
the middle point is a yellow and you can
get a pretty good representation here
which all countries are perform well
okay so you can do a lot of that kind of
stuff and you can see how easy it is to
build a dashboard in power bi is a very
simple representation and it
automatically created this map if you
want to change this map to something
else and if you want to change it your
table just click on a table and you
bring up a table for you in a matter of
seconds right in order to do anything
just click on it and it'll automatically
bring it up for you if you want to
change the data into a matrix they won't
represent it in matrix might want to do
that they might want to put it in a
matrix okay matrix would only be more
relevant if you put in something like a
probably something like a region so it's
trying to take some still taking some
type of loading a zero the refreshed
power comes from taking Stillson loading
then we will go and delete it create a
matrix again so I'll probably click
region and this time I'll take country
and I will take GDP and I'll put that
other matrix and you can see now the
representation changes so for each
region
I get data nicely aligned in a matrix
format it's different from a table you
want to look at this data in a table you
can see this table data looks like you
want to look at the same data as a tree
map tree map is again very very suitable
for hierarchical data so the kind of
data that you see here is what we call
hierarchical data so country belongs to
a region right so one region has
multiple countries so if you click on a
tree map is what we call a creamer just
click on it and magically you will see
that you know there's a Central America
and the Caribbean these are all the
countries there and basically the larger
the box
and you can also set a diverging color
scale
there's different color scalars being
used here so probably I can come here I
consider diverging scale data colors and
it can basically set it color saturation
in my butter drag your GDP and you can
set a diverging scale drag and drop by
GDP here and again you can pick and set
your values there right hope this is
making sense hope you'll be able to
understand the real capabilities you can
see that you can drag and drop it's very
simple to configure drag and drop
interface okay and obviously a lot of
other stuff you can do a lot of other
formatting changes you can do and
there's another type of analytics it's
not available for all visuals there are
certain visuals for which you can
perform analytics remember a while back
I was saying that there are certain
kinds of analytics basic analytics is a
comparative analytics you can do in
terms of linear regression and stuff
which you can because you can do on the
fly using power bi and this is the Vista
tab that you can use for it analytics
tab it's not it's not applicable for all
visuals but then they're definitely
visuals for which you can apply it to
and of course you can apply your
saturation you can probably remove it so
let's say what I did here was I remove
my country so right now I only of the
groups ok you can probably add another
group for country if you want to add one
more group like I see I'm grouping by
region I'm grouping by country and you
know it's very interactive so you can
either do it this way
or you could have it in detail so only
only reason being having in details was
that put it in details it becomes more
hierarchical so inside central Caribbean
you see the details okay
it is pretty intuitive how it's working
overall ok the other way of doing it is
to remove from details and put it inside
the group so they are now they're both
part of the group and now what happens
now is of course I can I can set this up
as a color saturation color saturation
means not only are you presenting the
values based on the size of the Box you
can see bigger the box more the value
you can see one eight six six three five
three it's a big value it's a darker
color and you can see it's a slightly
lesser value slightly lighter color and
it is the least value so it is a
lightest color in the smallest box
that's our tree map represent data and
you will see a few other icons come up
these are drill downs it can go to the
next level of hierarchy if you want to
go down to the you know to the country
level you can do it like this if you
want to go down if you want to expand
down one level in the hierarchy you can
of course go down here okay and it is
how you can turn on drill down and if
you turn on drill down when you click on
Central America and Caribbean when you
click on North America you will
automatically bring up all the countries
of North America right I can just go up
again
drill up and when you click on South
America it will bring up all the
countries of South America when you go
up and click on Central Caribbean these
are all the countries of Central
European pen and you can see that the
diverging color scale remains the same
across in turn on turn off real down
turn on or turn off you can have the
focus mode click on the focus mode you
see the visual in a more focused manner
right a few other cool neat options that
you have you can export your data into
files you know you can export your data
and you can put it in excel file and
stuff like that right go back to the
report all right so that's basically
what I wanted to highlight here you can
of course have simple bar charts you
know the most popular kinds of charts
that we have simple bar charts you can
configure and instead of creating a new
chart obviously then you can click on
this and it can convert this to a bar
chart so all this information that we
are seeing you know using a to a tree
map the same kind of stuff you can see
using a bar chart again you can see that
is grouped by region and country just to
keep things simple and not to confuse
you anymore let me just say region and I
can see a simple bar chart based on
regions right data labels you want to
turn it on you can see two data labels
come up formatting stuff you can change
and customizations are just incredible
the kind of stuff you can do here you
can of course a multiple columns here
you can of course a multiple items so
probably you can have one more even if
you can probably have a map chart
probably have a map chart here let me
just go ahead and select a country
country and it's gtp or maybe maybe just
maybe just put that maybe just both out
of the put out of the year and the GDP
and the moment I do that you'll see that
automatically it generates a bar chart
for me maybe the best way to represent
this data is the line chart I probably
might want to go and set a line chart
and you can see that I get a line chart
information based on GDP and it's just
so magical it just does it automatically
for me in a matter of seconds I get a
line chart so this is the line chart
that is across all regions no filters
are applied but what I really want to do
is when I click on something here I want
the lines are to be automatically filter
and you can see it's happening so now I
am seeing this only for Central America
when I click on North America it is the
line chart it filters when North America
next lick on South America
I see the trend of GDP for South America
and see the GDP dropped is the shower
they appear again you can you can do a
lot of such analytics here okay of
course if we want to present data you
know separately you can of course do
that so probably as your axis is the
region right click on the line chart you
can see that you can obviously have a
legend you can have a separate legend
and you might want to do your comparison
across legends right so here you see
that three lines in a click on South
Central America
it's the blue click on North America
it's the black click on South America's
red so a lot of this kind of cool stuff
you can perform the interaction
interactivity this is incredible and you
can you can of course have a map chart
initial map chart that I created and
same kind of interactivity you can have
it laid out all in the same canvas it
just arranged the sizes a bit maybe just
have more space for my map chart there's
a pretty neat job to organize stuff
properly and when I click on Central
America I can see that automatically
highlights to Central American places
it's not perfect because you know that
the certain countries which are and the
reasons why it appears here because you
know the certain country names they're
probably companies North America click
on this and automatically highlights
that particular in the bar chart alright
and you can see that when I click on
this Barbados succeeded Barbados
accounts for 0.17 million out of the
entire stack is nice way to represent it
and here again you can see that this is
applicable only for Barbados right make
sense of an a click on this chilly you
can see that line chart now filters only
for Chile and for South America so
pretty neat we have representative data
all right so after I have done all of
this stuff and this is again a very
basic demonstration I'm showing after
I'm done with all of this topic and I
can absolutely go and publish the
service and this is where I develop the
stuff here and I can publish this stuff
to the service and the way i do that is
i go to i go to home and i have the
option for publishing the my - book i
can publish my dashboard they are going
to save my changes absolutely yes they
ask me if i want to save my changes the
save it in a local PB IX file they can
see the extension of a power bi file is
what we call it our p bi x i probably
call it demo underscore day one just by
day one demo click on save and once you
save the local copy and if i go back and
show you you can see does the local copy
that i saved here it's it's a dot p bi X
file and now
I come back here is publishing it to
power bi service right it's a very very
simple workflow I wanted to show you I
have a few other demos and really cool
demonstrations I wanted to show you on
theater capabilities
taking a bit of time success so so you
can detecting open that in the power bi
probably a means of public service I can
directly open that or I have it already
opened I can simply come here and it's
automatically come you can see the star
I can mark beside demo one the star I
can means that I've just recently just
very these in this a new data set I have
here ok like I can just come up here and
I can just open it up from here I can of
course go to my reports pane so just
like you have in having the desktop tool
just like I have in the desktop tool
where you have the data tab the
relationships tab and the reports tab I
just talked about it in the power bi
service you're mainly three components
you have data sets data sets is
synonymous with your data tab all the
queries that you have in all the data
sets that you have are are imported here
reports are basically the same reports
that you build here
let's see reports all the stuff that you
build your are your reports if you have
multiple pages and you can see this is
the single page you can of course build
multiple pages you can have one more
page when let's say you want to build a
you know horizontal bar to probably a
stacked bar short you can of course do
that some of you have to build a stacked
bar chart based on regions years and GDP
you can build that kind of stuff stacked
bar chart so you can do that kind of
stuff also probably want to have a
general agent alright so you can have
this kind of stuff also built out so it
is in a different page and not even
click on publish the published version
will be sent out to power bi so that
will be taken as two different pages for
the same report second you see this is
only at page one you can delete a page
like this yeah you can't eat a page and
this page one this is the only page that
I am that I exported and the same page
that sort of come up here okay that's
the same page that shows up here very
important to note that whenever you are
using maps you can see maps by default
uses the Bing mapping service so you
need to make sure that you are connected
to the Internet so if you're not
connected to the Internet
some of these capabilities will not be
there okay so you need to be connected
to the internet for you to be able to
use the Bing mapping service that's a
default mapping provider for power bi
soft okay alright so I'm sure already
know being is the max of search engine
yeah alright so this is my reports
and the final thing that you really have
is your dashboard okay sigh I don't have
the Bing Microsoft - PO that I have here
so quickly go ahead and remove it I
don't really need it right now go to
remove it I just wanted to take it as an
example of the capabilities of power bi
and really what you want to do is
confirm your reports you want to build
what we call a dashboard okay so what
you're going to do is you're going to
slowly start to clean items from your
reports on to your dashboard because
what you share with your users are not
reports reports are the individual
chunks ok reports are the individual
chunks that you develop it is the
dashboards that you share with the users
so when use next time when you share a
link with the users that link will be
for the dashboards not the reports of
course they can navigate to the reports
of the dashboard they can navigate to
the individual report pages but then the
stuff that you actually build an under
stop that you actually share are your -
box and the way to do that is very
simple you see an option for pin visual
and when you say pin visual is giving an
option where you want to pin it so I'm
trying to paint this particular visual
give you a small preview what happens to
existing dashboard I don't have any I
can create a new dashboard I can pin
that particular visual ok
so probably I can say demo one that's my
dashboard I can clean that particular
visual and you can see demo 1 dashboard
is created if I go to that particular
dashboard and you can see that - bowtie
is created in - books we call them as
tiles ok we call them as ties in a
dashboard ok that's that's my pin visual
simple enough sequencing XML to come
back to the report and if you want to
pin one more visual let's say I can pin
this particular visual and that's it and
this time it's an existing dashboard
click on pin and it is pin you can go to
the dashboard and you can see it's so
simple so neat you can raise the tie use
is very easy to play around with right
you get the same kind of come back to
the match box again a lot of default
settings you can set I mean by default
whenever you click on a particular
report on the transfer ticket it takes
it to the corresponding report so you
can see that right now when I try to do
some filtration stuff and all that if I
try to click on it it will take me to
that particular report if you take me to
the focus view of the particular report
so there's one more option that you can
even do so I can go ahead and delete
that particular dashboard and remove it
then we going to delete it and one more
thing I can do here is I can come up
here and go to my reports tab and I can
pin I can pin the live page so the
entire
stuff I see here I can pin that as it is
I can pin the live page and again it's
going to ask me to I want to pin it and
that Mayo dashboard absolutely yes and
very very important you can see here in
life page enables changes to reports to
appear in the dashboard times when the
page is refreshed so so the auto refresh
functionality is maintained whenever you
make any kind of refresh on your reports
okay so let's say I pin this to my
dashboard and then I make some changes
on my report and you can absolutely do
that even you might be wondering that
okay so all this thing I got by
developing in the desktop tool and I
published in the power bi service but
you can actually edit your report in the
service you can actually come here you
can edit your report in the services
okay let's say you don't like the color
let's say you want a different color you
can actually come up here and you can
actually change your data colors you can
come here you can let's say you want to
make it a red color you like the red
color so you can you can do that kind of
edit so it's just like toggling between
the reading view and the the edit page
view okay
so you can do a lot of this kind of
stuff here okay so maybe you want to
change the colors here or maybe you want
to change this to a different chart
okay much much better changes to a tree
map they actually come back here you can
changes to a tree map okay
multiple visualize by group will be
region country and GDP alright make
sense click on save the report is saved
and I can I can go back you can go back
to a reading view of course you have the
option to go back to the reading view so
this is the default view that you have
and this is how you go back to the Edit
report view click on edit report to take
you to that particular edit record be
where you see the same kind of
visualizations and fields pane which you
are seeing in the text of view it's very
intuitive the tool is very very
intuitive and as I was saying and
contain the live page and it retains the
light page of the dashboard you can say
demo one that's your dashboard like a
pin light and what will happen is if you
go to the dashboard and go to the
dashboard now a thing in the dashboard
you can see this page as it is so it's
the same stuff that tests that's been
carried out here the interactivity and
everything is maintained here is another
great way to maintain interactivity so
otherwise normally when you when you
clean individual visuals or sometimes
that interactivity is lost so it's a
great way to maintain that interactivity
in the individual visuals right now I
can see that I am doing it directly in
my dashboard okay
in dashboard everything is a style so
you can see by default this is what we
call a tile but these are all individual
tiles and you can add new tiles
but you can add new tiles and tiles can
be including anything it can be an image
it can get Xbox you can go to a text box
you can type in next again they can put
a simple title this is my first report
display your title and subtitle probably
say a lot of this stuff in doing I put
some links hyperlinks and stuff like
that you can put click on apply and I
can move this tile up they might want to
just apply some neat formatting just
change the size and all that and you can
do a lot of this kind of stuff here you
can just arrange the sizing a bit all
right so what other kind of stuff you
can do you can even obviously you can of
course change that you can change the
layouts you can change the I can add new
tiles and you can see new tiles you can
add some web content probably you have
some YouTube videos web content
basically you can give some URLs ok so
you can you can embed your coding get
some URLs and you can see the custom
link so you can set custom link you can
give you a URL SC if you want to play a
youtube video if you remember in Bing we
had that we had a section where
essentially we had a we had a news
section right so you might be wondering
from where it was taking that new
section right and that's it it was
taking that new section from that tiny
place it added a new tile there so you
can of course go and add in links very
easy to do just a while as I was saying
you can type in a new link
all right so pretty simple overalls how
to how to configure the stuff here in
the overall service and just wanted to
show you a few other neat demos so easy
to remove the dashboard so you can go
ahead and remove it as I just showed you
in code and delete your dashboard and
one of the very very neat feature that I
wanted to show you and all this while
all this while we were creating this
report from scratch so we went to the
air to the text of it created the report
from scratch we uploaded the service you
know we had to figure out what kind of
charge to use what kind of graphs to use
we have to do that stuff all from
scratch instead of doing that Bob here
gives you a very neat feature of quick
insights and once you upload your data
set here you can click on the data set
and you have an option for you have an
option to do quick insights ok of course
you have scheduled refreshes which is
not a very complex discussion I don't
want to get into it but you can do a lot
of data set refresh is scheduling here
the data gateway that I mentioned it can
do a lot of that kind of stuff but then
quick insights the really interesting
things I wanted to show you so if you
know nothing about reporting they know
nothing about visualizations you can
still come here you can even let power
bi figure out who is machine learning
algorithms what is the best kind of
charts and graphs we use click on View
insights insights are ready it usually
takes time but here is taking very less
time because it's a very small data set
and you can see that it does a fairly
neat job of showing you a lot of
different charts and graphs that you
know you might want to might want to see
yeah you can see GDP periglacial several
trends the case is trying to identify
the ups and downs the highs and lows and
if this palette we have seen major
fluctuations in GDP just might get some
idea about this saying if you know
nothing about your data it's let's say
some very different domain some of
different language you know nothing
about it
I think quick insights a great job of
applying some internal algorithms and
try to figure out you can see GDP is
trending upwards for Columbia and a lot
of it also is linked to the so to say so
to say the the natural language query
all right so you guys enjoying it I
haven't I'm not hearing from anyone so I
do a few questions on that I'll take
that up in a while but it's interesting
to you I mean how are you guys feeling
on power bi I'm sorry if I'm really
stretching the session I think probably
we have another 15 20 minutes more 15 20
minutes more and we can wrap up the
session in a while you guys enjoying it
yeah all right it's very intuitive
indeed it's absolutely very interest and
very interesting and I can assure you
will love it you know data is something
you should all learn to play with and in
the world of BI in the world of
analytics it is less of coding and it is
more of it's more of thinking I mean
he's got you got a thing I'm not saying
that being a coder you don't have to
think of course equal to think everyone
has to think but then I small of it's
more of understanding how to represent
data you know it's understanding how
best your data will feel so very
intuitive feel to it is very aesthetic
feel to it go to know what looks good
and I go to know what really looks good
so I want to show you one other quick
thing and again just want to briefly
come back here and this is this the same
thing that I did here have a dashboard
okay and does natural language query the
Q&amp;amp;A section which which some of us are
mentioning okay so if you just type in
here ask a question about your data
it's another brilliant brilliant feature
of power bi okay it's a brilliant
feature is something that really
differentiates power bi from from the
rest of the tools in the market today
the natural language feature
you can even just create your data set
using English language if you have your
dashboard up there and if the business
business person is trying to view that -
Barry knows nothing about your data you
can actually come back you can start
typing things if you just click on it
and give you a set of options here
you know what I'll stop you might want
to search and I can have simple things
like sum of sales by let's say GDP okay
if you give me an option and give me an
option of here they say someone sales by
GDP make some sense probably probably
I'll say sum of GDP by country I don't
have any sales maybe some of GDP by sum
of GDP by country and do a pretty neat
job of figuring out how I want to
present my data you can see how cool it
is you know just by typing in your stuff
I can do a lot of crazy things you can
see as a table just say as a table it
will show you as a table I mean it's
just incredible and just kind of power
that it has it's just incredible when I
as a tree map it just gives you as a
team app you wanna use it as a pie chart
you wanna give you a spice it's not the
best way to the presence of pie chart a
different thing but probably that casing
want to represent as the region the
region of the pie separately still be
good and this is typing English
sentences right just in these sentences
are being converted into charts and
graphs you can see how how magical it is
oh yes oh yes it's not automatic the
initial settings are automatic but there
are a lot of things you can configure
around it yep one of you did mention in
the beginning of the session that I need
to do your modeling properly your data
has to be modeled properly for you to
you know apply some of these semantics
yeah so so obviously I'm able to query
this because I know it is GDP I know it
is region but just as an example I don't
want to get too much into it just an
example if I had renamed this column as
something else if instead of region this
column name was something like capital R
you know capital R could be anything
it's I mean just a region but then I
instead of region I just use an
abbreviation for that power bi will not
be able to recognize it then that case
I'll have to say some of GDP by capital
R and it makes no sense right so you got
to know you want to give your columns
proper names
proper semantics have to be there and I
mean it into a fairly good job to you
know guide you through what that
particular column will be but then in
general you got to make sure that you
model your data properly okay
so you can obviously say trend of GDP by
region you might produce a line chart
and do a lot of crazy stuff here okay
and you can see how magical it is maybe
you want to say by year it's going to
show your line chart by year right so
that's natural language query for you so
please your typing is automatically
appear ringing or do you need to do
something for it it is automatic it is
absolutely automatic but you can disable
it there is a way to disable the natural
language query feature but it is
automatic yeah yeah I mean default
settings are automatic if you want to if
you want to disable it obviously you've
got to go to the dashboard settings I
got a lot of stuff here and you just
said it quickly so it's just because you
ask the question and just want to take
it out you can go to the dashboard
section let's click on right-click click
on settings then you see this window and
here you get a show the Q&amp;amp;A search box
on this dashboard you can just go ahead
and disable it you want to learn more
about the click on entrance this guide
you through the semantics on how to
configure to the data modeling turn on
time flow is a beautiful way in which
you can you can arrange your stuff in
the dashboards with a lot of dashboard
settings that you can perform your data
sets
you know the Refresh options you can
perform here gateway connections and all
that stuff you can perform your alert
subscriptions and all all of these
things you can do and these are some of
the developer settings that you have
alright so that's it I mean I think
pretty much good with this particular
example yeah all right so I'll go ahead
and show you something something cool
again again I think the part here is
pretty simple where you configure the
visuals I'm going to show you another
quick example I think but I know we are
fairly familiar with the basics of power
bi to quickly go back and show you a few
other examples go ahead and import one
more data set you can remove your query
so you can of course go to edit queries
and it's very simple to remove your
queries you can come here you can take
you can of course delete your queries
that continued microwave you can see I
just deleted my query I can go ahead and
save and close and apply and when I do
that I can see that automatically the
relationships and everything else is
gone you can individually the reports
will still be visible because if they
cannot find the corresponding piece I
can go and remove them or to get data go
to excel let me let me get something
else now let me take relationships and
let me show you quickly real quick how
to how to configure
relationships so this excel sheet has
three tables three sheets I should
rather say they can go to the
relationships Excel workbook you can see
that their sheet three sheets that I
have okay and just to just to do some
basic data analytics right now just to
show you how what it means and how you
configure this kind of stuff you can see
that as a customers table where you have
a state column okay
the state column is basically an
abbreviation okay this is basically
different requests based on certain days
you have a latitude and longitude column
which is a little different this time
okay you're going to show is this
typical geographical data I'm going to
show how it represented using a map okay
but then the idea here is to how to
relate these three sheets you have
states and territories you can see the
state abbreviations and state names
which are linked to territories again is
the territory abbreviations and which
are directly linked to territory names
so you can get an intuitive
understanding that these tables are
joined right so if customers which is
joined to States using the state
abbreviation and then the territory
which is joined to territories using the
again the territory abbreviation it's
very easy to configure that in power bi
okay you can just select these tables
click on edit and once you do that it
will obviously open up the Edit queries
interface so edit queries there are few
things we need to do you feel few
transformations we need to perform one
of the first things we have to do here
is you will see that a guru territories
you see that customers it has an
operating need job of using the first
name as headers but then if I go down to
States States I need to promote the
first row to headers you can see it's
taking column one column clear default
so come here use first row as headers
computer nitori's use for so as headers
and now I can see that things look
better okay
I can I can give some IDs so probably
come here and rename it call it
territory ID just to just to use proper
naming conventions I use territory ID
and territory name is as it is come to
states probably come to rename and call
this territory ID come to customer and
in eggwin in the states are probably
named this state ID instead of
abbreviation I'll call the state ID
maybe I'll just call it state name I'll
just call it state and finally I'll go
to customers and call this state ID and
I hope you get the idea what we
eventually got to do is we've got to try
to form relationships
other things are pretty straightforward
you have the ID column if you don't want
the ID column which is pretty useless
right now I can go ahead and remove that
particular column okay so you have phone
numbers which are as they're configured
ABC right so other things it does a very
very neat job of configuring you know
stuff the way it should be one thing I
need to change of course is a zip code
you'll see zip code is taken as a number
1 2 3 is a whole number 1 2 3 is a whole
number which is how it should not be
treated okay so it please these are all
numbers and power bi is not so
intelligent of course it is intelligent
but it's not so intelligent but then I
got a tell power bi that hey you know
what zip code it's not something as an
aggregate you can some zip codes you can
subtract sit for sit still or it's still
a text right it still it takes a still a
categorical data when you do that is ABC
and it immediately moves it to the left
hand side not as treated as categorical
data alright so these are a few things
that you've got to do and other things
are fine you can see that required date
by default is a date type you have a
daytime type also and a lot of different
neat features that you have here other
things that ok you can of course apply
filters you have an option to apply
filters you want to look at only data
and is a very excel like features you
can sort your data and whatever you do
all that will be applied in the steps
you want to sort it ascending to see
that sorted rows is applied in ascending
order here I want to delete it and
delete it
on the filter rows you can go ahead and
filter your rows the very
straightforward options that you have
alright let's quit take a quick look at
stage setting states are looking good
and finally limit territories again ABC
ABC looking good and that's it my
queries are looking good
I'll go ahead and close on apply and now
my data part is fixed alright my queries
part is fixed and now what I got to do
is go to the relationships tab and fix
my relationships taking a few time too
little bit of time detecting
relationships so go here normal
relationships pain and you can see it
has automatically formed relationships I
did nothing I did nothing and this is
where power bi you know is really
intelligent it figures out it looks at
columns with similar names
it looks at columns a similar name
similar types similar data and it
automatically creates this relation so
you can see it is a one-to-many the star
stands for many and the one stands for
one one to many right so so one state
here relates to multiple state IDs here
and it's very pretty into
visit one territory ID here is to
multiple territory IDs here and it can
just double click on it and you can they
can look at the kind of message to this
form is very easy to create religiously
it's almost magical the way the
interfaces you can see state ID state ID
you want something else you can sit and
select it right of course I can can't as
cancel it I won't select both cross
filter a it's a concept I want to get
into it's a complex concept slightly
slightly complicated it's slightly
difficult to digest but probably from a
typical fact table standpoint we
typically send it to both okay it's an
active relationship again there's a few
other internals theories related to this
which I wouldn't want to get into but
then there's a cross filter option that
you also get here okay
and that's what my relationships are set
I can go in and I can go to my report
and I can start building reports so all
of a sudden I had three completely
independent data sets but then all of a
sudden I've got a way to link them so if
I take a table or if I take a matrix if
I take whatever I mean if I take
anything for that matter I can I can all
of a sudden use data from three
different tables you can see from one
table from the other table I take state
and put the other table I take territory
and this is working if I did not have
that relationship this will not work
this will not work if I did not have the
relationships defined very very
important concept right and of course
you can you can do some other cool stuff
you have the latitude and longitude data
you can directly click on that and you
can immediately you can see I get a map
chart you see I get a map chart
immediately right you want to configure
this based on your requests types okay
how many requests you are getting so
maybe you want to have an ID column and
I remove the ID column you might want to
have an ID column you could have kept it
but it going to count but that's just a
way for you to represent the cities you
can still take the city you can still
take the state can go back here go back
to your model you have the city city of
course is city and state go back to your
go to states state is of course your
state from they'll call it country or
region right so if the province I find
it'll come to my territories where
territory is basically kind of myself
right so there's no fun category for
this for ten provinces
right so it mainly is my state and state
and country which I'm concerned about
come back here and now when I click on
city
you can see it first thing the globe I
can come up and when I click on state
and when I click on city now there will
be no more problems in identifying which
state that particular city belongs in ok
so otherwise they might be conflicts you
might have a particular city which is in
a different state and that kind of stuff
all right so that's another example I
wanted to show you and probably the
final final kind of data turning example
I want to show you here is let me go
edit remove this it's relationships time
I want to show you and this is by far
the most important thing right you know
it's nice to play around with visuals is
the easy part
right it's easy part is to play around
with visuals but then the complex part
is really to come back and model this
thing because that's really the heart of
what you go to so come back here I can
remove this stuff from here I can go and
delete them ok introduce my customers
probably I can go to edit query the
query still stick in a new query again
you might have observed that I had three
Excel sheets
I agree excel sheet and all three of
them are taken up three separate queries
okay I hope you observe that particular
part I'm going to remove my queries here
close and apply and you can change your
visuals and they're gone all right so
come back here and the final thing I
want to show you is straightforward so
essentially what I wanted to show you
here is how to how to merge queries okay
anyway so since I've opened this ready
let me show this to you also so these
are again some some intricate
transformations that you can do an
exercise in power bi okay
so you can come back and connect to an
exhale connect to custom columns
essentially and you have you have seven
different kinds of seven different kinds
seven different regions from which this
data is coming from right so all I want
to do is I want to merge all these
queries we look at Oceania South America
they all follow the same standard right
I can go back and edit it so now they
are all individual queries so they all
individual queries now look at Africa
flag name capital status flag name
capital status flag name capital status
they're all the same kind of stuff and
and what is what I'm essentially trying
to do here is a sequel Union all it's
very similar to a sequel Union all we're
essentially I'm doing a union all of all
the data so all the seven continents
data for all the seven continents have
to be stored in a single place
so no matter who that is what we call
append queries so the merge queries is
for it is like a joint merge is for a
joint and append this for a union all so
this is the Union all that we can do we
can append queries as new so we can form
a new query out of this that we can call
s3 or more tables of course and what are
the tables are gonna include Africa
Antarctica Asia Europe North America and
South America click on ok and you can
see that now it's going to append a new
query which we are calling append one
you can of course name it I can probably
call it continent consolidated and you
can see it's so easy to do this kind of
stuff and all that we're doing is we are
doing a lot of complexity all right now
not exactly complex on that point of
view but just put to do the same thing
in an ETL to like even an SS is you have
to you know you have to do a lot of
steps you to do something like a you to
do a union all transformation right so
it's pretty complex that way but it's so
so neat so intuitive in power bi content
consolidated and content consolidation
you can see Africa 59 rows over four
rows 59 rola difficult content
consolidated you can see that 269 rows
so indeed all the all the rows have been
added you can see yeah make sense so
that's what I wanted to show you in this
particular example and finally the other
thing that I wanted to have wanted to
display here is and you can see that if
I try to delete this to give an example
like that query cannot be related
because it was referenced by another
query so you cannot direct it in this
query the referencing query has to be
related first
what if columns are less good question
again the ones where you don't have the
columns it will be null values blank
values will be taken there yeah of
course I can remove this particular
query and then I can remove the
remaining queries and the final thing I
wanted to show you is is another concept
a very very very neat thing that they
can do in power bi if you try to do the
same thing using some other kind of ETL
tool it will probably take you a long
time I'm sure you what you're feeding
out what this data is a typical example
of pivoted data its pivoted data where
you can see that you know state names
are listed out in the in the left hand
side is all the US states that I have
and you have
and you might be wondering where I'm
getting this kind of datasets as a very
very common source of data for you to
play around is gapminder.org excellent
source so having this kind of datasets
Gapminder of course you have the
data.gov your government website where
you get all public datasets okay so you
can do a lot of cool stuff using that
and you can see that it's a spirited
data and I using power bi again I can
unfavorite very very easily okay I can
go to power bi desktop again wouldn't
cancel this part come back here go back
to my get data take excel and all this
while I been showing excel break and of
course Electra database is also state
population years population table edit
it and you get the query editor window
that opens up and what I wanted to show
you here is a neat way in which you can
you can you can you can devote your data
all you have to do is select this column
so much you turn to for this this is
fine the first two columns are fine
that's your that's your state name
that's your ear name and I want to
unpick over these columns and all you
have to do is just select these columns
you can see this is one more column I
have here if you want to move your
columns is very easy just move your
columns here want to move your key
column right to the to the beginning
again just move your column here and
your key columns comes in the beginning
okay very very simple very easy to
configure this kind of stuff
okay so that's your key column and
coming back to the pivoting again so you
want to start from this column and go
right up to this column anyone to do
unpayable just right-click on it and say
and pivot columns and magically it will
hunt pivot your data okay all right so
it's it did not really give us the
intended result I hope you observe what
happened you and I wanted to keep it for
you I wanted to give you a small
surprise here and I hope you understand
what happened here it's not the best
kind of thing that happened here I hope
you any any idea what happened here
you can see that it's taking as column
three it's not the not the best thing
that happened so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go back and rebirth so step
I'm going to go back and click on the
cross and now what I want to do is
actually the reason why it happened is
because if the first rows are not really
column names but I can and any weight my
first or as headers and now when I do
this now I can actually come back here
and now my on ticket is going to work
check your data types once is all
decimal numbers you can see this up to
this just written as ABC and Pender's
okay
I'm pivot your columns and you can see a
much more neater representation you can
see these are the year so I can come
back here and come back and rename your
column colored here and this is your
value which is your population so the
same thing that you would have taken
probably I mean I'm sure you will know
folks who know SQL you will know that in
the sequel query language of a separate
syntax for pivoting and unfitting it's a
complex syntax you know if you know if
you try to do this in SSI or any of the
ETL tools it takes a lot of time you
know it takes time to configure pivot
and pivot but then it's magically simple
in power bi if you want to remove some
columns go to remove your columns want
to remove your columns here and as a
population data and once you have this
stuff it is very simple to you can see
all these steps that I've applied here
is very easy to go back and save this
and generate visualizations out of this
go to the reports pane click on the name
a state name I can see that right now
when I click on the name it's taking as
a table because it doesn't know where
the name is means of state probably what
I need to do is come back to name try to
rename this column okay I'll try to
rename this column here I call a state
and the category is basically put the
modeling tab the category is essentially
gone straight right so I'll call this a
state a province and now when I compute
reports when I click on state you see
that a true presence in the form of map
all right there is all US states this is
a field map I have an option to give a
field map which is much cooler you know
it looks better if I officially five
state data a filled map looks much
better because it gives me all the US
states listed like this and now if I
take population here data as a much much
better feel you can come to color
saturation and essentially you get the
larger the population you can see the
better so color so essentially the same
number that I'm having here so it
doesn't make a lot of difference come
greater colors and put diverging on for
the maximum screen alright so
essentially that the reason why this
data is coming as it is because the same
kind of population values everywhere
not much difference right alright so
that's all that I wanted to cover today
again at this one final thing probably
if I have to talk about a little bit
here and just give you an idea you do
have the concept of slicers you know for
filtering and stuff you can be can put
some slices very easy way to port
filtering if you want to filter based on
years you can click so these are my ear
slicers and some of the filter based on
only 1840 so right now I can see only
1840 data let's just convert this back
to a probably a metric so it will make
more sense right now you can see right
now I'm seeing data only for 1840 if I
want to select 1850 you can see I'm
selecting data only for 1850 it's that
simple to configure a slicer on what we
call a filter in here right so it's very
easy to do that of course you have some
neat little features for slicers instead
of it's a vertical representation you
can obviously go here and I can go to
selection controls and go to general and
so you can go to general and you can set
the orientation to horizontal and data
looks much cooler you can you can come
back here you can extend it up and you
just probably drag it a little bit to
the side and you can see how how
wonderful it looks yep so that's your
your data you can see all the years are
listed up here probably can have a map
down here and whatever you select here
that it gets filtered as it is might
want to create a line chart out of it
here wise data so probably a line chart
will be really more significant and you
want to be able to represent your wise
population trends alright so and finally
you have the r component where you can
obviously write our script visuals so
people who are familiar with art is a
very close integration between power bi
and AR you can of course click on R and
you can see that I can write to our
script ok so you can write your R code
so things like correlation matrix you
know heat map some complex or visuals
that you don't have you don't really
have some visuals here you can directly
go and write with hard script for that
and finally there's another wonderful
feature in power bi where you can import
the custom visual ok so there's
something called the custom visuals
gallery the web the link is apt or for
the i.com visuals we have some a great
community of developers so develop these
kind of visuals in using the language
and essentially what we can you can you
can use these visuals as it is you know
it is given example there's something
called a play access duel kpi's liquid
gauge
any kind of visual that you want to use
in really cool visuals you can use
directly from here
okay very simple to use it how to import
a visual very simple to do it you can
probably have firmly click on play axis
play axes if you guys know is something
that you use scatter so probably might
we'll take something like let me show
you a cooler example here this is
something that I have found helpful at
times where you have an attribute slicer
a really really nice way of filtering
data and just want to show you see the
brief description of the visual you can
download your visual of course you agree
so your visual will be downloaded your
downloads folder right so once that is
done what you can do is you can
obviously go to our come here you can
import a custom visual and now you can
you can take your stuff from your
downloads folder like make sense it's
very similar to input a visual very
simple to import a visual into our power
bi okay I can take my attribute slicer
and I can see that the visual was
successfully imported click on OK and
that's it you can see that you can see a
small icon that has come up attributes
slicer there's the same attribute slicer
that got added that's the attribute
slicer that I added here yeah make sense
I'll go ahead and remove that our visual
not really required instead of that let
me take this attribute slicer click on
this attribute slicer and I want to
slice this based on let's say state and
population and you can see that I mean
you can you can see how how magical it
is you can of course sort by state you
can sort it by state and you can see
sorry sort by population and sorry start
by population a can see the the states
with the highest population are coming
so it is a slicer it is still a slicer
in the sense that you know it you can
still use it to sort data let's say you
want to look at trends of New York from
1870 92 1860 you can just click on it
but the best thing about this is you get
to see a trend of how much of population
was there for New York's you can just
click on it and it is it is still slice
it based on Virginia now you're seeing
it only for Virginia ok you want North
Carolina you can see that now you're
seeing data for Virginia and North
Carolina it's very very simple that any
physical search different type in values
here you can select Ohio and get data
here only for Ohio
click on enter and that's it you get
data for Ohio and Virginia it is very
intuitive and this is how we can import
a la
of custom visuals from the custom
visuals gallery alright alright that's
it guys I think we had a had a long
discussion overall in some sort of
specifics here quickly come back to the
decks just to review the text again
something that we have already talked
about at length the visualizations the
data sets the reports the dashboards in
the thighs these are the building blocks
of any Powerglide solution that you have
right alright so that's it I think
there's a lengthy session today and
obviously it's time to time to bring a
logical conclusion to the overall
session I did have a few questions
around machine learning and friends or
my apologies I think it's not really
simple I think we need to get into a few
other concepts for that you know a
real-time streaming all this very easy
to configure but then I just wanted to
make sure that it's on a more structured
way it's very easy to configure but then
there are still underlying concepts and
underlying data says I figure to build
for that alright so the power bi has
online learning videos on Microsoft has
tableau has absolutely yes you do have
it so I did share that link initial link
with you after power bi dot-com
so please go ahead and please look at
some of the some of the learning videos
there so even when you start up RBI for
the first time and even you start
probably a deck stuff for the first time
I you should be able to see click on
toned and essentially when you try to
start a power bi desktop for the first
time you get a you get a link where it
asks you to where it highlights learning
videos and learning items so Microsoft
does have some pretty good learning
materials from power bi yep let's take a
bit of time to load initially and
essentially what we're trying to
highlight here is the interrater course
that we have one power bi so we have a
bad starting 15th of March 15th of May
as a new batch is starting and I just
wanted to give you guys a heads up in
case you're interested in joining that
particular batch we are going to have a
much more rigorous coverage so this was
just a preview it was the overview
course just wanted to give you guys an
idea as to what power bi is and some of
the capabilities of power B and just to
get you interested in power bi we had
folks running in from different
backgrounds different experiences and
hope all of you had enjoyed the session
hope all of you you know were able to
relate it to other VI tools you would
have worked in or if even if you have
not worked in bi before hope at least
you were able to hope at least you are
excited you were able to get excited
about the capabilities of power bi so
what you see here are the cause details
are something that we are going to cover
in far more detail in our regular power
bi certification training quotes that we
are starting from 15th of March I would
really encourage all of you to be a part
of it in case you're really interested
to learn more about power bi I'd really
encourage you guys to be a part of it
and let's meet again and let's learn
together yep there's Dex you can see Dex
data analyst expressions it's a
completely different language altogether
another very very powerful part of power
bi we do have we are going to talk about
SSRS reports also is a very close
integration between power bi necesarias
reports there is power bi embedded we're
going to talk about custom visuals Q&amp;amp;A
some more complex concepts there
administration there's completely
different discussion administration that
we are going to cover in our regular
course ok so that's it that's it it's
great to have all of you here I think
you guys SPECT great I think you had
some great questions that came in and I
do had one question is to take up how
will the UI get refreshed automatically
for real-time data changes it does I
mean if you are connecting to real-time
streaming data it does it does
automatically get refreshed and you can
literally set the frequency you can set
the Refresh frequency I did not complete
a refresh but then you can you can set
it at a frequency to be very very small
also so real-time absolute it is
possible yeah so for streaming data it
is it is indeed real-time yeah you might
have seen the again if you see here just
this what I was mentioning this is what
I was mentioning before when you start
power bi desktop and this is the this is
the screen that you get initial learning
screen that you get you can just click
on it and you can get started with
desktop and it'll basically take you to
the other Microsoft Lync where
essentially some of these learning
videos are saved all right and you can
see the oxygen option of streaming data
sets here are just answered your
question I don't have any streaming data
sets yet but just to answer your
question I can connect to real-time data
to your dashboard second of course you
streaming that I can learn more about it
so more advanced concepts on it you can
absolutely go out and do that so I do
just to answer your question I hope you
get a brief idea about it I can probably
go ahead and just just look more just
research more into it yeah all right so
do we have box plots in power bi answer
is no you don't have box plots in power
bi I'm sorry so the only way to get
Splott says you have to take you have to
write an art code and it's very easy to
build a boxplot by the way yep so that's
a good point but you don't have box
plots in power bi so the only plots that
you have are what you see here
visualizations so additionally you can
go ahead and search I'm not sure if
they've added so this gets refresh so
you do have a box and whisker plot of
the custom visual by the way yeah so Jan
Peter so whoever this person is I mean
it can be a person it can be a company I
don't know I mean you can literally
publish your own visuals if you're good
in coding can basically publish it by
and and Microsoft will review it and put
it up in the custom visuals gallery so
you can go and reuse it here but then as
a default it doesn't have it yeah can we
access files from Hadoop absolutely yes
I mean you name a source and power bi
has a connector to it there's no source
that probably I cannot connect to and I
literally mean it you can go to get data
and you can see that there's still
clearly no source the power bi cannot
connect to it is all the different slash
sources you know we have more apps you
know office 365 web apps no you just
name it just search it it's an infinite
list of items that you have you alright
so thank you guys it was great having
you here hope you enjoyed the session
again and as I said 15 maybe of starting
one more batch we're going to have a
more detailed discussion on power bi
it's a formal certification training
that you can have the life class that we
have a network of obviously I'll be an
instructor for that particular class we
do have 24/7 support some of you might
have attended I do deca courses before
but then other idea is to test Quentin
straight oh all right 13th May is your
is your first class right 13th Amazo
weekend so essentially essentially
that's that Saturday and Sunday that
Saturday and Sunday is where we're going
to have starting the first pass or 13th
May is when we are starting the batch so
I'm sure the support team will get in
touch with you again it is great having
all of you here hope you guys enjoy the
session hopefully I'll see you guys
again on 13th May
yep so bye you have a good day have a
good night and happy learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
