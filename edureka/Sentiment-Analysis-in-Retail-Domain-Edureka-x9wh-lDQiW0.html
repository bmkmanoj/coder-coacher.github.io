hello everyone a very good morning and a
very good afternoon and I couldn't mean
to all of them in the webinar
t so thanks for joining as a vine are
this conducted to AJ Rekha the objective
of today's webinar is going to be on
just breathing yourself through the
world of daily signs just digesting
something as to what's happening or what
is this and all about and you're gonna
be trying to just understand what is the
data mining some of the stages are the
data mining one of the most popular
software that is you know taking over
the world I should say in the reason
day's recent years which the existence
is not new it's been there for a very
long time and it is you know there have
been precursors to that but what is
taken out of breeze and more a favorable
software so to say is the are so we're
just quickly looking into what does this
and what the data scientists was trying
to understand the context behind it all
right so we're not going to be talking
about how this word is being coined but
what involves in the data science what
needs to be what is the need of a data
scientist right so what is the basic me
behind this so called data scientist and
finally maybe looking into the roles and
responsibilities of a data scientist so
the me requesting after understanding
what is the need for it you might
understand so what you can't do is find
this play in what kind of rules are the
data scientists playing essentially
right so these are the many questions
you might have it in your mind and
finally we will be wrapping it up this
oh by now with a example within
sentiment analysis you know which is
widely and
very favorable analysis for scholars
right in in the computer world and the
natural language processing world and
any any you know it because of the the
more sporadic information cycle and
there's when you look at the
unstructured data which is what kind of
change many things in the recent times
in the recent world after the after the
involvement of or rather the boom of the
so-called engineers who call the social
media you know sites social engagement
collaboration sites such as Google and
Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter and all
that action right okay that being said
you know data is pretty women everywhere
and everybody actually you know is
playing around with the data and and
every organization is not new to it
where they've been consuming either
consuming or they've been storing data
for a very very long time and you know
though it's so funny to say as it says
from this particular you know comic
series speak like you can see that if
you're taking a reason example of you
know where place is ready
you know these Nala ticks or they big
data or whatever we call it as big data
analytical big data inside the assigns
any term it may be you can see that you
know the data which is fundamentally
what it is right you know as a shaped of
the world and one such example is like
you know believe it or not Germany not
only won the World Cup football World
Cup but underneath heard the rest data
signs in it right there's a lot of
research a lot of data science in
analytical and algorithms were applied
to mine through the power
data understand not just the German
players also the openings also the way
they had the openings play how did they
in various scenarios over a period of
time next track sir and all that so you
can see how they impact us not just for
the company which runs the business it
also you know for the openings or the
competitors as well so that's what data
has done but that's where the data
science and the analytics is done
over a period of time and and that's
what it is doing now as such
now just as it says about like you know
what I suggest talked about is nothing
but a sports analytics right that's the
application of it right now in the sense
the vertical are set right so some of
these scenarios if we talk about where
does it come into the picture like where
does it apply him right word and what
essentially is required that's something
which I could say it's a dangerous Heinz
application right now if you look at the
basic terminology as Wikipedia would say
right so data fine there's nothing but a
study of the generalized extraction of
knowledge from data and the key word is
science right that's a statement now if
you look at what does it mean is data
plus signs so essentially it's the
knowledge which you the inside which you
try to understand or grasp out from the
data using the science per se right when
you see the signs essentially we're
talking about signs in the nature of
weather maybe a signs out from physics
science or from mathematics signs from
machines extra tracks or on all that so
it's nothing bad and
stayed where you process something
essentially process here means
processing the data right analyzing the
data extracting the knowledge out of
this data and insides and all these are
basically done through things such as
machine learning and measure learning
itself is where you know the artificial
intelligence are being a part of
appliances to the machine learning as
such it's a state where your machine
tries to understand your data by itself
and starts to produce you the bristles
now when it comes to the processing part
we know that where we are in a world
where the lots and lots of data are
masses of data which is being stored and
this is essentially where Hadoop comes
into the picture and you can take a note
of this link as part of a generator
block where you can see a lot of
conversation happening in terms of
hardware it provides you a great point
of you know note for you to actually
repository for you to gain knowledge on
Big Data and Hadoop as such now so that
essentially means three things storing
organizing and integrating huge amount
of unstructured data is where your
applications of data signs are and
processing and analyzing this data right
and extracting the knowledge insights
and why you want to do this all you want
predict the future from the data right
okay Jason has a question is it
necessary to look into data some problem
looks very evident that is true
now the problem looks evident but D but
still it goes beyond that right though
the problem is evident you there are not
proper solutions the solutions may be
there but there are situations where you
wanted to
actually come up with Mary's options to
that it may not be one solution right
what if there are 10 solutions to it
right so essentially we're talking about
a case where ever you're talking about
there is an evident towards a problem it
may be straightforward evidence but when
it comes to finding and root cause
behind it
predicting even before the problem
occurs right even you stop the problem
to occur right what if you stop the
problem darker or what if you minimize
the problem Sturken so those are the
things that you are talking about sse
deriving out from the data right say for
example all right if say for example as
you said in terms of the problem is
evident and let's say for example you
stopped at a bus stop okay anywhere the
industry are there examples of places
where people have not used data and
things have worked out well actually
speaking peoples are not using data
right and have have things are worked
out things are being working out yes say
for an example right let's say for
example you have a bus and a bus stop
right and the buses have been coming
people have been boarding in and you've
been going into the right destination
where you have right but the what we
call here a problem here is the
population here right you've been going
to your destination that's all fine and
it's always crowded it's all a problem
yes it's a known problem so what people
give birth and you know they there's
always you're going to be in more more
population and the bus is not enough for
you now you're living with the problem
right we are not doing anything with
that right things have worked out right
the industry the so-called the industry
that generates or the organization runs
this so-called buses all it's all
working out now
what if tomorrow comes up with why you
need big data and analytics
and data science is you know what there
will be a car just as you saw on the
first light
there gotta be somebody who is looking
into this data if you don't do it and
he's gonna come up with a much more a
bigger bus or a bus which can actually
do some innovative stuff like you know
or maybe he gonna introduce something
called a double-decker bus
now what happens essentially he takes
the guy who was been running this
business for a very long time out of the
competition right and why is that so
that is because he was just living with
what it does and he was just taking the
information as how many people were
there at a given point of time or X
attracts a ton and you've been
accumulating this information and not
done anything with that and he's been
living with that now what happens that
is where you know like somebody like who
computer would come and knock you out if
you don't react to it and to do react to
it right essentially what you would do
is do this data science right a so
called analytics right
thanks I do get is required but like
Steve Jobs he went with his gut feeling
right so some time data is overrated who
do I award over lowing theta how do I
avoid over analysis of data now there's
a lot of things which involves in terms
of data science and all that right so I
can I would disagree when you say it
Steve Jones Steve Jobs just went with
his gut feeling right so there was a bit
of obviously the information which was
all involved in it a that could be you
know the guys marketing analytics guys
over there and other things and believe
me or not
you know the just an FYI for you right
he believed that the customers did not
know what they want no I mean he was
right sir
see he was aware of the information but
then he believed that see he started to
institute his idea into your mind right
he started to say this is how the
industry needs to be this is what it
needs to be so it's not that he did not
know what is happening at all right I
remember I've been reading some of the
blog's right so for example you know
like a lot of organizations including
you know mine mine and myself people do
analyze the service write the customer
service and you know Amazon takes a
survey or there's so many organization
who take the survey and analyze the
service so that they can improve the
customer experience right so what
happens is like I I remember going
through this blog or though going
through this not even blog it was an
article in the forest or for that matter
all right
well talked about the cost service
specifically and one gentleman in that
blog or in that forum or he commented
saying that I have been using five phone
for so-and-so yours and I mean I never
have come up across a stage where Apple
have ever surveyed me you know and the
reason why we're talking about is that
because they tap all the usages of the
customer they know what is happening how
is this an X attraction and all that so
essentially the
products have been designed in such a
way that there was not much of a need
way they need to take a survey upon
right and and it could be still a survey
not necessary to the customer directly
but indirectly like for example you know
like what NSA is doing right the same
manner Yanni should have and there's
nothing like all were doing with our
Alex yeah analytics could go wrong not
with the algorithms what you choose and
use but rather with you know like taking
the wrong problem to solve right if you
take the wrong problem and and that's
how it could happen and also what I
would advise is since it's of a by no or
we will be sure running short of it I
would rather have your questions hold it
and I'm gonna take it at the end of the
session actually right so I'm gonna take
an order of your questions thanks for
the questions though we'll be taking in
order for at the end of it so so I'm
going to take an order for your
questions JSON and and we'll be looking
into this questions so let's go through
this diviner and and then take this
question so quickly you know there was
one question from be honest or as I'm
just gonna answer also that Jana sure
Prashad I'm gonna answer your question
quite later apologize for that so so
that being said that's the appliances or
applications of data science where you
store organize integrate your data and
process these data's try to extract
knowledge about it and in size and try
to predict the future from that right
now if we look at how is it done so
basically there are so many life cycles
like kdd which is nothing but knowledge
discovery in data mining there's a
website called kdd Nuggets the person
who actually you know started us off
I'll weaken Prashant I don't I don't see
there are any audio shoes I hope others
do not have any audio shoes please check
your audio at your end right so there's
quite a few techniques or you know life
cycle methodology which are available
for data signs and as far as the on the
data mining as such so one such popular
one is called as ktd knowledge discovery
in data mining and this this is this
gamer from the person who runs that ktd
nuggets website this edge so when you
look at the flow or the stages of your
data finds or data mining this first is
where you start to collect the data it
is rarely in other words to say once you
have a data you do to start selecting
the appropriate attributes now
appropriate things which is required
from the various amount of data which
you collected right so first process the
selection of you know the right
information within the data now once you
start doing that of the selection of
data the next thing is to start
processing like not targeting the right
information within the data right which
is basically is what you call it as
pre-processing in other words where
essentially like you know there are
certain things where you have to like
you know in terms of there are so many
words which you have so many jargons are
there in the data signs and such as like
you know clean seeing data clean seeing
data munging and all those things which
are there that also those are things
which we call it a pre-processing of
your data right and the next step
essentially is the pre-processed data as
where you actually start to do some
transformation of that now the
transformations is where the data
wrangling and again like you know the
data where like for example if you take
a age and the distribution of the age as
such right it could be so that there is
a lot of missing
values in that right so there could be a
lot of missing values in your age and
essentially where you actually transform
this into you handle these missing
values right so other enemies and other
things so that's the place where the
pre-processing of the data are being
transformed into a form where you can
start looking into look into this data
into this transformed data which is your
next step where you track this
transformed data is taken and you start
to understand this data right understand
this data and try to understand this
data through exploration right where
some exploration analysis happens on top
of your data which is where you apply
your hypothesis or other techniques
essentially on top of that about and
essentially where you actually start to
do your chi f-test ITA's chi-square test
on all those things on top of this data
where they're doing exploratory or
descriptive analysis on top of this and
then you start to get the patterns out
of it understand the patterns out of
this and start to have this data
transformed and mined in such a way that
you can start apply some model on top of
this normalized data where the data is
like you know and you his way you tack
start to you know take those test data
and then you know apply your model on
top of this death data and then once you
do it is where you start evaluate your
data right so that's where the now step
happens where your evaluation happens on
top of this model which you build on
those transforms and mind data
essentially on the sample data and then
apply it to your entire population or
such and the knowledge what you gain is
where it's either a prediction or
prescriptive right now so that will be
the anything which you which you realize
out of all this whole kdd process in
terms of your data mining as such right
so those are the steps involved or the
stages in your analytical life cycle
analytical world right we first you
select your data right and then you
target the right thing within the data
for your process pre process those data
once you pre-process the data you
transform this data right into something
which is understandable something which
you can start working on then you start
mining into this data because the data
initially is going to be an ugly data so
you need to make this ugly data into a
much more into a better shape so that
you can start looking to this data which
can make some meaning out often right so
once you understand the basic stuff by
exploring this data this way you start
to get the patterns or offer it and
build your own model right and then I
mean identify if there is a pattern at
all over there right once you do that
you build it is where you realize
something called predictions or
prescriptions what transformation also
involve plying Dismas knowledge logic
essentially your whole process of this
from the start to end is where this
business logic I mean when you say
business logic
I would slightly change the word
business logic here there's nothing like
and you fils loop statement or something
like that traditionally as you are used
to when you build a web web-based
application this is more of
understanding from the data right if I
give you an example let's say I have the
height of the you know students in a
class right now what essentially you try
to do is once you know what is the
average height of it then the next step
is let's say there is a new student who
joins right now let me tell you
something your system should be able to
tell you this student who comes in first
it should predict whether the student is
going to be a male or a female
if fluid is a male then tell me what is
his height if it is a female
tell me what is her height
right now - I didn't when you identify
that this is the average height and this
is the average height of a male or a
female in your class and then when you
build the model when you use the model
to build that using a certain algorithm
that is what I would call it as a
business logic in the world of your you
know like web based development or
anything now even going beyond that if
you don't call it as a even a business
logic now once you know that whether
this person is going to be inside as a
male or a female right then what do you
do next is what you would do it in and
the whether I should give an admission
or not and then you would have some kind
of criteria for that to give an
admission on all right that is where
your usual business logic in your
organization on your company or in a
university is of what so that is the
last thing you do you know in terms of
applications like for example student
application and admissions right so once
you know that this is a male or a female
and this is the average height should I
admit this person into this class right
a based on this particular so that's
where your business logic would come
okay so there's nothing called business
logic but if you want to really term it
it comes more at your web world where
you have a frame 10 system X attraction
at all okay now so the next thing is we
looked at what is it
Digga sciences what what the world terms
it has what are the things which are
involved in the data center what kind of
applications do you think is the data
sciences we know the flow what it
involves to build a data science or an
analytical solution so to speak at the
end what do you realize predictions or
prescriptions right prescriptions are
where like for example I said whether
the person who's gonna join our this
class where there is going to be a male
or a female or what will be their height
that's what you predict but
prescriptions are something where you
say right it is good to have
person whose of this height hoon who is
a male for this particular class that is
when you're going to have a better
admission rate that is what is called
prescription now your end result and
that that is where the executors that is
where the organization's are law looking
to you when you do a data science
project or a data science task or from a
data scientist a prescriptive analysis
is water that I said now right when you
stopped at place where you say the
person is going to join or where this
class there's going to be mailed and
it's going to be of this height that is
what is called as prediction you predict
the future based on the past data such
as your height and the previous height
from this particular class for this year
for the last 50 or six or cracks or and
all that all right now to do this
programmatically right what would you
need right at this point of time there
are many tool sets what we're looking at
is one of the most popular language
called art so what is our our is a
programming language and R is a
programming language it is built by
statisticians for statisticians right
and you primarily use it and it is an
environment for statistical analysis
right now what are you looking at in
this screenshot is a basic basic art a
standard art now this is an IDE for that
which is what I'm going to demonstrate
it which is called as an IDs I
integrated development environment which
are nothing but art studio right so this
is just an art console which you're
seeing it and when you execute that
binary essentially near windows it's
just gonna show you up with a command
from kind of it's a shell rather to say
right and are it's a software which you
use also data analysis has powerful
visualization packages and all that all
right
I mean for example if you actually look
at the thing which is there in the
screenshot there doing nothing bad this
is a package which is used for or for a
library which is used for visualizing
ggplot very powerful and essentially
they are installing it in walking it and
then just a simple random number
generator yet right a normal distributed
random number and they're putting it
into the x and y binding them based on
column column based binding putting it a
new observation are available just
simply plotting it and then this line is
so simple nothing but you know out of
one single line they're applying an
advanced algorithm called k-means
clustering right so they're just doing a
k-means simply by just writing one
single line and essentially by if I
wanted to look at this particular key
means job data observation which this
I'm just gonna simply look into the
structure of this key mean so which
actually tells you the number of
clusters the centroids the total sum of
squares within sum of squares total
within sum of squares between sum of
squares and the size of it actually
write the sides with cost is no line so
the way these other attributes which we
can find out that it's so simple in one
single line you can just write a complex
algorithm there I want so so the lot of
other works which is involved like is to
one the knowledge off telling what is
the right algorithm for this particular
business problem right and then when you
wanted to apply or write it and you do
it through art it's going to be so easy
right so that is what the actually kind
of demonstrate is shows a search
actually right now another example of
data which is like I said it has a very
powerful data visualizing what exactly
you're looking here is a plot that
represents we charge it by just looking
at you can just tell we are looking at a
Canada map here right or something of
that sort right I mean so we're looking
at the Toronto map rather actually right
and it's so and what it is actually
showing as is all the traffic signals
right is what we are looking at its over
rate and it pulls this all this
information right out from the data
right and the entire structure of the
city comes in so it's like that powerful
we are talking about in terms of the so
you can just see in the previous slide
we just saw that means applying as
advanced algorithm clustering is what we
did and here we're looking at an
advanced visualization right so that is
the power of this language and it's so
easy in fact for that matter if you look
at the the way this thing is built it
will be again one single line as what it
takes for you to build is actually
alright so R has that capability as well
very powerful visualization as well and
so that's about the R and again coming
back to the topic the data science what
is that right so it's a common term
where people say right so okay if you
take an example of we know we all know
Flipkart
I'm sorry we all know you know like the
Netflix right and we all know Amazon
movies cube we also have starts movies
and all that and we all know the IMDB so
a lot of movie recommendations out there
right so now you can see these movie
recommendation they want to improve and
they get when you compare they kind of
looks more 1 and compared one to the
other the lot of movies are
recommendations if it looks much better
that reason being they get more and more
better it's because the more and more
data so algorithm is best only when you
have more data to it all right so the
more data usually beats better algorithm
it's not that a better algorithm makes
better results right so the algorithm to
be better you need more data right
because we're talking about
always remember that again more data
necessarily does not mean that all the
data are good data right it could be
that you have a terabyte of data and 500
rows it doesn't mean that every
information is valuable for you it could
be so that only half of it is valuable
by
when we say more data we also mean the
fact that more relevant data right so
let's say for example you NSA kind of
uses click streams right in terms of try
you know like understanding would you be
doing when your general browser right
the behavior or maybe even organizations
are started do you use the click streams
nowadays right to understand the
behavior of a customer in a website
actually right and so it essentially you
kind of stole every stroke of the
customer every move within the page
right now all this is not gonna
necessarily help you only certain things
like when he actually you know clicks a
particular button or you know changes
the font is what is going to be relevant
for you so that you understand the
person whom we are the reason why he
does it is because he's not comfortable
with the font size of it right or he he
does the maximization because it doesn't
automatically happen right so that's why
we talking about so so no matter how you
algorithm is it can be just simply the
right data makes your algorithm
sophisticated looks sophisticated that's
what happens with the recommendation
engines as well person ask questions can
be embedded the scripting language like
Python for data extraction from social
media in are yes simple as that
that's the power of art it has every
plugin recommendations yeah I mean this
is every plugin and all that chicken use
you have something called our Python
which you can use it and simply use that
within your arm yes is the answer now so
when we look at what constitutes the
steal signs what are the things which
are involved right what does it take to
understand or involves in terms of job
and tasks of a data science and we were
talking about many things if you
remember the first like we talked about
storing Massie Wally watch data right
and
we talked about processing this data and
analyzing this data and taking a meaning
out of it and predicting something and
also in the terms of the stage we looked
at him we said we were trying to explore
this data right so what so if you talked
about all these various things which I
just mentioned is processing this data
so we know that the data comes in many
ways in these days and we're talking
essentially about the big data right so
I'm storing and processing this data in
walls something called data and it's all
part of something computations and which
is nothing but data engineering is what
we are talking about right some various
sources desperate desperate data as such
and all that right now to store this
data and process this data we're talking
about massive parallel processing or
distributed computing and all that is
basically was required massive brands
and processors and infrastructure is
what we are since you're talking about
right it data scientists or data science
involvement is there an advanced
computing as well right now in addition
to these two things once you process
store write this data and extract this
data and analyze this data as where you
start to apply certain knowledge and
mathematical statistics as such so there
is an advanced need for and usage for
statistics mathematics as such right and
to put this all together in a very good
perspective right is the fact of knowing
what you are doing right so what is your
business
what is the one big question you wanted
answer what is the one big problem you
want to solve just the would way I
talked about as long as you determine
the fact you wanted to solve the problem
in school admission or the class at
or you know developing a new type of bus
if that is what is what you wanted to
solve a problem that is solve the
problem of the population by developing
a new type of bus and how do you do it
essentially do that you gotta have
something called German expertise as
strong as you are expert in that
particular domain this whole data
science is not going to help because
that is where the roof thatÃ­s when you
start is to apply because you're not
going to go anywhere at all when you
actually start this whole data center
and so in addition to the data
engineering advanced computing
statistics and all that what is most
important is the domain expertise all
right so that being said one big piece
whom do you do all this spot right so do
you do this
though you have a knowledge of
statistics to mine experience data
engineering advanced computing at the
end of the day if you look at what we
saw in the earlier right the last thing
is you gain this knowledge you build an
insight now where does this inside go
right who is consuming this insight who
is using it and what they are using it
for there's going to be a guy who is
sitting on top of the organization
there's going to be a guy who's sitting
and saying echo you know what I make the
call right so there are these executors
who are the one who have to look it and
they have to be you know they have to
agree they have to take the bite right
if they have to take the BAI they have
to agree to it and you have to sell off
to them you have to put it in the way
they understand this so you take this
statistics what we're looking at back to
him and saying hey I found this now can
you implement this right I predicted
this can you implement you know what he
will not agree to it okay so you predict
it so what right now that is where the
most important piece comes into the
picture and the whole data science is
just called visualization right so human
human takes many things so easily when
you visualize it images all this thing's
what makes
human even more right so if you look at
the number and you foo the way he
conceives the number you know how he
conceives not by looking at the number
not by knowing what it is what does it
mean by looking at the image of the
number right so ash realization is the
key part because that is where at the
end of the day all your data signs work
are consumed or rather is fruitful
because that is what an executor looks
at it and say ah yeah I see the
breakthrough now and I see what is going
to happen right I understand what is
happening and what we need to do right
so visualization tells a lot of story
and you tell the story through
visualization so these are the key
components of your data science so data
engineering is where you all your when
you say storage and process your hadoop
comes into the picture again how does
being a distributed computing is where
your advanced computing comes into the
picture so that may be how to spark
storm or whatever it may be and that
type of the mind which you work in there
is the industry knowledge automobile
sports right finance banking and finance
FMCG right arrow whatever it may be
right as long as you have the kind of
knowledge you'll not be able to solve
the problem right and applying a certain
techniques algorithm right you need to
know that right and finally you need to
take the results and put it in a form
where it is understandable it's somebody
who is going to make the decision out of
it and if you look at the type of demand
in terms of this skill set we talked
about by looking at the previous picture
right you can understand the various
type of things which are involved right
one we're talking about one person who
is like diversified and all this like
you know those days we used to say jack
off all master of none right so here
it's not the case you got to be jack of
all and master of everything that's what
the big data kind of starts to emphasize
on right talking about guy good and
visualization and talking about guys is
good and data engineering you know guy
who's good and algorithm building
algorithms and you're talking about a
guy who's very good in various domains
talking about a guy who's good in an
advanced computing right and also you
know it's not this you put the
visualization you're gonna pass of that
guy who's sitting the executive and say
you know he needs to buy in right son
you gotta why who gonna be communicating
it so you should be the end of the day
you should be able to communicate back
articulate what you did actually right
so this is what gardeners say is Big
Data create big job 4.4 million 90 jobs
globally and there's a link towards that
and this is the report of the big data
sits gap 2/3 of big desk is requirements
and automate your lack of skilled
professional that's we can see lot of
universities and all that have started
and and even they have started part of
the curriculum itself right there
education fundamentals it says only
one-third is what we are looking at of
the as being supplied out and again if
you look at the type of vacancies we are
talking about now what has happened is
this big data and data science standard
grade various types of job it's not that
you're going to be a guy who's gonna
always build an algorithm right building
an algorithm could be one person right
and being a data engineer that is the
storage processing this could be one
person's job all right and and the guy
who works in building this visualization
would be like so those are the
situations where a person who's a bi
essentially he develops his skill to the
next stage where he minds to the Big
Data and starts to visualize from that
right so I'm reporting he goes to
advanced visualization right a guy who's
been doing a data warehousing goes from
working from a traditional db2 toe all
the way the Hadoop storage right the guy
who's been building a web based
architecture that goes on to build and
distributed computing architecture right
a guy who's been just a quantitative
analyst goes on to become an analyst
who's even beyond that I mean like it's
still whatever y'all got even built and
all that right data signs are nothing
but if you in my words I always feel
that this is something she's been there
earlier even it is there something which
is what like you know companies like
Morgan Stanley or you know JP Morgan or
banking structures all they've been
using this and what they call this
quantitative analyst maybe they not been
mining through massive data set but that
is what they do that's the biggest
difference as actually it does it the
involvement of various various different
tool sets all right because that's the
difference from those days to now and
the big data itself is nothing but new
appliances new applications rather than
and and new appliances applications and
world problems so to speak right so this
is a trend which we are looking at the
data scientist right as far as job
Prince is concerned way the back there's
a pretty old slight but you can you can
still I don't think it would have
dripped it here it still you know gone
something like this also probably right
so we looked at the component right so
we when we talk about data science when
you talk about the the you know putting
the components such as data engineering
advanced computing and the statistics
and all those in visualization and other
words and in a much more you know like a
broader tongue so to speak or in terms
of aligning it more in terms of the
tools and techniques for data
engineering advanced computing
visualization and for statistic
analytics the way how we can pull this
for all your data engineering needs the
data architecture involves tools such as
Hadoop for your processing storage when
it comes to analyzing write analyzing
exploring it right when you put connect
the dots when it comes to your data and
like data mining right the stages of
analytics in terms of your selecting
your data processing pre-processing your
data transforming your data all these
things you essentially do it through
your analytics tools such as our right
and then when you build your model that
is identify the pattern
and evaluated is where you apply your
mission learnings where you apply your
actual algorithms on a big dealer scale
you use something like asthma hoot or
MLM or whatever it is and there are so
many other things like know there's a we
just did is listed Mahavira there's so
many other says well actually and
finally to visualize it you either use
our I'll use other you know we're data
visualization tools I mean it could be
in a programming language it with each
reader jeaious or it could be a tableau
or anything else for that matter
actually so for the big data appliances
there's so many different tools is
actually right and so I mean just just
to so um so when I tick that this is
just something which is should want to
quickly share and in the same way like
so this is an example of the ecosystem
right if this is for the door it is for
the kind of the Hadoop ecosystems or
something which you can say but still
you know when it comes to data
acquisition think you know processing or
putting your data these are the various
vendors what we are talking about right
and when you talk about martin data
mashups or data you know like
transformations and all those things in
the big data world right so these are
the data provider so to speak right
these are the plate orga various
organizations in terms of your no sequel
or any dear storage and all those things
when it comes to this is like they also
have this because like CP is nothing but
complex even crossings are nothing but
your streaming data right where you know
like when the data comes lassen screen
and when it comes to analytics like you
know justice are there's so many other
two sets right but are being the open
source and comparison to the other as we
speak again for data visualizations
there are so many other tools which are
there for data visualization I mean
sorry data which realizations in terms
of like you know
advanced computing right when I talked
about advanced computing we are talking
about these data visualizations tools
and organizations such and it comes to
the BI tools right whether may be data
visualisations or something even more
asset and other business risk management
in actions as such as these are the
biggest vendors were talking about so
this is a consider this is a vendor
landscape what we're looking at for
various data science jobs or data
science lifecycle as we just saw it
right in terms of data acquisitions or
data transformations pre-processing
validations and all those things as such
all right
now what do you want to talk about this
right why do you want to talk about how
to pan are together right so the reason
being that you know how do is become a
synonymous when you talk about Big Data
right when you talk about storing big
data right and when you talk about
analytics we talked about are all right
so putting it all both this together how
it is happening so there's a company
called revolution analytics they were
the one who came up with a set of bunch
of libraries package so to speak it's an
open source which is available in
through cran and they call it as our
Hadoop and so this our Hadoop fundable
he has three packages the RMR is for the
MapReduce fundamentally they apply the
MapReduce technique computation paradigm
which is applied in rmr package and
library the our HDFS helps to manipulate
access the HDFS from our and I get our
hedge space is the same for accessing
them and and you know providing act
other things such as data retrieval data
storage to HBase from our right the
HBase data management from that so
that's Hadoop and are together so
revolutionary takes the organization who
came up with this our Hadoop which
essentially does that and they do have
the commercial version of R as well in
the sense they essentially they have
many what AMS tissue Dinah's like you
know they have they have the parallel
processing and other things and packages
capturing to the enterprise
in addition to the open source and they
do the supports and all that actually
right and they have quite a few
algorithms which are implemented which
does the parallel processing and all do
and and this revolutionary tix is now a
Microsoft company right and machine
learning so there was a question on
machine learning I believe like so
machine learnings there's so many
different algorithms for data imaging
which can be used to build the systems
and essentially they're nothing but read
you pass data and predict your future
and essentially you know like there are
so many different algorithms which comes
part of a machine learning which we look
into later right but machine learning
nothing but focuses basically on you
know something where the system learns
it by itself and keeps growing it itself
where it's something is what you call it
as artificial instruments right and when
a new data is exposed it knows what to
do because it has trained itself based
on the past right so it take your
training data apply the algorithm and
build the model that's what you do and
in general machine learnings are
classified into two right in terms of
learning one is your supervised learning
and supervised learning so supervised
learning is where you have a known data
set right where there are labels and
simple as that right so where for
example when I say when I have a cream
right and I say this cream is chocolate
tomorrow is he and and and I say it's in
this color except drag cetera so you
come up with a new cream altogether
tomorrow and based on what it you know
it looks into right from the past it
understood from what it is it can tell
what this cream is right and because you
said what the scream was and how it
looks and that is what you call it a
super wisely learning right so they are
nothing but a known data set to make
predictions training data set includes
input data and the response value so
when you train the machine you already
give the information as to what this is
the response value also so from it the
supervised learning algorithm builds a
model to make
diction of the response value for the
new dataset when it comes to
unsupervised learning
it draws inference from the data set
based on certain patterns within that
right certain the way the data looks
like so it used for exploratory data
analysis where in you you would be able
to find some hidden patterns or groups
within the data right so the most common
ansible is learning method is a cluster
analysis right where you kind of group
things right you cluster put people into
certain bucket for example high income
low income right so when you have a data
of all the people who are earning right
so you just take the data and you
understand the pattern within that right
the hidden patterns within that and you
start bucketing them so that's basically
is unsupervised learning and that's what
that algorithm doesn't specifically the
cluster does that again this is a list
where it is not a full list it's not a
comparing this it's just a small snippet
you can call it us when it comes to
supervised learning and unsupervised
learning some of the techniques which
are used right Navy bias is a very
popular in terms of spam filtering even
Google uses it right and every spam
filter in the world uses Navy bias which
is lazy techniques you can call theirs
SVM's
which is where you know Netflix is using
recommendation engine random forests in
addition trees of classification
examples k-means clustering fussy
hierarchical all part of your clustering
analysis techniques as such right
now let's run into quickly in demo right
wherein I demonstrate we're in a
demonstrate you know how to do a
sentiment analysis right and we take an
example of Zomato ratings review right
and and and we'll let let's quickly look
into it and before that this is the you
know like as you know this is a verb I
nor the actual course from the edge.a
Rekha involves all this there are nine
modules which are involved which takes
you way the journey
from the introduction of your data
science getting more to learn about the
data and how do you manipulate the data
and more of machine learning techniques
right you will be learning about how to
do clusterings all those things which
you looked at right so posturings and
support learning and Su boys learn and
some of the techniques have you built it
to it through art we learn how about
Hadoop learn how to bark attack sure and
we'll be looking and you'll be looking
into how our and Hadoop are integrated
together and how and and also the you
know how mahute is built and all that so
that's what the entire data science
courses packed up that in the iterator
courses and concern all right and yeah
and there's a final project which hints
you that certification as such right so
now let's look into the demo quickly how
about the movie rating and so as where
the data is concerned this is the data
which we are looking at so it has all
the location restaurent
and the comments by the you know the in
the website what are the come what about
the comments given by the you know the
moviegoers and all that so now
essentially what we're trying to do is
we're trying to us I mean this rather
like you know the restaurant and not not
sorry not the movie rather the comments
given for the restaurant and what are we
going to do is do a sentiment analysis
of all this unstructured data as such
right so that's just what we're trying
to do here
so essentially you know this is the
structure of the data right all of these
are factors and finally this is where
your unstructured data is right and so
we have the positive and negative you
know like data has such with this right
so and we are loading the positive and
negative dictionary so to speak right
the positive and negative dictionaries
and then we are identifying the
polarization of these words positive and
the negative
right and and then essentially stuffy
are writing our own function sure this
is the function which essentially
identifies the sentiment over the
unstructured data right the based on the
dictionary what we did right so so we're
creating a vector and then we're going
through every words right and based on
every words based on the dictionary
knowing what does the you know the
sentiment polarization for that we are
actually scoring them I said right for
the entire data right so for the entire
data we are actually performing thee for
the entire data what we saw for all this
we are performing this sentiment as such
right and once we are done with the
sentiments coding right now what we are
doing is we are visualizing it right
okay sorry about it so system when we
the entire thing was generated in source
so you can see that the sentiment scores
done for every thing in the data right
so we're talking about 175 observations
for all of 175 observation we have the
sentiments code follows away in the
restaurant and who have actually
provided the feedback and we're trying
to visualize it right as I said it's a
great visualization we are not we are
just using a very standard visualize
you're sure what we're looking at is a
simple histogram from the entire data
set right so we're looking at the entire
population what is the so we're talking
about of how 275 customers close to your
about hundred customers falls within the
range of 0 to 5 all right so that's you
know close to the family positive or
rather like you know you can call it as
a neutral depends upon what the scales
are right and also we can look at in a
tabular form that right and this is what
we are actually looking at in terms of a
tabular format
from the scale of minus five to twenty
seven you can see like a lot of them as
we know right between zero to Phi is
watch they take lot of them fall within
this range that hundred right so the
same thing visualizing also looking in a
tablet format so this is an example of
sentiment analysis using the art tool
where we process the data applied an
algorithm to it and also visualized it
okay now let's take up the questions
whatever people hancher right okay so
starting from the question with I think
JSON yeah
oh sorry but I think I'm done with JSON
I'm gonna start with neon eeshwar I'm
walking a Joe j2e from six years can I
have data sciences materials from your
own with absolutely you can have you can
you'd at any point of time there's
nothing like you know I about me like I
have 15 years of experience and I'll be
doing data science for the last five
years or effort so if I put that into
the picture I started my career of the
earth mines from the 11th year onwards
so you know like so you can consider
that I've been working on the data
engineering advanced computing and as
such now and of course videos to my
knowledge
now why fulfill the rest of the other
parts which is basically you know my
statistical and also the you know the
the visualizations as well actually
right so this does it rather I would say
it's it's good now rather than later
right are we so Jason asked what are the
major analytics used but the so many
techniques but when it comes to machine
learning is what we actually looked into
now people turn into clusterings when it
comes to customer segmentation when it
comes to you know like movie their movie
ratings and all those things they look
into recommender systems right there
flicks
Maison you can see all the amazing
recommendations all use the same
recommendation and they use a profile
Gordon and in other words they call it
as Market Basket analysis that's a
technique which is used findability you
thing and chi-square is JSON it's like
it's a basic so to speak the chi-square
itself was used to build something
called chide analysis is where it is
used in terms of predictions where and
more of it it's an algorithm which is
actually used where you can also give a
very descriptive information right there
people when people use a logistic
regression right the where you say
whether this person is going to buy this
or not
right Shawn unload he's going to churn
or not churn same way and use care trade
analysis to tell but then he's going to
churn or not and the same time why you
think he's going to churn right because
it that's worth it so there's so many
different algorithms for for many
different business keys or uses so
that's why the knowledge of statistical
techniques in many mathematical
techniques and all that will be able to
help you to derive and again a pure
quantitative techniques or a guy who's a
data scientist who was more into the
statistics and all that will even build
is one algorithm so to speak right and
guy who's very very very advanced so to
speak would transformation also involve
opening or I answered this question
Manish can we embed the scripting
language like Python for data extraction
from social media and yard yeah I
answered it yes and can we integrate our
with Hadoop HDFS a high-wage space I
think we just saw it
you have our Hadoop from revolutionary
ethics and yes pretty much yes you can
do that right and so for hive even you
can just use a simple rodbc you don't
even need anything like our hive or
anything like that
ODB see within the art is more than
enough to pull data from hive actually
right I'm doing research and machine
learning which book material you
recommend for that how do I be expert on
machine learning which are maybe the
step
I should follow okay see some of the
things which helps you to become a data
scientists or even get into the machine
learning and all that I uh as I said
there's so many different books starting
from introductions statistical learning
is cell you call it as and again you
have so many books and machine learning
and in addition to that actually I would
recommend you to take you know like also
look into Coursera's are at the same
time look into register yourself in
Kegel contests and start looking into
many of the things and start learning
that as such and there is a cycle
statistics comma again they have
extensive thing and of course uh you
know Harvard and Stanford all has their
you know CS courses which again you know
helps in in-depth learning of machine
learning right as such when it comes to
your thesis PhDs and all those things as
such and how analytics is different from
statistics now see right the analytics
are nothing but you know is basically
your end result right and what happens
is what happens is you use certain
techniques right and that techniques is
nothing but statistics or any
mathematical right so analysis is what
you do right analytics are nothing but
analysis wait what what do you how do
you do analysis you apply certain
techniques such as statistics using
Stata such as machine learning rather
right such as machine learnings or
artificial intelligence or certain
algorithms such as all whatever we spoke
so analytics is the N is the process so
to speak right and statistics are the
techniques are the methods
which are used basically right and deep
I think we showed some our code and this
is a verb by now mind you so you're like
and I believe you would be you know
happy that at the end of the thing it
was not just a theoretical session it
was a demonstrate there was a
demonstration of the art code I think we
measured in the earlier right and what
we did was a sentimental analysis on a
risk unstructured data right I know when
they are programming and data science
machine learning that's nationally so
water Hadoop knowing is necessary can
you join industry early with our data
science is machine learning
well Hadoop is necessary yes because
we're talking about you know looking at
vast amount of data and deriving
something so looking at just a data
we're like you know a few rest I may say
for example like you're trying to build
that is where you're as as you know like
we looked at in the slide and where we
said and algorithm is good mainly when
there is more data right so let's say
you are trying to imply an Market Basket
analysis to build a recommendation
system right your recommendation system
is not going to be good or efficient
until unless you look at the data and
the whole entire world and analyze many
many different factors and and put it
into a two and build your model and
evaluated so yes
knowing learning Hadoop is important in
this data science world and what does it
do in the Hadoop world you will store
the data and extract the data and
transform this data all these three
things you would do in the hood of would
and you can write algorithms in machine
learning in our nation are Python Giulia
and even you can do it in Java but it's
gonna be very complex Kayla and all
those things to ever known to know the
list of companies
officially unfortunately I can't
provided kunti like there are so many
you can could any portal job portal
there's so many companies search for
data science and other takes big data
and everything is this is an opportunity
what algorithm was applied here in
sentiment analysis you wrote your own
function yo all you did was you wrote
your own function and and that's all you
did here but again you can also use and
you know techniques such as Navy bias to
do it but we are just showing that it's
limitless you can do anything you want
but in this case there was no specific
algorithm was used it was simply built
on three things one is you had a
dictionary of positive and negative
words and you know you wrote your own
function to look into every single word
and look into the polarization and score
it okay so that is what you did you in
this case right and which university do
you recommend best for data science that
depends upon what money you can put if
you are in India you know I am hazard
you know like and is B has it so if you
can show off some good amount of money
you can get it from these two
universities and this a come there's a
you know Institute at the Hyderabad call
in Sophie I sure and abroad you know
like the US of course Stanford has it
Harvard assert Northwestern University
as it even fact for the man you can't
even do your masters masters in
predictive science masters and big data
and all that actually pretty much in a
broad every university starts to build
it as part of the earth as a set
education regular day to the curriculum
says how to use this sentiment scores to
demand forecasting in retail as I said
yes you can use the centum
course and you can use your market
basket analysis or a trophy and all that
it'll be combination of more than one
techniques together right so that's
where if you remember when we looked in
the data science thing right and when
you transform this data and you look for
the pattern so with the data side with
this and that sentiment analysis you see
some pattern then you can say
essentially as we saw that 0 to 50 is 0
to 5 we saw people wear clustered in
that particular group you can just take
them as a sample right you take that as
a sample and which are positive
customers and you add group the rest are
those into some others so essentially
you do the clustering over there and
then you can start applying a predictive
algorithms it could be anything right
and here in terms of demanding your
forecasting here you can use your time
series so now the same thing what howard
is over a period of time and you build
using so you use ARIMA right auto
regression in moving average and then
you can do a forecasting on that right
so in terms of forecasting all that you
can build time series analysis and you
can do that right they brush that'll be
the best way to do it in this particular
scenario what is the difference between
business analytics and data analytics
there are so many different names right
the one of the mean the same you know at
the end of the day even a business
analytic analysis guy or a data analyst
guy are going to look into data data and
essentially he's going to do all those
things which we looked into the pass of
the kdd ok Hadoop's role is just to
store the data rest are all done through
analytics tools such as SAS or nowadays
SAS is order also like you know pulls
data from you know like Hadoop Hadoop
braless Hadoop which is storage yes and
also for elt not ETL extraction load
transformation how do pose more alt okay
have some say a same question had an
experience of and now looking to break
in rates okay I think I've answered it
at any point of time in your career you
can drink through and get into this so
you would be using your
past and present actually right so I'm
skipping few of the questions which are
repeated which I have already answered
can you be the strategy book related
with that book I should follow they can
go with men there are many statistics
book preliminary you can start with you
know like this guy's who's this the
O'Reilly has a book write data analysis
and then there is this this oral ebook
with how it has all these images right
they they have this head first
head first has this book on data
analytics right on statistics that's a
great book to start with gay book online
and there's a great book called if you
are interested in the way what is taught
in the university there is a book called
data and models and the best book I will
also recommend this is El introduction
to statistical learning that's a great
book to start with as well
right below training is not have to grab
data said Canada like it has to do ten
projects well see I mean more and more
practice makes you perfect right so
essentially all this whatever you learn
it's going to be a pinch of assault and
you need to learn a lot I think I have
another picture here to help you up show
you
it's a journey for for that matter right
you know just if I I mean we're running
out of time but essentially like you
know just go on google it and search for
data science journey and you would see a
you know more like a you know like train
map right train journey map and you can
see like there is a like in journeys or
ten steps which you have to take it to
do it actually for data science what
ecosystems are part of this record is
Map Reduce is not Map Reduce is not
enough you can do data science is big
you can do data signs and hype not the
complete data science has to building
algorithm but even for that matter anger
is a data science for that matter right
working on unstructured can do it in
HBase that is the solar where you can
essentially do searching right where it
has Lda in LSA in kind of things and and
you know like there are other things
within the Hadoop ecosystem nowadays
think mahute MLM all these are
ecosystems right but for machine
learning though is you have the yes we
should this is recorded and it will be
available in twenty first time why are
why not SAS simple SAS is commercial
licensed and there are so many different
things are is open-source and it has all
the latest
pocky latest algorithms and techniques
right and and SAS takes a lot of time
for certain algorithms to be released as
such what may be the salary for data
scientist beginning levels with PhD in
computer science depends right I can
give you anyway from there are people
who might know even learning 200 to 250
K there are people who are earning even
100k so it depends it's all your
negotiation skills I would say with the
directory created using LDAP not sure
which was a dictionary created using
LDAP no it was not I think it was openly
available there's a lot of dictionaries
which are available in the you know in
the internet which you can use to the
negative one positive and you have it
from the Stanford library as well can
our load data from Oracle yes as I said
doesn't something called ODBC rodbc you
can use it and load it from anywhere my
cql Oracle whatever it is how our cloud
era certificate optionally descends
compared to a rake of course is it
comparable or can one of them be termed
as a step stone to other this is a step
stone to that but essentially the say
for example it's a combination of many
like if you take the Hadoop course from
Mandy Rekha and your did it this course
from AJ Rekha all this would help you
and additionally you need lot for
example clowder is certified you need to
read through the Hadoop definite guide
fourth edition book right and
essentially you know walk through many
of the ecosystem which are their
practical and then that helps you to you
get you that I'm in verge of completing
PhD specialization of machine learning
want to join companies also acting as a
stem professor salary is petitioner
they'll be please tell me and moniece
experiment will it be more yes of course
I think you are the very much of a basic
level and again a bit of experience view
as I said kaggle context attracts a
trend negotiation you can do more and
Oracle shows down while handing a large
dataset how are can we fit data why are
could one would be very slow yes that's
why you need Hadoop right and so that's
where you can actually you know break
down the latency right because har
itself is an in-memory that is where you
also need the revolution Alaric's so
that it can be parallelized okay okay so
we're running out of when we ran out of
time I won't be able to unless take more
questions unfortunately I'm just taking
one last question from Prasanna what is
the scope of doing an MS in business
intelligent analytics I thought I
answered some scope is very high do it
now
that's what I would say right and and
and and it is great even if you are
working so that it can put it both
digits together and I think it's a USP
which you would have in the corporate
world and thank you thank you everyone I
hope you enjoyed the session and this is
just a print of a salt of what you can
and and there is more to it and whatever
it is practice practice practice and
read read read read that's how you can
actually you know like not one class one
session at all can you know teach you
everything so take this a pinch of salt
and start doing that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
