session you're going to discuss about or
we are going to discuss rather about the
new features of turbo 9 i'm going to go
through each and every slide and also we
are going to correspondingly look into
that particular option in tableau these
are the various concepts which we are
going to briefly discuss upon because
given one hour we cannot cover all the
new features of tableau 9 that would be
close to impossible right so we look
into all these features which are listed
down on the slide we will look into how
to make a direct connection with any of
the statistical packages where that
option is available how to split the
data columns what are the new features
of tableau discover side menu how to
connect to the various data sources and
we'll see why the tooltip in tableau 9
is extremely fast we will do some kind
of data interpretation tableau is
intelligent in doing this and then we'll
see last but not the least which is a
radial and lasso selection in tableau 9
all these are the new features in the do
cause of showing these new features i
would also like to show you the existing
features and on top of that use the new
feature options and show how it works
alright and at the end of each topic i'm
going to show tableau and the
visualization on the option in tableau
push which I and at the end of the
session right I'll give you good 15-20
minutes time to ask me questions all
right let's move on so this is the new
feature of tableau 9 wherein you can
connect to a lot of statistical packages
you can say in the past you have been
using SAS which is a statistical package
right you can call in the files which
are created using SAS
into tableau and start visualizing that
SPSS if you are using IBM SPSS as a
statistical to you can call this
particular file dot a say we into
tableau and start visualizing that and
the same holds good with your our
package also our tool sorry if you are
using our whatever file you probably
create as part of using are you can call
those files into our into tableau and
start visualizing that let me show you
where that option resides in tableau the
moment you open tableau this is the view
that you are going to see within this
you have a lot of options to connect to
a variety of your files for example you
can connect your txt file you can
connect your excel file if you have any
MX access file you can connect to that
right and here is a new feature called
statistical fine when we are doing when
we do a drop down on this you see all
these extinctions this means that if you
are using any one of these statistical
tools you can call in these files into
tableau to do a good visualization and
also there
lot of service to which you can connect
to and let me show you a file once again
click on the stop and let me search for
download and here you have our and
tableau integration there you I'm
clicking on yes right now just give me a
minute while this opens up so let me
show you how this statistical package
integration happens right so I'm into
something called as outlier new don't
worry about that because I should start
our start are so and things like that
let me right click on this calculated
field and click on edit so this code
which are seeing here is the code which
is written in our our is a statistical
tool by the way right so the code which
you use in our the code which you use in
size you can use that in tableau and do
the same thing with your our or any of
your statistical packages do that is one
good part about tableau so back to our
discussion that's a feature number one
so you have a bunch of statistical
packages and you can connect to any of
these second good option here is
splitting your data columns say you have
a column and you want to split that
right how do you do that let me show you
in tableau once sir
lo has to default data sources which are
available for you to access let me click
on sample superstore yeah we have
connected to this in bill data source in
our if I drag customer name and drop on
say rose just for an example you see
that each customer has the first name
and the last name what if i want to have
two different columns first column
should see the first name and the next
column should say the last name how do i
do that so let me remove this customer
name i simply right click on customer
nien and there is this new option called
transform you go to transform and say
split there you go tableau has
automatically split into two columns
this one column called customer name got
split into two columns what information
resides in this customer name split one
let me drag this dimension and drop it
on the Rose Shelf you see all the first
names of the customers appearing here
right these are all your first names now
let us drag and Rob the customer name
split two from the dimensions view to
your rows shelf once again oh sorry or
let me remove the customer name split
one so here if you see split to these
names are your last names so one simple
click has ensured that a particular
column got split into two logically
based on some logic right it doesn't do
that on the flight they
some logic to split the data you can
also do a custom split that means you
can go to transform right click on any
of your dimensions go to transform and
click on custom split if I click on this
you see that you can split based on dash
comma semicolon cool and dot space and
all that and here you are mentioning
that you want to split off the first
column based on one of these separators
or you can split the last one or all
things like that this is yet another new
feature in tableau which makes your life
extremely easy right if you want to
split the reader now let me go back to
the tableau deck once again and let us
run through the next so this is the same
visualization right which we have done
just right click on dimension name go to
transform and click on split you can
also do a custom split here in tableau 9
for the first time right this there is a
right menu on the right side you'll have
these options you'll have something
called as discover within which you'll
have the training videos which are meant
for the freshers so if you're a newbie
to tableau and if you want to learn the
basic things of tableau you can use
these videos and also you will have the
visualization of the week so people keep
working on tableau there's something
called as tableau public which is free
for your download and use however not
all features would be available in that
but you can generate so basic
visualizations UK
publish those visualizations that you
perform at you RN and showcase your
skills to the entire world based on how
popular your visualization becomes how
many people are accessing how many
people are liking that on facebook how
many people are tweeting on that based
on all these metrics are measures if
yours is the best visualization that
would appear on tableau and on a weekly
basis it's changes look at the singapore
private properties market this was when
we have taken the screenshot but if you
see now as of today i think there would
be a different visualization so here i
am on tableau if you go on to go back to
your home screen which appears when you
open your tableau the very first time
you need to simply click on this icon
there on the left top corner right let
me click on that there you go previously
the visualization which I've shown you
on the screen shot was some singapore
data set based on that right now here it
is french high school outcome indicators
you have a visualization here and then
you have the resources various forums so
when is the tableau conference going to
happen so on and so forth okay so back
to our presentation slide so this is yet
another new feature of tableau and here
in tableau eight it was very cumbersome
in the sense that when you click on
connect to a server you had to manually
scroll and see where your server or
database of interest recites right you
had to manually do a search now this is
a new feature which you can see in
tableau so figure
habla now if I click on more servers you
see the search option so you can search
a database or a server of your choice
and it's very easy that is what this new
feature is all about because you have a
lot of databases lot of a different
service available here okay going back
to the presentation deck once again to
show you another new feature which is
called as tooltip and trust me it's
lightning fast super responsive let me
show this on tableau right in tableau
eight right when you hold your tool tip
and leave it like that the pop-up would
appear for eight seconds and disappear
however in tableau nine the moment you
hover your tool tip you're over your
mouse pointer on a particular data point
the information about that data point
would appear endlessly and also it's
super fast extremely fast with no lag
absolutely so let me show you that now
let me go to the tableau and I'm connect
design I'm connecting to sample
superstore let me create a new sheet and
let us first create a scatter plot and
then I'm going to explain about the
responsiveness of pointers or your mouth
when you who were right so I'm dragging
profit measure and wrapping on the
columns I am now dropping sales measure
on two rows shelf you see only single
value here because the information is
aggregated if I wanted
segregate that all i have to do is go to
analysis and uncheck this option which
is called as aggregate measures and here
you will see all the values which are
disaggregated now if i hold my mouse on
any of the data points and leave it like
that in the previous versions it would
disappear within eight seconds not
within eight seconds after eight seconds
this pop-up would disappear however in
tableau 9 it would constantly appear in
that way now let me hover my mouse to
the other data points do you see any lag
absolutely it's super fast look at that
look in that it's not even taking a
split second right that's a good part
right the moment you hover your mouse
you'll be able to see the information
pertaining to that particular data point
let me go back to the presentation dick
you can create this kind of a
visualization and also hold your mouse
in that and you know see how fast your
mouse pointer whoring is you can create
a world map you can use a map to create
your visualization and try to hover your
mouse that is also extremely fast so let
us do even this part now here I go to
tableau I am creating a new worksheet
you need to select latitude and
longitude by pressing your ctrl key
click on
my panel and by default if you see there
is a blue border here for this
visualization and that is called as your
default visualization to stop so tableau
is intelligent enough to identify which
visualization you have to use given the
data right so I'm clicking on that it
has created a world map you need to be
connected to internet to view
visualization of maps now let me drag
and drop state dimension to the detailed
option here you see that United States
and all the various states have zoomed
up now right and what if I want to view
profit by state all I do is drag profit
measure to the color pain and drop it
there and you see this visualization if
I start hovering my mouse it is so fast
that you'll not be able to find any
difference right it's not even taking a
split second to change the values when I
over from one state to another and this
is what is called a super responsive
option in tableau now let us go back to
the presentation let us discuss more
things there is one good option in
tableau called as data interpretation
what if the data that you are dealing
with in tableau has some null values
doesn't have any values in that by
default tableau will fill that
particular cell with null option right
now let us do this also in tableau and
see how it works
the tableau let me open new sheet here
if you want to connect to a different
data set all you need to do is click on
this icon which says add new data source
or you can press control D on your
keyboard and let me connect to the exle
and let me connect to the story points
Nobel laureate I just double click on
that once I double click on this data
set is going to take me to this view
wherein I need to drag and drop the
information different tables into this
pain here which is dragged sheets here
so let me first drag final data or
florets all is well now let me drag info
here okay this doesn't work once again
let me drag laureates per capita and
drop now let me drag info and draw
uh-huh I think this data set is okay
there is no error absolutely happening
here so let me redo it in a different
way and see quickly again nothing is
happening right so I think right
previously I have done this and I've
ensured that these errors do not appear
that is the reason why it's not
appearing but let me use a slide to show
you that so when you drag and drop the
various tables which you want to use for
your visualization in tableau tableau is
going to throw this message and say that
data does not look right do you want a
blow to interpret this do you want W to
help you if you say
turn on if you click on this tableau is
going to do some changes to the null
values and what changes the tableau do
on the null values if you want to view
that you need to click on review results
if you click on review results you'll be
able to see what changes tableau has
automatically done on your null values
and this is a good feature of tableau 9
and when you click on review results you
will be redirected to an excel sheet and
how does that excel sheet look like like
this right it says that data is
interpreted as column headers if that is
the case you would see this red icon
green icon if you see feel that data is
interpreted as values in your data
source and this is the end result of
data interpretation in tableau last but
not the least option here is radial and
lasso selection icons now here let us
once again do a visualization using
tableau this time we'll create a similar
kind of visualization a Walmart but
different values right so how do i
create a map here i need to click on
latitude and longitude expand the show
me panel and click on right cymbal map
now let me drag and wrap state here on
detail there you go right let me drag
and drop also sales to the size
hey guys is my wife's not audible please
confirm is my wife's audible audible
right so most of the people say it's
audible com alotta so I request you to
check your connection at urine probably
there's a problem at urine okay so I
have these circles which are nothing but
my profits our sales for the various
states you can increase the size
decrease the size so let me increase now
is there any question know everyone says
it's not perfect perfect guys so there
is a small play option there if you
hover your mouse on that you'll be able
to see two icons let me select radio so
what this does is you can do like that
so it has selected only five states
right if you notice carefully it is
highlighted only these deeds all the
other things here are blurred out so in
this way you can select only few states
of your choice or few locations of your
choice however this is a small circle
right right it's like that you have
selected only these now what if I do not
want to highlight everything in terms of
a circle I want to randomly select there
is a lasso selector you can select in
that way all this
towards the coast right or I can select
all the states in the central region for
example in that way that is called as
NASA this is yet another new feature in
tableau same thing is explained here or
lasso selection and things like that and
one lasting right when you want to
create a new dashboard let us create or
let me rename these things let me rename
this sheet 12 customer mean she do I
will not rename sheet 3 i'm going to
rename it to state by profit now if i
create a new dash boot there's an icon
here i click on that new dashboard here
let me drag state by profit right now i
also drag customer name or I want to
know what information is contained in
sheet2 I haven't renamed that so it's
slightly confusing so when I hover my
mouse on sheet2 it says that okay this
is a scatter plot and you see that
there's a small thumbnail towards the
right right or let me remove this also
now let me who work look at that the
moment I hold my mouse there is a
thumbnail appearing on the right side
which says that this sheet 2 is a
scatter plot this sheet for there's
nothing sheet 5 seems to be a Wilma so
it's this is extremely helpful for you
when you build dash boot because most
often than not you end up building dash
boots
all right there is one more very very
interesting feature in tableau I liked
it to the core and that is if you if you
want to filter right for example a
drag-and-drop order date on column there
however I don't want here let me do a
drop down here I want quarter so how
many clicks did i do two clicks right
I've first dragged and robbed here their
first click off drop down second click
off filter or first click right and
second click in selecting the duration
are the time scale of my choice there
you however there is a new feature in
our which says that press your right key
on the keyboard drag and drop your outer
date while you do this you get the
information if you want a quarter click
on quarter done I was I did not even
spend two clicks on that right but I got
the visualization of my choice and that
is this visualization all about right
okay we came to an end it was a fairly
quick completion of the features however
now I wish to take your questions and
try to show you other visualizations if
you have any doubts I am sure there will
be a lot of doubts okay cycle has this
question what is the difference between
tableau public in tableau desktop am new
to this too so let me show you that let
me open the tableau public here we have
tableau public right I am opening that
okay let me go to tableau desktop and
let me go to the home she so if i tried
to represent these two beside each other
let me place these two beside each other
and compare it for you here this is
tableau desktop and towards your right
hand side it's tableau public right look
at the comparison I can connect you only
excel text file and access I cannot
connect to any other files I cannot
connect to any statistical files right
there are no inbuilt data sources in
tableau public in there there are no
service to which you in connective
however once i connect to any of the
data source after that let me show you
that quickly so do I have it here yeah
we have samples coffee cheney disease
once i connect to a data set whatever i
can do using desktop i can do it using
tableau public all the features of
desktop are available the only thing is
you'll be able to work only on limited
data set you cannot connect to any of
the servers or any of the databases to
work on that all right there are a few
questions coming in money she has this
question can you please show how to
connect to apache HP is directly with
tableau Oh a money um that is something
that probably aren't be able to show
what I will just tell you that do you
see that here all you need to do is
click on more servers if you have the
server that you are speaking about
it's not there unfortunately however
there is an option called other
databases probably you want to try out
by clicking on that if at all you can
connect your data set right provide your
server name connection details username
and password and things like that hence
I'm handicapped ensuring you this option
right kamalatho has this how to get
tableau de sub license key what's the
cost I think cause of your tableau
desktop personal edition is $1,500 and
professional Edition is nineteen ninety
nine dollars however for your practice
if you want to learn tableau you can use
tableau desktop which is free of cost
and Raj Kiran has this question when is
data visualization useful so let me ask
you this question let me connect to
sample superstore let me rightly can
show you the data look at sales for
example all right let me take you to one
of those let me see okay profit if ice
ask you to hover and try to make some
inferences or try to draw some
inferences about profit there are just
under 10,000 increase right 9000 994 how
can you even you know analyze this table
we thought visualizing it I really don't
know how many negatives are there are
how many positives are there what states
are profitable and things like that
hence if you have this kind of huge data
set where in there are a lot of numbers
or things like that visualization makes
your life much easier ight
rather than scroll that profit column up
and down and make sense out of that I
would probably do this right let me
close this yeah I would probably do the
simple visualization when I on the fly
come to know and what states are very
profitable what states are the least
profitable yep and there are a few more
questions can we save the workbook or
dashboard in tableau public Manish we
can do so we can save your visualization
what you do on tableau public co mulatto
says how ad free cost tableau des
desktop doesn't come for free but your
tableau public comes for free that's
just to ensure that there's some kind of
market penetration of tableau deepti
says can you resize the individual
sheets in a dash boot so let me go to
this dashboard I'm assuming this is the
this question let me drag this and if
you want to resize you can do so yeah so
you can do all that
alright once again I'll go one by one
questions right money says can we open
the existing tableau workbook sheets
using tableau public or we need the data
separately you need the data separately
because if I right click on that if I
say open with oh there you go right yep
so you can open that you can open that
since I'm trying to open the our file or
the tableau file which has our script
it's not opening but if you have
existing worksheets then you can open
that D'Ablo is able to connect and
visualize no sequel databases if you
could show that unfortunately I do not
have any examples available about no
sequel but yes I know for a fact that we
can connect to no sequel databases and
we can do the visualization can we use
sheets prepared in tableau in PowerPoint
absolutely so what you can do is you can
save your files right and you can print
it to PDF you can save it as your body
called PowerPoint presentation etc you
can do so that option is available if
not here in a different place but that
option is available you can extract that
the PowerPoint or you can extract that
to word format and show your
presentations thus tableau provide api's
to integrate camel has this question to
integrate with what tableau integrates
with the external applications right
seamlessly and young there are aps
available if
that is your question on connecting two
different statistical packages and
things think that next deepti has a
question I had six sheets and everything
had to be fit in at once what do you
mean by that if they fit into one she
one location or how was it in this way
is this your question okay once again DT
is exquisite you had six sheets and
everything had to be fit into one
dashboard right one below the other okay
dt's question is that whether she can
increase the length of the individual
sheets so a scroll bar appears and not
everything is quizzed in the available
space now that is not available if the
unfortunately Raj Raj Kiran has this
question in u.s. there are many jobs in
data analytics what i heard is correct
can you please him absolutely right on
analytics there are platter of tops
awaiting you so let me click on this and
show you one so mackynzie has come up
with this which says there are a lot of
job shortage right in u.s. so if I
expand or open this URL it's going to
show you this that there are 140
thousand to one ninety thousand jobs
shortage which is expected in the
analytics space alone that's the good
part right and 1.5 million manages okay
Rahul as this question can you please
show how to use a sample stats file with
tableau I have just shown a Rahul are
right so if you write our code you can
open that
in tableau and you can start working on
that for that right you need to make
small changes for example if I open our
studio you need to run this package
right are so right it's just running
hold on the straight I can't see is that
an operation is in progress once that is
done i'm going to show you how to use
your statistical packages in our so here
once you install that you load it in you
run this our serve you need to go to
tableau you need to go to hell settings
and performance manage our connection
and let me taste the connection here it
is perfect so just bear with me one
discoms huh
it's taking a lot of time yeah here you
go there you have k-means clustering
this analysis which we have done right
and here it shows automatically errors
now here MV outlier that is a package
which you need to install in our so I
see library mb outlier let me see
whether that's there it's not there so
you need to install it so I'm running
that I'm going to come to your questions
once again well I just show this in
clarifying question yep it's done so let
me run this job done so now if I go back
to the sheet and then come back to this
sheet it should not give me that error
yep it hasn't given me that ever that's
a good pot right ah that's your question
Rahul Kamal sees yeah tableau is going
to integrate with other applications is
there a tableau tutorial to get us
started those tableau videos will help
you get started right the videos which
are available here on your tableau just
to get you started right but if you want
in-depth information you need to join
tutorials such as that provided by
eureka the t says my question is whether
i can increase the length of yeah that I
don't think I've answered that rajkiran
says can you explain me about the server
feature so tableau server right the
visualization that I perform on tableau
desktop if I want this to be viewed by a
customer who's sitting in a different
location altogether I publish this to
the tableau server and the customer can
be able to view that if I just give him
some URL second thing is with respect to
the security they want to provide
similar kind of security to everyone may
be no right and what if customer says
that you keep working on the fly i want
to check on what changes you're doing
and the such circumstance also you know
um tableau server feature works the
establish in read scripts to create the
reports it's not yeah you can write your
own scripts as in here right profit
ratio i right click on that click on
edit and whatever you are seeing here is
a script that you have written so you
can write all those scripts in tableau
to come up with some tailored
visualization for your customers can we
select states randomly I mean picking
them randomly in latitude longitude
selection you can do that by filtering
Mohan you can filter the option and then
select your own latitude or longitude or
whatever you want right or the range of
that in that way where can we download
sales and order data sets sales &amp;amp; order
data sets three what does that mean i
didn't eat you yeah absolutely we can
publish the sheets to server Theru so
come lata has this question how to
publish data charts in web dashboards
using tableau all you need to do is
click on server say publish workbook and
whatever server you have you can provide
that details here and if you have a
tableau public you can publish the data
oh it is not gone what you can basically
publish that too I think yeah here we
have tableau public right so you can
publish the data to the tableau public
server also that option is available and
you can share that URL with your friends
what can be a PD has this question what
can be a plus point of tableau or other
data visualization tools in what
scenarios will it be better to use the
good part about tableau is it integrates
with multiple data sources in the second
good part is its analytical so you can
do a lot of analytics on tableau where
is a scatter plot here is a scatter plot
so I click right click on that go to
trendline sea shore trend lines i right
click on that train lines and say
describe train model so it's going to
provide you a prediction model here if
any of y'all are aware of your
recognition techniques right so it's
explaining about that regression
technique here and giving the output of
that so this is one very strong reason
on why you're seeing all that in here
yeah have taken that question et tu
viens good no Raj Kiran has this
question can I know tableau client and
server uses which protocol for
communication I think you're getting
into the server administration part so
let me show you that in tableau you have
two certifications sorry
one is related to your tableau server
and one is related to your tableau
desktop right and this discussion here
or this webinar is about tableau desktop
and Ed orica provides trainings on
tableau desktop right and if you want to
know more details about tableau server
you need to do a deep dive on a
different aspect right can we integrate
these
in a.net webpage mera jiya absolutely
you can integrate the tableau
visualizations on a.net web page we can
do that Harmeet says please repeat
aggregation and disaggregation so here
let me drag and drop profit to the
column shelf and let me drag sales
measure to the Rose shell and this is
called as aggregation aggregation means
these values are added up samba now if
we go to analysis and click on aggregate
measures or uncheck this option I will
see disaggregated measures huh so Shri
has a question on how is the performance
if the data set is too large to some
extent tableau is much better than the
other visualizations because of its
architecture right it's in memory so
read and write operations would be
faster however if you have extremely
larger dataset it doesn't work not it
doesn't work its performance is going to
deteriorate and it depends on your
memory that you have and wink it has
this question can we integrate to know
sequel and be able to view real-time
data absolutely wink at you can do that
right in fact we have done a project for
Nestle client wherein we have done that
right we've integrated Twitter and all
that real-time cycle do we need to know
anything else to to work upon tableau no
you can just get started with the
tableau basics and then you can build on
the concepts how to parameterize a
tableau report what do you mean by that
Rahul do you mean that
can we say that every 24 hours there has
to be a report which should be generated
automatically and sent to the clients is
that your question meanwhile I'll take
the next question what things do we need
to learn to make it a courier cycle you
need to learn data visualization
concepts and also one of the status one
of your visualization tools which is
tableau can we integrate the reports
created in tableau public on a web
portal yes deepti you can certainly do
so click we want a blow or similar tools
is a question which rajkiran is asking
yes Raj Kiran these two are data
visualization tools while Egan has this
question while integrate with the web
application how can we pass some
parameters dynamically I didn't quite
get this question date range from the
web application to the report
again still I'm not clear or any other
way of putting down your question might
help our rajkiran has this other use for
social media marketing which one which
one is used for social media marketing
tableau you can use it the inferences
that you draw from the visualizations
that you make using tableau from that
yes it can be applicable to any segment
any sector manisha this question can we
create a dashboard which keeps updating
periodically say everyone or absolutely
monies that's the use of your tableau
server right so every hour you can
publish a report a new dynamic
visualization Rahul has this question is
there a way that clients get notified
when we publish in new report on tableau
server yeah all these options are
available on your tablet server you can
configure your tableau server to ensure
that you get these kind of notifications
how is tableau different from Spotfire
tableau is different because tableau is
meant to be used by your end users right
they will be easily able to drag and
drop the various options and do the
visualization even if they know nothing
about the underlying code that you have
written and tableau is very good at
analytics and you know that data
analytics is fast catching up what's the
best way to learn data visualization
concepts so you can join this program
ripple which starts right from the
basics of visualization and teaches you
about all the concepts of trampo is
cloud computing concepts using tableau
oh yes Raj Kiran there are a lot of
cloud computing databases right and you
can publish your reports to cloud
directly that option is available so the
same answer right tableau and click for
you how do they differ both are
competing so since most of y'all are
asking this question let me show you
this
oh yes manish we can either publish the
dashboard manually or automatically let
me show you this who is a market leader
anyone who's seeing this visualization
right or this screen who is a market
leader right so we should not be bought
about what is the difference between
that and other tools undoubtably it's
tableau sorry let me by the way which
location are you all joining from us are
India okay the reason i'm asking this
question is because there are a lot of
opportunities in us and nowadays the
indian market has grown to a great
extent with respect to data
visualization there is a lot of work
that is getting out soon here so you
have equal opportunities in both these
countries but us is amazing i'm in india
mirage
lamb from hyderabad rajkiran rishabh in
india also there are plethora of
opportunities you can just do a Google
search or you can search on your job
portals right and you'll be surprised to
see so many openings just in data
visualization or tablet oh alright
marriage that's nice to hear how is
opportunities for analytics in India
it's just booming right it's just
booming and this increase will be very
steep in the coming years in the coming
few months bono rajkiran now I'm a
freelancer I do not work with any
company do I work with four companies in
a span of 13 years any minimum
experience required for this know there
are a lot of opportunities for freshers
as will cycle if you do a search on now
creo r monster or any of your job
portals and if you select 0 years of
experience you will see that there are a
lot of opportunities even for freshers
Harmeet you can just do
search tableau download right and then
you will go to tableau website in it's
free for download PDC's and planning to
join our masters in analytics could you
mention some of the core products which
are used extensively in us it's our if
you're banking on analytics right it's
our our is a tool and you have to focus
on that to a great extent p how do
tableau secure its data tableau has a
lot of security aspects within that and
if you are using tableau server you can
ensure that you provide some security
options for example I want one stea
color to only view my report I want
another stakeholder to actually edit the
report so you can do all that and it's
very secure once again rajkiran your
questions are pointed towards the
tableau server so I will request you to
just do a round of research on that
because this webinar is related to
desktop and I do not have a lot of
exposure on the server part is tableau
of programming more or not no tableau is
less of programming bono and more of
your visualization drag and drop things
like that so I get as this question I
have prior experience in other
technologies and if I join data
visualization no they do not look into
you as a fresher because they look into
you as a person who has a lot of domain
experience industry or sector knowledge
and that knowledge coupled with the data
visualization knowledge is going to be
very profound any testing jobs is also
there related to tablet no reship there
is no testing in tableau because it's
very user-friendly right it's drag and
drop you can test it for yourself based
on that logic there are no separate
testing of photon blow
rahul says like you interested with our
can we integrate with Python as well
which one tableau I'm not sure about
integrating Python with tableau Rahul
but there should be a way out whipple
says it's ace trial version yeah trial
version is only for 14 days however
tableau public is for lifelong oh yes
Hadoop can be integrated in fact this
program of a Eureka ensures that you
learn about how to integrate Tablo and
Haru AJ what is a good combination of
tools to be used with tableau which will
be a plus point for jumps are our I've
shown you are right our and your tableau
is a deadly combination Python RRR
Python and our are related oh yes Raj
Kiran Python are r and r are related
both of these can be used for your
statistical analysis our pd that would
take some time significant time so we do
not have so much of time it's already
1030 now probably you can drop in your
query to support at a Eureka and they'll
get in touch with you
oh yes this demo video will be shared
with y'all so these security aspects are
well taken care of rishabh and that is a
reason why it's appearing in the leaders
quadrant right the security part of that
is taking care of data security and all
that all right friends thank you so much
for your time hope I've answered most of
your questions thank you have a great
night already depending on the location
that you are joining from thank you
friends good night do not forget to take
the survey at the end of this right
you'll be shown a survey window please
take this away without feel thank you
