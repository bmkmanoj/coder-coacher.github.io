gentlemen my name is Vardhan and I'm of
course excited to be here on in Rica
live with you guys and in this well in
my previous session on selenium I
explained what is data driven testing
and I told you how to implement it using
webdriver right and in today's session
which is the next in the same selenium
series this is also a very interesting
topic and what I'm going to teach here
is all about page object model and what
is page Factory in selenium okay so in a
previous session I explained why it's
important to break your test case in to
do what I explained last time was to
break your entire test case into one
class which would contain the test
scenario and the other class which would
contain data data and that which would
pass the data which would actually pass
the data during testing right so
similarly in this session we again break
the entire test case into two parts and
one class here would be used for you
know it should be used as the page class
and the page class is nothing but the
class which contains the locators of all
the web elements in the web page which
is going to be used for testing and the
other class is going to be the actual
law class which would do the year
testing right so that'll be the test
case and the other one would be the page
class so that's what I'm going to teach
you in today's session and oh yeah this
implementation is called the page object
model and I will talk about its benefits
and of course you'll be able to start
designing your own test cases this way
in the future so if you guys get any
doubts during the session please feel
free to put them in the comment box and
either my team or rival myself finds
them for you so this is it back relax
and enjoy it rekha life for the next 45
minutes to learn water speed object
model and page Factory in selenium now
these will be the topics I will be
currently but before I tell you anything
more I want to first full understand are
you all familiar with this concept of
page object model can you all please
give me a quick quick reply in the chat
box
okay anyways moving forward I'm guessing
that there will be a some of you who'll
know what it is and some of you but not
okay I've got an answer here some people
know it and a little bit and some do not
completely they're not familiar no
problem
as you can see I will start the session
first of all with an introduction to
what a page object model is okay I will
tell you why it's useful and how exactly
does it work I will also talk about what
a page Factory is I will also talk about
what a page factory is and after that I
will give a demonstration on both how to
implement page object model using page
Factory and how to implement this same
page object model without using page
Factory right so let me get started with
the first topic for today and that is
why use page object model now to help
you understand why the page object model
needs to be used and adopted alpha is
present this problem statement to you
okay now consider there's a web page
which you are testing and well assume
that there are 10 elements on that page
okay and along with that let's say it
also has links to other pages like a
link to a login page from the home page
and a link to a blog page and extra a
couple of pages and let's say you have
written multiple test cases in which the
elements are used and lot of tests are
performed on them okay now if the
element located off any of these
elements or all of these elements
changes then what we do okay
you'll have to probably change the
locator of every element right because
you know you have to change that in
every test case that also so that's the
that's the deal I'm pretty sure you know
you people are very with me
correct so and initially well the test
you know if it's a small application it
would look you know the test code the
script would look something like this
and you know you will be locating very
few elements and you'll have to make the
changes and just probably a few lines
like what's highlighted over here but
when you work in the industry you would
not be dealing with such small
applications you will have hundreds of
the pages each having numerous web
elements and the same web elements can
also appear in more than one page okay
and to test the different functionality
of the different elements which are
there in different web pages you might
have to write 100 different test cases
right so that's one challenge and now if
you want to make changes to the locators
what will you do because in this case
there are probably 100 test cases and
you will have to make the test you know
the change to the locator in all those
cases and at times you will also have a
scenario where you will be changing the
locator of the same element in multiple
test cases because it might be used in
multiple scenarios right so you have all
such such situations at that time it's
going to be like really tough right it's
gonna be very tedious modifying these
test cases and changing the locator it's
going to be frustrating and boring so to
eliminate all these issues we have
something called as the page object
model and the page object model it
basically helps us write flexible code
and it tells us also maintain it in a
very efficient way ok so you will have
you know besides that you'll also
understand why it's industry preferred
then I'm gonna give you a demonstration
okay but before that the only thing that
you need to note is a page of it model
is not a framework okay a lot of people
have the misunderstanding that it's a
framework it's not it's just a design
pattern to restructure how of your test
case is written
okay and what kind of researching is
done in this case as you can see here
the restructuring is done in with
respect to the test case being divided
into the test and the element locators
right so the element locators are
separated from the actual test scenario
and basically these element locators
will be present inside the page class
and this pH class will be accessed
during runtime by the your you'll be
your test case so that's what that's why
you need a use page object model and to
explain what exactly that is and give
more details I will go to the next slide
and yeah as the definition says a page
object model is a design pattern to
create an object repository for web UI
elements and the object repository that
we are talking about here is simply the
page class right if you look at this
imager we have the you know it simply
says we have we make a combination of
you know page class and the test case so
these both in combination helped us
achieve the P om design pattern okay so
page object model is also generally
acronym to P om and the peach class here
will contain all the locators of all the
verb elements that we need to test in
our that we need to test in our
application and whatever test scenarios
are there
whichever what data needs to be passed
to that particular element those would
be present inside the test case so the
case would basically be calling the page
class whenever it's needed or whenever
you know whenever it's mean it just
calls it so that's how this whole
concept works now speaking of the page
class and in the test case now speaking
of them in detail these two contain what
you see here on the screen right so your
page class first of all it contains your
element locators like I said but it also
contains something called us the methods
which you know call these locators so
you will have various elements on the
webpage will have probably a text box
you might have a link to another page
you might have Vedas or things you might
have radio button you might have all
these things right so you will have an
locator to identify that element but
what kind of action is performed on that
element are you clicking on that
are you just passing some data under
some text field all these actions right
those are called as operations and
there's a method which we use to perform
those operations so you have these two
items basically personal page class okay
and similarly in our test case we have
the actual test scenario like you know
I've also explained in the previous
session and besides the actual test
scenario you will have the calls to the
to the methods present in the page class
and when you make the call to the
methods over here you will also send the
data that you want to you know yeah you
want to pass as parameters for testing
supposing you wanna supposing it's a
login page and you want to send in your
email address or password details then
that will have to pass in through these
method calls okay so the actual test
would be here these would be executed
and when these are executed the method
calls would be made along with the data
which is parameterized and that goes to
the page class and here when these
methods are called and the buffer the
operations are executed by using the
element locators over here so it would
locate the elements using the element
locators and then whatever actions are
running it to be performed they would be
performed so that's how the page object
model works so so guys are any doubt
with respect to what is a page object
model how it works any doubt I can
answer it right away
before I get my hands dirty with showing
you a code
now let me just explain what I was
saying I was just saying that the login
element or Java that you see or write
this class I'm going to use this as my
pH class ok now this page class contains
all my webdriver raw you know it
contains all my elements and all my your
locators for identifying those elements
okay and this test case class this is
where my actual tests are you expressed
okay now what to help you understand
what code I'm gonna present you let me
first of all go to the login you know
let me explain this class of mine okay
which is my pH class and this class
basically contains three different well
let's say it contains three different
parts okay now this is the first part
which has my three are the three
different element locators and then this
is the second one which is a constructor
for instance waiting my driver my driver
is actually instantiated from in this
particular class but I'm I'm I'm you
know importing that same object driver
object over here so I'm just creating a
constructor for that and then finally I
have three different methods for making
calls to each of these elements so if
you remember from the previous sessions
or in general what we do for raw
locating any elements is we use the
command driver or find element followed
by we have this part right we either use
by name or by ID or by XPath and then we
send whatever keys do you want to send
so it's a similar way but what I'm gonna
what I'm doing here is I'm just creating
I'm just using the by class to to create
and send the data as a method call okay
so for each of these three different
login fields that we'll have in our
webpage the the username the password
and the login buttons right we have
three different elements so for each of
these elements we have three different
methods and I'm using the driver what
find element function to identify my my
first user name field and I've used the
by class to our two to specify the class
name I am saying store
identify the
called username by the name tag okay
and this I'm storing it over here in
this variable and what I'm doing is I'm
just passing this same user name field
here so whenever there's a function call
made it would indirectly go and pick up
this particular element and send the
keys whatever it receives okay and this
key is B is again received at this
method as arguments and its received
from the other class and similarly we
have the you know we have the password
field right so for the password field we
have the password which comes in as
arguments and this would be sent as
again parameters to my this variable
okay and here the bind name there you
see your of again used the name tag to
identify the password field from my web
page and yeah the data would go into
this and whatever details are there that
would be input and similarly the third
one would be the login button right so
the login button we would we won't have
any details or any any text going in but
we would just have to click on that
login button so for that we are just
again using the find element to identify
this field and sorry we are just using
this find element to identify the login
field this is again defined over here
and by making the call to this login
button
we are just performing a click once the
once the element is located we have a
familiar click operation on this
particular element okay so that's what
my page class is doing and the other
thing that you need to notice the
constructor so if you remember the
constructor basically has the same name
as the class okay and the concept prom
using here because what I'll be doing
from my testing area is that I'll be
creating my object driver for my web
driver over here
okay you guys would of course know that
whenever you're working with selenium
you got to you have to specify you have
to set the property and then say which
driver you want to use if you want to
use chrome driver or if you want to use
gecko driver and all these things so I'm
creating the driver over here the object
for the driver over here and this I'm
passing as you know arguments to my my
pH class okay
so that all these
all this data would go and you know my
driver would execute successfully okay
that's what I'm doing but one thing
which you might you know find strange is
that I have you know used this
particular object
I've used this object I've created a new
object for this class instance okay and
then I've sent this driver over there so
this would I really mean that my web
driver should be defined as a global
variable and then inside my constructor
I will have a I will offer to finalize
you laughter defendant locally because
the webdriver instance which I have
created over there that would come in in
this function call and I'm instance
waiting this I'm using this command to
instantiate this driver through the same
driver which I'm creating here okay so
the global rabbit I'm creating I'm
setting that same value which comes in
from the local driver okay so that's the
only thing that you need to note okay I
have to help you understand a bus given
driver one for my local driver local
driver for this particular constructor
and my global variable of course is no
it's just going to be driver so this is
what you need to understand from my page
class and going to my test case here is
where you know it's the interesting part
so basically I have about two different
fields which I need to fill right I have
my username and I have the password
field so to send the values to both
those or fields I need to send them as
method calls and since in my ear since
my pH class I have three different
methods for three different methods for
each of these elements I need to make
separate method calls okay now if I want
to make a call to any method from a
different class then I have to create an
object of that class which via which
contains a method right so in our case
this is the class which contains a
method login elements so I'm creating
object instance of this class and my
object name is login and yeah while
while creating while making the creating
the object I'm of course giving the
driver this is what I explained earlier
but the next line that if you can see
here
making a call to the methods okay so
there are three element or three methods
user element password element and login
element okay you can verify that here
also so if you see that is user element
here password element and login element
and each of these methods make
indirectly they make calls to the to the
locator right so that's what I'm doing
I'm saying login toward user element and
I'm passing the my username and then I'm
making a login dot password element to
call the password element method and
then I'm passing this credentials and of
course I'm not passing any credentials
to my login login element right my login
element just needs to be clicked on so
the operation that I'd be performing
here is dark liquor whereas here it was
dot sendkeys so yeah this is what
basically my code is going to do it's
just here I'm just going to create the
object instance the driver instance and
then I'm going to you know perform these
operations to pass my data from here to
my my pH class okay now let me show you
a sample of that by executing this code
okay let me I'll show you how it works
so as you can see when I have executed
the chromedriver has opened this is the
page I want to test and yes I've logged
in successfully and now it should quit
so this was the same page I showed my
tests on in the previous session okay
this is the say this is the URL and you
guys can also perform any if you want to
practice automation then you can do it
in this URL okay now let me just pull up
the console and show you the results so
it says that the method verify login has
successfully passed correct so this is
the method verify login which had which
was passing the credentials and yeah
this is successfully passed test runs
one and there were zero failures right
so this means our raw test running
successfully and yeah this is how I want
this is what is an example of page
object model and this is what I want to
explain so however here we have not used
the concept of a page Factory okay so -
wait - why not implement page Factory I
will first go back my slide
and give you more I'll brief you more
about what a peach factories and why a
page factory can be used with the page
object model all right
so basically a peach factory is an
inbuilt class in selenium for
implementing the page object model okay
we can also think of it has a library
which has the necessary functions to
make calls to the appropriate page class
or the methods inside that page class
okay and to use this page class we need
to just import this page factory your
package okay that's a Java package and
you can do that and the important
command and the benefit that of course
or you get with this package is this
unit element statement okay
this inert element command because this
in combination with something called as
ad great find by annotation we can use
these two in combination to directly
pass our elements so locating our
elements in our piece class is going to
be easier for us now because we'll be
locating our elements which are there in
our page class from the test case right
so when we have this when we import the
page Factory and then when we have the
unit element statement we can easily
identify what elements are there from
the page class so we can easily choose
and we can now easily pass details and
all these things so that's a it's a
slight benefit that we have and we
implement page Factory okay and yeah
this comes with selenium so all the more
reason to use it correct and besides
that we can also use this at the rate
cache look up annotation to store any of
these elements in cache memory supposing
you perform any tests on certain
elements then if and if you want to
store them in the cache memory then you
can just use the add great cache look up
command after that particular draw after
the fine bye annotation right and when
you do that you have a very you know
fast test right your test cases will
execute faster and you'll get it
immediately so in large-scale
application this would be beneficial
where you will have multiple test cases
running every frequently so that's the
thing with page factory and yeah I think
I've told everything I need to tell
right so the difference between using
your page Factory and when you're not
using a page Factory is just that you'll
be using the driver dot find element and
then you use the by tag either by name
or
by ID by XPath we'll be doing that but
with the venue using page factory you
just used a great find by annotation you
don't need to give dravot or find
element all the time and yeah you don't
need to make multiple method calls so
it's a little bit of an advantage and of
course you need to import the page
factory package for that and yeah cash
lookup helps you make your test cases
faster so there's one more topic of this
advantages that I want to tell okay so
advantages of this is yeah by now I'm
sure that you would have understood what
advantages are there
number one is maintainability so you can
maintain your code in a very efficient
manner you can you have the test case
separated you have your method calls
separated so whenever you want to change
any locator right then you can easily
change the address only in that
particular page class and you can just
maintain your test case separately
because otherwise if you have it all
together then you know by the in the
default pattern then you will have a
problem you will have to make the
changes in multiple places so this way
you made it in a better way and
reusability so reusability is a factor
where you know in in applications where
you need to make you need to make use of
the same element in multiple test cases
so let's say that you have two or three
different page classes okay and you have
you know ten test cases and your draw
each of these ten test cases you are
testing out different functionality so
at this time if you want to make use of
the same class and if you want to use a
combination of the same elements then at
that time the whole concept of
reusability comes into the picture okay
you can just make the function calls or
you can make the method calls and you
can execute your code easily so you not
have any problem there and speaking of
flexibility that's the biggest benefit
right so it's very flexible as and you
can if you don't want to if you want to
remove a particular feature if you want
to remove a particular you know element
then you can do that by just deleting it
from the code you don't have you won't
have any other dependency anywhere else
right so similarly even a test case if
you want to
really execute a test case you can you
can also you know leave it to the site
because it will not be affecting any
other test case because no other page
class will be affecting any other test
case in combination with this so that's
one advantage with respect to
flexibility and yeah the code would be
optimized for better use right your code
will be more smaller and it would only
perform what you know what you expect
from and so you not have that many bugs
or errors as you know you can expect so
that's another big advantage with Beach
Factory so these are the things why
people use it in the industry
extensively today and in general
whatever you've seen all these days
right by using the driver or find
element and then using the different
tags that's a very primitive v that's
not exactly how it works in the industry
because when you are actually working
for a company you will have a massive
application which would have mul like
hundreds of test cases so at that time
this is the way forward and this is what
is actually needed and if you also want
to crack interviews then page factory
and page object model is a must know
topic and this is probably the one topic
from where you will have the most out of
questions as done right so that's the
thing
now now that I have told you this I can
simply go to my at ellipse IDE and show
you a demonstration of page Factory it's
not gonna be very different it's going
to be a slight change that's it okay so
I'm just gonna delete these things and
as you can see this is my this is my
package which contains these two classes
for page Factory okay so I've said page
object model with page Factory and let
me open these two files and oh yeah the
web elements or java that you see or
this I'm going to use as my page class
okay and this class is my test case it's
very similar to the previous code the
only difference is in this part where
earlier I made calls to three different
methods right I did those things are add
three lines but instead I'm just making
one single call to one method
okay and besides that over there I made
a and I created an object's instance of
a class straightaway but here I am
creating an object instance of for the
class but I'm used doing it with the
help of a page factory package and that
is the inert elements so this is what I
was talking about earlier right so inert
elements can be used to easily locate
your elements so when so when add the
rate find by is used in your page class
over that time inert elements can be
used in combination with this to
identify the elements so it's a little
easier now you will understand that
Bederman I explained this so it is hold
on till then and yeah even this page
class over here is pretty similar that's
the only difference is in these lines
where I'm using the element locators
right so earlier I used the by class and
I used I use three different methods to
call those to call that by class right
But Here I am using a dread find by and
when you specify other aid find by you
will automatically you can choose which
tag you want to use whether you want to
use ID or if you want to use name or if
you want to use XPath or CSS or class
name all these these are things you can
mention over your now since I am using
name simply specified name here and
inside double quotes have specified the
name of my web element and that is user
name correct and then the important
thing is you have to initiate you have
to say that the element so this is a
keyword and after that if you give you
know whatever you give you that would be
considered as the name of the variable
where will be getting stored and
similarly I have done the same for the
other two elements one is the password
and the other is the login field but
short show of use a different method
over york i've done it in a different
way so here i've simply said name is
equal to username or you can say X bar
is equal to so on so but in this case
I'm use this function called how dot
name okay so I can have either how dot
name or how dot ID or how dot X path I
can use any of these things it's very
similar to name but it's just that in
the industry it's a preferred preferred
method because yeah the whole package it
also comes in news in Malta in various
other places well of course I can't show
the uses right now but that's how I
would use but you know it's as per your
comfort you can use either the name the
the ID straight away or you can use it
with the help of how dot packaged so you
can see how lot name on how word ID or
how dot X path and all these things and
the syntax goes like this after you say
which tag you want to use you have to
say using is equal to and then you need
to specify what is the name of what is
the value of that particular tag so the
value of my name tag if it's username
then in this case have two equivalent e
you specify the value but since it's my
password field the name value of my
password field is a password itself so
that's what I've said here and similarly
my login button right it has the value
of log in so again of this said using is
equal to and in double quotes you
specify this and then you say web
element and then you create these two
variables and then your locators will be
ready okay what I've done after that is
simply I've created another constructor
which is again the same and I explained
this earlier also it's because we'll be
creating a driver from our test case to
to map that to our global driver which
you have instantiated inside this page
class we are using this constructor okay
and we are you are doing it using this
using this call right and yeah finally
over here instead of having three
different methods for the three
different elements have simply have one
single method and over here I'm making
calls to each of these elements so I
have defined user username password and
login as three different elements right
so web element was the key word are used
for creating these three elements and
then I'm cop-calling them over here I'm
just saying user name dot send keys the
user ID okay and similarly I'm calling
password which is a recognizer and I'm
be sending my sending I'll be sending
the keys of my password and in case of
my login button I would identify the web
element and I would perform a click
operation on that right
what this is where you need to I need to
show I need to go back to this class and
explain how the function call is made
okay so let me just go there this is
they are this you would know so I'm just
gonna quickly go and explain this part
of my code so what I'm doing here is I
am making a call to this method login
method is the name of the method right
so here I'm making a call and I'm
sending the user ID and the password so
that you can understand over here but to
send this we need to instantiate a class
we need to instantiate an object of that
class right so that is what I have in my
previous line so over here
there is the name of the class where the
method is present that is web elements
and the method name is located that's my
method name and instead of creating it
as a new Java object I've just said use
the page factories in it element method
okay and here I'm passing my driver and
the web element dot class so I'm sending
the bytecode of my class file so the
bytecode of my class file I'm sending it
because I'm there are various elements
are there which you need to be located
and it would use the the class file to
locate this so that's the reason we use
this here make it otherwise if we don't
specify the dot class failure your
execution would not happen so along with
driver you need to make sure that you
send the dot class file of your class
which you want to use for locating your
elements okay and yeah quite simply I'm
just using the class name dot I'm just
using the my object Liam got the method
name so the and I'm passing these or
credentials the username and the
password credentials and I'm just you
know for for our sake for convenience
sake of putting my thread to sleep and
I'm closing my driver so it's a very
similar implementation and if I hit the
Run button I can show you a
demonstration of this
okay I have a question here from Kumari
and she's asking which is more efficient
using with the how tag or name or XPath
well Kumari see in general you can just
use name or ID okay that's the easiest
but you know at times you know they
might change and it might not always be
available so expert or something that's
going to always be that for every
element
okay so expert you will definitely have
in every element but if you do not have
yeah if you don't have the tag the name
or ID if you don't have these tags then
you can use XPath in that case okay
yeah and how that can be used in
combination with that so that's the
thing Kumari so any other questions okay
so seems like my output just got
instance got close so I'm going to run
the command again so that I can explain
what's happening guys in fact when you
run the command so it's the same thing
that's gonna happen right your browser
is gonna open that the feeds are gonna
get populated with whatever data you
pass in and then it's I've logged into
the application and then it would close
yeah so it's the same output that we got
for the previous test case also and yeah
it says test runs where one failures
zero and log and modify was the method
that was executed right it was executed
successfully so that's how page object
model with peach factory works and you
know earlier I also explained how page
object model without meat factory works
so it's you can you can use any one of
the methods so page factory is that is
just that in some some places you will
have a certain benefits if you're using
page factory you will have bar shortcuts
but yeah whatever helps you can use that
right whichever is more convenient to
you you can use that particular you can
use that particular technique
okay so Connor is asking why do we use
concept and page Factory well yes
current the same reason that you know I
specified earlier so by using the
constructor which has the same name as
the class name we are saying that a
particular object instance from another
class is going to be is needs to be
instantiated in this particular class
okay so if you look at our case what we
have is we need a webdriver right so no
selenium K a test case would be executed
without a driver correct you need to
instantiate a chrome driver or a Firefox
driver so the driver instance over here
is set with this keyword right so driver
is the name and it's set over here okay
I'm initiating chromedriver over here
okay and of the this is where my your
exe is present for my chrome driver now
this particular driver object can be
used only inside this class correct I
cannot use this over here in the web
elements this is a different class
altogether I cannot use that driver over
here but all my web elements are present
here the locator is present here the
method calls to these elements are
present here in this class so for this
purpose what I am doing is I am just
whatever my your driver objects
instances I am just passing that over
here using the constructor okay and the
syntax for you know using a contractor
is this you gotta say this dot drive out
and this is what you specify over here
so globally what you declare you can
have if you have driver 100 over here
then you have to also change the name
appropriately over here so let me give
you an example okay so I can change it
this way so I have convenience here
correct and then similarly whatever I am
getting in from the class that I am
storing over here which is coming in as
arguments I'm storing it as driver one
okay now this one I am using locally
inside this particular constructor as
driver one so I'm basically
instantiating what driver object I am
getting that I'm instantiating to my
driver 100 which is
globally inside this particular class so
for ya conversion conversion from local
to global variables that's why we use
constructor so if you guys are you know
if you have more doubts on this then
it's important that you get your core
java concepts clear all right okay so I
have another question from officer Ollie
he says can you please show me using a
droid cache look up absolutely after so
to execute the cache look up let me just
you know make things simpler here
I'm just going on
and this is where you add that line
cashflow problem okay so in my case I'm
gonna make a big difference because it's
a very small application about you know
in general it's gonna be it's gonna
bring a lot of benefits if you have a
big large-scale application so the cash
hook up this line is what you need to
add to every single web element right
after every single locator indicating
that you know it's going to be present
in your cache memory so so let me just
import the cache hookup package so yeah
now we're good right so now if I execute
this it's probably going to be a little
faster the element locating technique
you it's you can visibly see it over
here but yeah it's that's how it works
I will clear after
okay Kumari says can we put in at
element in the constructor
Kumari no we don't do that okay we we
use the inert elements separately and we
use that as a method call and her ender
says just like you know after a
framework we can understand it easily
for testing any website yeah her in
there so it's not a framework actually
it's a design pattern but you can use it
for easily understanding how testing
happens on any website yeah okay so yeah
I think that's pretty much all the
Commons that I've got I think I can
discount you today's session on that
load so I mean just quickly go to my
slide and wrap up today's session by
showing you this conclusion slide of
mine okay so we spoke about why a page
object model needs to be used I show you
that with the problem statement as to
what problems would occur if you don't
maintain a page object model type you
know this kind of a pattern and then we
saw you know how we can do it right what
exactly is a page Bob's model how do we
perform the operations there how do we
divide it into two different classes
what are we store in the different
classes and then I told you how a peach
Factory can be used inside you know
along with a page object model because
page object model can be use in two
different ways by simply a simple page
object model where you're not using page
Factory and also in another way where
you are using page Factory which is
provided by selenium right so it's a
selenium library which they provide so I
have shown you both and of course for
demonstration of both paid off with mall
and the page Factory in selenium so yeah
that brings us to the end of the session
here but before I conclude I just want
to quickly go here and show you a couple
of more things
so this is our selenium landing page
ghost landing page and here if you wanna
if you're interested in learning or you
know selenium from our raw from Enrica
then you can go to our landing page and
check out our details here so you have
the pass details you have the price
details you have all
okay so this is the URL you can check it
out here and since you guys have been in
our you know a life session for so long
we we also give you this optional to do
avail an exclusive discount on any
course that you buy from Ed Rekha right
and you will have to go to this URL
which one of my team members would put
in the chat box you can use that and if
you fill out this survey form over here
then you have you know you you can you
you'll be eligible for this exclusive
offer which others are not and that's
because you've been on the live session
for so long okay
so go ahead make use of it learn
something and you know grow knowledge
and in the meanwhile if you are also you
know new to selenium if you don't know
anything and if you want to get started
from scratch then you can check out our
blog series we have a couple of blogs
here along with the interview questions
blog which would probably help you in
understanding sorry it should help you
in clearing any interview that you have
right so you can do that and of course
we have YouTube playlists also of
selenium which most of you might be
aware of but if you're not check out we
have plenty of videos here you might
want to gain more knowledge going
through these videos and most you know
most of all click on the bell icon that
you can see next to the SUBSCRIBE option
