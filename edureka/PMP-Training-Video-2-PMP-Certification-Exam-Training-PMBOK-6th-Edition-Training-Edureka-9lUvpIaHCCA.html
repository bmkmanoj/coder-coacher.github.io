the PMP training program all right so
now let's move on to the next topic
which is about understanding the types
of development cycles now I'm sure some
of you may have already read about these
life cycles some of you may have work on
different life cycles so we'll just
touch upon all these different types of
life cycles and I'll also try to give
you some generic examples and we'll try
to also take some specific examples so
you may have come across various life
cycles like predictive life cycle or
reductive life cycle and in fact there
are combinations so sometimes predictive
and adaptive way of working is combined
and then it becomes a hybrid life cycle
apart from that we also built in a
iterative way and incremental way so we
have iterative and incremental life
cycles as well so let's start with the
predictive life cycle typically what
happens in a predictive life cycle now
you'll agree that the best example of
predictive life cycle is waterfall
because in waterfall life cycle what
happens is that we do a front planning
and wonderful life cycle as you may be
aware already and you may have worked on
waterfall way while working on software
projects specifically and if in case you
are not working in software projects
then also in the traditional way of
working
typically we always do the upfront
planning so we spend good amount of time
in gathering requirements in defining
the scope of front and based on that
scope that we have defined we come up
with the schedule how much time this
project would take to complete and
accordingly we also derive the cost that
is required to complete a project so
that means all these activities we do
upfront and therefore it's a predictive
way of working so the best example is
the waterfall life cycle where we do a
front planning and then we have these
different phases through which we
actually go through in order to build
that software product so there are
various phases that we talk about as a
part of waterfall lifecycle like
starting with we initiate a project then
we spend good amount of time in
gathering requirements then we do
analysis of
those requirements and based on the
analysis we start working on design part
and on design again we create high level
design low level design etc and then we
start actually built activities and then
we test the software and then it is
deployed for use so that means all these
activities are actually planned well in
advance because we create a fluent
document for requirements specifications
similarly based on that we do afferent
analysis and planning etc so it's
absolutely a predictive way of working
or developing their software product and
therefore its predictable life cycle
whatever life cycle the another type of
life cycle that we can talk about is
productive life cycle so this is going
to be definitely different than the
predictive way of working
so here the detailed scope is defined
but that's defined typically for a
particular iteration now this iteration
is nothing but a specific duration that
we are talking about the duration of
iteration could be anywhere between 1 to
4 weeks so you may define that in the
beginning of your project itself so
let's say in your project you all agreed
as a team that you like to have
iteration duration of two weeks so what
you will do essentially is that in
adaptive life cycle you will define the
scope of the product that you're
building for that two weeks so whatever
that you think you could complete within
two weeks you identify that as a scope
and then you agree to that so that means
you build those features within two
weeks in the iteration that is agreed
upon and again the next iteration you
will pick up next set of requirements or
features so by this way you will
actually go on building the software now
the advantage over here is that we have
got multiple feedback cycles because by
the end of every iteration we go back to
the customer and ask you know what is
good in it what could be improved
etcetera so that means we get to adopt
as for the requirements or as for the
changes that are given by the customers
and therefore this is change driven life
cycle or adaptive life cycle and this is
typically used even on the agile project
as well now there is also a hybrid way
of working where
we do a bit of perforin planning and we
also respond to the changes that are
coming on the project so it's a
combination of predictive life cycle
wherein we are doing beta for planning
maybe for if it is one-year project then
you are doing bit of a planning for
three months and then you are also
building iteratively incrementally at
the same time we are showing the demo to
the customer taking feedback and then
building or responding to the changes
that are suggested by the customers in
the upcoming iteration so this way what
is happening essentially is that you are
not only doing the afferent planning but
also you are responding to the changes
or suggestions given by the customer so
this is truly a hybrid way of working
and therefore it is a hybrid lifecycle
now one of the example of hybrid
lifecycle could be framework you know or
discipline agile is one of the way
wherein it actually covers about bit of
a predictive planning at the same time
we also adapt to the changes that are
shared by the customer so that could be
one of the example of the frameworks or
the lifecycle point of view the
disciplined agile now moving on to the
next two life cycles first is iterative
out of those two the iterative life
cycle again here also as far as a
project scope is concerned we determine
the project scope early in the project
life cycle itself and what typically
happens in iterative life cycle is that
we have these iterations so development
happens within the iterations and then
we go on building the product in chunks
the small chunks we pick up a small
chunk of the product we build that in
iteration and again we move on to the
next iteration again we build the next
set of features so this is how we kind
of you know go on building over the
increments that are produced out of this
iteration in a successive fashion
incremental ii when we work in an
incremental lifecycle what happens is
basically again deliverables here are
produced through series of iteration so
in both the cases you'll find one thing
common is iterations so in iterative
life cycle we built it in cycles
however in incremental life cycle we
built on the previous
chunk or we built on the previous
increment of the product so of course
we'll take example probably I think I
should take you to this example is very
nicely
explained the iterative and incremental
way of booking and how we combine these
ways of working when we start working in
an agile way so I came across this blog
and I found this very useful and this
blog which is written by Stephen
Thompson and he has nicely explained
about iterative and incremental way of
working so for example if you have to
paint Mona Lisa picture in an
incremental way if you go so typically
what happens in incremental as we just
saw we built it in small chunks so you
just pick up a small chunk which is in
this case let's say just a face and then
you paint it in this iteration alright
so if there are three iterations out of
these three iterations you have
basically painted just a face then on
the top of that now this is my first
increment that I produced out of this
iteration now in the second iteration
I'm going to build on that increment and
then I'll extend the picture all right
and in the third iteration I will build
on my previous increment that I have
created and this is how I complete the
picture so in the third iteration I
built the remaining part of the picture
so this is how I actually go on building
on the previous increment that I have
created and incrementally I complete if
it's a software product then you just go
on building the features or depending on
the kind of product that you're working
on so this is incremental way of working
now what happens in iterations again a
front you have decided that you will be
building this picture in three
iterations and then one by one you just
go on enhancing in each and every
iteration so maybe in the first
iteration you have just created a
high-level architecture and design in
the second iteration you sort of try to
start working on few features and then
you again enhance those features as you
move ahead in the third iteration so in
iterative way we built it cyclically
okay and then we just go on of course we
go on getting the feedback and then we
go on improving upon that as well so
that's how within this three iteration
in an iterative way I could complete
this picture as well so just by changing
the approach the way you work changes
definitely drastically and when you
combine both this approaches then
think this is the best way I would say
because this is what we do in agile in a
child we build incrementally and
iteratively and therefore the biggest
advantage is that at a particular
iteration we can also think of deploying
that product in production or maybe we
can start using those features as well
so as you can now see an incremental and
iterative way we not only are talking
about the features that we would like to
focus found but also we are also
considering the high level design and
the architecture and then from there I
have started at the same time I have
also built certain features in the first
iteration in the second iteration again
I am going to build on the increment
that I have created at the same time I
am also able to prove my target level
architecture early during this lifecycle
which certainly helps me which gives me
a bit of confidence when I move ahead
through these iterations in the third
iteration if you see actually I'm even
better in terms of my design and
architecture overall at the same time I
could complete my feature as well
suppose if tomorrow I decide to put this
just a face paint things then I should
be able to even do that because that is
ready so this is how I go on just
building it in iterative and incremental
way and with continuous feedback it's
going to only help me in this morning to
the changes that are coming through are
the customers or the stakeholders so
this is how incremental and iterative
way of working helps so if you see the
predictive life cycle if you just some
remove at this point in time then rest
of this life cycle you'll find we
definitely use it in an agile way
adaptive hybrid incremental iterative
and some part of predictive also we use
as I mentioned especially when we work
in hybrid way so this is about the
development life cycles now we are
moving to the next topic which is about
phase gate now if you see phase gate
what is a phase kit we typically work in
phases we are talking about a project
right so project will happen through way
these phases of the project phases and
as a part of the phase gate what
typically happens is that the project
performance is always compared with
what's documented in various project
documents
we'll come across documents like
business case or project charter the
project management plan our benefits
management plan and we created certain
things there we may have put up
milestones of the project over there or
we may have put up how the benefits
would be realized on this project once
we deploy it in production once my
customers started or start using it so I
need to then compare the performance of
the project with what is mentioned in
these documents so as a part of the
phase that's what I do typically and
these things actually helps me in taking
certain decisions which could take the
example but for now what we'll do is
that let's take a quick example of
project charter or project management
plan so you may have put up there as a
part of the project management plan that
you would be completing your
requirements gathering the start date
and the end date and what you will get
as an output is requirements
specification document so this is what
you have agreed as a part of your
project management plan under scope
management activities so when you
proceed working on the project we look
back and check as a part of the project
performance whether we completed the
requirement phase or not and when we
completed the requirement phase whether
my requirement specification document
has it been created has it been approved
by the stakeholder or not and based on
the overall progress then we make
certain decisions like for example
whether to continue to the next phase so
if in case depending upon again in which
phase you are working so if it is a
feasibility phase that you are at so you
just identified some project idea and
then you started working on it and you
are doing the feasibility whether can we
convert this idea into some product
which we can then sell it in the market
so at the feasibility stage itself
you've realized that this can't be
materialized maybe because of certain
reasons so then you may decide to not to
continue ahead of it right so these
decisions are taken based on the phase
gates another decision could be
continued to the next phase so if your
idea is going to work if it is feasible
to be implemented then you might just
work on a business case and they will
just start working on a project so
you've just decided that let's just
continue working on it and let's move on
to the next phase where we actually
create
business case and the benefits
management plan and then the sponsor
will create that and then we'll hand it
over to the project manager who will
then work on the project charter or
sometimes decision could be to end the
project so at the middle of the project
at times if the business objective
itself has changed then at times it
could also be decided to end the project
then and there itself so for example
there were some regulation you do which
we started working on a project however
we realized that that regulation itself
is no more now valid and we don't need
to now work on any changes which were
triggered as a part of that regulation
or maybe the compliance activity so we
could just end the project then and
there itself or we could just remain in
the phase and we could extend it so if
you are in requirements and if you are
behind the schedule or if you are not
able to achieve what you have put up as
a part of the plan
then you might need to then extend it or
might you agree to extend that plan as
well or you could also repeat the phase
or elements of it you could extend it
you could repeat it so these kind of
decisions are taken based on the phase
gates that we agreed and that we have
put up in these documents these are the
project documents and these are
definitely important so moving on to
then the project management processes so
let's try to understand first what is a
process and sure you must have worked on
n number of processes and if you
actually see the typical whenever we
work on a process we always come across
there are some series of activities that
are mentioned in a process and we have
to perform those activities one by one
and these activities are interdependent
on each other whenever we work on any
process there is always a predefined
objective that we try to achieve so if
it is a requirements gathering process
there is a predefined objective that by
the end of this process I should be able
to produce a requirement specification
document which will then be analyzed
further in order to create a design of
the product which I am working on so
there is always some predefined
objective like whenever we even start
working on a project there is some
objective that you have on mind it could
be that product service or a result
as an outcome that we talked about so
that's a process you take any process
you would always find these
characteristics of a process so whenever
we work on any process
you always have few things that we need
to really take into consideration like
there would always be some inputs to the
process when we work on a process we
need to refer to some of those inputs
then we always use certain tools and
certain techniques which actually helps
us in working through that process
efficiently and we always have some
outcome you know so which is certain
outputs that we get at the end of the
process when we complete that let's take
a quick example for example you are
working on a process which is the scope
management so as a part of the scope
management process for example you would
refer to certain inputs which could be
the project charter or project
management plan or quality management
plan or project lifecycle descriptions
that are given the development approach
etc all this is given as a part of your
project management plan you would also
refer to the enterprise environmental
factors and organizational process
assets so that you can get ready-made
templates as a part of the OPA or
organizational process assets so these
are the inputs that I would refer to
when I will start working on the scope
management now what kind of pulls and
techniques can I use one of the tool and
technique that I can start using is the
expert judgment so I can identify those
people who have gathered scope or who
have worked on the scope before and who
are kind of subject matter expert or who
have got good number of years of
experience into that and I'll try to
take their judgment and I'll try to take
their views on this you know I will try
to take their inputs on this so the
expert judgment could be a very simple
and yet very useful and something which
we can do quickly as well as a part of
the technique the another thing that we
could do is the alternative analysis so
I can always look for what are the
different alternatives that I have in
front of me and then what I could do all
right
there another simple tool I could use is
conducting meetings so I could conduct
meetings with my stakeholders to find
out what are their expectation out of
the product that we are building and
even I could run surveys I could run
questionnaire
so there are so many different
techniques and tools I could use in
order to gather requirements as a part
of the scope management and what I would
get by the end of it
what output can I expect at the end of
this process is of course the scope
management plan so I would have a scope
management plan which I can refer to in
order to understand the overall approach
to the scope management in the project
that I am working on what I would also
get is the requirements management plan
how am I going to manage requirements
overall so it could be even requirements
which keeps coming even after we kick
start working on the project so how am I
going to manage them what is the
approach that overall I have agreed or
we have agreed as a team on this project
so this is just one quick example so
whenever we come across a process always
remember you always find certain inputs
which needs to be used in order to get
started on that process will always need
to use certain tools and techniques
which will help and make our life easier
and make that process efficient at the
same time there is always going to be
something that is expected by the end of
that process which is nothing but your
outputs so what is that output that I am
expecting by the end of this process I
should be knowing that up front so
that's about process and of course we
are going to learn more about process as
we proceed we are going to cover xlix
processes which are part of the team
Bach six Edition and as a part of the
examination we should be aware about all
these 14 and processes and what happens
within these processes what are the
different inputs outputs tools
techniques that we use and at times it
might sound confusing but once you
understand the context then you will be
able to relate it very easy so from
there we are going to actually move on
to a bit of a different topic which is
alluring
now this topic has been introduced as a
part of the sixth edition of PIM Bach it
was not there earlier but and I
completely appreciate the fact that PMI
has decided to put this topic as a part
of the sixth edition the reason is that
as a project manager especially this is
very very important this is where we get
an opportunity to implement and practice
the knowledge and skills that we have
learned over the period of time
living what do we do typically in this
tailoring so this is the area where we
actually select an appropriate process
tools inputs outputs techniques life
cycle based on the kind of project that
I'm working on so it could also depend
on the kind of project constraints I
will be coming across or kind of
governance expectations on the project
the culture right or for that matter the
customers I am catering to so project
manager is the one who will be
ultimately doing this and for that
project manager need to collaborate with
multiple stakeholders in order to ensure
that the process is tailored based on
these factors that we just discussed
so every organization will have their
own project management methods to suit
them and provide additional tailoring
guidelines for individual projects and
bigger the organization I have seen the
complexity goes up and specially there
is lot of demand there is a lot of need
from the governance point of view so if
you do not manage or if you do not
tailor your process well you might land
up getting into an trouble so it's very
important that you need to alert the
process based on the kind of project
that you're working on kind of
constraints that you are handling and
kind of governance requirement that you
would have on your project so to give
you an example let's say we were working
on a project where in the complexity was
very very high because there are
multiple stakeholders involved not only
that they were stakeholders involved
from different different time zones as
well so we had to use certain tools
which will help us in ensuring that all
the stakeholders are collaborating well
because that was our biggest challenge
and hence we started using a tool which
is actually a confluence and JIRA and
that helped us in ensuring that even
though our team members and the
stakeholders actually are distributed
but still we were able to perform the
task smoothly and we had to make use of
also the various tools as I mentioned
from JIRA and confluence as far as the
collaboration is concerned we had to use
of course the video conferencing movie
and some of these tools which actually
helped us in coming together during the
meetings and the discussions at the same
time even if you are working
of some time zone wherein there is no
overlap happening but still whatever the
activities that you have completed are
always updated so that when the other
person start working the other person
would know what all things that person
is supposed to start working on so this
kind of a tailoring really helped us
ensuring that we sell smoothly even
though the complexity in the project was
bit on a hide side especially with
respect to the distributed themes and
distributed stakeholders this is just a
quick example but as we go ahead in this
training we have taken some more example
and based on the context we have
actually discussed out some scenarios as
well and what we could use what could
work better
etc we have discussed as part of this
training as well I am just taking a
pause here to check if there is any
question so I can see here there is one
question from Matt and then he is asking
about where all we can apply tailoring
and how we could do this so Matt as I
mentioned here when we started
discussing about tailoring so tailoring
is all about based on the context that
you're working in so you need to first
understand what kind of context you are
in as I mentioned our project context
was that we had a team which was highly
which was heavily distributed at the
same time there was a timezone challenge
as well so that was our context those
people who were experienced and though
people were having that kind of a past
experience of working this way so use of
tool only facilitated the whole
experience of working smoothly so you
need to first understand the kind of
context that you are in even some of the
factors that I mentioned here on the
slide like culture alright so if you are
dealing with a culture what kind of
cultural aspects like if you have
stakeholders belonging to let's say US
or UK or China or India so then the
culture definitely changes so we need to
factor that as well what kind of a
governance do you need really if the
project is for example I have seen
sometimes a project is like a
high-performing project so there is not
a tension given to such a project
wherein if there is any project which is
strategically linked to the
organizational objective then that
project
gets a lot of attention so that is the
case that probably you need to have a
separate governance altogether so you
can't really have just a governance
called just for the sake of it once in a
fortnight or once in a month probably
you need to get started or you need to
have such a governance calls once in
every week and you need to also think
about how are you going to really report
the progress of such project to the
senior management what kind of a
dashboard should we be using etc so
these are different ways which we need
to really think through based on the
context that we are working on so I hope
I answered your question
all right so matt has given a thumbs up
so I presume that you know he's happy
about what he just shared and of course
as we go ahead you will also come across
various ways through which we can do
that so let's move on to what we
discussed some time ago about the
process now let's understand about the
project management process and it's
group so as I mentioned the project
management as far as the PMI is
concerned and the PMP is concerned so
there are certain process groups that
you may have read somewhere or if in
case you have already started reading
about PIM Bock then probably you may
have already read about these five
different process groups and these are
nothing but initiating planning
executing monitoring and controlling and
closing these are the five process
groups that we have as a part of the PIM
Bock and this process group would income
pass there are almost 49 processes and
these are like mapped to the 49
processes as I said so for example
initiating would have two processes
planning 24 executing and monitoring and
controlling 12 processes and closing has
only one process one important point
here which we need to really remember
and understand is these are not the
phases sometimes it seems as if these
are phases so for example we initiate a
project then we do planning and we
execute and then a monitoring control
and we close but remember that these are
not the phases they are also called as
domains of project management from the
PMI or from the pin box point of view
but actually these process groups will
be a part of each and every phase so for
example if you take a phase let's say
requirement gathering is a phase so we
initiate
requirement gathering then we do
planning about how are we going to do or
how are we gonna gather requirements
then we execute that means we actually
go and maybe do interviews or we run
surveys or we have focus group exercises
etc so that's execution part of it and
throughout this we also monitor your and
control because we have a requirements
management plan right or we have a scope
management plan and then we see how
whether we are performing as per the
plan or not so we have a monitoring and
controlling happening as well and once
we complete it then we close which is
nothing but we actually look for what
output did we get as a part of the
requirement management process so maybe
you've got a requirement specification
document you got a requirement
management plan etc so then you are good
to close the process so this is just a
quick example but you must have realized
that all this process group can fit into
each of these processes each of the
phases I mean to say so these are not
phases but these are just the domains
and this fits into various phases of the
project apart from the process groups we
also have knowledge areas so initially
there were nine but now we have pim Bach
the latest in fact the previous edition
itself added the new knowledge area
which is stakeholder management so now
we've got ten knowledge areas so
starting with integration management is
one of the biggest in fact amongst these
ten knowledge areas then we have scope
management schedule management cost
management quality management resource
management communications management
risk management procurement and
stakeholder management so as you can see
here the various processes belong to
these knowledge areas and I'll give you
another way which will also help you in
getting a fair idea about how these
knowledge areas and the process groups
and the different processes are fits and
this will gives us a large picture about
the knowledge areas process groups and
the various processes so as you can see
here these are the process ones that you
see here in the column leftmost column
is nothing but the different knowledge
areas and the ones that you see at the
top are nothing but the different
processes that we have so initiating
planning executing monitoring and
controlling and closing
and then there are these 49 processes so
just to give you one example so for
example project integration management
would cut across all the process groups
because when it comes to integration we
are integrating the activities that we
are performing right or the processes
that we are performing as a part of
these various process groups that means
project integration management is
definitely one of the biggest knowledge
areas then scope management would have
mainly planning part and bit of a
monitoring and controlling as I
mentioned schedule management however
will be mostly planning and a bit of a
monitoring and controlling but if you
see closing is the smallest one so it
has only one process in that alright so
this is how the 14 end processes are
mapped across these process groups and
the different knowledge areas so I am
sure this must have given you a fair
idea about what will we have to study as
a part of the exam so as part of the
examination will have to study how these
process groups have these 10 knowledge
areas and 14 end processes they are
interlinked and we need to also go
through all of these processes and we
need to understand them one by one as
far as this training is concerned this
training is organized by knowledge areas
so you'll find each and every module in
this training is based on the knowledge
area so we'll be starting with for
example a module on integration
management right then we'll be moving on
to scope management likewise there are
various modules on this training which
are based on the knowledge areas so from
there so we've just saw a bit on process
groups then knowledge areas now let's
talk a bit on processes the various
processes that we just saw there are 49
of them now there are a few things that
I just wanted to highlight about them so
you will find these processes which
sometimes they're used only once or at a
predefined point kind of in the project
example could be project charter or a
closed project or a phase so if you see
the project charter so once you create
the project charter in the beginning of
the project then you just keep on
referring to that you don't have to
unless there is impacted or modified but
of course you go on modifying it if in
case there is an impact but once you
have it you have it for the whole
project and that is something which kind
of
empowers you as a project manager and
also gives you an authority to use all
the resources that are required on the
project now similarly even the close
project if you see there is only one
process that's it so it is just used
during the last phase which is nothing
but closing similarly you'll find there
are certain processes which are
performed periodically one of the
example could be acquiring resources now
resources are required on the project
Road so whenever we acquire resources we
need to refer to this process or for
that matter conduct procurement we need
to work on conduct procurement
activities as in when we need to engage
for example vendors or as and when we
need to procure certain machineries or
you need to buy some licenses from some
OEMs or some vendors so that means we
need to keep on performing procurement
related activities throughout the
project so these are periodically
performed processes on the other hand
there are certain processes which are to
be performed on a continuous basis
throughout the project like define
activities so you'll find we need to
keep on defining activities as a part of
a generative process you always have
activities because if you see process
process will have different activities
which are interlinked so that's one
example and the one is monitoring and
controlling activities again these
activities you'll find if I just go back
here and you'll find monitoring and
controlling activities are part of
almost all the knowledge areas so these
activities will need to be performed on
a continuous basis so this is a bit on
the processes that we are going to cover
as part of this training anyways all
right from there we are going to move on
to project management data and
information because while working on
project you will be gathering lots of
data so you should be knowing you should
have some strategy in place in terms of
how are you going to deal with that data
what kind of information what kind of a
matrix should I be preparing so let's
take a look at this how does this work
most of the times I have seen that on
project unless you're a very small
company there's always some PMI is that
is used which is project management
information system it could be for
example the one that you may be using
already from Microsoft which is MS
Project or it
be from CA Technologies clarity so
whichever the tool that you're using or
it could be simply Excel based PM is
tool that you are using currently in
your project so whichever the tool that
you're using typically what happens all
the work performance related data it's
captured as a part of the tool so right
from the planning activities to
executing the activities and capturing
the actuals and maybe completion of
tasks etc all this information is
captured through this tool which is PM
is tool whichever the tool that you are
using actually now based on that data
will have to actually come up with the
work performance information and for
that what was typically done is that the
data is collected from various
controlling processes its analyzed
context and it's integrated based on the
relationships across areas so you'll
find that data is gathered let's say
from cost point of view from scheduled
point of view if I have to give you
quick two examples so how are we doing
in terms of cost how are we doing in
terms of schedule so we also take into
consideration the cost performance index
scheduled performance index so are we
ahead of the schedule or are we behind
the schedule are we overspending or are
we under spending so typically all this
information is kind of analyzed based on
the data that is gathered and then we
create different work performance
reports these reports are then shared
with the team with the stakeholders etc
now these reports there are certain
standard report formats also again the
reports will have information about
against the project management plan how
are we performing so that's what
typically the report information would
have so again from the schedule point of
view from the cost point of view from
the scope point of view risk etc so all
these constraints typically we need to
represent in a very concise and a
succinct manner in report which is then
shared with the team as well as with the
management now if you see this
particular diagram you'll find that we
gather all the data through the PM is
then we work on the performance
information rights which I gave us a few
examples and then we create reports
these reports
then shared with the team all right with
team members as well as the stakeholders
through the project communication
management now whenever there is any
project change that is introduced it
goes through the project change control
now the project is changed whatever the
change that is incorporated at any point
in time in project either it is approved
or rejected so if the change is approved
again it will go back to executing
process and the same thing will happen
and all this information is again shared
with the team member and the
stakeholders so this is what typically
happens with respect to data and
information on the project because there
is lots of data there's lots of
information that's available and we need
to analyze it we need to ensure that we
are making use of it effectively and we
are communicating it to the right people
at the right time and most importantly
we are also taking certain decisions in
order to take some preventive and
corrective actions so that's the most
important thing from the data point of
view from there we are now going to talk
about project management documents now
especially from the business side you'll
find couple of documents as I mentioned
earlier as well the project business
case and the project benefits management
plan these couple of documents which are
developed by the sponsor and where the
project manager's responsibility will
come into picture is aligning project
plan or business case or benefit
management plan chapter even for that
matter the project success measures
organizational goal and most importantly
tailored some of these documents so as
to align to the program business case
and that's where the project manager
come into picture in order to establish
that overall alignment to the business
case because ultimately that business
case and the benefit management plan is
the most important document from the
business point of view
so whatever the activities that are
performed on the project needs to be
aligned to that so that in turn it will
help you achieve the ultimate objective
of the business and that's where the
project manager come into picture
now we'll also take a look at the
interrelationships of how the need is
assessed and some of the critical
business project documents now this is
important from a high-level point of
view as a project manager sometimes I
have seen that not
everybody has this weave but it's good
to have this view so as I mentioned some
need assessment may have done based on
which business case gets triggered and
then business management plan is created
so if you take a simple example let's
say you are working in some service line
or some line of business and suddenly
you decide strategically that you want
to move digital okay so there is some
need assessment that must have done that
all the competitors they are digital and
it's important that we also need to move
on the digital platform so that's a need
assessment that is done then you create
a business case so if you have to move
digital what kind of a business case how
much what are the options what are the
various alternatives that are available
and what is the best possible
alternative and what kind of a benefits
would we get once we implement the
solution that we have chosen can be then
captured as part of the benefit
management plan so once this is agreed
at a business side then these two
documents are prepared by business
sponsor the sponsor will work on the
business case and the benefit management
plan and will give it to the project
manager the project charter is also
prepared and given it to the project
manager because then project manager is
authorized to use different resources on
the project at the same time he is then
formally engaged on the project so
actual project activities will kick
start from whence the project Charter is
in place onwards so before that whatever
the activities that happen are basically
categorized under the project work
activities so right from that idea
generation or sub need assessment to
coming up with a business case or for
that matter then writing business
benefit plan etc all these are nothing
but the pre project work now these pre
project work is important because
ultimately this is the one that will
trigger the project and then once we
have a project charter in place then we
kickstart the project activities so then
you will come across various the
preparation part of the project so you
would also work on the project
management plan based on the project
charter and then you would typically
carry out your execution of the project
management plan activities and once you
complete all the phases then you will
close it so this is how typically some
of the key documents would fall in
through this various phases and through
this project life
now what we'll do is as an example we
will take some of these documents and
we'll just try to learn about them what
all these documents usually contains so
starting with the project business case
so if you see project business case what
would it have of course I'm going to
show you the actual business case so
that it will be the fear idea but let me
just pause here and take a look at if
there is any questions so I can see here
that it Savita is having this question
that who prepares project charter this
is a good question by the way because I
have seen sometimes this question is
also there in the examination and people
get confused sometimes I have seen
people writing about project manager is
the one who will create a project
charter but don't forget that project
manager is been given a project charter
that means somebody else has prepared it
so in this case it's going to be the
sponsor of the project will be creating
the project charter and handing over it
to the project manager which authorizes
the project manager to kick-start the
project at the same time it gives as I
said authority to the project manager to
use all the resources on the project so
that means it's a project sponsor who is
actually working on the project charter
and then handover it to the project
manager so I hope this answers your
question all I try got an affirmation
from her thank you now then moving on to
the project business case so this is
what we were talking about so business
case will typically have again need
assessment which we just referred to
there are various evaluations criteria
it would have even some pre project work
activities most importantly is project
success how it's going to be measured at
the same time how can we maintain it
throughout the project and of course the
recommendations go/no-go various
business need what are the various
problem areas why this project is
triggered or would need to be triggered
ultimately what are some of the goals or
root causes etc and recommendations so
the best thing that I'm going to do is
that I would rather take you through
very quickly the business case itself so
that you would get to know exactly what
all things are covered as a part of the
business case so this is just the
example of the business case for some
project and I'm just going to read
through this not everything of course
but only the
Keating's so that you can understand and
you can relate to what we just spoke
about the business case the key points
so talking about executive summary so
for this business case of for example
this business case outlines how the web
platform project will address current
business concerns the benefits of the
project recommendations and
justification of the project the
business case also discusses detailed
project goal performance measure
assumptions constraints alternative
options so that means I come to know
that this project is about web platform
project so what was the issue the
business was facing due to which this
project is initiated because of an
expanding client base Smith consulting
has moved to a decentralized business
model over the last two years as we
continue to support more clients in more
locations the administration of our
workforce has become more difficult
until now many of our internal
requirements such as reporting payroll
activities resources management have
been done via agency legacy mainframe
systems so in a way this gives us an
idea about why this project was
initiated so basically there were a lot
of decentralized activities that are
performed but now they wanted to
centralize it obviously there is a cost
benefit as well so what are the
anticipated outcomes moving to a
centralized web-based administered a
platform which will not only give ease
of operation but also will save cost
what are the recommendations of course
there are various options and
alternatives were analyzed to determine
the best way to leverage technology to
improve the business process and reduce
the overall cost within Smith consulting
the approach described here allows us to
meet our corporate objectives of
continuously improving efficiency this
is very important what is objective
ultimately all right objective here at
the corporate level in this case Smith
consulting has this objective of
improving efficiency reduce cost and
capitalize on technology so there is
some technology already in place so can
we capitalize on that technology and
achieve some of these business
objectives so I'm sure this must have
given you
zest of idea about the problem area why
this particular project is initiated
Smith Consulting's
overall objective and how this is
aligned to the
justification the migration of payroll
and other administrative function from
the legacy main film system to the
web-based platform will result in great
efficiency with regards to company
resources and business process so here
we are talking about mainly efficiency
and if you see you must have noticed
here this particular project is
straightaway aligning to the
organizational goals and objectives so
in this case one of the goal is of
course efficiency gains and cost saving
and this project of moving on to the
web-based platform is completely
aligning to that another important thing
that here we need to really focus on is
the what exactly are we expecting what
kind of a benefits are we expecting so
here very objectively it is mentioned
15% reduction in overhead cost in the
first 12 months 10 percent decrease in
employer nor in the first 12 months 50%
immediate decrease in time to generate 2
weekly and monthly financial reports etc
so very objectively we need to capture
this data so that we can start measuring
it so this would also then be a part of
my business benefits management plan
when we'll talk about it then I'm sure
you will be able to relate it to this as
well business case analysis team so who
are going to be involved then what is
the problem statement and short now we
are clear with that at high level what
will be the organizational impact so for
example this is another area which will
give us an idea about with this project
what kind of a changes would happen what
kind of impact it would create on
technology on people on structure etc so
let's take a quick example here the WP
project will impact Smith consulting in
several ways the following provides high
level explanations of how the
organization tools processes rules
responsibilities will be affected as a
result of WP project implementation okay
so for example process with the WP
project comes more efficient and
streamlined administrative and payroll
process this improved efficiency will
lessen the burden on managers and
provide autonomy to employees in
managing their administrative and
payroll tasks and actions so that means
there is a change in process earlier
this was done by the managers now it's
gonna be done by the employees
themselves so there is an impact
clear-cut on the process this was just
one example this could have impact on
Rosen's
once abilities even technology one of
new hardware software etc that have the
technology migration will be done so you
will put the overall approach what
phases we would follow but his overall
project overview again he will put that
description etc and most importantly
again the cost what kind of cost your
project would incur and even from the
performance point of view this is
another area where I would like to just
spend a few seconds so this talks about
some of the key resources like reporting
time sheets software and system
maintenance and staff resources so this
is where the performance enhancements
will come into picture so these are the
areas of focus that the team has
identified what kind of assumptions now
assumptions and constraint we need to
also highlight very clearly assumption
is all staff and employees will be
retrained accordingly in their
respective data entry timesheets and
reporting tasks because this involves
employee performing these activities
which were performed earlier by the
managers so that means we need to clean
the employees so the assumption is that
training would happen on the platform
that is being created project constraint
will be there are limited IT resources
available to support WB project and
other ongoing IT initiatives so that
means there is a very clear-cut impact
on the resources which could hit the
another constraint could be cost or
could be you know quality if it's not
managed effectively then project
milestone so what are the milestones so
again you can mention about the various
phases completion of these phases and
maybe some of the key outputs that were
expecting what is the strategic
alignment we already covered this so
this project is strategically aligned in
terms of as you can see here improve the
record keeping new technology so again
from technology point of view and from
even the workforce retention one of you
cost-benefit analysis of the solution is
done and you have to recommend the best
solution so it could be migration on to
the new platform so by or built it
in-house whatever the option that you
decide etc okay so this was just one
example of the business case now there
is also a business benefit management
plan now again I would like to relate it
to the business case and some of the
pointers that were given in the business
case we can certainly relate even this
to but you may use whichever the
template that is available in your
company because every company would have
their own Opie's as I mentioned earlier
organizational process assets so one of
the thing under OPA is the
organizational standard templates for
benefit management plan one thing that
we need to remember under this is even
though you create plan well in advance
but the benefits will start coming once
your product is introduced in the market
or once it is life and used by the users
etc that means the real benefit
management plan will be active first of
all even though the project is completed
still the plan will be active because
once the project is live or the product
is live or it's in the market you will
start measuring the benefits and start
comparing the performance against what's
captured as a part of this plan so what
typically it would contain it would
contain the target benefits so whatever
the benefits that have mentioned for
example 20% cost reduction by the first
12 month or employee staff reduction of
15% in the first two years etc what is
the strategic alignment in this case we
just saw the strategic alignment to the
cost-saving benefit or efficiency gain
timeframe so what a time frame so again
very clear it was mentioned within 12
months within two years within three
years etc who is a benefit owner so for
each of these benefits that were
mentioned so we need to identify who is
going to owe those benefits and how
those will be then tracked so what is
the metric track boost benefits again
within that also we can mention if you
come across any assumptions or risks
likewise you can create this plan and
the project manager will ensure that the
project activities are also aligned
towards this plan all right so these
were the two documents mainly from the
business side now once these documents
are in place then project sponsor will
hand over the project charter to the
project manager so project Charter will
typically include your high level scope
items the background the context behind
why this project is initiated bit on a
business case etc who is the sponsor who
are some of the key stakeholders what
are the phases that are involved on the
project etc some of that information
including what is acceptance criteria
apart from that you would also have in
the project Charter things like what is
my star
and ended for each of the email stones
that I've agreed to or with the
stakeholders etc then who are my signing
authorities who is going to give me sign
off on some of the key milestones when I
go on achieving them then a baton you
know cost whatever is mentioned as part
of the business case but stay tuned I'm
going to show the project Charter
example the actual project Charter as
part of this training and I'm sure you
will be able to then relate it to the
project Charter better and that example
is definitely good that's a progenitor
of the actual project then project
management plan is another document
which I'm going to show you which
actually contains various subsidiary
management plans like scope management
risk management quality management apart
from that how are we going to manage
these schedule stakeholders etc etc so
the project management plan is nothing
but the I would say it's comprises of
all the different subsidy management
plans which I just now mentioned so in
short this will also have how the
project is executed how it is monitored
and controlled etc so all that is going
to be a part of your project management
plan now how the project success is
going to be major ultimately because
you're doing that project so that you'll
get some benefit out of it now how are
you going to measure those benefits
there are various ways which we can use
so one the way could be the project
success could be measured if you
complete the project within constraints
like you achieved all the scope or you
completed project within schedule or
within the given budget or whatever the
quality parameters that are agreed with
the stakeholders or you optimally used
the resources on the project or you
manage risk effectively so that means
one of the way to measure the success of
the project is how well did you perform
on some of these project constraints and
if in fact I did mention that earlier as
well if I have to measure how successful
is the project manager or what is the
performance of the project manager how
do I measure that one of the ways
through which I'll measure it is how
well the project manager is managing
this project constraints so one of the
ways through which we can measure the
project success is whether I'm able to
deliver the project whatever the
commitments that I have made to my
clients
or customer whether I have delivered
those within the budget schedule at
minimal risks okay and issues etc etc so
that is one way of doing it the other
way of doing it is of course achievement
of the project objectives in itself so
for example the project objective is it
could be some benefits that we are
committing to so benefit would come once
that project or product whatever the
outcome of the project we talk about
either product or service or some result
once that product is out in the market
the benefits will start coming by
selling that product or once their
service is out in the market that
service will enhance the customer
satisfaction so that's subjective with
which we started working on the project
so it could be financial it could be
non-financial for example achieving
better customer satisfaction could be
non-financial because it's difficult to
really measure it not be 100% tangible
really I mean there are ways through
which we try to quantify but it's not
fully tangible also if we move to the
desired state maybe you're working on a
change project and then you are let's
say you had a traditional mindset and
then you are moving from that to the
agile mind session or to the mindset of
responding to the changes which customer
is demanding so that we can perform
better in the market so if that was a
project and then if you achieve that
objective then that is your success or
contract fulfillment okay so you are
obliged to some contract to the
government sometimes that there are
commitments which are made to the
government that out of the findings
could be non-compliance issues or
whatever depending on the scenario that
you are in and then you initiated that
project as a result of that and you you
could achieve the benefit such that
you're now confident that you have
started complying to those
non-compliance things that you have
identified okay apart from that there
are also other things that I mentioned
in terms of quality or all that project
could be governance compliance so that
project is initiated as a result of some
regulatory compliance activities and
then you successfully completed that and
it was done well within time so that now
we don't have to pay fine okay so
whatever the fines or regulatory fines
that we talked about you have avoided
that so
the cost avoidance which is one of the
objective that you achieve what is
defined by the stakeholder so sometimes
as I mentioned in the project charter we
also put what is the acceptance criteria
for this project so when this project
would be successfully completed so
what's the success criteria that is
being agreed between you and the
business and how you decided to measure
it so all this you mentioned anyways as
a part of the project Charter itself and
what can be the impact if you don't do
that so whatever is defined against that
you could measure it another thing is
how to link to the organizational
strategy and business results so as we
took this example of the wp Smith
Consulting's project that we were
talking about the WP platform so in that
case that project was completely aligned
to the organizational objectives of
achieving the cost reduction or gaining
efficiency or for that matter the
employee retention exception so even
that is another success criteria of the
project continuous business alignment
okay is definitely the most important
thing so I have seen that many times
whenever we talk about the project
success measurement we always revolve
around scope cost and time but it's
definitely beyond all that we need to
also factor in lot of other things that
we just mentioned over here so this
covers everything that I wanted to cover
as a power of the PMP introductory
training today and thank you for signing
in today and I'm sure I answered all
your questions that you asked through
this training and during this training
we took quite a few example at the same
time have you can embark the journey for
PMP certification and how you can plan
how we can go about completing a PMP
certification successfully what kind of
a support is available to you through it
Eureka at the same time what kind of
tools and resources that are available
at your disposal in the form of the
question Bank or when you will do the
practice of the 200 question sets so how
that support is available to you and all
the basic PMP training introductory part
we covered today of course next time
when you will come we'll get started
with the first module which is about
integration management and from there we
will start so I'm sure
or you have started your journey for the
PMP certification and this training will
definitely help you in learning about
various PMP topics as a part of the
PMBOK 6th edition which is based on the
latest Bach edition at the same time it
will give you direction and a lot of
practice at the same time confidence to
appear for the PMP certification and I'm
sure with this you will be able to clear
the PMP examination in just your first
attempt so I wish you all good luck for
your examination and thank you so much
