so we are going to look at curity so
that's the Kerberos component so again
Kerberos setup we are not going to do as
part of this install and so what we're
going to do is we are going to basically
discuss this and if somebody wants to
try it out you can definitely try it out
and try to setup Kerberos and so
basically Hadoop basically integrates
with Kerberos the Kerberos again is a
security basically principle based
authentication system so where you
basically set up principles and you with
least reduce the risk of your basically
unauthorized attacks so if you go to the
next slide you can see that when client
is talking to job tracker and they
anybody can basically give the
insufficient credentials and people can
be basically just login to your job
tracker and do things so if you have
Kerberos then whenever this client
logins to talk job tracker it well it
will have to give a ticket and that
ticket will if it's a valid ticket only
then this client would be allowed to
login to job dragon and submit jobs so
that's something that tells here that
when you have Kerberos setup you'll have
basically a key distribution center and
client will first of all get a ticket
and then when that ticket is available
with it it will send that ticket to job
tracker on name node and once name node
and job tracker basically are able to
authenticate it only then they will let
it access the data or submit the job so
so when we have Kerberos there are some
like tokens that come into picture so so
there are delegation tokens their job
tokens their block access tokens so
again Kerberos is again a different big
topic in itself so if you are interested
you can read so delegation tokens is
something that goes from client to
basically server and job tokens are from
job tracker to task trackers block
access tokens are from between name node
and date and also when you enable
Kerberos then tokens basically are some
tokens come into picture so these this
slide just tells what kind of tokens
come into picture so client to server
would be delegation toker name no to
data node will be block access tokens
from job tracker to tasks
there would be job tokens and then you
have SASL security layer so that's
something that you can read a bit more
and for assignments we try to remove
data note today so you should try that
tribe secondly name note try removing
and adding the nodes and read more about
Kerberos for people who are interested
so that's what we had for today so now
I'm going to take certain questions
Orion is saying what do we do with what
what do we exclude on data nodes and it
should exclude our neighbor and
jobtracker so we don't do any exclude on
data nodes when we are excluding they're
excluding a data node on name node and
on job tracker we are excluding at a
strike at which we did today right so we
saw that we excluded
so this decommission is going on so T n1
has data node has been excluded from
this name node and similarly for job
tracker we excluded data once we have
just two tasks trackers now so that's
what we do so me they say can you
explain the repo concept in cloud era
class when you get a chance yes once so
I think our last class is cloud era
basically we will touch cloudy Ramanujan
and I will try to basically set up cloud
era manager and show the repo concept
yes definitely so III will discuss that
so funny thing is about security so at
this point if somebody wants to log off
they can but I'm going to take some
questions and I'll again request I
waited to fill the feedback form because
that really helps us understand what I
was going on it could be good it could
be bad so whatever you feel about the
class just give it the feedback so so
that it really helps us basically
planning better and having a better
session so I will request everybody to
do the feedback I think yesterday also
only 1012 people did the Phil the
feedback so it'll be good if everybody
can fill the feedback so with that I'm
going back to the questions so funny is
saying so does that mean a user
authentication is common across name
node and Linux level so so funny when
you do Kerberos authentication what you
do is you basically setup
basically a key distribution center and
this server basically grants our tickets
so we user basically contacts this key
distribution center it gets a principal
where it has the credentials and it was
sent it credentials to the server and
which would be a name node or basically
a job tracker and name node will
basically again confirm the credentials
from key distribution center which is
admin server and then once it has
confirmed the credentials we'll let it
access so so when you say it is common
across neighborhood and Linux a level so
wait so we are not doing a
authentication at Linux level right so
we are doing authentication at Kerberos
level so we are setting up a Kerberos
server and we are using Kerberos ticket
granting mechanism as a authentication
system so we have set up this key admin
server on one of our machines and we are
getting the tickets from that machine
and this and name node will basically
contact this machine to verify the
identity of the system of any basically
request so every user will basically
send a ticket to the name node when they
contact and similarly the job tracker
when they contact them for submitting a
job so so again I mean this is something
that you can read in detail so and if
you have questions you can come back to
me next time and we can do this again I
I can take this also as like in one of
the exercises to show a live Kerberos
system in our last class so that will
basically clear out lot of questions
about Kerberos so Roscoe icing just for
knowledge is this Kerberos like LDAP or
a DSi so Kerberos is like another
authentication system is not like elda
you can integrate your system with LDAP
you can also integrate Kerberos with
Elda so you can do that but Kerberos is
just like a different authentication
mechanism so so far
saying its Cloudera rapoo which you are
going to cover yes we will take clouded
or manager as like one of the case
studies so because lot of people have
interesting cluttered managers so I'll
try to basically show how you install
flooded a manager and how you configure
your cluster using cloud area manager so
yes I can do that so Raj Kumar Singh is
where can I find the feedback from so
Rajkumar when you log out of this
meeting it will automatically come on
the screen so I guess you can just fill
it up and submit so ran is saying one
question on hive is do we install a
separate my sequel server to store my
data for hive tables so yes so again we
will cover this in hive class but I can
answer this question so when you set up
a meta store so so what hi v-- need a
meta store so you can have few options
so you can run like a post craze you can
run derby or you can run my sequel so in
under my sequel you will create a
database for your storing hype tables
which we call meta store so it will
create a database in my sequel for hive
and then people will just contact
directly that metaphor for all the
queries so yes you can use you will you
can use my sequel server and create a
database and there is a connection
string that you define in hive for
people so in there you will type your
complete location of the port where my
sequel is running host and port and then
slash the database name which would be a
meta store so funny thing I heard it's
way easier with code analyzer to many
tasks it seems yes but then we don't go
with courier manager because if you just
start with sort of a manager you won't
really understand what's going on in the
background because card to the manager
just gives you a GUI and you just once
set it up everything will come back up
and you won't really understand what's
going on behind the scene so what you
understand with this course with this
manual installation is what is the real
thing and you just we just don't quote
go directly to GUI so because you guys
are administrators right so you should
know internals of things so if you go to
clutter a manager you will just know the
cui you won't know what when you click
start name node what exactly happens so
now you know that you have to first
format a name node and when data nodes
comes you have to add the tries here to
make sure the permissions are correct so
design manager does all of things these
things for you so you don't really
understand the system and when somebody
comes to you that okay my
data node is not coming up so from cloud
era manager log you will you might not
get all the information which you might
go directly by logging logging into the
data node and see what the issue is so
which is what I guess the good way to do
is to first understand everything
command line how things work and then
you can go to a GUI based install so
that's why I guess we cover it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
