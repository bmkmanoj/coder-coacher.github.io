you need to remember one thing that
pointers can always be used in place of
an addict
the sense let's say I have an array a of
20 I don't have to access the data only
using the variable a if I want to access
the fifth element I could always say a
of six or if I want to access the fourth
element I can say a of five that is one
way of accessing it but I can also
access entire array using a single
pointer we're going to see how we can do
that so let's say this part is our
memory now if I say int K of 10 in
memory he's going to allocate 10 blocks
and each block is of size 4 bytes
because integer so we're gonna have 10
this may not exactly be 10 let's say we
have 10 blocks so this is a of zero this
is a of one of to a of 3 so on up to a
of 9 and this is a as you mentioned
earlier the variable a alone that any
index is the starting address and using
a we can access any blocked one so if I
wanna access the fourth one which is a
of three so when I say a of three what
internally happens is this is a plus 3
into size of int so 3 into size of int
which is size of int is four for 312 she
adds 12 bytes to a the starting here 4 8
12 and this is where the fourth block
starts so the math is simple if I want
to access a of 9 you would just say a
plus 9 into 4 so if I relax anything
like a of n would be a plus n into size
of end which is 4 in this case
isn't that simple now let's say I
declare a pointer an integer pointer in
star PTR and I initialize a pointer to
the first integer in the array so I can
say the address of a of 0 so this is
allowed right I can get the address of
anything in memory now a of 0 has an
address a of 1 has an address a of one's
address is this a of two that this is
this a of 0 the address is here so let's
say this has an address of 5000 so I say
in star PTR equal to address of a of 0
which is 5000 so he's going to allocate
a variable PTR in memory and this is
going to have the address of a of 0
which is 5000 stolen so now if I say
star PTR he goes to the address 5,000
and fetches an integer from there which
is nothing but he is fetching a of 0 for
me let's say so sing star PTR I say now
PTR + 1 so what is PDR + 1 so first
before we see what is PTR plus 1 what is
PTR alone PTR by itself is just the
address which is 5000 in this case so
when I add 1 to 5,000 I'm supposed to
get 5,000 and one but that is not what
happens with pointer arithmetic in
pointer asthmatic every time you
increment the value of the address
increments by the size of the type of
variable it's pointing to so in this
case PTR is of the type int star that
means pointing to a variable type int so
every time I add 1 to the address the
address will get incremented by the size
of int so if I add 1 it actually gets
incremented by 4 so PT R plus 1 is
actually the address 5,000 for if I add
2 to PTR's
then PTL actually become 5008 so we've
now seen how we can use pointers to
axial elements and add it there was not
much of a difference with an a/d you use
an index number that pointers we just
did point arithmetic otherwise it's
pretty much the same thing here you see
a of 5 otherwise pointer is a pointer
plus 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
