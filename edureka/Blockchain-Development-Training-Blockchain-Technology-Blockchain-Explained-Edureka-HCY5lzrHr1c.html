dear akka I welcome you all to this
session on blockchain development
training now before we proceed could all
of you just give me a quick confirmation
in the chat box as to whether I'm
audible or not okay so that seems pretty
nice ready apathy is ready vineeth is
ready and the rest seem to be ready too
okay so let's begin with today's session
now let me quickly give you all an
overview of the topics that we are going
to cover today we will be discussing
about blockchain and the concepts that
make its foundation then we will talk
about the blockchain related employment
opportunities and the technical skills
that you require to grab these
opportunities we also will be giving a
little special attention to smart
contracts and smart contract development
since it has become such an integral
rule of a blockchain developer I'll also
show you some really interesting smart
contracts and decentralized applications
that have been made so far and in the
end we are going to have a coda long
session where we make our own very own
smart contract to simulate Kickstarter
in a decentralized manner now it's
almost taken for granted that you might
know what a blockchain is when you are
attending a blockchain development
training session but for the few of us
amongst us that still don't know or have
a few doubts I'm going to be going over
the basics of the technology that has
had quite an impact on the world
so blockchain is the technology that
serves as the backbone of
cryptocurrencies in short
blockchain could be described as an
immutable record of who owns what but
what does that exactly mean on a
computer on a computer it would mean it
is a decentralized and distributed
database of Ledger's which are synced
across a peer-to-peer network through
consensus algorithm that might have
confused some of you but fret not
everything will be clear by the end of
the session to get a better
understanding of blockchain technology
let us go through its four main concepts
the first and most principal concept the
blockchain technology is distributed and
decentralized networks so unlike
centralized networks that are owned by a
company or an organization and are a
focus of data these centralized networks
are the exact opposite these centralized
networks have no single point of
functionality they have multiple servers
over the network that hold these pieces
of data that is being transferred
through the network this because of this
design structure that attacks like DDoS
which are focused on specific servers
are rendered useless by decentralized
Network a decentralized network can
become
to a lightbulb with more than one input
wires even if one stops working the
light path keeps going as long as what
those input wires are working the second
concept of blockchain technology is that
of a shared ledger a ledger is the list
of transactions on the blockchain
network now every time any PL on the
network commits a transaction it is
broadcasted to the entire network
if the network's consensus algorithm
deems the transaction valid it is added
to the ledger the catch here is that the
ledger seen by any peer is the same as
they are kept in sync the ledger serve
as a single source of truth for
transaction history now that I've told
you about the consensus algorithm it's
only fair we discuss it as it is the
third principle concept that keeps
blockchain technology up and running the
consensus algorithm allows a peer to
come to the decision whether a
transaction is valid or not a consensus
algorithm can be thought of as a complex
math problem this problem is solved by
miners or anybody on the network ok so
it seems like Priya has posted a
question in the chat box
she's asking who exactly are these
miners so miners are people who have set
up workstations to actually solve these
consensus algorithms they invest huge
amounts of money in high-quality
parallel processing units called GPUs
these people have made their daily
earning by validating transactions on
various blockchain networks and owning
block rewards I hope that answers your
question Priya now
okay so coming back to the topic of
consensus algorithms there are many type
of consensus algorithms the first
consensus to be ever used was
proof-of-work algorithm which was used
in the Bitcoin blockchain since then
other concepts of consensus algorithms
have been invented for example proof of
stake proof of elapsed time proof of
capacity and proof of storage these
consensus algorithm serve as the heart
of the whole system as it is the
singular thing that tells us about the
validity of a transaction the last
principle concept of blockchain
technology is cryptography cryptography
is the art of hiding and encrypting data
or in more technical terms transfer to
given plaintext to its respective
ciphertext block seen uses a
state-of-the-art cryptographic
algorithms that result in such a secure
and immutable systems the most prominent
form of cryptography that can be seen is
public private key cryptography which is
mainly used to generate unique digital
signatures for every transaction the
sender of the message Judas's publicly
in conjunction which is message to form
a ciphertext since the digital signature
is made in conjunction with the message
it ensures that the digital signature
will be unique almost every time
cryptography also secures other aspects
of blockchain technology but as for some
other session some other day so now that
we've discussed the principle concepts
of blockchain technology it must make
more sense to you when I say that
blockchain is a cryptographically
protected universally synchronized
distributed and decentralized database
of who owns what it's quite a
revolutionary thought process that has
been implemented into this fantastic
piece of tech this also means that
blockchain technology has created
numerous job opportunities for tech
enthusiasts let's discuss these job
profiles now so as you can see there are
three distinct job profiles namely a
blockchain architect a blockchain
software developer and a blockchain
consultant a blockchain consultant is a
person who works as any other consultant
and advises organizations and businesses
as to how blockchain could help their
cause next a blockchain architect as the
name suggests is the guy responsible for
building blockchain architecture and
protocols regarding blockchain networks
next we have blockchain software
developers or commonly known as
blockchain developers these people are
developers who develop applications
using blockchain technology as some of
you guys attending this session might
already know that
centralized applications have become
quite the buzzword in the tech community
and for good reason to these
decentralized applications have zero
downtime and complete transparency and
security which is quite a lot to offer
for an application this is exactly what
blocks in developers are busy coding so
since our topic of the session is
blockchain development will be
discussing about these guys a little bit
small so let's begin by discussing the
technical skills you guys need if you
want to become a blog scene developer
yourself first of all you need to have a
very good understanding of cryptography
and data structures as they form the
base of blockchain technology next you
will have to study the blockchain
architecture and the best way to do this
is by reading the Bitcoin white paper as
Bitcoin was the first implementation of
blockchain it's white paper has the
working of the same down to the tiniest
detail so you guys need to know some
basic path development to become a
practicing blockchain developer last but
not the least and also the most
important requirement is the ability to
develop smart contracts so for those of
you here that have no keyword smart
contracts these are pieces of code that
can help control blockchain transactions
a very simple example would be something
like the transaction that is controlled
by a test condition for example a smart
contract could exist that sends some
amount to Priya now as Shashank here on
the outcome of some football match like
Manchester City versus Manchester United
smart contract functionality is
available on various blockchain
platforms in today's time so let's go
through a few of them the first platform
that comes to mind when talking about
smart contracts has to be theorem if
helium is the first block in platform to
implement smart contract functionality
built by Vitalik butyrin it's helium
advertises itself as a robust
peer-to-peer network that works like the
world supercomputer by connecting peers
across the globe and helping them commit
transactions that are more value to them
then simple bookkeeping of values next
we have hyper ledger hyper ledger is a
project under the Linux Foundation the
strives to bring blockchain solutions to
industries and hence create a blockchain
network that suppose true private and
confidential transactions next up we
have iota which uses a special
technology called Stangl as the Internet
of Things keep expanding the need for
interoperability and sharing of
resources has become a necessity iota
enables companies to explore new
business to business models
by making every technological resource a
potential service to be traded on an
open market in real time with no fees at
all
lastly we have Stella Stella is a
platform that connects banks themed
systems and people Stella integrates all
these confidence to move money quickly
lively and at almost no cost whatsoever
ok so it seems Vinny's house posted the
question in the chat box he's asking
what languages are these spot contracts
programmed in I was just getting to that
beneath that's actually my next topic so
most smart contracts are developed in
network specific scripting languages for
example if hitam smart contracts are
written in solidity or serpent while
hyper logic contracts are written in
chain code there have also been new api
is like Liske which allow developers to
write the blocks in applications and
smart contracts in JavaScript along
ditch known to most developers coming
back to network specific languages like
solidity serpent and Viper these
languages are very similar to common
object-oriented programming languages
like Java if you guys have experience in
object-oriented programming
you should definitely try learning one
of these languages I hope I've answered
your question beneath could he just give
me input for information in the chat box
okay so when he says he satisfied so
let's move ahead with today's session
okay so now that we've seen who
developed these decentralized
applications running on smart contracts
it's time I show you some of my personal
favorite decentralized application so
firstly we have la Luz Luz is a
decentralized taxi service that connects
drivers directly to customers in this
way they remove centralized services
like uber and Ola which take away a
maximum margin of the profit by paying
the drivers only minimum wages next up
we have Leroy Leroy is a decentralized
Twitter our online identity and data is
particularly sensitive and data breaches
by centralized companies like Facebook
MySpace Microsoft has made us realize
how vulnerable we are
Leroy takes all this data and stores it
on a decentralized network such that
nobody owns your data for future misuse
pretty cool right lastly we have lock it
lock it combines the two moves from sync
technologies that is blockchain and iot
which lock it smart apartments become
fully automated
Smart Objects can be rented on-demand
and unused vehicles get a new lease on
life they are developing the future
infrastructure of sharing the economy
now all these cool decentralized
applications have one thing in common
their basic application logic is run
with the help of smart contracts okay so
I guess it's time I give you all the
demo on how to build a smart contracts
ourselves so we are going to be trying
to solve the problem caused by
centralized services so in today's world
a great idea isn't enough for building
businesses you need proper planning a
revised business model and most
importantly some handsome funding now
unless you're some rich guy funding is
always a problem for projects and this
is where centralized services like
Kickstarter come into the picture these
fundraising companies have some general
problem caused you to that inordinate
power they hold due to centralization
some of these problems include things
like anyone who misses out on a deadline
for the campaign cannot get in or donors
who change their mind about the project
that they've donated to can't get out
the whole process of providing a project
with a little bit of funding has been
contrived by the unnecessary rules of
Kickstarter so we're going to approach
this problem the decentralized ring the
person looking for funding will submit
the project idea on the blockchain
network for funding this project will be
issued a certain token which can be
given to anyone who wishes to donate
money to the project this token can be
sold by the nating person at a later
time if the project generates profit or
if he expects that the project will fail
he can just hold on and just move away
from his losses this way of issuing a
token gives the donating party some
control over the money which was not
prevalent in the decentralized
architecture of Kickstarter okay so
let's begin coding I'm going to develop
this contract in solidity which is its
helium's major smart contracts scripting
language will be also using the remix
browser so let's head over to the remix
browser first yeah I already have it
open but you can always visit it by
going to remix start at cerium torg
so press the plus button out here and
create a new contract so I'm gonna be
naming this contract crowdfunding
head okay and there we go so let's
remove this first yeah so you're gonna
do this to decentralized way and just
create a token to keep track of rewards
anyone who contributes gets token and
they can trade sell or keep for later
when the time comes to give the physical
reward the producer only needs to
exchange the token for real products
donors get to keep their token even if
the project doesn't achieve its goal as
a souvenir so it's gonna be like a
winner-takes-all crowdfunding contract
so we're gonna treat the contract with
minimum entry free for the project the
project will have a proposal deadline
and a campaign deadline before the
project proposal deadline people can
enter their projects providing a name a
URL and the entry fee when the project
proposal deadline is over people can
vote with etho for the project they want
to support so our contract architecture
is going to be something like this
we're going to have a minimum entry free
for a project towards farm then we are
going to have a project proposal
deadline on a campaign deadline before
the project proposal deadline people can
enter the projects providing a name the
URL and an entry fee when the project
proposal deadline is over people can
vote with etho for the projects they
want to support when the campaign
deadline is over all the pledge money
including the entry fees goes to the
project with the highest votes and the
contract is closed thereafter so let's
begin so I'm gonna name my contract
winner takes all
so this is how we define a contract it's
like defining the class statement in
other languages so we're gonna have some
state variables so let me define them
first before I go ahead and explain them
so you will minimum entry fee
you went public deadline of projects you
in public in their line campaign
you went public winning funds and public
winning funds address public
we're gonna call it winning address
so we've defined some state variables
for a contract here where we will save
the initial parameters but the project
is in the leave and how much money it
has pledged to it some of these have
public modifiers which mean that we can
access them from the outside this way we
can display the deadlines and the
current winner in our UI so so next we
are going to create a structure
structure is something similar to the
structures in C language so let me just
write my code before I explain it again
struct project so our project will have
an address
it's gonna have a name or URL the amount
of funds its generated and a flag to
know whether it's initialized or not
oh I forgot to tell y'all that we have
to specify the compiled evolution and we
do that by saying pragma solidity
anything about zero point four point one
seven
so out he'll word I'll explain would
have done solidity provides us with the
ability to create user-defined
structures called stops so while we can
only use these inside a contracts they
are still useful to organize her data in
this case we create a structure for a
proposed project so now we need to keep
track of all the state changes within
our contract to keep track of state
changes within our contract example of
use of dashing money to a project we
also create a so called mapping these
mappings are like hash maps and other
languages but have some limitations like
they're not iterable for example so
let's create our mapping first so we go
mapping address and we map it to the
project and we're going to call this
mapping projects so I mean a mistake
here is equal to
next up we will create the address array
and call it project addresses
next up we need a counter for the number
of projects so we go public number of
projects
so solidity doesn't let us expose these
mappings to the public so we also track
at least the addresses of these proposed
projects in the address array to be able
to query info about the proposed
projects from the UI another limitation
is that these arrays even if they are
public are a bit bothersome to query so
we also have this counter got a number
of projects so we know how many projects
are proposed at any time in any point
next we need to create some events so
event project submitted and this is
going to take a number of parameters
like your dress
attr and we're gonna give a string name
the URL and the boolean or feather is
initialized next we need an event in the
case projects get supported so project
supported address addr you went amount
and event paid out too
so this is all steak and a dress and
dumb aren't opening funds
so let me explain what I've done these
events are only used for debugging
purposes in our contract we can
basically use them to log onto the
blockchain which can be helpful when
testing and debugging the contract we
can also listen to these events using
web CIS this is a framework for
interacting between UI and the contracts
in this case we create an event for all
our transactions as well for all the
finishing of a contract so now that we
through with all our state variables and
events we get to our functions the
function is the constructor which is the
transaction with which the contract is
created in this case we supply the two
deadlines as well as the minimum entry
fee we want to set so let's get on doing
that so we go function winner takes all
so since this function has the same name
as our contract will be called when the
contract is created as is the
constructor function so we'll take the
human of minimum entry fee and the
youant
of the duration of projects duration
projects and the un duration campaign
this function should be public let's
begin building our logic so if the
duration of the campaign is less than or
equal to the duration of projects then
we simply throw now if minimum entry
free now we just set up so minimum entry
fee equals to minimum entry fee but
deadline projects will be equal to now
plus duration so now thus duration
projects plus so now plus duration of
projects we don't need anything
so deadlines campaign will be equals to
now the duration campaign then the
winner billing address so the winning
address will be message dot Center
and the winning funds are set to zero by
default
yeah so it seems you're doing correctly
so let me explain right now this
function is the constructor which is the
transaction with which the contract is
created in this case we supply the two
deadlines as well as the minimum entry
fee want to set as you can see
solidarity provides a nice API for
handling dates with the now keyword as
well as the possibility to add and
subtract time units from it if the
campaign deadline is before the proposal
deadline we throw which is basically
solid italy's way of throwing an error
this means that the whole transaction is
canceled at this point and all funds are
rolled back to the previous state ok so
now with our constructed contract in
place it's time to submit our first
project proposal we do this with the
submit project function so let me create
everything before I go ahead and explain
it all again so we go function submit
project string name and we gather the
string of URL so we're going to make
this function payable public I'll return
the boolean value
it's called success so go if message
sender is less than the minimum entry
fee message dot sender not send of init
of value so message or value we are
throw
next if now is greater than deadlines of
projects then also we lived through
because he's definitely crossed deadline
and if project messaged are standard
initialized
if it's not initialized we're gonna
initialize it so projects
message center equals to project message
dots under on and on you are L comma
initialize 0 comma true and you're gonna
push this to the project addresses so
yep thought push message dot sender
message now we also need to increase our
number of projects so number of projects
equals two project addresses dot glint
next we need to get the project
summiting so you gotta pass it message
sender name URL and projects
and then we'll return true
I'll see Alfred on false
so let me explain what I've done so
first of all you should notice that the
use of the payable modifier this means
that we have access to the message dot
value and the message or sender
variables which are the address of the
transaction sender and the money they
send we check of the message or values
of our specified minimum entry fee and
if it's not we throw canceling the
transaction we also throw of the
proposal deadline lies in the past then
we check if there is already a project
from the sending address with the
initialized flag unfortunately there is
no way to check whether a mapping
already includes a key or not because it
is automatically initialized with every
possible key soomi must do it this way
if the project is from a new address we
create the project and add it to the
mapping as well as our address re list
and trigger a project somewhat relevant
so now we will do something else we I'm
going to see how we can actually support
the project so we're going to build the
logic for that so now let's create a
function called support project function
support project and we give this address
attr make it payable is you can pay this
guy something in return boolean of
success so if message dot value less
than equals 0 we'll throw because who
really actually just donates nothing
that's just that just makes no sense
throws
if now it's more than the deadlines are
now is less than equal to the deadlines
of projects you can throw again because
makes no sense if you've crossed your
deadline next if the project is not
initialized we have to check that
condition to project
so if it's not initialize you don't
throw it because we need a projective
initialize to be actually funding it now
if it's passed all these tests will the
project's ad they are
dot funds plus equals to how much ever
this guy sent so message dot value next
we see that we create some events so let
me just explain what I've done a bit for
those who couldn't catch up so stolidity
doesn't let us expose these mappings to
the public so we've added the funds of
the project now we're going to check
something else
so if project addr is the address funds
are greater than the winning funds and
we just said the winner so winning VAP
so winning funds equals to project
so we've given them the funds of the
winning funds that we set up and the
winning address also has to be sense
awaiting address the equals to a TDR
next we have to call the event project
supported the project supported will
take in the address name on the name
just a message or poly okay right yeah
the message talking next we just return
true that it's successful so let me
explain what up down again now that we
have projects we can put some money to
them that is if the proposal deadline
hasn't ran out already or we are still
before the campaign deadline the
function is also payable so we again
have access to the message or value
which is the amount of money pledged to
the project we check the deadlines
whether the pledged value is a positive
number and if there is even a project
with the given address if any of this
fails we throw and cancel the
transaction if everything goes well we
increase the project's funds and update
the winning project also triggering the
project supported event for debugging so
now for our UI to be able to display the
available projects which we need to do
because it would be quite hard for use
if they can't get any infos about it or
their dresses to send the money to we
also provide a CAD project info function
so let's get on creating that so
function get project info and it will
take the address addr lb of a constant
thing is so public constant returns
string name a URL and come on funds its
collected so we're going to define a
variable called project and it's gonna
how the project they're acquiring next
if the project isn't initialized
let's roll ass we're gonna return
project dot name
okay so remember as I stated above we
counted on structure but what we can do
is return multiple values from one
function which is exactly what we've
done here we have accessed the name URL
and funds to the dot operator through
the project variable so also note is the
constant modifier which means that this
function does modify the state of the
blockchain and therefore doesn't cost
any gas now we need to finish our
project so let's go and put up the
finishing functions a function finish
if now is greater than equals to
Deadline campaign and we're gonna call
the event paid out to and we're gonna
pass in the winning address and the
winning funds next we're gonna
self-destruct so this is a premade
function that I'm gonna explain later so
self-destruct winning address and we're
done let's see function finish this
finishes the function and this finishes
the contract
so let me explain all right let's say
people proposed some projects and we
also have some people pledging money to
those projects what happens then
optimally we would automatically end the
contract once a campaign that lying is
over how this is not an easy task to do
we would have to trigger and based on
some time like a cron job now there are
solutions for this out there such as
this but in our case you have to create
a finish function which must be called
at some point after the deadline is over
by the winner for example if the
deadline is not over we just don't do
anything if it is however over we
basically just trigger an event called
Selfridge struck with the winning
address the self-destruct is a built-in
function which closes the contract and
pays all the money in it to the given
address so this ends our winner takes
all crowdfunding contract so looking at
me actually develop the smart contract
it must be pretty flustering as you all
don't know much about this language I
guess so to actually learn blockchain
and spark contract development you need
a structured learning and roadmap a data
data through our blockchain course we
give you a very structured and modular
way to learn the technology so Eddy Rica
is an e-learning company that has live
instructor led sessions at every rakah
we also have a 24/7 support team that is
there to guide you through your
technical and non-technical issues
regarding your course once you sign up
for a batchat at Eureka you get a
lifetime access to the learning
management system that has all your
documents your PDFs your projects
regarding your course and that can be
seen by you in a very structured way
following which you can also reassign
your batch if you think you're not
comfortable with the timing also if you
