welcome to the seventh video of this
Enriquez free angular course for a
business here I'm gonna talk about forms
now as you can see the roadmap I already
have covered a lot of concepts revolving
around angular we worked on components
data binding directives routing this
angular form video is the second last
video concerning the concept that we
need in order to go ahead and build a
full-fledged cloud application using
angular so let's get started with
angular forms now as you know forms are
the most crucial aspect of any web
application so if you visit any of the
web site you will encounter forms in one
way or another in general forms are used
to go ahead with functionalities such as
signup process for signing in for search
functionality for getting the feedback
or survey from people so basically forms
are the interface from which we get
majority of rich data from the users so
it is quite essential to build the form
in such a manner that there is a very
less space for an error to happen or
very less space that a user go ahead and
provides incorrect data the second thing
is about the flow of the forms you
should be very much precise about how
the values are paying entered and how
you are gonna retrieve those values and
finally store it in your database
so let's go ahead and understand whether
a different ways that angular provides
us to build upon so basically there are
two techniques are two types of forms
that angular provides the first one is
called as template driven forms and the
second one is the reactive forms now in
this video I'll be talking about
template driven forms only this is the
first part of this angular form video in
the second part that is the next video
I'm going to go ahead with reactive
forms so let's get started with template
driven forms now as the name implies or
template event forms are built by
writing templates where we bind
directive and behavior to our templates
and let angular do the rest
so we'll be relying on directives like
ng model and perhaps attributes like
required and in length etcetera on a
higher level this is what template event
forms achieve for us by specifying
directives to bind our models values
validation etc we are letting the
template to do the work under the scene
or behind the sea
so it's time to go ahead and call it out
so that you can get a better perspective
of things that I'm talking about so let
me open my editor over here and I'm
gonna spin up a lightweight server so
that I can host my application using the
ng self come on the application will be
hosted on the port 4200
so the building process has begun and
finally we are good to go - was it the
application that we have for now all
right now here we'll be building a basic
form with two or three input fields and
there will be adding some validation
rule as well we'll learn how to do all
those things for now let's go ahead and
create a component on which we'll be
working for template different forms so
I'm gonna go head fit and another
instance of my terminal and I'm going to
go ahead with ng eg confident and when I
named it as template driven
now that our component has been created
which we can check out over here as you
can see this is the folder for our
component this is the component class
and this is the template file or the
HTML file
now whenever you are going ahead with
template different form you have to
import a certain module called as forms
model so let's go ahead and do that
otherwise you will get some error
while working it on directives like ng
model and ng form so let's go ahead and
do that
forms module from our turret angular
slash forms then you need to put your
thumbs model in your imports area that's
it now we are good to go with template
different forms
now with template driven problems we can
essentially leave a component class
empty until and unless we have to read
or write values from the forms or you
have to send data that has been entered
by the user on your form to your
back-end API or to the service class
then only you have to work around your
component class otherwise all your works
will be inside your template as the name
suggests template driven forms so we
want to go ahead with our template and
here we're gonna create a form alright
so these are basic form now I'm gonna
create three inputs the first one will
be for name the second one will be for
contact and a third one will be for
email so basically what I want is I want
to create a form that will add user to
an array that I will be creating in my
content class and then we will add
validation rules to all those input
fields so as to ensure that the data
entered by user are correct or violated
so let's go ahead with a label this name
it has name
now we need an input field this will be
of type text and a name attribute which
I will be talking about later on and
we'd not need value for now similarly I
want a feel for my contact so I'm gonna
go ahead and do that so this will be for
my contact
and for my email
all right now what I'm going to do I'm
going to export or template reference
variable for our form so that we can
access all those value of form that has
been entered by the user so I'm going to
go ahead with hash frm and use something
called as ng form directive now if I go
ahead and interpolate the value of the
form and use a pipe JSON now we are not
able to see the form because we haven't
nested our component so let's go ahead
and do that as well in our app component
template let's go ahead with our app
form print template and
it's done so now as you can see we are
having a farm for now let's do one more
thing
let's put it inside a container f-class
container and then let's use a Jumbotron
Ashford
I'm doing these just to make our form
good-looking it has nothing to do with
ten ten different forms so far now we
are having it so far good we need to add
a button as well so let's go ahead and
do that as well so I'm going to go ahead
with a button which will be of type
submit' and the name of button will be
add user now let's add some CSS class
button button success
similarly I'm gonna add CSS class to all
my controls or all my input fields I'm
gonna go ahead firt form group and then
for control
alright then so you can see we are
having our forum over here which is
looking good for now now the thing that
I was discussing was the template
difference variable that we have just
added as a forum and we have used RNG
for my activism that we can access the
values that has been entered by the user
on our forum now if you notice over here
you can see that we are receiving an
object as a JSON which is empty for now
even if I enter any values we are not
able to retrieve those values or access
those fellows this is happening because
there is no model that has been assigned
to values for our forum for that we're
going to go ahead and use a directive
called as ng model so I'm going to go
ahead with ng model
now this next error that we are getting
is name attribute so that is the mandate
part for using ng model you have to go
ahead and assign name attribute we have
to do that because ng models will look
for a name attribute and assign that
value as a new object key for the global
ng form object that we have just created
that is frm to which we are referring to
using so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go ahead and add our name
attribute as name then contact then
email alright
so now as you can see the JSON object
that we are having with respect to the
forum values we are having three keys
over here as name contact that we have
assigned in our name attribute so in a
nutshell
ng-model talks the forum and points the
forum value based on the name attributes
value in this case we have assigned our
name attributes as name contact and
email with respect to all these three
fields now if you enter any value over
here you can see we are able to access
the value so that's how it works up so
we'll be using this will passing these
values to our a component class and
there will be adding user to a list
which will be displaying later
now that our basic template has been
created for our form the next thing that
we want to do is we need to add a
functionality submit functionality so
whenever a person submits the form we
need to access those values and finally
add it to an array which will be
displaying later on as discussed earlier
so what I want is I want to catch an
event called as and he submit so
whenever a person submits the form this
event will take place and finally I'm
going to bind it with a method that I'm
gonna define in my component class and
there I'm gonna pass my template
variable so that we can have the access
of the value that has been entered by
that particular person now let me add
this function to my content class so I'm
gonna go ahead for that ID user a method
which will pass a template variable and
let's console it out for now
all right now let's see whether it works
or not
so we are able to retrieve the value
from our forms now the next part is we
need to create a model for our user
object that the object that we're
receiving from our form so let's go
ahead and do that so I'm going to go
ahead and create a model or an interface
to be precise it's use it of tears
export interface user will have three
fields one will be string other one will
be contact which will again be a string
and the last one will be email
I'm doing this because I want an array
of this type user where I'll be feeding
all my user that will be submitted from
my form so I'm going to go head to my
component class again and then I'm going
to import that interface
and it will be in my user class
now let's go ahead and create an a user
list which will be a pipe user for now
it will be an empty list all right now
the next part that we want to do is we
need to add validation rules some of the
validation rules in all our field so one
of the validation rule can be we found
the user to fill all these three field
and until unless he has not entered the
values in all these three field he will
not be able to submit the form so let's
go ahead and add a disabled attribute to
our button so I'm gonna go head to the
disabled property over her disabled
equals to form dot invalid so whenever
the form is invalid at that time it will
it return a true and finally the button
will get disabled now too so as to make
the field required we're gonna go ahead
with required attribute and same viana
go head with our contact and then
similarly we gonna go the head with our
email all right so now as you can see
the button has been disabled until
unless you have entered the values in
all these three fields so if I go ahead
v ashish Bakshi and then contact number
and then until unless that I have
entered the values in all these three
fields button will be disabled so
everything is working good for now now
let's add some more validation rule so
one thing that we're going to go ahead
is we're gonna add a pattern attribute
what it will do it will check for the
pattern that we are expecting for the
data that has to be entered in that
particular field for example for a name
we expect characters a name cannot have
any digit inside it that cannot contain
a digit inside it so we're going to go
ahead with a pattern so I'm gonna go
head fit part basically I have already
got my reg ex or regular expression for
all these
so this one is for the name you can
google it out whenever you are working
on such demos you will get plenty of
regular expression for all such common
functionalities or fields otherwise you
can go ahead and check out how regular
expressions are written and finally add
it to your pattern attribute alright so
basically what it is doing it is
checking for the two things the first
one is your name cannot be of a single
character it should be more than a
single character and the second thing it
should be a character same thing we're
gonna go ahead with our number which
should be of comprised of digits the
numbers contact number so I'm going to
go ahead and do that as well and
similarly the same thing will be for my
email so this is the pattern or the
regular expression that I have got here
all right so let's go ahead and check
out whether it is working or not see if
I add three and a and an incorrect email
ids let's say show at the rate one two
three you can see the button is still
disabled even we have entered the value
in all these three fields and if we make
it
still it is disabled so you have to
match the pattern that we have specified
in our a template all these three
feelings should match that particular
pattern then only that pattern will be
in ever now the next thing that we need
is we need to display an alert message
regarding the error that the person is
doing while entering the values in each
of these fields so for example if he is
entering digits in the name field then
there should be an error message stating
that the name that you are entering is
invalid so let's go ahead and do that as
well so I'm going to go ahead and use a
DEP tag and it will be of an alert alert
danger I am gonna use ng-if directive
that we have discussed in the directive
video which allows us to add or remove a
particular element from our comm based
on certain conditions here the
conditions will be whether the pattern
has been matched whether the person has
entered the data in that required field
so we want to use all those attributes
over here now so as to refer to all
these controls or input fields I'm going
to go ahead and export a variable with
respect to each of this field based on
ng model so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go ahead and add a template
variable let's say it as name of user
all right and we will be doing this
using ng model because ng model is what
that allows us to access the values so
therefore I'm going to work with name
user and then I'm gonna use this name
user over here user dot errors and I'm
gonna use something called a safe
navigation operator this question mark
that you are seeing over here since at
the first time the value won't be
entered so you will get an error that
referring to a null value cannot read
property of null or undefined so you're
going to go ahead and use the safe
navigation operator so as to bypass that
error now the attribute that we are
interested in for now is required so I'm
going to go ahead with required and I
want the message as name is required
now let's go ahead and check out whether
it is working or not so as you can see
the alert message is being displayed
over here and as soon as I enter the
value that alert message is being
removed from my door now the thing is
that I don't want this alert messages to
be displayed like beforehand when a
person visit the forum it should happen
run time whenever a person is clicking
on that particular field and then
leaving that field vacant intentionally
then only it should produce that
particular alert message so I'm going to
go ahead and use something called as
touched over here so let's go ahead and
do that so I'm going to touched and then
if the person has does that feel or has
clicked on that field and then clicked
on anywhere else it will check whether
the validation that we have added has
been satisfied or not so I'm going to
again go ahead with an ngf and here I'm
going to check his name user dot F dot
question mark dot required
for using touch you have to use your
tablet variable only along with a dot
and then followed by a touched now here
what I'm going to show I'm going to show
name is required all right so let's go
now we are not seeing any alert messages
now whenever I click on this particular
field and then keep anywhere else I can
see that adult message is being shown
here that means that the person has
intentionally left that field vacant
which we do not want so let's go ahead
and add these to all places
so here we'll be having contact is
required and similarly will be adding a
variable so I'm going to go ahead with
contact user equals to ng model
contact then contact now let's go ahead
and do that over her as well for our
email field again when acquired with a
variable this will be email user ng
model
email user and eBay user
alright
now email is required so for now we are
getting an error property test of
undefined because we haven't passed any
value over here so let's go ahead and to
add this safe navigation operator
so as you can see the air has been
banished now if I click on that
particular field and then click anywhere
else this thing is not working let's go
ahead and check out what this issue you
are having this contact user over here
and there's a type over her and
similarly let's go ahead with email as
well so everything's fine now I guess
so now that we have this alert messages
being displayed for now now also we want
different alert messages for different
type of problems or different type of
validation that we have added for
example if the person has provided an
incorrect or invalid name then the alert
message should be that the name is
invalid so let's go ahead and do that as
well so I'm going to go ahead and copy
this div tag and let's say errors and
then party
if the patent has not matched then it
will return a true and then will say
contact and voila
alright similarly we gonna go ahead and
do the same everywhere else
so here it will be named user
and it will display name is invalid or
we can say invalid name and shorter all
right
similarly contact
invalid contact let's go ahead and do
the same with our email
and let's make it a Spartan
alright now let's see whether it is
working or not so if I do too
and then click over here you can see we
are getting messages invalid name
similarly if I do this I put an a over
here in the contact a character it will
show us and univer it contact and then
if I go ahead and to something else show
1 2 3 then it will display a message
called as in that email similarly you
can go ahead and add more validation for
example if I am expecting the user to go
ahead with the mobile number 3 so I'm
gonna go ahead with my contact and then
ya squared and put it over so now you
can't enter more than ten digit over
here so I'm going to go ahead with five
six seven eight nine zero and no more
digits are allowed similarly what you
can do you can go at Whitman length as
well if you want the length to be
precisely ten so I am going to go ahead
with an other attribute called Earth men
length
you're entering the number which is not
matching our pattern or it is of less
rigid stand that is expected you will
have the same error that will be invalid
contact so I'm going to go ahead and use
and and I'm going to go ahead with
contact user dot earth now I'm going to
go ahead for it then let alright
so now if I go ahead and provide triple
three so I'm not getting the message
okay let's do one thing all right so
what is happening over here that I have
used and I should go ahead with or
because either of these should be set to
true then only our invalid contact will
be displayed my bad so I'm going to go
ahead and do that so now you can see we
are getting an invalid contact number
all even if we have inter digit in the
contact field but the thing is the
length of the number the number of
digits that is expected for a mobile
number is not been fulfilled so that's
it now instead of ng if you can also go
ahead with with properties like hidden
so what I can do is I can go ahead with
headin over here and also with what we
can do we can use this variable that we
have over here that contact user and
using that we can use a method called as
hazard where will you pass the
validation that we have added and it
will check whether that has been
satisfied or not so what I'm trying to
say is let me show you a demo so we can
go ahead with contact user thought has
error and there we can pass min length
all right
conduct user dot has in her method it
will return a true value whenever the
person that is entering the value and
the contact field is not satisfying this
manland criteria it will return as a
true value and that true value will hide
the carton because it will set the
hidden property as true so what I want
is I wanted to set it as false and also
I wanna go ahead and use this safe
navigation operator so let's go ahead
and check it out so I'm gonna go ahead
and put two digits over here and if I
click over here you can see we are
getting the same alert message again now
let's go ahead and do one more thing
let's add this value whatever value that
has been entered by the user to our user
list array so I'm going to go ahead and
do that so let's create a variable or an
object of type user all right then what
I want is
want to push this object in my user list
so this thought user list thought push
and it will take the user bad now we
haven't received the value from our form
so I'm going to go ahead and do user
equal to four dot value now then this
form value will be pushed to our list
now let's go ahead and display the list
as well so I'm going to go it with my
template so I'm gonna go ahead with an
unordered list and I'll like that I'm
gonna add a CSS class and that will be
list group and here it will be list
group item and here I'm gonna go ahead
with my ng4 directive so there I'm gonna
iterate over my less that we have just
created which will be user list
alright goes to now here what we want is
we want to go ahead and interpolate the
name the user let's again go ahead with
the safe navigation operator eyes so
this the contact and then now as you can
see the value are being added let's go
ahead bit Josh then again some other
number and George at the rate at Eureka
dot cool now as you can see that George
has been added as well so that's it guys
this was all about the form that we have
for today this is how you go ahead with
the template different forms so what you
need to do you need to go ahead and use
all the directives you have to create
the form the template itself then
finally your template event forms is
powered by directive so you have to use
two major directives over here the first
one is Energy Forum second one is energy
model then you need for validation you
can go it with properties like required
pattern min length max length and then
using ng F or hidden or whatever you
want you can go ahead and paste on the
condition whether the validation rule
has been followed by the user or not you
can go ahead and display an alert
message so that's all about the content
event formulas now in the next video I'm
going to go ahead and talk about my
reactive forms there will be learn how
reactive forms
differs from our template event forms
how we can go ahead and use reactive
forms in quite detail so guys I hope the
session was quite helpful for you it was
informative for you in case of any query
or any doubts you can go ahead and put
your queries in the comment section
below so see you in the next video till
then have fun bye
