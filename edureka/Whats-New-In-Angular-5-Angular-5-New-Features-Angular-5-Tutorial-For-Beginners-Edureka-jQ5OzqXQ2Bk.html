today I'll be talking about the changes
and new features of angular 5 now the
main focus behind the changes in angular
5 is to make the very framework smaller
by reducing the bundle size faster that
is bringing more responsiveness and
easier that is including new features
for a developer to work on now most of
these changes has happened under the
hood and you'll notice much of a
difference if you go ahead with the
angular 5 as of now but there are some
changes which you can leverage in your
current code base with an angle files so
as to improve your code performance so
guys let's go ahead and have a look at
all those changes so we'll start with
processor web application support as you
know Google has been working on rows
above a application for quite a long
time the idea of PWA is very much insane
and I believe will put a huge impact on
the way things work around in a wearable
of an industry basically a progressive
web application is a web application
that can be installed on your system
it works offline when you don't have an
internet connection leveraging the data
cache during your last interactions with
the application angular has a package
call as at the rate angular slash
serviceworker which was in a different
repository until angular 5 where the
angular team put it to the main
repository now in case you are not
familiar with the service workers you
can think of them as small proxies in
your browser once you activate them it
lets you to cache a static asset and
therefore you don't need to fetch those
data on every detour
next in our list is build optimization
update the bill optimizer is a tool
which is included in your angular CLI
that makes your bundle smaller using the
semantic understanding of your angular
application basically what it does is it
gives those parts of your application
which are needed and marks pose as pure
this improves the pre checking process
that let you remove the additional or
extra part of the application from the
build the second thing the build
optimizer does is to remove the angular
decorator from your applications runtime
code decorators are used by compiler and
aren't required at the runtime therefore
it is a good move to remove them from
your runtime code finally all of these
things let you release the size of your
JavaScript bundles and therefore it lets
you to boot up your app
occation faster now let us talk about
typescript guys Android 5 supports the
new typescript version 2.4 because of
this now you can take advantage of all
the new typescript features in your
angular code base the 2 main feature
that comes along with the typescript 2.4
are string based enemies and weak tie
protection let's understand what are
these basically typescript 2.4 now
allows ennum members to contain string
initializers for example I have an
Impala and I have three member called as
red green and blue which has been
initialized by the string value as you
can see now let's talk about the feature
call as weak tie protection before that
let's understand what is a weak type any
type that contains nothing but a set of
all optional properties is considered to
be weak for example I'm having an
interface over here that have all the
optional properties colored font and
size so with typescript 2.4 you can't
assign an object to a V type when there
is no overlap in the properties of the
tool that is I'm having a function
called a send message which accepts an
argument of type options with respect to
these properties and then I have an
object called as aux having two
properties as background and font size
so it will throw me an error when I go
ahead and call that send message
function passing this object because
there is no overlap between the
properties of the two so this was all
about typescript guys let's go ahead and
understand the significant improvement
that has happened in terms of compiler
now angular works in two ways when it
comes to compiling your typescript or
angular code that is just-in-time
compilation and ahead of time
compilation in just-in-time compilation
the templates are compiled in the
browser at runtime whereas in case of
ahead-of-time compilation the templates
are compiled at Build time now if you
think about ahead of time compilation it
has lots of advantage because it let
your browser to download the pre
compiled version of your application
therefore the browser can render the
application immediately without waiting
the compilation of the application to be
finished but the problem was this
compiler was a bit slow
before angular 5 and as a result most of
us were going ahead with just-in-time
Mode compilation in development we only
used ahead of time compiler when we have
to push the course through the
production
now the reason behind this low
compliation was that for every template
change it triggered a full compilation
of the application now an angle five
things have been improved in fact the
compiler has been transformed using this
script transform feature that was
introduced in typescript 2.3 so let us
understand what is the change that has
happened in the compiler with respect to
the previous version in the current
version so earlier what was happening
was that your angular compiler was a
separate program which prepared your
script to be compiled by the typescript
so basically your angular compiler was
working as a transformer that transforms
your code so as to make it ready for
your typescript compiler to go ahead and
compile it now what is happening is your
angular compiler is a plug-in to the
typescript compiler this means that a
separate bill step that was happening
earlier for the angular compiler is no
longer needed so if you go ahead with
the incremental rebuild what happens now
is your angular compiler is now able to
compile only those parts that is
necessary the hence you get the
significant reduction of the build time
in fact I would suggest you guys to
check out this on your own using the
flag - - a beauty in your NG serve
command it has not been turned on by
default in your engine or command but
whenever you go ahead with the NG build
command it will be compiled using a UT
only according to an official statement
from the angular team when they were
performing an incremental äôt build of
angular dot IO website that is the
official website the GNU Compiler
pipelines save 90% of their bill time so
that is the build time from 40 seconds
went down to two seconds on their
development machines so that is the huge
improvement guys but there are still
some problems with large number of
components if you go ahead with a ot so
they are working on that and I guess in
future releases UT will be turned on by
default and we can go ahead and make use
of it now let's talk about white spaces
guys now earlier all the tabs new lines
and spaces in the templates were
recreated for you and then included in
the bill by the compiler but things have
changed in angular file you can now
choose whether to preserve white spaces
or not again this will help you reduce
the bill side of your bundles for
choosing whether to preserve white
spaces or not there are two ways either
you can go ahead and specify that in
your
for a decorator using the preserved
white spaces property or you can go
ahead with the application wide
specification in your typescript
configuration that is the file PS config
dot app dot JSON file and there also you
can specify whether to preserve white
spaces or not but remember in general
the component level specifications
overwrite application whitespace figure
right now this property has been set to
true by default but in future that team
might set the very preserved whitespace
feature to false by default now there
has been some changes in router as well
some additional events are added to the
router lifecycle this events are
activation start and activation end or
child activation start and child
activation it so this makes easier for a
developer to track the router light
cycle and for example what one can do is
one can display a spinner while some
children components are being loaded as
shown in the code over here also with
the new router it's now possible to
reload the page when the router receives
a request to navigate to the same URL
earlier a lot of people were complaining
about this feature and it was quite
impossible to build a refresh button
which we can do with angular 5 now there
is some news with HTTP module as well
guys the old adroit angler HTTP module
is now officially deprecated with the
new HTTP client module this hdbut line
model was shipped in version 4.3 in the
angular slash common package now for
using the new HTTP client you will need
to import HTTP client module from your
at the rate angular / comment / HTTP
package now in case you are trying to
replace HTTP model with the newer HTTP
client module in your current code base
you need to remove the map press rest or
chase and calls because jason has been
assumed as a default in angular 5 and
therefore it is not necessary to parse
it explicitly angular if I have now
supports rxjs 5 point 5 point 2 or later
versions this has change the way we used
to import rxjs operators earlier we have
to write separate import statements for
each operator now we can go ahead and
use the
es6 D structuring and import the
operators as shown in the example over
here for example I can go ahead with
input map filter from rxjs / operator
this has improved the tree shading
process again so as to reduce your
bundle size basically to remove all
those coals that is not necessary in
your runtime code and your team has
introduced the new number date and
currency pipes that increase
standardization across browsers
earlier what was happening one needs to
rely on the browser to provide number
date and currency formatting using i18
polyfills or i eighteen api's so because
of the inconsistencies between different
browser it led to different bugs all of
this has been fixed now in angular 5
with the new pipes which do not rely on
I 18 polyfills anymore now if you don't
do anything when you upgrade to angular
5 you will use the new pipes by default
in case you want to go ahead with the
previous implementation you can do that
by importing the deprecated I 18 pipes
module which is there in add the red
angular slash common package well there
has been some changes in form as well
basically what was happening earlier was
that validation was performed for every
value changes in your form control this
significantly impacts performances in
those cases where you have complex
validations now you have the power to
specify when validation should happen
using the update on option now in case
of reactive forms you can go ahead and
specify the update on property in your
form control or you can go ahead with
the form group as well so as to specify
a group white specification now there
are three states on which the validation
can happen the one is called as blur the
other one is change or submit in case of
blur the validation will happen when the
user has left the input field and have
clicked on somewhere else in case of
change which is turned on by default it
activates validation on every change in
case if you want the validation to
happen once the user click on submit
button or tries to submit the form you
can go ahead with the submit option as
well similarly in case of template
different forms you can go ahead and use
the directive ng form options so there
also you have got this update on
property again you can set it to submit
in case you want the validation to
happen when a person submits a form or
you can go ahead with blur as well you
can either go ahead with the control
white specification or you can go ahead
with the form
white specification as shown in the
example over here so it's up to you guys
now there's one more thing that I forgot
to tell that
additionally now you can specify the s
ink valuators directly in the option
object instead of specifying it as a
third parameter so as you can see in the
example here in the options object what
I have done I have used update on and I
can go ahead with asking values over
here as you can see now there has been
some other changes as well for example
they have introduced export as using
which you can export component and
active with different different names or
alias also zones have been made a faster
by default zones are nothing but
execution context so that allows change
adduction for your angular application
now it is possible to bypass the zones
for better performance in case you are
don't want to change direction to happen
so as to increase the performance for
that what you can do is you can
bootstrap your application with the
option call as ng zone and you can set
it to noobs so as to bypass the zones so
as finally we have understood what are
the changes that has happened in angular
5 angular team is quite agile and they
are going ahead with the new releases in
every six month a lot of things are
being changed in case now you're
wondering how to operate your
application to angular 5 they have built
a angar update guide which you can check
out that is HTTP angular update guide
firebase.com so let's go ahead and check
out this website
so what you have to do over here you
have to specify what is your current
codebase the version that you are using
for example if I am using 4.3 and I want
to upgrade to 5.0 now you have to click
on show me how to update and it will
list you all those changes that has
happened that you have to do in your
current code base so that is very useful
guys so you can go ahead and have a look
at this as well finally guys I hope that
you had a good time over here you
understood whatever changes that has
happened in angular 5 so see you in the
next video guys till then have fun bye
