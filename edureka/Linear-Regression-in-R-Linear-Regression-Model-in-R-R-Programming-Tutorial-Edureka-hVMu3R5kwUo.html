about myself
Ashok and have about 20 plus years
experience in information technology
last three and half years in big data
and related technologies analytics data
science and later davyous I've done I've
done three four projects in here in the
big data space and I also do product
consulting besides being an educator so
today's topic is linear regression in R
and I'm really looking forward to spend
the next hour or so with all of you so
I'm absolutely excited I think there's a
lot of lots and lots of participants
today I'm I'm I'm seriously excited
France yeah okay so let's take a small
look you know I'll French the way I want
to structure this session today's you
know we will see because we have one
hour right so the first hour the first
30 minutes I would say let's look into
linear regression a little bit you know
let's see how we can relate to the
actual real life you know coming to the
linear regression and the last 30
minutes you know I would like to
probably show you a small you know a
demo right so that's the structure so
are you all fine with this
okay so how many people are familiar
with regression prints linear regression
and all that how many people are
familiar quite a few of you are actually
familiar okay little bit here there I am
me good basic okay awesome you know it's
just curious to know that's all you know
I'm not going to ask anything other than
that but you know it's good to know that
you know people are catching up with
this so I'll let me actually begin with
you know let's go a few slides in deck
then you know I will come back to my you
know I will take you through a
whiteboard and you know we'll get onto
examples right so that's the intention
here
so what can you learn today what is
linear regression and how to design a
regression model how to compare
regression models hands-on part right so
let's see you know I have about 31
slides so I may not you know spend time
in every slide so I'll try to make you
know the best possible use of our 60
minutes here right so we are trying to
give you a generalized introduction here
suppose you are the owner of the
restaurant and you know where apes are
part of a waiters pay so the amount you
know if you as you can read from this it
depends on the total bill right so in in
different places you know there are
certain places like you know they they
say 15 percent is mandatory right in
especially in the US and all that right
so tipping is liquor and in Europe so
some places it is optional some you know
it is but in many places you know it
becomes it has become a practice right
so we can predict the amount of tip from
using regression this is where we are
coming to okay let me just so predicting
the tip if you're actually looking at
the line you don't have the data for the
amount of the bill but you only have the
tip amount and you have different meal
options people have taken right one two
three four five six and all that so all
you have is the tip amount now you want
to know hey you are trying to predict
the tip correct so this is what you are
trying to have so let's say first meal
order it's like you know this is the
dollar five and dollar 17 and things
like that and so on so forth
and if you see visualize the data they
are just plotting it meal in the x-axis
and tip in the y-axis in dollars right
if you look at it if it is just plotted
right so woah what does this indicate
friends can you all tell me what is this
plotting scatter exactly yeah
this is just plotted in a very scattered
fashion right it's a it's a kind of
scatter plot right so let's go a little
further so this is what I have but can
you make out anything by by looking at
this you know so what is that how can
you predict the tip right so if you look
at this how can I predict the tip amount
correct so this is what we are coming to
so based on whatever we have we are
trying to find the mean of the tip
amount right mean is nothing but you
know I need to find an average correct I
am trying to find an average so if I
find an average it comes to like you
know approximately 10 correct not
approximately exactly 10 if you look at
it right you know 22 33 41 55 60 divided
by 6 is 10 that's exactly what we are
getting correct so if I draw a line so
all the plots right you can relate to
this this centered line which is theme
which is calculated out of mean now I
can make some sense out of it right so
let's go a little further to understand
what is what the best estimate best
estimate is kind of you know dollar ten
because mean of the tip amounts note
that you have only one variable no other
information the best prediction that can
be is the mean is it can be the mean
itself correct when you have only one
variable but ideally in regression I
mean here we are come to the conclusion
of this typica problem but in ideal
regression right you may have one
dependent variable and there will be
multiple independent variables right
multiple independent variables will come
to that correct we'll come to the
shortly so you know it's just an
extension to whatever we spoke right so
we have things like no residuals
residuals is like you know it's the
deviation between actual and estimated
value right so for the sixth one right
if it is 10 whereas the amount was 5 so
it was minus 5 it is plus
for you know we are just plotting it
based on the the intercept value
whatever we got right the mean value so
we are trying to plot I mean we are
trying to find the deviation here right
we are trying to find the deviation here
this is this is again a illustration
then the sum of the residuals you know
by all these things right if you make it
it becomes zero so if you add up all the
positive and negative deviation you
should get zero correct because 10 is
the mean here so in other words amount
of positive and negative deviation is
always the same okay because the amount
of positive and negative deviation
correct so it will be the same tunnel
and well here right whatever is the
deviation once you have plotted it
correct so now for us to get a
pronounced you know sometimes the
deviation is so less and and also it
will come in negative and all right
what we do is we typically do the
summing negative values Jaya the point
is see okay there is a question here see
here 10 right if you look at it the
first one the first one right I am
making minus 5 because the average is 10
right so the first one the value is only
5 so I am getting minus 5
Jay are you clear now yeah similarly so
this is you're getting plus for beer
because you are getting 14 correct
so that's how we are getting so sum of
squared errors you know you should get
120 and how do we why do we what do we
need to get from squaring the residuals
the goal is to create a linear model
which minimizes the sum of errors
correct so that the deviation is more
emphasized and making more obvious and
it's helps in comparing different
analysis models no Hardeep is asking sum
of square of residuals so this is what
minus 5 it becomes 25 it Hardeep say a
sum everything it becomes 120 if I add
up all the squares of the residuals
right it becomes 120 so this is if you
look at it right
this is 74 75 79 95 120 sure this is how
we are getting adding all the residuals
exactly yeah so yeah and if you look at
it improving the current model so I'll
just go just give me a minute friends
I'll just see how much we can have okay
before yeah only 2 slides so I will come
back to that same part so the tip of the
waiter depends on the amount of the bill
we all know that you know that's the
actual model till now we were just using
the previous tips to estimate the value
of next step correct so we will design a
regression model which will estimate the
amount of the tip depending on the
filling a motor correct so this is what
we are trying to say so this is the
billing amount
what is the tip so this is the
respective amount so the tip of the that
tipping emot-- actually goes up directly
proportional to the bill bill amount
right so this is what you are saying so
we are trying to do a linear model here
visualize the data again you know we
have plotted it this is a bill about
this is a tip about
correct so the same x-axis right we have
put the Billa moon and here is TT p'mote
okay now before I jump into all this
math and everything right friends let me
demystify because friends am i audible
in the first place some al qussair Abell
am i audible ok ah ok thanks others can
hear me out
clearly let me say that how is 34 and
the last one tip of rupees 5 just a
second uh narsimha's asking last two
lines
no no I'll come what I'm saying is here
we are again
plotting t see earlier we put one two
three four five and we plotted the tip
amount here we are plotting the actual
bill amount and we are trying to come up
with a linear regression model right and
how we can predict the tip amount in in
previously what I told you was to use
the tip amount to predict the tip amount
so we took the average because there is
no other independent variable there
right we took a mean now we have the
bill amount so we can use P I mean we we
are trying to plot it so that you know
there is a dependency here so the bill
about any fluctuation in the bill amount
it leads to a you know the tip value
keeps changing right so we are trying to
plot this and develop a model this is
what we are trying to do yeah this is
what we are trying to do so let me not
get into this friends for now so what I
will do just a second just give me one
second there is one other question which
I didn't Hanser how is 34 and the last
one if of narsimha did I answer your
question or not yet okay okay you got it
now see what did I answer your question
okay I didn't hear from him not really
okay just a minute friends before I
switch back to the whiteboard to
actually take you through the linear
regression right so that I'll make it
simplified you know I don't want to talk
too much of math because some of you are
not familiar so I just thought I'll take
you through a basic one how is 34 and
the last one tip off okay okay okay
narsimha says that that's correct
see he says 34 is 5 180 17 everything is
you know it is all going up but this is
like you know how is 51 51 should be
actually the tip amount should be little
higher right instead of so that's what
he is that your question narsimha
yes so it is possible 'nor ship
narsimha it is possible to have these
kind of values as well see it is like
you know we always use a regression
model to do prediction right so the
prediction can have you know here and
there sometimes the values right it can
be here in there although it is directly
proportional or on walls but yet
sometimes you know it also happens in
this way and sometimes you may even get
a skewed or outliers and you know those
kind of data as well it's possible but
by and large we see a pattern right of
course this is a little skewed data but
by and large we see a pattern in all
these things
correct correct
yeah sure percentage it's not like yeah
it is it's not exactly percentage Rupali
I mean we will see how we can model this
right so I tell you you know I'll begin
with a small example so that you know
you all feel comfortable this is where I
am coming to so let me take a simple
notepad right let me use a simple
notepad and I'll ask you so before I you
know
before I ask you something I want to
just real time depends on person - yeah
jeevan says in real time it depends on
person-to-person somebody use a frugal
guy you know may not even tip or
somebody who is like a very very
generous they may tip even you know a
lot of you know a lot of money as well
yeah the people who are taking corporate
lunches dinners and they all generously
tip because they always think they can
claim it back from the company so that
is another part of the story okay so uh
thanks I want to tell you something you
know because I want you to know the
regression right so one thing is you
know we have it in the slide it's to me
you know it is very mathematical you
know this one see once I go here right I
think you'll I feel that you may get
lost here you may get lost here so I'll
tell you in a very simple way or are you
working with the simplified approach is
that or you'll find with this approach
also awesome thanks because I want you
to understand what is linear regression
in the first place right so I don't want
to just keep going with all the math and
all that so first you know suppose you
are a or Thanks suppose you are a
testing manager right I want to begin
with a very very simple example you are
testing manager correct you are a
testing manager for a manufacturing
company or any kind of company that
produces let's say some accessories for
ipad right so you're producing that so
the acceptable rate is about five
percent let's say okay acceptable defect
rate right you all know this right
defect rate you know that is a kind of
tolerance you can have so in other words
if there are 100 devices you're
producing 100 accessories right of same
accessories right hundred accessories
for that device okay Phi can be
defective so that's the which is kind of
okay according to because you are saying
that
septal defect rate is 5% so the how
are you getting this is it's actually
from the historical data so if you want
to verify this manually because you know
you are going by the historical pattern
right if you verify this manually you
find it only four point seven percent
instead of you know on one month data
right you are taking one month data and
random you're verifying you're finding
it only four point seven percent okay so
what is the kind of inference you can
come up with am i are you getting what I
am asking friends I'm just leading you
to a couple of terms right which I want
you to know sure okay before that I want
to say Amit is saying how come how did
you come up with Bill and tip
differences there may be some other
possible dependency that may change the
significant absolutely correct Amit just
for this example right we are saying
bill amount and tip if there are other
parameters it will definitely influence
the significance of the model you're
perfectly right about that right so
friends what I'm saying is what I'm
saying is you know what we see there are
two inferences you can come up with you
can say 4.7% is the correct one right
well you know which is so there is
something called null hypothesis and
there is something called alternate
hypothesis so I just want to spend like
a couple of minutes on this because you
know you will be using this more and
more in the regression and all that
because that is how you talk the
business language right okay now my
point is like you know in null
hypothesis the sample data as well as
the population population is the
historical data okay or the same and
they are not different this is what we
are saying in alternate hypothesis we
say both are not the same so
we have something called you know
p-value right that is a probability
right so we just say if it is you know
if the experimental value of P is less
than Y what we saw that right that the
intercept then we can reject the null
hypothesis so this means the sample and
the population are not the same right
that's what we are trying to say other
way other ways you can reject the null
hypothesis and say that okay so you know
just to give you a more practical
example suppose you are developing a
medicine for a life-threatening disease
right let's say that you are developing
something what will be the confidence
level friends just want to be what what
should be the ideal confidence level
here can someone tell me here Oh money
brilliant even yeah no no no confidence
level what should be the confidence
level okay
people are saying 100 percent hundred
percent I I like that too but you know
95 is very less right life-threatening
disease if you say 5050 right nobody
will even touch that right 99 and a bow
okay 99 and a bow is probably the
probably you know it should be the high
end of 99 right because you are talking
playing with the life okay so Hadoop
says null hypothesis know how the simple
thing I want you to remember because I
don't want to deviate away from what we
are doing in this session what I'm
saying is the confidence you know the
the null hypothesis is we are saying the
experimental value and the historical
which is the population or the same okay
if you reject the null hypothesis that
means it is alternate hypothesis right
so that is the sample and population are
not the same
that is the nutshell yeah so what is the
optimal value you all said you know 99%
or more right so point zero five is
acceptable deviant uses awesome
so anything that involves life of the
people that love a very very high I mean
very less margin for error
so it should be even like 99.99 I would
say right so that's the kind of thing we
are talking about right so in other case
so like customer retention let's say in
other cases like customer retention
improving Net Promoter Score for a
company so it may be even 90 percent or
93 93 percent and so on and so forth
right because that's not a very critical
thing so it depends on the criticality
and demand of a business so if you need
very very high confidence so the
experimental p-value will be higher than
the cutoff value right so we can say if
if it is like 95% confidence level
population and the sample or different
side 99% they may be the same correct so
let's go with some example ya rabb
kibarim precisely coming there so I I
want you to you know because we will be
interpreting using those terminologies
right so I just thought I will touch
upon that suppose you know I want to
give a very simple example you are all
working for a real estate company right
you are working you want to predict the
price of an apartment in a particular
area correct so that's my example sure
now you have collected you have
collected the historical data correct so
the point is you are working for a real
estate company you want to predict the
price of an apartment in a particular
area correct you have collected
historical data the data pertains to the
price of the apartment with lots of
different apartment and you want to
estimate what is the price in that area
correct okay so what can be the
parameters by which you can determine
the price of the apartment fronts can
you help me with this
let me put land price you can help me
with some of the parameters ok land
price guru Palace Museum circle rate
what is
nitesh population density construction
cost locality I think you all have
labour price labour cost
okay solid the experience here a lot of
people okay
commercial commercial value okay it's
kind of land price right that's kind of
square footage okay how about the value
of land yeah it's all the what about the
this friends crime rate proximity to
work offices that's right
locality right somebody else also
mentioned that amenities I take that to
proximity to hospitals that is a
locality for me and amenities distance
from yeah mister day I would put the
distance from you know landmarks right
hospitals and all those things here
that's a commute correct future planned
development plan and all that so there
can be actually number of parameters
right there can be number of parameters
here so what I can put government loss
okay I can simply put price of an
apartment right I can put a plus B B
into let me come two things here just
wait for a minute see into crime rate
plus D into locality I'll just take yeah
that's it let's say okay this is what I
have right okay G 1 says builder also
okay yeah I take all these inputs you
know I just put few of them whatever you
guys mature right labor costs okay now
there is a this is a very very simple
linear regression equation right so we
can make an assumption okay let's say
you know just for this right let's say
that you know I want to just take you
know these two things right just
get easier for us right so let me say I
just take only this because I know there
are so many other things as you rightly
pointed out so many other things are
also you know there is a dependency but
you know let's take this is my price of
the apartment and this is my regression
equation just for this this example sick
correct so I'm taking a plus B into land
price plus C into crime rate correct
this is my regression equation now we
all need to have the values for a B and
C okay do you all agree with me we need
to have the values for ABC to predict
the price of the apartment correctly so
that's the next question so what is ABC
here right so the price of the apartment
here is the dependent variable right it
depends on all these things correct of
course it depends on land price and it
depends on crime rate correct so you may
be wondering hey what is a what is B
here B is some kind of coefficient you
know you'll come to that right it's it's
a kind of coefficient right into the
land price a coefficient into the crime
rate so okay now what is a so what I'm
trying to say is land price and crime
rate or independent variables right
these two are independent variables B
and C your coefficients price of the
apartment is a dependent variable okay
now you are pretty clear correct now
what is a here any guesses friends
what is a he is a constant okay though
he says excellent base value exactly
right so no matter what whatever is the
crime rate whatever is this rate no
matter what this is the base value
correct this is a base price okay so I
will have the base value coming in for
you know a refers to the base price C
one thing is you know one of the most
important constraints in linear
regression is the dependent value should
be
continuous in nature right in linear
regression I want you to understand this
this means you know what we can say is
it can have the range and it can take
any value in other words you know there
is no restriction in this example right
there is no absolutely no restriction in
the price of the apartment it can range
from 100 thousand or you can go up til 1
million or it can go to 5 million and so
on and so forth right hence we can use
linear regression equation here right so
we have this oneness you know come into
the coefficient part of it right we
talked about B and C right coefficient
we can have three properties as part of
the coefficient one is the magnitude one
is the direction one is the causal
correct so I just write it so that you
know magnitude I don't want you to feel
threatened by all this you know
definitions it's I'll make it super
simple for you to understand so that's
why I took the whiteboard nature of the
independent variable
yeah nitish how do we just I'll answer a
couple of these questions how do we
determine it should be linear no if it
is continuous right nitesh so that we
can have a range so that is so that
means I can have a linear here if I have
you know you know there are so many
other regressions available and it is
like logistic and all that right so
logistical regression you know if it is
if I have something which is nonlinear
right I will go for such things right
okay now what should be the nature of
the independent variable it is you know
we will see that parameter like every
sea crime rate everything is caught on
in everything will influence here right
everything will influence the price of
the apartment these are all influences
and we will have the coefficient okay
come tie is asking base price base price
is only a here right okay
the ridge no there is another question
you mean ranges to limit Ravi's asking
the what I'm when I say the range means
it can take any value Ravi yeah it can
take any value here right so coming to
the coefficient again back to our
context here the magnitude what we are
talking about right magnitude is the
amount the coefficient is impacting the
dependent dependent variable right it is
by this amount right if I say one here
right one point two here so it will be
one point two into land price right okay
that is what we mean by the magnitude
correct
now what is let us move let's say you
know if I say let's say you know I'm
making it even more simple price of the
apartment
I'm making a plus let's say five point
five you know I'm just giving a random
number land price right now I have
sliced the crime rate also here right so
I'm taking only this this is a base for
me and this is my this is my coefficient
and this is my land price correct is
that correct
so how do you interpret this friends can
someone interpret this is a constant
price will be determined apartment price
base price will change the factor of
five bit okay I'm getting various okay
all right so I'll yeah I mean there are
various people were kind of told that
correctly okay so what I'm trying to say
is any unit change in the land price
right in the unit change in the land
price impacts the price of the apartment
by five point five times is it okay to
say I mean I'm just talking the business
lingo right so that's what we are trying
to say here so let's say the higher the
magnitude right higher the magnitude
more impact on the dependent variable
correct higher the magnitude fine now if
I say if if I say
five point five it can be even - five
point five right - five point five so
how do you interpret this again it'll
see the if I have a positive one right
let's say I put the same thing here if I
do this something like this right
something like this so the first example
it says five point five times it'll
influence T it'll it'll influence the
price of the apartment by five point
five times second case to any unit
change any unit change right off the
land price will decrease the land price
by two point I mean five point five
times correct that's the direction
that's right am i audible friends okay
thank you yeah thank you so that's the
direction so this will determine whether
it will be directly proportional or
inversely proportional so that's what we
are trying to say so what is causal
causal is you know we saw this right
magnitude we saw direction we saw what
is causal causal is you know we try to
explain the relation between dependent
and the independent variable so it can
be unidirectional or even bi-directional
cause and effect exactly in addition
right cause in effect this cannot be
measured or gauged by domain or you know
actually we cannot just measure it just
like that right but we can gauge it by
you know our our business acumen or you
know domain knowledge this is what we
can do for example the crime rate right
the crime rate higher the crime rate we
say lower the price of the apartment
correct if the crime is really high in a
particular area it really impacts the
price of a land okay price of an
apartment in the neighborhood correct so
people wouldn't like to move there and
all that is the reverse true maybe or
maybe not right
maybe or maybe not okay the next thing
is like someone who is very very
familiar right with the real estate and
all that may be able to answer this this
is what because it's just not you know
it's it's it's not a logical stuff I
mean it's it can be a bi-directional
thing and somebody who is very familiar
with the domain or somebody who's very
familiar with you know business
knowledge can answer this question right
so that's what we mean by the causal
okay
so friends yeah I think Jeevan he says
please hurry up 35 minutes helped spend
more time on or please okay sure Jim and
I'm getting there so I have an example
to show you in our so let me go there
without further auto so let me show you
a simple data set so are you all getting
the basics of regression before I go to
the our example or you're getting this
here okay sure
awesome thanks so I'll go to the R
because you know the slides it's you
know I already have typed what is the
example I have shown I mean what I'm
going to show here so I'll show you the
data set first just a second show you
the data set first
what you do with this equation Ravi I'll
come to this you know I've shown you the
taste of linear regression so we will
see from an actual thing right okay so
we will see what we do here I'll I'm
exactly show it in R so we will know how
to build a model here correct so we are
what we are seeing here this is a data
set correct this is a data set just give
me a minute I'll just pull this data set
you know I have half of this just a
minute
you
okay so I have like 10 students here
okay if you look at this I have the
great point average in their high school
what they got and they are in the
freshman they are in the college
so using this data right
using this data I am trying to predict
what can be the score when they go to
the college so this is what we are going
to do or y'all clear with the problem
statement friends okay so what I'm
trying to do first thing I am reading
this right we are trying to build a
model that can predict the grade in the
college that will be dependent on the
grade in the school okay this is what we
are trying to do we are using linear
regression right we are using linear
regression okay so I am off let me
execute this first thing is you know I'm
just doing you know I'm just reading
this data set okay now I'm doing though
you know I'm just putting that to a
variable okay high school if I do a
summary here okay so and this is going
to give me the so it gives me the
minimum first quartile median mean all
these things based on their data what I
have here right this is what I have this
is what I have okay
and I also have if I want to see the
structure right if you want to see this
say it is having like you know these are
the values I have right I have 10
objects of three variables this is what
I have now let's let's plot it friends
let me just load this just give me a
minute let me pause
okay I have plotted it I have the high
school GPA here and the just a minute
I'll just show you this is what I have
high school gbn freshman GPA in the
y-axis correct this is what I have and
let's go
describe plotting no plotting you know I
just say what is the x-axis and y-axis
orbit
okay so what I'm see we already have
this right freshmen HS GPA and yeah as
per the you know we have exactly read
this this is what I have correct these
are the variables have used and this is
these are the values I've used for
plotting correct so exactly I've done
this now if you look at this right let
let's look at this scatter plot what is
the correlation France just let me pull
this what is the correlation here if you
look at this what is the correlation
anyone here
the access know the both access I it's a
positive correlation excellent yeah
the access both x-axis as Felicity
y-axis it is it's actually you know both
are numeric in nature if as you see the
high school greatest more and more you
know when it is increasing right the GPA
freshman GPA is also increasing so this
is what we are seeing so it's a positive
correlation correct it is an increasing
order what kind of coefficient value do
you expect here is it positive or
negative
can you tell me quickly it's positive
right straight forward so to run the
linear regression model so what I'm
going to do is you know so let me come
here I think this is what we have plot
so I'm simply going to run this friends
this is my linear regression model right
if you say LM is the function linear
regression so I'm simply passing this
the LM is linear model the argument is
the first thing is the dependent or the
target variable right this is my
dependent or the target variable and
what is the independent variable
anything that follows the tilde symbol
right that is the independent or target
right freshman GPA whatever that follows
the tilde operator are the independent
variables here right so there is only
one independent variable here because
it's the GPA but I can have bunch of
them here all grouped if I have like you
know four or five of them I can always
have so if I have like you know suppose
I have you know just for example I want
to put it suppose I
many of them here right I'm sorry
sorry if I have like you know HSS just
dollar
it just says GPA to write so I can I can
go on having like this whatever that
follows tilde operator it can come here
right say in short anything that comes
after the tilde operator or independent
variables in the linear model so that's
that's the point I'm trying to say so we
can also write the equation as you know
you can also write it as you know model
HS and I can I'm sorry I can put it like
freshman GPA
this also is possible right so if you
want to take off take care of all the
things right say it will take all the
independent variables right so instead
of defining each and every independent
variable you can you know all the ones
following tilde will be considered for
this model if I have like five variables
I have put the one before the tilde
operator one variable rest of them will
be independent so let's see what is
getting output here this is what I am
curious to know right this is what I
have so can you see the output the
college grad so can someone you know if
I can give make out what's exactly you
know if I need to interpret this what I
have from the LM right this is what I am
getting right residuals median max
coefficients intercept significance
residual error it says this right so if
I need to make some conclusion let's
focus on four significant ones here
right that's why I had to tell me
initially about those p-value and all
that so where is the p-value friends
here can someone point point me out
where is the p-value and what is a
p-value here okay
Arpit is spot-on yeah sure point to five
to correct this is the one yeah that's
right okay this is a p-value which is
coming out of this experiment and 0.64
six five is the estimate correct
estimate and multiple R squared if you
see right point you know four eight four
three just a minute this is the one
right this is what I have and I just had
R square is where suggested R square
it's four to one
correct this is what I have there are
four values that we can verify the
summary of linear regression model there
are so many
other things too but these are the four
significant ones here so what is the
estimate the estimate is the business
see that if I need to say that in the
business sense you need change in the
school grade will increase the college
grade by this many times right by this
many times is this correct France is it
okay to say that okay so the magnitude
in other words it is 0.6 force no okay
the what I'm saying here is you need
change in the school grade right okay
will increase the college grade by this
many times so this is exactly the
magnitude machine right so this is the
direction is positive or negative here
positive obviously so what is the
intercept here what is the intercept
okay so you're all yeah point four three
three nine I asked a couple of you have
pointed it out right this is very clear
now okay so how do you interpret this
can someone give it a shot
how do you interpret this bass that's
right this is the bass constant so this
is the minimum value of grade in college
right no matter in in other words right
I can interpret it this way no matter
how much a person had got in the school
a student will get 0.4 3 3 9 at college
so this is the base value right so
that's your intercept so what is point
zero two five two how do you interpret
this what is this then that is a p-value
you all told me but what is the p-value
here I mean how do you interpret this so
what is the null hypothesis friends what
is the null hypothesis high school grade
K how how to arrive no I'll call no
let's not the how to arrive you know it
it is the linear model you know it has
calculated this for us okay my point is
how do you interpret this p-value can I
say that high school grade does not
depend on the school grade in other
words the independent variable right
does not impact the dependent variable
both are same that's the null hypothesis
right that's the null hypothesis correct
now the what is alternate hypothesis
high school grade has an impact on the
college grade right so that's what we
are trying to say okay now we have let's
say you know let's say we have 95%
confidence level right so our cutoff
p-value what's what should be the cutoff
value if I have the confidence level as
95% can someone tell me
exactly yep I mean a point zero five
yeah five percent or point zero five
right now the experimental p-value is
lesser than thee what is the
experimental p-value this one right this
is the one it is actually lesser than
the point zero five so we can actually
reject the null hypothesis
right we can accept or reject someone
mentioned it sometime back right so we
can reject in I have a null hypothesis
so it proves so what it is proving here
it proves the high school has high
school grade has an impact on the
college grade so high school grade is a
significant variable in the
determination of the college grade
that's what we are trying to say
are you clear friends so far whatever I
said yes okay now let's look into
multiple or square here right so let me
just spend a couple of more minutes here
multiple you know what we are trying to
say is multiple R squared we got right
this is the one what we are saying is
amount of variation of dependent
variable which has been explained by all
of the independent variables right so to
the to what extent the in demand in
dependent variables can explain ideally
we expect the independent variables to
explain the dependent variable right
completely so what should be the ideal
value for you know multiple R squared
friends what do you think should be the
ideal value fantastic run it anybody
else so what we are expecting is we
expect independent independent variables
to completely explain the dependent
variable right so a dependent variable
which has been explained may all of the
independent variables so ideal value
should be one exactly right so but it is
very hard to get one in most of the
cases say anything about point seven is
considered good
in this case we are able to predict
close to 48 percent rate looking at this
value right we are looking we are
looking at a 48 percent now if we go
back to the apartment what we saw right
okay
price up at the apartment you know if we
say let's say you know this is where we
where right price of the apartment now
if you look at this price of a tool and
price you know this is what we were
saying plus crime rate you know this is
the equation we gave right initially now
let's look into the you know there is
something called adjusted r-square you
know we saw this right here adjusted R
squared which is 0.4 to one right point
four to one let's go back here okay so
what this means is let's say multiple R
square value will actually increase as
we increase the number of independent
variables right okay
higher the number corresponds to higher
accuracy of prediction so instead of
giving me just one variable one
independent variable if I have five my
degree of accuracy by my accuracy of the
prediction actually goes up so can you
explain better using less number of Idid
beasts or you know independent variables
or more the answer is more but let's
look into the adjusted r-square we just
saw it as point four two one right now
this is same as the multiple R squared
in this example at least it appeared
same it's almost like you know it's
almost same though there is a bit of
difference yes
so only thing is it only thing here it
is not sensitive to number of
independent variables the adjusted
r-square right unlike this one this one
is sensitive to the number of
independent variable right here it is
not sensitive correct so what you are
saying is you know if I am predicting
ten independent variables using ten
independent variables the multiple R
squared will be X if you increase the
number of variables throw another five
right the multiple are the multiple R
squared will go up you
more right this value whereas T if I
make it 20 you knows it he you know
it'll keep going on okay but beyond the
point right it may not be very
substantial fee make it 25 28 and all
the rate may not be very substantial but
there will be a little bit of changes
but it is bottom line it is sensitive to
the independent variable right okay
it'll sensibly increase whereas adjusted
r-square right it is not you know
impacted by the number of independent
variables it will only increase like if
you have like if you have a scenario in
which you have some independent
variables makes multiple r-square
actually going up whereas it may not
really patty I just you know adjusted
r-square then the variable is not really
significant okay for the linear
regression and you can even avoid those
variables right so something which is
not really significant right you don't
need to you know let's say you know a
milk booth is there in your near your
apartment is that going to really matter
does it really matter
in the price of the apartment probably
no right probably no so you don't care
about those things you don't worry about
those variables am i audible friends
okay because at least three or four
times you know somebody suddenly said
you know I can I can't be hurt okay so
what do we infer is we should create an
equation with more number of I'd V's or
independent variables or less number of
independent variables or just an optimal
number I think you will go for the
optimal number right having too many
variables is also going to be chaotic
it's better to go with an optimal number
because it becomes difficult to handle
too many independent variables as well
right so let's look into the prediction
which is probably the last part here we
predict two sets in this case Y in it
why we need so many independent
variables no no J is asking linear
algorithm now we used only two jr. but
you know we can have many we can have
many right but all I'm saying is there
are the you know the
the once which doesn't impact the
r-square values right you don't need to
worry about those variables that's what
I'm trying to say right that doesn't
impact now let's say let's look into the
prediction here right we have an English
executed this so prediction so what does
this say let's say say see the values
here and let's compare it with the data
set here right let's compare it with the
data set 1.7 you know if you look at
this right this is what I am predicting
using the value
it says 1.6 it's one point seven one
point eight five it is like two two
point one one it's one point eight two
point one seven
you know if he's look at this right 2.76
it's like three you know this is by the
prediction these are the actual values
correct so what is the then when you
have the actual values and mean you have
the prediction we can always look at the
next thing is how do I calculate the
residual or error for student one right
I mean you can always see this right so
it is like one point seven six I'm sorry
one point six minus one point six minus
one point seven two right I'm sorry
here this is my residual so it is if I
calculate this right that's what it's
going to do it's point my minus point
one two right so let's try if I print
this right it says this is what it's
trying to say right similarly if you
look at the second one two minus one
point five right so this is the one
similarly it has done this so what are
these values they are the predicted
values and we have also calculated the
residual values so this is to verify the
difference okay so this is what we saw I
just know let's sell let's assume
friends you know now that we have
predicted so what are we going to do
with this let's assume that you know we
have a new data of high school grade and
we have to predict the college grade
right so we
actually taken uh some kind of
historical data and come up with the
model right
this model is fairly you know it has got
some some level of accuracy right say
feel we have a new data right new model
new data now what we can do using that
high school data new data right I can
use a prediction algorithm I can very
well use this model this model is
already there so people also say right
friends the more and more you train a
particular model right it becomes more
and more efficient is that correct
so I mean I have like historical data
like one month rate the accuracy will be
there you know the more and more I go on
and train the model okay it's it can
become very very you know it can become
the accuracy will be far more higher is
it clear friends whatever I explained to
you so far on the linear regression we
will skim through the deck I think you
know little bit before I take up
questions so let's say he's adding more
data will train exactly in addition yeah
train the model yeah more data in the
sense more and more you train the model
right the accuracy will be more higher I
think how many people you know you you
all you know the way people have devised
chess and all that right
I think deep blue was one of the things
which even defeated Kasparov at one
point right in the 2000 now they've got
the most powerful chess engine which is
called comodo its rating is far higher
than even Carlsen right it is like it is
just thrashing all the opponents today a
lot of people are you know playing with
that comodo is a computer right more you
know it is it can think through multiple
possibilities
it is these designed by human only but
it can just think through multiple
possibilities and it can play right in
the in the chess
okay just a second friends let me skim
through the deck what they have got to
say here mean value given value read
linear regression just a minute okay
narrow distribution is always better
with a instead of a broad distribution
so that makes it okay closer look
just a minute friends I'm trying to see
what are the areas I can explain little
more okay looking at this yeah this
makes it a little more sense here tip
deviations if you look at it they have
calculated the slope they have
calculated the intercept here 634 5x
minus x intercept y intercept just a
minute minus x squared
bill deviation if you see the steep
deviations deviation in the products
bill deviation square if they say it
comes to they put it put a total here it
comes to for 206 Sal see where they have
plotted it you know I'm not seen it yet
it's just a minute value of the slope
calculating it here okay this is a
formulae they've calculated it value of
y intercept is this this is a average of
what we saw right and put the values of
intercept into a linear regression
equation see it's the same thing they've
done right the direction the base value
whatever we have seen so far right so
using this calculator they are using
this as the predictive tip amount right
what can be the predicted tip amount
based on the bill price they are using a
a plane coefficient value okay and there
is a magnitude here right observed
versus predicted then they will
obviously go for the residual here let's
see whether their bill
and they are plotting it as well just a
minute
residual yeah obviously they are coming
to that the same thing whatever we saw
right so what is the predicted what is
observed what is the actual one missus
predicted right
so for some cases it can be positive for
some cases it is negative right this is
how it will be how did we get 0.81 yeah
that's what they were on either whatever
is the you know this is the observed and
this is a predictor correct this is what
we are getting
so just a minute so I'll save bill a
mood again they're put with residuals
which is the error here right squaring
the residuals you know as we saw in the
play in in the very first example right
in the so so that this results in
positive value the second approach
better estimate and decreases the sum of
the squared errors okay this is the
dependent variable and independent
variable tipper mode as a function of
male amount so this is what we are
getting so okay so friends you know I
thought you know I I would rather
explain you a very simplified way and
come to this so did you understand
you know I am did you understand the
linear regression did you understand how
we went about it
did you understand how we did the
prediction subsequently and the
residuals did you understand these three
four things whatever I just mentioned
concept Ilyas Phyllis Dell how to train
the model when I Cal come to that okay
75 okay this is a 75 out of 100 all
right so that's your I have got sure I
think that's that's fine what about
Sedaka I think Sudha car was asking
something so doctor are you fine so far
so doctor and you know a few names which
I just remember out of my head that ish
narsimha
okay alright Hardeep
the dumps okay thanks okay I'll just
repeat Ravi has told so I'll just
summarize it so that you all stay clear
the first thing friends okay I'll also
say you know there's something called
how to train the model right so there is
what we do friends the thing is you know
before I come to training the model and
all that the the first thing is I want
you to you know in this V for predicting
the regression any I mean using a
regression model to come up with the
prediction prediction algorithm we
always try to first you know there is
one dependent variable right which will
be dependent on multiple independent
variables these are all these they will
be used for prediction correct they will
be used for prediction so what we
typically do is we will simply take you
know one by one right we will you know
try to form an equation and try to see
you know we will try to see you know
what is the coefficient what is a
possible coefficient for different
independent variables and what is a base
right and we use the function called LM
in the linear model for the our right in
the student grade whatever I told you
right I try to you know the actual
values were here the actual values were
here and I try to tell you what was the
model that was predicting right so there
were residuals residual is nothing but
errors so be compared to the actual ones
right because this is the historical
data I took right so my model was you
know I can the more and more I trained
right when I say training the model if I
feed some more data right the next time
you know I I can you know the accuracy
will actually go up so if I feed out if
I feed with more and more data you know
my model will become more accurate as I
keep entering more and more values right
in the sense you know I may also find
you in the model right so it becomes
more accurate with more data instead of
say if I it's like saying friends very
quickly if somebody gets like you know
one person says you know it's is very
simple this way if one person says
hey you are a rock star right you will
know you will think okay you may feel
flattered but you are like okay if I was
five people say you're like yes you are
like okay you feel somewhat good if
hundred people say right it's much
better so in this case you know it was
like 48 percent confidence that's right
in the dish yeah what we saw here
correct so it may become higher and
higher right may become higher and
higher as we move forward so that's how
you train the model right and finally
you know the model becomes so clear so
it is like you can literally predict
given the data of grade point average of
high school you can almost accurately
predict freshman GPA right is that
correct
correlation is zero no then it becomes
okay what vivekananda saying if the
independent variable if there is
absolutely zero right so what will be
the what will be the what to say what
will be the freshman GPA friends in this
case if the freshman you know whoa what
will be the prediction sorry let me
frame the question differently if what
he says is like the freshman if the
correlation is completely zero how do
you go for regression that is what we
make on in this asking can someone
answer this because we have understood
it well let me check that can someone
try answering this okay Vivekananda
point is you know as we saw the
coefficient you know if it is like
totally zero let's say right then it can
you know it it very well take the base
that's it
whatever see the base also we saw all
right we make another what I was trying
to say this this what is the base value
here in this case we saw it here right
can you tell me again what is the base
value
intercept correct it is the intercept
here yes so no matter what you know the
the point is whatever is the thing right
the base value it is like you know the
no matter what you know how it you know
how the freshman performs right how they
performed in the college they are going
to get that great right in the freshman
okay so that's what we try to intercept
I mean interpret here correct that's
what we mean by this all right so just a
minute friends one other thing I want to
tell you before I what if the Ranjan is
asking what if the base value is not
significant in the first place okay
the the variables basis you know that
that's see the variables the
significance in significance it is
generally attached with the variables
runyan right so which are the
independent variables right so this is
what I have used library for what
purpose - for this linear model equation
jr. right correct so I need to use all
these things especially you know if I
need to describing the data and all that
right so I need to use this okay any
other questions which I need to take did
you all understand you know one thing
you know I again missed out did you all
understand did you all understand the
you know given the fact you know you
have this dependent variables
independent variables then you have the
base value I mean you find out the base
value you find out the coefficient of
different independent variables then you
saw we saw the r-squared we saw the
adjusted R square which is insignificant
which is which is not you know which
doesn't really get impacted by the
number of independent variables whereas
multiple R squared yes okay and okay so
this is what we saw so what okay
Nitish says I got which other method can
help us to do the same let me answer
this Jeeva there are like you know when
you actually do multiple you know there
are several regression techniques
available friends right there are
several regression techniques available
you need to take which is the best one
which gets closer to your you know which
provides higher accuracy right so here
we are talking about linear regression
here and we are using this right so
there are different regression
techniques available so you need to use
which is the most appropriate for your
for your kind of business and for your
kind of analysis so that is absolutely
in your hands okay now if it says I got
accept hypothesis okay see the
hypothesis what I am trying to say in
the dish you know just you try to
understand this it becomes very simple
okay what I'm saying is like you know we
did all these things right we did
everything in the college grad and you
know what I'm saying is the null
hypothesis here in this case like I am
saying the both the experimental value
and the population which is the
historical value right I mean I'm saying
the high school grade is not dependent
on these cool grade I'm sorry yeah this
is what I'm saying
right now you can reject this hypothesis
on a confidence level of let's say 95
percent right that's my confidence level
of 95 percent 95 percent means my
p-value probability value should be 0.05
right if the confidence is 95 percent
since it is lesser than that right the
experimental value is actually lesser
than the cutoff value so I can reject
the null hypothesis that is what I am
trying to say in addition yeah
okay adjusted r-square okay
let me explain that again just a minute
see I just said there are two things
right multiple R squared on the adjusted
r-square
okay so the more and more number of
independent variables right if I add one
more right this may actually go up okay
this will impact whereas adjusted
r-square it is actually it doesn't get
impacted okay it is like you know it is
not it it doesn't impact even if I add
more number of variables right
independent variable it doesn't get
impacted here
that's your adjusted r-square Vinayak
says if correlation is zero no linear
relation exists yeah okay anything else
friends did I miss out any questions so
adjusted it's like you know it's morale
you know if I want to say it sensibly
increase right it'll not just merely
increase by the number of independent
variables right say it'll sensibly
increase let me put it that way if we
choose type of regression then variables
we rely on historical data is it the
correct order yes and if they see the
more and more you do write more and more
accuracy it becomes right over a period
of time you know it's just like you know
picking up a skill right once you become
more flow in tree you get fluency by
experience similarly what degrees of
freedom given can I understand what is
this question like what degrees of
freedom means what can you articulate it
a little bit
what does it mean I mean whoa what is
the context here I don't get what you're
asking sorry if I didn't get that
how residual value help in real life
okay okay residual value nitesh the
point is see that is like your error
rate that's layer that's an error for
you so going forward right the more and
more error you are getting right you
you'll try to minimize it right so you
know the deviation from the actual
misses predicted so you can try to fix
this over a period of time do charts
look boring in or nOCA no no actually
indica the point is it's R is one of the
best in data visualization it is one of
the best so I showed you a very dumb
scatter plots sorry about that but I can
you know you can really add juice and
you know spice to make it a lot more
interesting agreed and it can be done
for sure but this is a very
straightforward scatter plot whatever
you're seeing right that's what you are
seeing but it is not at all boring trust
me but you know it is almost in the you
know tableau if you see that right it's
it's it's beautiful tableau is beautiful
and you know or has the visualization
support plus your statistical formulae
and all that so in that way it is very
effective
yes Hardeep yes residual value yeah
exactly hurt them yeah this he says I
use tableau - yeah okay sure so friends
I hope I was able to make some sense out
of today's session hope you all enjoyed
it all squared
more and more independent other access
ok Hardeep says R square more and more
independent other axis XY gets impacted
see R square right see Oh what I was
trying to say heard if the R squared is
like as I told you more independent
variables
it becomes you know that that's the
percentage of it we can actually
determine rate percentage of accuracy
rate so it'll definitely need the higher
the percentage it'll become correct the
