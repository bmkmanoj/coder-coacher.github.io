response to single page application
using this angularjs how to write a
basic program in angular JS whenever you
want to start this angular JS program
first you have to download and include
your angularjs plinking so that is what
we are doing first we have included our
angularjs plug-in in this curve next we
have a directive called
ng app what is it - whenever you include
this angularjs plug-in and if you run it
in the browser this plug-in will look
for the directive called incr once it
finds that directive it will that
particular element will be the root of
your language this application now if
you see in this example we have NT app
in the body so whatever you are
declaring inside this body everything
will be considered as an angularjs
components so here you can take write ng
controller or a ng click event
everything so this part under the body
will be considered as an anchor this
compounds so to build the angularjs
application what do we need just one
notepad plus notepad are any your
favorite tool then just one web browser
just more than enough to run your web
application before we go to demo do you
have any other questions please post
your questions in the question windham
okay we are getting a question from
screen there
can we add mg up yes so this year
premier everywhere the ng F from there
only angularjs application starts so if
you want to start the application you
have to add ng up okay the next question
what is ng-controller so if you want to
write any other business logics or the
validations all the logics goes inside
the controller this is where you can
write the logics okay let's start the
basic angularjs application so will we
can answer all the questions
so what I am going to do I already have
downloaded my angularjs file so I have
to create my estimate right here let me
open that particular history whatever I
have created okay can I see my screen is
this visible for you yeah thank you so
this is the editor the sublime editor so
it is really makes developers like PC
whenever I want to create an HTML file
skeleton I will type like HTML 4 and 5
on top it will create the skeleton force
this is the best editor I feel let's
create the title okay whenever you want
to start our application we have to
include this angularjs script file
inside this application
so now we have intruded the script okay
so I have been told
whenever you include this crew the
script will look for ng-app directive so
this wherever you are writing this Genji
up directive that will be considered as
the root of your application if I write
my MT app right here inside my body this
will be considered as the root so what I
am going to do I am going to improve
this ng app in the root of your gum our
root of the word down is this HTML tag
right here I am including this ng app so
here input the nga here I want to give
some name for this angularjs application
let's give it as a demo so here in
define my angular this application now
you have to declare it okay I'm creating
a script tag ID here itself the app
equal to this is the syntax for
declaring your angularjs application if
you see in this syntax we are giving
some empty brace right here
so this empty brace is for the
dependency injection what we discussed
so what if you need any other modules to
access in this particular application
what you can do you can download those
modules and inject it as a dependencies
for example if you want to include this
bootstrap download this bootstrap script
and included outside dependence right
here push off so you can access all the
functions inside some bootstrap use
inside this particular angularjs
application this is the use of
dependency injection for now we don't
need these dependencies let's start the
basic application okay now I have
created angularjs application I'm
working
esse Angliss application with the name
called him let us run this is my
developer tool now we started this
application and I want to write some
kind of functionalities over here as I
mentioned if you want to write your
business logics or any other validations
we have to write it in our controller so
let us create the controller for angular
JS I have defined a controller called
test controller over here so now I have
to define it in the same thing how we
have defined this angular JS so f dot
control above test controller so you can
extend we are mentioning for this
particular application and creating the
controller that is what we are
mentioning right here so now we have
created the controller let me add the
consult mug right here so we get to know
whether it is coming inside this
controller you can see this now it is
coming inside this test controller so
whenever you are defining the controller
and a test controller it will call this
particular controller it will come it
will execute whatever the
functionalities you have written
inside this control okay now let's see
the expressions inside this particular
controller if you want to do any
angularjs expressions we have to use
this double place that let me fill this
for plus 12 so this is normal HTML if I
want to evaluate as an expression you
have to give it inside this particular
places now if I give 4 plus 4 over here
it will be evaluated and it will give
the result so let me put it in the big
size here so this is a normal HTML
content and I am adding right here 4
plus 4 and it will evaluate again it is
giving the result so you can write all
the expressions inside this double
places in angularjs so it will evaluate
internally it is using our normal dot
ever function okay now we have seen this
expression right here now we want to see
what is called to pay binding in this
angular this let us do that I am going
to create a scope variable inside this
controller I'm creating a scope variable
called name I am just naming it as jump
so this is my scope variable name if I
want to give the scope variable name
inside this controller I will give it in
the same way whatever I have done it in
the expression let me do this
so I am going to give this particular
variable name right here so this is
available right here it came so whatever
the name I mentioned right here it is
you can access that in the view what I
have done I am not writing any
punishment so if you are using a jQuery
buddy will be writing will be getting
the class or ID of this particular
content and inner HTML or dot HTML will
push it but here we may not to do
anything whenever you update it in the
model automatically that model will
update in the view let's do it in this
way we have one more directive called ng
model in the angular JS so what it will
do whatever you are mentioning right
here the same object you can give it to
the model so this model will take this
if you change anything in the model it
will update this object over there in
the controller as well as the object
there in this view so here we are using
this dollar scope variable called name
excuse this name as a model to this
textbox you can see this let me put it
in the bigger text okay now inside that
whatever it changes I am making it will
be updated interview I haven't written
any functionalities over here if you
want to accomplish this function with
the normal JavaScript or jQuery or they
will be doing he will be listening for
this key of the event in the text box
whenever the key event happens we will
be updating this view but this is what
we are find under two-way binding so
whenever you change this particular
model value this view is automatically
changing this is called two-way binding
over here okay can we use multiple
controllers inside our application you
yes we can use multiple controllers
right here already I have defined one
controller called test controller in
this application hit me defend one more
control depending one more controller
called test controller new in the same
way you have to extend this controller
okay now I have extended this controller
if I can I use this particular
controller scope variable inside this
controller no you can't use it so
because this controller is separate from
this control if you want to use it you
have to use it by our route scope
variable let's try this before already
defined a scope variable called name
inside my first controller if I keep
name right here inside my second
controller let me run this see here they
are not at all getting anything because
this scope available only inside this
controller itself if you want to share
the scope between the controller you can
do with the darkness
route scope or you can do with the
services so let's instead of writing it
in their dollar scope let's make it in
the root scope I am injecting the root
scope to this particular controller that
we put this Jeff in the root scope
now this jump is available in the first
controller as well as in the second
controller so whatever the data you are
defining in the root scope it will be
available all over this application when
if you are defining it as a normal
dollar scope it will be available one
inside that particular controller okay
Liggins having any other questions okay
we have a question from surrender called
routes he is asking me to explain this
route scope akin okay so what is it mean
by root scope now many this route scope
let me build one more let me put this
scope variable right here
scope dot name equal to Java so this
particular chip will be available
accessible only inside this controller
so I want to declare a name inside my
one controller but I want to access it
all over the application what you can do
so if you are defending it on the root
scope it is like an instance of your
application so however if we have this
global variable in the same way whatever
you are depending on the root scope not
some particular name so that will be
available in the global on your
application so we can access it anywhere
in the control okay
what is global and local variable so
will global and local variable is so if
you want it is like a normal hour
functionalities whenever you are
dependent as a local variable it will be
accessible only inside that particular
function alone so after after that
particular function if you want access
it that local variable inside the outer
of that function you can access it it
will throw this undefined so you have to
depend it as globally if you are
dependent as a globally so you really
accessible all over this application
next one can we have a look more ng-app
I'm getting a question from Nitish can I
use more ends here no you can use only
one entry have as per the application
because otherwise difficult all this
work a various applications are as I
mentioned application starts from
wherever it finds by ng F so this will
be considered at the root you cannot
have to root for a single application so
we can use only one nzf per application
how to create the user-defined function
I am getting a question from Illya let
me do this okay now we have seen lager
two-way binding and other things now I
want to create a function whenever you
said clicks on some particular button I
want to do some kind of business logic
let me write this inside my fur let me
delete these controllers so this is
confusing now I have only one controller
in my application let me get a button
whenever I click on this particular
button I want to let the user saying
okay you click this button so I have the
writer controller functionality right
here all that mean I am creating one
function called all at P so I am going
to define this function inside my first
control so this is the syntax to create
the function user-defined function in
the controller now we have a button and
our I click on this button it will throw
Lord this is the functionality we have
written right here this sir we can
create user-defined functions inside
this angularjs application
yeah I am getting one more question from
myth ish can I have no app no controller
in the angular subluxation yes of course
you can create a application with Noah I
mean you have the market as int app so
but you need not to dependent them that
we do the file right here what I am
going to do I am just going to define
just Eng I'm not going to try this
particular NJ up equal to whatever it is
let me come at everything so I define
one here NJ up over there and I am
deleting the functionality side sure so
still we can access all our expressions
everything inside this function can see
this is number eight now with just only
the MGF whenever you are mentioned as
MGF it will be considered as the
angularjs application you need not a
dependent but the best practice is give
it as a name then only you can create
the controllers and other stuff with
application test with the expression
alone we can't build the application
that's why we are defining it yeah
and we are getting a question from sha
hill car asking how how we can create
this URL routing okay now we have seen
the basic angularjs session now let me
show you the application whatever I
built using this angular JS okay is the
basic program we have covered let's go
for this them now our scenario is I want
to build a basic angularjs application
where user can log in create a new user
view this user list and daily user this
was a function or they want to create
using angular this what are the things
you need before to create this
application one is server editor
next one is the browser to view this
application now I am going to fill this
application on Nantes server so you had
you should have that node.js installed
in your machine then I am going to use
MongoDB to store the user information I
am going to use this is the application
okay let me check whether I have no
install information so if you want to
check whether you have a node installed
just type North - D it will give the
version number whatever you mean stop if
you don't have a node that doesn't
matter it is really simple to install
this node is go to note that Obagi
download the executable file and install
we can install this code simply then I
want to run MongoDB in my application
just to store the information let me
start the MongoDB so here I have started
the MongoDB now this MongoDB is
listening to the port two seven zero one
seven now I got that also now MongoDB is
up and run
let me check whether it is showing the
database and others okay now you can see
now this MongoDB character to this disk
if I want to show the database they will
give all the databases
okay now MongoDB also working fine now
let's start the basic application
whenever we need to build a web
application with node.js what we have to
do is we have to create our packets
adjacent
let me open this first I will be
mentioning the name of this application
and the version these are all these
things are mandatory okay after then
inside this nodejs i am going to use
Express framework so Express is a
framework on top of this node
application then body passer it is for
passing the normal string to JSON and
August
Mongoose it is the connection between
MongoDB and the nodejs lodash is just
for it's like underscore.js to do the
data processing these are all the
dependencies I am going to use inside my
node application so whenever you want to
start your node app what you have to do
you have to create just basic packets
are Jason and inside your app test you
have to mention everything I express I
have mentioned Mungo's so better I
mention it as like required of Express
it will get this Express module from
this node modules and we can access the
Express inside this particular pit
that's what you can do so here I have
done the basic server configurations
right here
you can see this and whenever you are
making an app that listen to some
particular port then if you start your
third application this application will
be listened to this mentioned put number
ok how to start the node application
just navigate to that particular path
and let's start - node whatever the file
name is are given here I marketed as
after days so I will be starting node
app now this application is listening to
3 those input whatever the console I
prettier right here so it is showing
over here listening to 3,000 put let me
open that particular URL right here okay
now it is whenever I hit this 3000 it is
coming to long enough it so what I
mentioning it in my application whenever
any URL request comes go to claim dot
slash index dot HTML so any URL comes it
will go to the client folder and it will
open this index.html in the same way if
any sir service came for dot layers or
dot HTML or anything like this this is
the regular expression to find if the
service is coming it in
this way whatever slash tower dot J s or
HTML
something two to four characters so
whenever a request for a dot J's file
our dot his table file he too will can
send it with the directory the full path
I need that's why we are getting a
directory name of this particular files
ok so what I am doing right here
whenever you load this application
automatically it will load our
index.html that's the thing we
configured it in our after J's so in the
index dot HTML we have to create our
angular app so what I am doing
first I am injecting angularjs file
right here you can see this clean slash
power company I have this angular JS
file inside the bower component so I am
just injecting that file I am adding
that file inside my HTML tag angular dot
min dot J's and I want to perform this
you are or the routing so I am including
and we are you a router in this
application in the same way I need some
more bootstrap CSS and other
functionalities so I am including this
foot stomp J's also this is what I need
for this application I defined my nti
passive user management so what you have
to do we have create the function policy
engine like angular that module of this
particular application alright so what
we are doing inside our heart folder and
plaiting this variety quit the angular
module of the whatever the name I
mentioned for his angle ideas and this
one last time in our demo what we have
seen there is no dependencies for this
user management now right here I want to
use the route providers that's why I am
injecting you a router as a dependency
injection to my application so once I
inject this application what will be we
can access we can access this state
- and the URL road progress these two
functions are available inside this UI
router so right here I mentioning
whenever this URL daughter provider is
not finding any part in this mention
photo structure this load login as a
default path this word where mentioned
right here
that's why whenever whatever the path
I'm typing you change it to login you
can see this this is what we are
mentioning right here if the path is not
available in this providers just load
this like the first one is done now
whenever this path is slash login I want
to load a particular template inside my
application as well as I have to add the
controller this is what we are
mentioning right here in the state
provider whenever my path is slash login
load this HTML inside the index dot HTML
and sit the login controller as my
controller to the supplication okay so
so let's see what is there inside this
log in addition I have this HTML inside
acclaimed app pages so plain app pages
have my login folder you say that I have
the system so what is happening whenever
that particular slash login comes it
will go to this application and it will
load this plugin at his chamber that's
what we are doing okay and it is loading
this login controller as well let's see
what we have in the line control in the
same way I have created a line control
another controller of this one then
whenever user clicks on this is like in
button
I want to send user name and password to
the backend I want to verify whether
this user is a
user or not that's why I wanted to rule
so how can you contact the back-end
services here we have one service called
dollar HTTP don''t stdt
HTTP are so whatever the method post
method argot method or put method you
can use any method and what is the you
are on me
absolutely / user / like him and I want
to pass the user information I have the
user information in there like in that
user so you can see this here I have two
text boxes right here I have two text
boxes
this box is ng model I am assigning
lying in that user dot username and the
next text box is logging that user dot
password
so whatever the data you are typing
inside the text box the data will be
available in this username and the
password okay then whenever user clicks
on the login button this is the button I
have created it is the button login
button I have created
so whenever user clicks on this button
if you call a method called
plugin so right here I have created a
method called login dot logon so here I
mentioned as a long interval because
this elías name I am mentioning so
mentioning the same week like in equal I
will be calling this particular method
once this method gets called it will
make a service call to this KP let's see
them Here I am giving admin slash admin
so this is the user name and the
password so whenever you want to see
this rip services you can open your
developer tool in the network's tab we
can see all the reservists
may open this network whenever I click
on this login you can see we are making
more cuts because once a large then it
it is going to the next page this is
what my functionality right here I
logged in once the user and password is
a valid this go to the slash pool this
is what I mentioned okay let's give the
come on user ID password so it will be
in the same page okay now I'm getting
the error doll username mismatch so you
can see the service right here and I
open the service I am posting the data
of something right here user ID and the
password so in the response it is giving
status 500 and the username is Miss
France okay
this sir we can handle it here I'm
writing like that logic in this
like in controller so you the status is
200 then user and user is a valid user
so navigate to the slash phone so what
it will do in this browser so whenever I
click give a proper user ID and the
password click on submit it will give it
will add it right here as a slash boom
have you seen this you are then for this
particular URL I am mentioning my grub
controller right here whenever my overly
slash whole load home that controller
and load hold that HTML for that control
this what may have mentioned so did
happen whenever I click on this home it
will go here pages home home dad HTML
pages boom from that HTML it will load
this particular HTML inside the index
system okay but in the viewer and you
can see one more thing it is not only
the poem we can see home slash list okay
so what is that inside the home we
one more term these are all the tabs
right here inside the room I want to
make one more this is a child out of it
so here if you see inside there my home
state I have one more state called
enlist I'm mentioning if the state is
URL is slash list load my list
controller as well as load my Lister
HTML so it will load this list are HTML
and listed controller inside this cone
we have the UID right here it will load
everything because this particular list
is coming under this whole that is Gemma
that's why we are loading this view
inside this is Gemma okay so what's
happening whenever it is becoming a pool
and it is becoming list so it will go to
this controller okay
so home it alert this home dot HTML and
if it is coming under the list it'll
load this list or hash table inside
let's see what is there inside this list
of is Gemma
so inside the listed HTML I have created
one variable called ng-repeat
of some kind of data let's see this
later first let's look into this list
our controller here what I am doing
whenever I open this particular
controller it will make a HTTP card to
this web service to get the list of
users available in the DB that's what we
are doing method is get and get getting
from this particular service whenever it
gets the user and bind it to give it to
the scope variable called user list you
can see right here I am NOT about using
the other scope right here because if
you use dollars code it will be really
hard to migrate whenever we build this
application in angular 2.0
that's why we have to follow this kind
of documentation
instead of using dollar scope use this
variable this
as same as this telescope okay so
instead of using this because if I use
this even inside the one function this
variable also will be the same so we
will get confused that's why I am
assigning this this variable to LLC so
we can use L see that whatever so this Y
LLC now will act as the scope for this
particular controller okay now let's go
to this list addition so we never
ignored this listed HTML I am NOT at all
getting any data because I don't have
any data in mind magari so let's store
some data so what you can do go to this
create page and we will do some data
right here so I am creating the user
right here as a create user so I have
saved this now if you go to the listing
page we can see that particular user in
the same way you can create multiple
uses so whenever you are coming to this
list abit it will get the user list from
this service and it will give it to this
ng-repeat okay now let me create one
more user so it will be clear
Oh creator to yourself so if you see our
network tabs so we are getting these are
these the file we are getting the
service the list of means we are getting
it as a JSON object so what we are going
to do we are going to give this
particular JSON object to this ng-repeat
so in the NT Limpy we look into this
object and each and even it it will act
like a normal problem so this will be
what are a this will be like up a yeah
say array of I so we can access user
that username so again doing their own
you serve god first name you said that
last name so it will act like a problem
whatever the number you have so what I
am doing I am creating a TR ng-repeat
inside that multiplet ease so the user
list water we have it will repeat it
over there and it will create a table
structure look for here in the U n I'm
not at all writing any code for us it is
just ng repeat will take out and in this
angularjs we have this services and the
fittest one of the filter is order one
so normally if you want to do this kind
of order be body be doing whenever you
click on some particular button will
make a Jack's call to the backend and in
the backend will be ordered by click in
the MySQL or wherever test we will do
this order by and everything but here in
angulation surf you can do order by what
so here I'm writing a key Shanti
whenever you click on this first name
heading tab other way plus name the last
name this order by last name this word
we are telling right here the pipe
symbol is mentioned for the filter and
this order by what we are passing idea
order by first name or order by place
let's do this
instead of passing the variable that we
put it in this
first name okay so whenever I reference
the spin it will be ordered by first
name because J okay this is the use of
our way now we have seen this list okay
how to do the speed pitch what I am
doing
whenever I click on this create tab in
the same way we are changing the URL to
slash field you know you are a drought
provider you have mentioned it whenever
it becomes slash dot create go to create
a twist Emma and create our controller
this what I have mentioned so let's see
what is there is a clinician one since
created his Timur and have created a
user field called first name the last
name username and other stuff so each
and everything is binded to some
particular ng-model so you can see this
right here the first name is binded to
user that first name last name username
and password so whenever user clicks on
this particular button a sign up so it
will call CC dot clear they method so
this method will be available inside our
clear controller so if we call this
particular method we are writing on
validation whether users password and
confirm as password is seen if it is not
saying we killed all that message right
here they will stop this execution
otherwise it will make a call to the
backend service and it will push the
data so we can store the data in the
MongoDB you can see that particular
functionality right here method outpost
of AP slash user slash C so we are
calling this FA and pass
this user data this is what we are doing
inside this feed list method this is
their basic application using angularjs
to explain routing and the dollar
services everything do you have any
questions on this demo yeah I have a one
question from Shaheen card where is this
UI router defined okay let me show that
to you so this is where we are defining
our angularjs application am i right
this way we are depending on me in this
name he can pass our dependency that is
you a router over here I am just
mentioning the drove out the name right
here
did I answer your question
okay
next one so please suggest a best
angularjs deeper hell play game and how
to use it I am getting a question from
Shrek Quraish so we can use the normal
cruel itself to debug our application
let's do this so whenever I click on
this particular applique particular
button I want to check whether we have
all the data so let me go to the sources
you can see all the file right here so I
have this particular edge to Emily
inside this clear so I can add the
debugger I can just click on the
particular line number so you will add
the debugger okay so whenever you click
on this sign up button it will come over
there its top so you can take all the
data so whether the way has a password
no it is undefined this one this is also
undefined so if you want to go to the
next line press yep then say it will go
to the next line okay this is how you
can debug your application okay
how could we describe dollar HTTP dollar
HTTP is the service to call your web
service whatever exper expose it is not
only for the nodejs or anything so if
you see where a Java or.net we can
expose it as a web service so if you
want to call that web service you have
to use our dollar HTTP the dollar HTTP
we have to mention what is the method we
are using and what is that you are and
we have the cop this year we can use the
dollar HTTP service in the same angular
JS application yes I am getting one more
question from Ruggie called
what is dollar location okay this dollar
location we used it in our login page
let's go to that one
inside our login that page we are using
down at location what we are telling
whatever the URL you are getting right
here if I mentioned has a slash home it
will go there dollar location of pot so
this down and location service dot path
some URL if I mentioned it so it will
add that URL after this hashtag that is
the use of dollar location service did I
answer your question already okay and
one more question from Malaya
is there any conflict point yeah so
there is no config file for this
angularjs just we will be having only
our defined this particular script our
own after this you can create your app
that country that is not a conflict by
later sir
angularjs functionality so what they are
doing when when you start the
application first it will come inside
this country but if you enact the dart
at that controller or not if you define
it in the HTML then only it will come to
that particular control but whenever you
are defending as an app that conflict if
you start our application directly it
will come to this conflict
so whatever the functionality you want
to write whenever you start the
application you can write it inside this
dot country or top run okay okay this
almost we are at the end of the session
so let's go go back to our PPD so okay
it's yeah I am getting one more motion
this basic comes were like what is
console table so as we developer if you
want to test the application so what I
will be writing will be writing the
console dot log inside this particular
functionality so whatever the log you
are writing it will be printed inside
your
in the deepest and we'll be having one
tab called console you can see this
so whatever the large I have written it
will come over there then I can verify
okay it is coming inside this particular
webpage or inside this particular
functionality so I can verify it it is
like a kind of debugger debugging
technique only no I mean again on
crochet this is it Bellini after nothing
so it is a default plug-in available for
this there Oberto just in the normal
Chrome press f12 or the menu will open
the developer if you are using Firefox
or anything else you have to include the
external plugin like Firebug or anything
else yeah I am ending one pushing from
screen GB where our Jason data obtaining
the rest service has returned for so I
have written all the other services
using our node application now this
webinar is only focused to angularjs
that's why we have covered only in the
client-side so if you have any queries
like oh yeah to get this recording
session or anything else you can contact
to support our intercom will be getting
the chorus all the queries will be
resolved again so it's time we covered
almost all the features in angularjs if
we have any other queries regarding the
session or our course just contact our
support out a dry cotton and please
share your feedback after the session
