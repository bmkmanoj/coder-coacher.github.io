package library XML that would be great
because we will using the library XML
throughout this case study so once you
installed the library XML please let me
know so that I can proceed with it
because this one is I want you to do it
with myself because the previous one I
did not feel that you can do it with
myself because you might be having a
different database so you cannot follow
me with writing down the code to buy
yours by yourself following me but it is
better that this web scraping will do it
together so please let me know once your
you have installed the package XML who
there has a scanning upload these links
in LMS this is this link will be there
in the file so you can have this link in
the file I put it in the chat window so
that if you could please have it from
the chat window that would be great also
how to know what are the libraries
already installed in your system you can
find the things that are installed in
your system by looking at this place so
this is a place where you can have a
look at the different libraries which
are installed yet this installed this
will be quite a big case study so my
intention is that through this site I am
going to fully scrape the data the data
will be scraped
what is XML to our I'll have to find out
actually
is it another package or something that
you are looking just now new package
might be because what is happening
Josiah is that everybody
excuse me okay packages popped when I
typed XML yes everybody is writing a
package on their own er that's a beauty
as well as a difficult part in our is
because you suppose I am proficient
enough I can I can write one package and
release it to the cou depository and
people can use it so that should be
another package then if it has popped up
so let's try it so I guess everybody has
got it so first is library XML oops
so that is like duty XML so this is the
URL that I guess I put it into the chat
window now this is a very important
command what he says is that it reads
the HTML tables he reads the HTML tables
sorry
with me then can you please type this
thing into your machine so that for me
it was quite fast it got the HTML table
in the tables and data set so did you
guys get the tables sing here into your
machine if you get it
then I will proceed and try to try to do
the next steps I just want to also each
of you to get this so Venkatraman has
said yes that's good encouraging for me
this I'll wait I'll pause for some time
so that all of you guys are able to do
this because this is a very interesting
case study because what we are trying to
do is that we are going to get the data
and it will be in a not in a very
fantastic form first we are going to
utilize whatever things that we have
learnt in the last two classes and a
little bit of new things that we learn
in this class using some string matching
and string manipulation functions we are
going to get a pure data frame and what
we are going to do is that you surely
like instead we use SQL DF also if you
don't want SQL Dave that's fine also you
can use plain simple R to do it but
we'll use SQL DF to do the other things
so anybody except Venkatraman who has
got to this place
Ajitha said yes no rush because we have
still a day left to cover this case
study but we want to get everybody this
first step right
well put this whole thing in a chat
window
okay I've got one question from soon egg
is you have to first initialize C URL
you've got an error in that third
statement assuming what you have to do
is that you first have to initialize
with this URL command so while you do
this let me explain what is it doing it
reads an HTML table into the tables and
what it does is that it does not convert
the strings as factors so that is why we
are saying string as factors equal to
false
assuming if you could please try it
yourself once again so there is asking
can you please repeat what does string
as factors do okay what does string as
factors to is because this read dot HTML
table it has default value as string as
factors as true so whenever it finds
strings it will make it as a factor if
it is true but we don't want dad because
because sometimes what would happen is
that there would be these population
figures population figures these are not
factors these are actually numerous and
we want to treat them as numerix but if
you treat if it becomes a factor then it
becomes very difficult to manipulate so
what we will do is that they will if you
make it as factors we will not be able
to manipulate so for our for our things
what we will do is that we will convert
them into numerix after manipulating
them what we are doing is set we will
first understand what is the structure
what I do is before you go into all
these things first let me understand the
STR it gives me the structure you see
here first it gives me a list of two so
it is a data structure it gives me two
213 observation of seven variables so
these are the variables that are coming
and then then there is another data
frame which is strain of serrations of
two variables so basically what is
happening is that the list is having two
to two variables of type data frame so
let's go back to the site and understand
what it is
see here this is one table and if you
scroll down this is another table here
this is another table see agriculture
and rural health rural development and
all these things are coming into picture
so this is set Eid effectiveness all
these things are coming in
so we'll go step by step so we have
understood that it has two data frames
and then what we will do is that we are
interested in the first first table we
are interested in the first table we are
interested in the first table
so what we will do is that we will go to
the first stable and you see that this
is a first table which is coming up but
it has all these ugly things there all
these are this /a in country name all
these things are there 210 2011 212 all
these things are coming so table 1 data
is this one so table 1 data is this
that is a table one data so we have
we have got to be table 1 data here and
we are not considering those
agricultural things here so now we have
the total data that we were looking for
we have the data of this from 209 to 210
211 12 all these things are there with
us
so if you guys are with me till now
then then I can proceed or will pause
for some time and discuss about the
things that we have discussed and then
we can continue tomorrow with the other
things so I see something questions
coming up error in print default M code
is equal to code right right invalid
connection venkatrama did you by any
chance get the tables data first you
should get the tables data if you have
got the tables data then then then you
should get now here I just wanted to
stress one thing instead this is a list
so so what you have to do here is that
so this tables if you loss tables it's a
list so if you remember in the demo too
that we gave the way the list is being
accessed
instead first you have to give the list
to access a list you have to do this
there two brackets said
so here you get the first list and you
get the second list and then you have to
do the rest of the part
okay what I will do is that I will pause
here and try to find out if there are
any more questions so that we can do the
whole this population data analysis at
this point so what we have done till now
is aligned with the objectives we have
learnt of how we can get the data from
SAS we have got the data from SAS studio
we have got the sorry SAS studio from
SAS from SPSS from SQL da and from from
sequel server we have seen but I would
request you that after this class maybe
if it is possible tomorrow just have a
look to connect to on any other
relational databases like like my secure
your post Chris sequel and then we have
seen that how we are able to scrape and
the data from Internet there are various
other functions also that are we are
able to scrape the data read lines is
one of them will show examples of it
this is one good thing that we are doing
is that the case study in which through
each what we will do is that we will try
to extract the data in the form of a
data frame and then we'll do some
manipulation yes let me answer the
questions actually how does it know the
web page has two tables does it look for
HTML tags my my guess is that pinning
internally it would be nice to have a
look at the code but the way it should
look at his a table tag okay Jocelyn has
asked a question what does tables 1:1 do
the tables 1:1 is
you see here here what I am doing is
that I have got this SDR tables STR
tables is a list of two things it is
having for the first Leafs list is a
data frame of all these firsts table
that is in the webpage and the second is
for the second table in the webpage so
if we go here see this is a first table
here first table here and this is the
second table here so this is how just
like if you are ok with it that's that's
that's the thing that it is going so
tables double double that bracket 1
close double bracket is getting this
first table in the eights in the page it
is getting this first table Jos are you
clear with this explanation
so okay juice is asking can you please
execute tables 1 again so I just clean
the thing I'll write it myself
tables
so this is a wonder sir
what okay so they've GT is asking Table
one data tables one names you see let's
do it step by step actually so Table one
data I am assigning it to here okay if
if you guys remember we discussed lists
the list if you remember is to be
accessed like this let's go back to the
demo to daughter
so list is this so that table you as a
list so here if I do X here this gives
me this so x1 would give me the first
element so whenever you are in doubt
with these things please go back to the
basics actually the your demo to dot are
showed you of how you can get this I
know it can be a little bit difficult we
are learning so many things in the same
point so that's why I wanted to slow
down so that this gets to you who there
has asked one question if tables one has
stable data Voltas tables to have are
these lists good question so what it is
his dad so whenever you are faced with
all these questions for these tables one
you should first go and you know the
structure command it's a very
fundamental command it is what you
should do is that you should do a steer
tables so what it is doing is that it
gives you the structure so the first
table is this table in the database in
the web page son and the second table is
the other table in the web page so if I
go to that website if you scroll down if
you scroll down and then there is
another table here so there this is the
second table that that they are speaking
of table bracket bracket 2 is the second
table
so I think we've got we have reached to
the end of this so if you have more
questions we'll continue with this case
study and we will show step by step of
how we can get to this and scree and and
also do some manipulations on this so
from now on if there is something in a
web page and you want to get data from
that web page you know how to get it
this is how we do web scraping from the
web page if there are prices in the web
page we can get those prices there so
there are many government websites
operator websites which have prices so
this is how you can scrape through the
data and you can get this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
