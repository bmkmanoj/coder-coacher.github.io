of 21st century well in this webinar we
can find that out of course using facts
so a Gina is at the end of the session
you will be able to know why data
science is the Mossad job sort of the
job in 2015 career opportunities with
data science advantages and understands
how companies are using their sign so
that you can mole your skill sets
accordingly so data science is a very
vast domain and and and you have to
focus on certain areas if you
a string that's in most of the areas
where it ascends deals in so in that
case you'll want to line up being the
jack of all trades but I'm so sorry my
throat is battery so probably have to be
for this bad wise so why the designs is
the most sort of the job in 2015 well
let's see the answers 1400 come please
board the data science flight so with
the design strengths gaining momentum
legacy firms build up the designs teams
now let's get a salary pan left okay so
how many of those for chip 1400
companies are actually using these the
data scientists these companies
basically are using these days Angus for
certain very specific tasks so I use one
sudden and specific the reason is those
tasks or enemies you know already being
done within those organizations but the
essence was not data now they feel that
they'd data is really important and dana
has got a lot of values they want to tap
the ink the the all possible you know
breath length and breadth of the data
sets and to analyze that they need a
data scientist which is probably one
step a couple of steps I had their data
analyst now what kind of work would it
assigns to redesign this doing here
comes like that so I married a scientist
I've been working on this investor for
last six years okay of course before
then before how will actually give this
term called later scientists I've been
doing the job let me tell you the the
kind i mean the kind of transition on
singing in the industries is humongous
and transitional space is specifically
related to do in a science and billing
update a sense team now for example when
aims to work with IBM long back we were
to suppose think about delivering some
analytics at certain for certain client
so what we would do is we would look at
the data and put that in a in an IBM
SPSS or are at the time or SAS and do
certain inbuilt operations well that's
because we did not have the entire
knowledge of how we could know
across different kind of data sets and
that's when we started figuring out that
we could actually process all those data
sets I mean like the videos audios the
pdfs and so on and so forth thought we
could use that data sets and actually
standing not love a lot of sense for
example we could figure out how many
people will take leave in the next three
months just builds on the conversations
undead the chatter conversations that
has big big big jump for us because we
could then figure out what's gone what's
are you blast you want to look like so
that was one big reason of course we
still we still you know predict I still
used to predict before the advent of
Gators instead how many people are
actually going to take leave there's no
all based on intuition and on data this
time it was supported with data okay now
what could be the other reason that
these organization have started using
data science well they've seen for
example the use case for for a
particular organization that deals with
IP addresses sorry I don't push our IP
address but I be properties okay the
intellectual properties so they wanted
to see how many research papers that are
coming in in every month humming them
are actually useful and they would want
to find out first 100 which are useful
that was a great thing because that was
a great idea because that would lead to
better you know quality of white papers
or research papers so what they did
rather than asking their scientists to
actually go through all those research
papers they use data science now the
exercise that used to get completed and
roundabouts month time takes couple of
hours let's say you GU jump because then
because you could use those use those
those sinus for something more
meaningful
now second is unlist get a salary band
left so we see how how the Saudis have
one up let's begin USM and any other in
bangalore and mumbai or in pune again
really sorry my voice is really battery
so tops expected jobs in the stick here
in the US well in the taxi in a tech
market video game designer is the
highest-paid guy i'll even compare it
with a software engineer google a guy
with a game video game design
capabilities in nvidia re you know or EA
sports but make far more money than
anyone second was data scientist as a
just seen a projected growth of 18.7
percent sustainability constant our
consultant solar sales consultant social
media managers and wind turbine
mechanical ingenious now how one good
thing is that the other guys are the
guys who are making good money are
actually from this my mental backgrounds
that's good that's good for us but in
the ID job I mean in the IP when I say I
di also include the analytics are also
glee the development that goes wrong so
I basically include I would say computer
software data scientist is one of the
highest paid jobs if I compare it to
video game designer if I compare it to
trading algorithm guy if I compare it to
the investment banker a hedge funds
hedge fund analyst so all them they make
more in a moment and a data scientist
but eventually what you've seen is all
of them have started using some or the
other kind of data science concepts so
it means that is actually going to jump
all over those particular kind of rules
and probably become the highest-paid job
in the industry not just in the industry
when I say not just me I near the
industry in fact any kind of job d
resilience would probably become the
hottest possible scale of the market
so then assign this ice salaries for as
us so if you look at the secondary side
the h1 filings what 2081 and did a
scientist average build salary was
104,000 then some in the in texas and
you know that is every X I think it
seems like ur 61,000 and number of
estrogen feelings were 29 then if you
look at the eastern side salad is again
on the high side but that's more with
the inside we find people working on
more of Epidemiology so they are more
specific kind of people and then on the
not silence again around 65,000 so the
rain is sixteen thousand two hundred and
thousand of course the one with 16,000
zero action or data scientists in most
cases the post is a misnomer for example
if you go on linkedin you will see that
so many people are are so many people
say that they did a scientist but they
actually have been working in in QA or
in you know o or NR or n software
development for the last 10 15 years in
the surgeons are calling themselves as
data scientist so that isn't help so
let's look at the median salaries are
now 94 k which is probably enough on
high side if you look at that way
millions Sally needed 6 21 thousand
rupees which is not great but still it's
okay i mean i can tell you people
definitely and much more than that much
much more than that um if you look at if
you look at all the total pay kind of a
thing in units ranging from 63 65 213
756 nothing these are a bit opportunity
numbers really or in fact they are not
currently about to all the right-hander
of data scientist i think i think it's
about a it's not in the range of 150 if
you are a good data scientist with a
good understanding of AI n ml
I hope my wises missus is I don't
understand difficult construe but
instead it make sense so let's decode
what is data science so redesigns is the
study of extraction of knowledge from
data it includes waiting elements
machine learning computer programming
mathematical skills visualization
pattern recognition and data engineering
so I will call it pattern recognition
part of machine learning only and I'll
call machine learning and pattern
recognition a part of computer
programming only okay I don't call
computer programming machine learning
and pert pattern recognition a part of
data engineering and I'll call
visualization machine learning computer
programming pattern recognition part of
data engineering i would add one more
skill which is domain expertise so guy
with experience in epidemiology would
you would be much better than a guy with
i'm not better but then it would be much
different to a guy who comes in from a
background of insurance finance right
both of them are Dina scientists but
it's not that he can swap these two guys
and ask them to do each other's work
it's not possible right new designs
practitioners they assign this okay so
we both study stations domaine ste
commentator time facing our days
programmers yeah so I would say a data
scientist is a guy who could who knows
how to use tasks vanilla Gotham who
knows how to code the logarithm apply
that to a logic and make it presentable
that's just a guess at this guy ok now
let's in Gotham stats program doing it
all applies to what data it all applies
to data that means you should also the
skill set in to to know how to manage
data so it could be big data in case if
it's really dodge so he needs to have
skills on regular programming
if there is not huge of it if it's
really sparse they should know how to
optimize your sets the data is again
let's say huge but it also has a variety
that means you should know sin lobbies
which would which could be used in order
to you know take whatever is there in in
files with different kind of formats
career path Starsky modeling and
technical aptitude business acumen
programming deliver housing and business
intelligence okay i would say be i ended
up a housing probably are not that
important you should know the set of
skills you should know how to how to use
it you should know how to massage it so
when i say it's not important but it
does not mean you should not you know
you should not aim to have that skill of
course can and you should also sequel if
you know sequel that's like sequels i'd
be basic you know a basic building block
of redesign listen skill set you know
architecture programming when
programming is is it's not that you need
to be a programmer to develop an
application think of a case where you're
developing your solving a problem on a
dataset and you come up with her let's
say a partial differential equation so
it could be a case where you cannot
solve it partial differential equation
within the system or within within
within a paradigm of a copy or a pen
right so you probably need to know how
to code that thing in order to solve
that problem next is business acumen
well business acumen is settling upon
that's pretty much solemn as to what
domain experiences statistical modeling
and technical aptitude so statically
modeling is by far the most important
part so if you aspire to become a little
later scientists you got to the courses
in stats that's like that's like really
really important then you got job roles
business ireland's data analyst data
scientist julie data scientist decisions
artists so business analyst is pretty
much same kind of guy you dealt with you
know
business and less other ones would
collect data put that in the next cell
bring some reports close it close and
I'm not with business and come up with
an answer data analyst again I think
other guys who probably would not be so
close to business but what's still be
doing some something or the other on the
data sets probably smaller data sets we
talk about decision scientists and their
scientists so what exactly could be the
set of terms you know referring to here
I mean what is it assigned as one of the
decisions I this honestly speaking I
think both of them are pretty much same
guys but i did a sentence also need to
be you know Sammy with with larger data
management which could be potentially
big data and and you know a lot scale
machine learning and all that a
dissonance and is the one I'm sorry who
is who's like super small at star six
and Laura thumbs and knows how to churn
of a number which could be decisive in
taking a decision so that's more of a
decision Alice I would say I stats every
guy is a decision scientists are
programming having a you know a platform
Emma guy what starts of cause is a data
scientist so advantages of the designs
descriptive analytics diagnostic
analytics predictive analytics
prescriptive analytics and what you see
is basically a optimization process
optimization evaluation okay so
prescriptive analytics what in the world
could be prescriptive right if it's not
reactive or what in the world could be
predictive if it's not diagnostic and
what could be diagnostic if it's not
descriptive so what it means here is
we've got a data sets first of all we
decide define what data set is what are
its boundary is one are the descriptions
part that Yosef example what is the
quartile range what is this a
correlation what is the summary what is
the median mode dollar blah blah blah
then we can figure out what could the
reasons we can find the correlation of
the systems now using all that
information we can actually
figure out what will happen let's say
you want to you want to ensure that I
you want to see whether a particular set
of people in your bank are they going to
be at NP that means a non-performing
assets well you can do that seeing a
print of analytics trained for all those
guys but what if I ask you to ensure
that ninety percent of your accounts are
not NPA so in that case you have to
apply one one layer of logic above
friend Dave analytics which would be
prescriptive that means how can you make
that happen okay vantages of little
sense meaning it flows were proactive
defect detection using plaintiff
olympics machine XO see this particular
diagonal it's fine it's majorly into
fraud one biggest area in which machine
learning is now being used is customer
behavior they want to figure out how
customer behave so that they could make
the best offers they could put things
which they would probably want to buy
they could figure out what their
salaries going to look like they could
see how much tax are you gonna pay all
that thing can actually help us identify
all the reams of a customer which could
help us sour customers better across
what could be one company Kurt
discussion could be one on my rationale
guy group of guys whatever one of the
very strongly used strongly
implementable area of data science is
fraud I working for analytics and what
am i endeavoured was too sorry no one of
my endeavor was to find out whether
whether whether a particular person was
trying to make a transaction is that a
lean tryna is that particular
translation illegal or not now think of
it in this case how fast you need to
make the decision because the
transaction is not going to be you know
a whole day process a guys wanna make a
transaction I needed to ensure how we
can do that of course I had one
particular you know one particular area
in which fraud was actually
fraud was fertile antics was used and
that for a short duration of time but
then we had the problem and to be able
to solve that problem was a big
challenge plus if you saw the problem
you save millions for your
organization's each year right so just
imagine if you could do that why would
an organization not be happy to be one
few hundred thousand dollars if we can
make them save 100 millions of dollars a
year a dana sin square pot guys let me
spin some water yeah thanks for your
part so let's see the job opportunities
so let's not think about something
behind before in july 12 so that the
term actually was coined by beach party
who was actually member of how are the
winds group also at the time how are
actually came up with this concept call
i did a scientist at this time actually
and since then it's been a buzzword as
growing a kill everyone wants me data
science nowadays why you can actually
make difference you bring in some
logical difference to your organization
okay so if you see the trend its claim
you know going up I mean the zeros from
indeed com and currently the person is
growth is a thousand which is super huge
major companies using your designs that
means means yoga means hiring data
scientists are amazon honda then walmart
bank of america all the social networks
dell intel and there's so many of them
not to these are so many of them they
are doing it so if recruited a scientist
what a good career you're lying out of
you real life application let's think
about it so BMW is using predictive
analytics to find a place to park so
what they're doing is basically they're
looking at looking at the cars the car
you know plots and based on that they
are able to find out based on the
history they are able to find out
whether a parking place would be
it will be available or not ok so let's
seem start at home and you put up a
little you use a GPS you put your fine
location at at at let's say BMW office
whatever so that could tell you that
you'll not find a place to park even if
there are some bacon places and that's
and that would probably help you save
some of time because if you let's say
you don't get a parking in a particular
office than you sometimes have to take
you I mean you have to come back maybe
you search for another building which
probably normal seem lean and so on and
so forth so pleasing it's nothing but
pritam algorithms that's what that
ecommerce there I mean they are using a
big time big big big time flipkart
amazon both of them so for example if
you would flip card first of all you
have to fill in sure that what every
customer is looking for that should be
made available to that to the customer
in next 25 seconds if it cannot show the
required product to the customer in the
next 3-5 seconds the customer is most
likely not to buy it okay so then your
ensure that what customer would probably
land are buying okay that is one second
if this is this big shoes if someone
bought better Alice they are most likely
you know they've also bought carrots I
even think of it this way I'll you go to
youtube.com and you search for a video
let's say Tom Cruise now now there is
another guy or the set of guys who's
who's you know whose history on YouTube
is pretty much similar to yours and that
guy saw a video on Tom Cruise and then
jump to a video on on Tom Hanks so you
might see you may like talking about Tom
Hanks ok a video tom hanks application
of data science companies using me focus
my position repeat business simple as
that so so basically you could figure
out who could be a pretty much customer
for example we've got leaves in the
system right you know what it lead lead
is something that
convert into potential that is a
potential customer and they can finally
convert into customer if we take care of
them and provide the required things so
for any CRM based organization who have
a good understanding of the leads they
could use DNA science in order to
predict something that deals with their
customer acquisition so maybe for
example let's say you are coming that's
here that sells CRM business to you know
do to big clients and you know that
let's see a particular kind of customer
has an issue where has an issue where
let's just some kind of issue XY that
now you can use data science to figure
out someone with XYZ is going to buy a
particular kind of us a technology
solution and that is what he proposed to
decline directly which is going to give
you a high probability probability that
the client is going to buy your offering
customer churn prevention so custom Chan
is like figuring out if a customer is
going to use your a particular service
or not or they are going to drop out of
the service or not okay so for example
if my if my total is number two let's
say my total bill usage is going above
twenty percent about one hundred twenty
percent then there's no chance that I
might just know by drop of that
particular telecom you know window
that's where these companies come in
come into picture and offer you
something which will help you reduce
your bill okay that's called as customer
churn prevention by analyzing of
customer is going to leave or not tamil
well is data scientists truly the sixes
off in first century I say it's a wait
time yes because because of the quality
over most importantly Savi's are good
you get I mean obviously speaking it's
not that easy to become a real scientist
that's because it involves a lot of
skill set and it's not something that I
can someone hand each way like a matter
of hours it's it's a it's a month-long
preparation okay but of course doing
certain courses can help you get started
fasten chemical get you can get you on
on the track and from there you can pick
up your journey of becoming a data
scientist ok questions so let's lie now
time for questions let's see if you got
any okay okay so on well I've got some
five six questions here and the strength
looks like somewhere around 35 so I was
expecting more number of questions
actually um so there's a raised hand
well instead of her Ayhan reason
actually you could actually put a
question on the chat okay so let's start
10 10 I hope you guys were able to see
my screen wait it's on oops
okay so how does one become an in a
scientist well I've told you that set of
skills you actually go and watch my
video on you do also where it says I can
search my name aledo then you can see
how big of a data scientist ah anybody
concert agree that I need to pursue yes
you can go and pursue a degree of India
signs of India signs are there multiple
you know she is doing that but the
problem is what I've seen I've been
interviewing lot of data scientist for
the past couple of years from those
universities with just then I mean these
days guys have chance at the Masters and
yeah these guys were able to do these
guys have done their masters and then
they never include them what I saw a
team where they had good knowledge of
what will got them somewhat but but you
can actually figure out that if whatever
they've learned it's more of theory and
not practical so maybe I didn't get is
one good place you can start your
journey for it assigns okay feel like
you you are through the course and if
let's say you even if you grab seventy
percent of it it'll put you push put in
a place where you can take on a journey
of data scientists okay I'll say you
will not be denied this honesty but
it'll still you know it'll still bring
up to bring you up to pace in order to
accommodate a scientist in the next six
to one year six months one year I'm
sorry okay so so you can think about
that next one any particular call you so
you can actually go and do a course of
course all rights by Andrew ng but again
the problem is but the problem is they
don't really didn't really take you to
the practical part of it water tools
apart from domain knowledge a personal
snow one language is are in the other
one is Python I would say go for both of
them and try to see how we can apply
machine learning getting
using these two languages hi do any
programming knowledge you don't actually
need a programming knowledge because
it's not basically programming job it's
a job where you use a programming
language to solve your problem so you're
not developing a web application is
you're not developing anything you know
using a programming language you are
putting you're using a programming
language solve the problem which is very
I mean the simplex is in the set of
packages are very limited so it's it's
pretty easy to actually mask that thing
what are the technical competence is
required to become leaner sentence I've
already said you need to know something
in big data okay that's good to have for
example how do machine learning gonna do
but all that you could you obviously
need to have sequence q's secret
understanding r and python are the two
major building blocks you need to know
statistics lot of statistics it says
what would you give more vintage as a
skill center in it i would say bit time
data centers arabic time has 26 ok I
mean services like the building block
off designs I've been masters in many
systems but my cousin advised me let me
see that the Gopher designs course I'm
confused well that's see embarrass
systems is on other criteria so I won't
say what you're doing is is all of no
worth but it assigns see there so you're
turning into a dealer signs roll the
fact is the fact is it does not really
it's not that easy actually honestly
speaking it takes a lot time and I've
seen so many people saying that we are
data scientist but they are not data
scientists ok so if you want to go for
it assigns cause go for that but trans
don't go for the sake of the fact that
you know that better sense I've got
better opportunities go for it assigns
role only if you feel like interest in
doing something more you know more
towards math and machine learning coming
from mccrory Brandon telecom network for
legislation how he would become how
would be coming days and his most my
career
it will it will boost your career Victor
and because then you'll be able to move
into a more strategic role so that I
mean for example in telecom there are so
many applications of data science so you
could have you would have you know your
organization take important decisions
and not means on tuition so it can
certainly help required silky skills and
I've only talked about honesty you take
mm and start up and want to understand
customer behavior how should I start to
paying up before taking greater size
course very good question are Sunnis and
uh um well in richer in order to
understand as being the first understand
what or whatever it takes to understand
that what all it takes to ensure that
this is uh this is not something which
can give you answered on a magic box
first of all you need to understand what
all it will take for me to be sure the
fact that if I'm able to process all
those models that have created would
enable me to become too to help my
customer better or do let's say two or
help you understand you guys have
behaved ever true so what I'm trying to
say is let's say you you put a customer
behavior in the sender and trying
certain set of things which could help
you understand your customer be even
better then try to procure data sets
that could help you do that and finally
apply machine learning on top of it to
see if you can actually get good answers
anything you will learn yourself is you
can of course learn yourself if you
learn mathematics if you have a few know
mathematics if you don't then its
climate bit difficult and the learning
comes would be very very you know
sluggish what's the cost of living any
record of accommodation is wealth is a
course on data science itself I am the
instructor for little signs course you
can do that is put even again I don't
claim that that course will make you
later scientists okay that code is going
to give you Freddy understanding of what
did it take to sorry for you to become
designed as if
us introduction to all those things to
an extent understanding those techniques
I've been going to the depths of it to
an extent again then applying them to
all real-time data sets and see how it
works but to master all those settings
you need to focus on a lot of the things
I lot me other things and practice for
erecting six months to 21 years i have
about i have about 15 years experience
righty lastly world in Silicon by
measure for n2 and fashionably up into
his break in service due to personal
reasons can I still pursue my career by
plugging ossified hoop mln Olympics
certainly there are so many people so
many people doing that stuff okay so if
you know if can do Hadoop ml analytics
you you're a rock star action in that
case these are like 10 steps which are
in demand and they don't really care if
you have a brake rod initially when
organizations and hiring data scientists
they just wanted to have PhD folks they
just want to have PhD guys which
eventually change to people who need
want to do stuff because EG folks had
focus on certain very specific area
which they figured out is not that
helpful and that's if you know stuff
they would hire you in printed modeling
re-design just recorded over the own
angle of course you can develop your own
you'll know you can use premal two
algorithms also what always you need to
learn known before we can go for cloud
for data scientists I don't know floral
design certification is more with big
data actually they don't talk that much
in do they don't talk that much about
SATA 6 clouded eyes a pure pure pure
bigger organization they started with
the first version Hadoop firstly flavor
of loop outside the Apache 91 native ah
do so they are I qualify them more as a
bit later complained not a science what
would be the best curriculum for
innocence course well lunch at six
statistical learning ml then that's one
then you sequel that's rather that
second and then of course a course on
your bday down
I'm kind of working on Java over the six
years can I move in to date sighs well
of course you can but the question is do
you really understand stuck you really
want to understand stockist artistics
not okay you can actually become a
dentist I can suggest the defense
approach is Joanna course join a course
which talks about it assigns then
practice a lot of design stuff once you
are done with the course are draining
good move for statistics yes one is from
stanford laguna de which is a course on
statistical learning by rakesh run en
travesty that course is like the best
courses but the problem is if your
nearest aisle six I do not make sense to
you and unless you do that cause at
least 10 * no certificate could help you
give you better could help you give some
kind of recognition directly in any
interview you you land up in so you need
a sign in sorrow you find people from
really smart backgrounds taking your
interview it's not like a Java interview
in your ID form or something like that
they want people to know stuff they
don't really care if you cut a
certificate not if I had to learn on my
own way to start with will be machine
learning well you can start learning but
only one for sure and I would say start
with starts 36 I know a Reuben Java can
I kicks can kick some korean air signs
of course you can send thin will sorry
if that's a wrongful incision of your
name that's because you already know one
part of it now we need to get your hands
dirty with statistics and machine
learning it seems like all the questions
are now over you got any more questions
we've got 20 more minutes for this
webinar let me know if you've got some
more questions
guys any more questions okay um so I
would say please look put in your
feedback and thank you so much for
joining this webinar if you've still got
some questions I can still take them
okay I see there are some reasons rather
than raising hands i would say ok
there's so many of them now why so i am
into analytics about facing problems in
statics what should I do ok thing is
again I'm retreating that it starts it's
not trivial status thinks of course
statistics does not really it is not
really a you know gets down to your mind
so easily and the only way to learn it
is read it again and again and again
okay and try to see how and try to video
data sets and see how it gives you a
different solution that's it this way
that's the way I have learned it so if I
wanted I said I would go and change that
in points in that data I don't see how
it will behave okay you mean are in
patterns machine language ESR and
patterns machine learning languages so r
is purely for some modeling so static
modeling statistical learning machine
learning definitely much the same term
right yeah used sometimes with the
different labels and all but you can
certainly go for a machine learning are
you can something call that as machine
learning of subsonic can you share some
good content for basic data science you
get good hands-on start with n 2 n G
culture that's what you want the easy
understanding books for star six there
is no easy understanding the best book
is
in Russian to statistical learning by
Travelocity and optically the order any
place where designs network like 4am of
beta well there's one it's called data
science central Winston Garn well as
there is a co-founder for a so you can
you can certainly go and do some
networking go there but that does really
help honestly speaking apart from the
course what we have to do well you'll
get loads of case studies so you can go
and work on those case studies any
specific topics to be in the status
click course yes sanskar learning is the
branch of statistics union work on the
branch called design of experiments okay
this there's a branch called native
learning all that is power of statistics
statistics and all that is part of data
science also so you can start with basic
statistical learning that involves
regression classification and regression
through different techniques like linear
longing nonlinear you're late works at
all can you provide some links to gather
more information about a design is I
don't really understand what is meant by
more information if you want more
information on more information on only
design so let me give you a link to my
youtube channel you'll find a lot of
things were there
okay so I've seven to one of you I IBM
or music model which should i join
that's a question here too I can ranjan
actually I don't know I don't know what
kind of profile you're offering you so
that's not a question I should be
answering here and it provides some
links to gather more information for the
designs done that what sanford course on
stands very referring to the course is
statistical learning by Travelocity
wrapped ishani rob tashera here let me
put right on
okay then wanted to learn something with
some of our advanced concepts well
you've taken a course from Metallica
which was very very less basic for
bigger I don't know when editing that
cause when i die i take this course i
teach things like support vector machine
no neural network deep learning takes
analytics in Python machine learning
with Mahad and connecting to our and
economy are in a loop and solving a
problem with our loop everything all
that is basic but I think then I should
go and start working on a deep learning
it want to learn something with Reliance
concepts I don't know what advances if
you reckon support vector machines and
you networks as trivial I think you're
only be part of machining cause so you
should go and learn about as I said a
deep learning I've already said the name
of the book okay let me put it again
bouquets introduction to statistical
learning by rakesh Ronnie flower st what
about SAS sizes again huh but it's a
great platform for data analytics but I
mean for machine learning for advanced
machine learning it's not that great
plus if present song orbits its
proprietary it's not open source for
data visualization yes they're at wounds
like d3 okay you can use are you can use
shiny as since I NY shiny apart from
three what kind of practical should be a
clue well the particles are like oh it's
nothing but its case study is right so
you have to solve problems you still
should start solving problems regarding
status 6v no linear regression on
innovation trust unity as human frost X
and X modulo what this stuff I see the
concepts are going to see him the idea
is going to be different how would you
move up something so that you can apply
let's say something like someone went to
machines on top of it ok that's a good
route to machine is a very complex or
concept it's not true at all right so
you think about what variations of
someone wrecked ocean is going to be
more helpful in a scenario that's where
it gets tricky well I guess we done with
all the questions if you think I've made
you question can you put it again in the
list for me the list is complete right
now i think in case you make missed
something uh oh and if everything
happens your question can you please put
it again okay so there's a hand raised
he could you could ask the question
directly in the questions window then I
see what art will use for data cleaning
well there I directly first of all is
not part of redesigns that's more of
data warehousing rid of massaging part
but for today cleaning of what I've used
is I use a DQ mention which is called
data quality manager and I've used it in
a bit at a high of HIV you can also use
a informatica for that all this one
informatica MDM muscle management which
is used for d duplicating in and
misogyny de plus there are some there's
some implication techniques
ok which could be used to to clean it
down any more questions or is that we're
done yes no if you're done we can
actually close on session I live in from
the couple of minutes for you to all the
questions or that i'll close yes now
okay thank you so much for running in I
hope you had our informative session in
case you want to come with me I'm there
on linkedin my name is Anna wrote the
color a tired eh que le concurrently
with me connect with me on there and
i'll be happy to answer queries thank
you so much for joining in bye bye and
take care I'll get still take 20 so
let's probably are wait for another
couple of minutes if you've got a
question
okay oh so we do have certain equations
how does a model when a model could be
judged on multiple things well first of
all what kind of model are you building
areas is a regression model is the
clustering either is a classic
classification model a glance efficient
model has got multiple multiple managing
parameters a regression model has got
multiple version parameters also try to
see what is the abstraction limit for a
for a particular model so what I mean by
that is what i mean by that is let's say
you're trying to solve the problem and
you're trying to make your model learn
from a particular kind of a dataset but
the thing is you really think a
particular a particular a particular
problem could only have a restricted
convert in a sec it could be exposed to
multiple variants you know paradigms in
a particular dataset so when I what I
mean is the rain set can change really
fast and the best way to elect to see
that whether you are whether you are
whether you're a particular whether your
particular model is able to match up
that variance actually is a good measure
of your mole performance as I join late
can I have a people against you can have
the Peabody no problems I'll put it on
one side you can we get a job only
learning are known as it a scientist I'm
sorry I don't think anyone would give
you a job just on the basis of being are
modular how did you model whether it is
a prick think I to correctly so it's
pretty simple right you always have a
testing center test data sets where you
already know the answer but you put it
on that data set and then you compare
with the actual answers to see how
you're doing what about okay that
central person landing a right job I am
NOT free sure about
I'm not really sure about that actually
fit trees you see reviews and use we are
assuming i I've known in that I'm not
too sure I'm not saying they don't but
I'm not too sure they really help doing
that you can actually has it question to
support and Anna Drakkar questions
getting
do we need to do ahead of course for it
a scientist I think it's a good one if
you go for a hard of course it's a good
idea actually but I don't think that's
mandatory okay so i would say you should
be good at I mean one of these begins we
call someone a date ascending should
know how to leave the big data sets that
if he does not he cannot actually come
up with more accurate results which
which are posh wouldn't call them larger
in assets right so so I would say yes
it's a good thing to have but not
penalty for sure any more questions I'm
here questions okay there's another one
wait be helpful doing designed course in
the US certainly we have because because
there are so many people who are
shifting the career in data science just
by being in US and doing a course or it
assigns can you suggest some sites where
we can practice analytics and Bill
Taylor concepts well one of the sites
one side is my own company topcoder she
can go to top coder and you will find so
many little challenges that you can that
you can you know participate in we did I
am creative analytics challenges then in
parts my den and those are actually the
industry problems okay so that really
makes that merely makes you kind of work
or at st problem directly then anyone
called Kaggle ka GG array are there any
dinners data exploded tools or packages
yes there are so many of them in our
whereas there is HMS HMIS see there is
Latins there is Gigi clues for
visualization so many of them so I don't
go for exploratory tools as such move
from language like our or Python first
can you please spell it out which one
shunt or so what does question topcoder
okay let me do that is it paddler no
it's topcoder am so sorry if my
pronunciation was not cleared yeah
questions yeah top coat exactly so I'm
imparted redesign steamer top coder and
we we run sewing challenge or little
things every couple of weeks yep any
more questions any more questions guys
well you can asking Jax Academy
rating but that's a company what do you
think I'll say they're bad honestly
speaking I have no idea okay you can go
and look at the causes for sure but I
have absolutely no idea for how good or
bad they are questions oh okay what are
the steps one should use while analyzing
the properties as well let's that's a
very big on sorry oh I cannot give the
answer right here well one first the
first and foremost important step is
killing the data cleaning it I mean once
I cleaning it's like imputing the data
okay then preparing the dealership so
basically you do not a feature
engineering directionally reduction
finding the eigen vectors find
eigenvalues you know d normalizing the
DA is none other than data sets put in
more create more columns create more
logical ideas create more logical in
assets and then apply machine learning
algorithm see how it does apply another
machine learning algorithm see how it
works again let's say three or five of
them try to tease think of an ensemble
that can do that then tweak the data
sets as per the request by the trade in
the virus variance and then test it on
you and your data sets that's how it
normally goes but then that's very very
well that's very very uh on the high
level what is the salary range for
incentives as a fresher I think in the
US it's around 75,000 and in turn you
have to solder to nine thousand dollars
india around eight to relax okay so guys
it seems i give they're almost done with
the medieval are now just one month left
so late in a few putting question left I
can't answer that
close of other questions how did machine
another algorithm suits our recent
experience and see what it is good at
okay for example a steam works best with
the pics datasets support vector
machines why there's a big reason for it
okay any more questions most welcome
thank you so much bye and take care
