what's the critical path method first
I'm on slide 21 which is critical giving
us the indication of critical path
factors now this is the slide where you
will have to pay a full attention on the
screen and let me know where ever you
wanted to know or further detail on the
critical path method this is very
important for you to carefully
understand on the critical path method
okay the first thing first the
representation of activities in a
critical path method is done in the form
of a block you guys are with me
look at this block number one the block
which says task a so task a is a
particular job that's a particular
activity which is going to take six days
okay so task a is going to take six days
task B is going to take a this task a is
going to take nine days thus f is going
to take five this so that's how there
are six tasks defined here let us look
at from the perspective of this block
itself if you remember what we
of the bout is early start early finish
late start late finish these are the
terms what we have used in this critical
path method okay and there are two more
terms what we need to use it here and
those terms are forward pass and a
backward pass okay
forward pass and backward pass so first
your attention must go to this block
which I'm trying to highlight okay so
your full attention must go to this
block first and why I'm actually
repeating this block is that let us
first understand about this block and
then we'll move forward from here okay
focus on this circle what I have just
run so let us put back the attention
onto this circle the points what you
to notice that I am actually now telling
you the syntax of this block that means
the template what this block is gonna
talk about the two things written in the
mid of the block
the first is generally the activity name
which is the task a the second is the
amount of second is the amount of float
available here that means what is the
time to complete this activity so always
when you have a rectangle like this in
the network diagram remember the first
item in the center is called as the
activity name which is task a the second
item is called amount of float which is
mentioned as six days in this block now
the second item on the block
put attention to the forward pass
forward pass means we are going into a
forward direction from one to six is
called as forward pass from 13 to 20 is
called as a forward pass from 22 to 26
is called forward pass for our pass
means we are going into the forward
direction from start to end from start
to end that is what is forward pass
meaning so that means we'll start with
the first we'll start with the first
activity here
the first task and we'll reach back to
the last activity which is called finish
the es stand for early start
EF stands for early finish LS stands for
late start and L F stands for late
finish got it so when I talk about a
forward pass that would mean that I will
move from early start to early finish
that is what is known as the forward
pass if I go in this direction that is
forward because I'm going from start to
end now what is backward pass backward
pass has something if I travel back by
the late finish to the late start it is
in this reverse direction are you
getting me okay let me draw another
picture for you if I'm going in
correction then this is called as the
forward pass when I'm going from early
start to early finish and when I'm going
into the reverse direction which is late
finish late finish to late start this is
called as the backward pass so the arrow
on the top is actually the forward pass
arrow arrow on the below the block is
actually a backward pass ok you are
clear till this stage so now you
understand on the four things what we
have mentioned on the block and these
four things are early start where an
early start is shown as the day one
there are times when this is taken up as
a day zero also it's depending on what
nomenclature you follow so in this
example we are following up a
nomenclature of day one so that means
the task is gonna take six days early
start for the task is a 1 early finish
is 6 so the corner portion of this task
we are going to write down the early
start and early finish the late finish
and late start for this task is
available to us here so this is the
information which is available to us and
how we have to fill up where this
information is I will guide you now so
let me first
let me first now repeat what
shared with you the task a is the
activity name that is the amount of lot
this task has which are six days es is
early start EF is early finish LS late
start LF late finish so the same
template the same kind of legend is
going to be used in each of the other
blocks what we have talked about let me
now give you some practical example of
how to create the early start how to
create the early finish and this example
would also clear you on certain
definitions the purpose of the critical
path method is the purpose which helps
us to identify how early an activity can
be started and how fast an activity can
be completed that is the purpose of that
is the purpose of the this activity okay
now the there is a question by one of
the participants saying can I know on
the detailing or the definition of the
early start and early finish and stuff
sure and this is a very simple as the
the full form of these names itself and
the early start means what is the best
time earliest available for us to start
is known as the early start what is the
earliest time I can finish a task is
known as early finish and the another
thing is what is the late start that
means how late that means how long
should I be holding up to a particular
task is called as the latest
it finishes again how long can i delay
how long can I actually delay on a
particular activity that is called late
finished so early start early finish
late start late finish got it now let me
tell you in giving the indication of how
should we start the activity because
till now what I have covered is that I
have only explained you the clock which
is the first block now you are at you
are clear and the nomenclatures which
are used in each of the blocks so if I
give an example of task e so you guys
know it very clearly that Serta's II
which is the activity name nine days is
the flow time available here and then
there is an early start and early fresh
let's start and early finish let me now
explain this chart in further detail and
that would be the time I think a lot of
your queries would get answered and then
I will take up the remaining questions
okay so that's the way we will move from
here so you must know how to draw the
critical path method remember with the
help of this diagram the purpose we need
to have is we need to look at the
scheduling we need to look at the delays
what can be introduced if there is a
need and we need to also find out which
is the critical path in this example if
you look at from the start there are two
possibilities I can actually go by our
task a task B task C task F and finish
that is the one path available to me to
complete the job
the second path available for me is
start tasks me task V task a task F and
finish so if I have to reached to the
finish stage I need to complete both the
processes which is the process which
starts from the sequence which starts
from start task a task B task C task F
and finish that is one and the second is
start task D task because e task F
finish the way the calculation of the
critical path has done is that you would
write if I have to look at the two parts
which are going to be available here the
first path which is available to means a
path which starts from activity a then
starts from activity B then starts some
activity C then starts from activity F
so that's the path one I am not writing
any other thing I'm saying star path one
this is start a B C F and finish okay so
that's path 1 and what is path to
available to me here is start
I have task B I have task B I have task
E I have task F and finish are you guys
with me till here so these are the two
options before I add up some more
options
the
she's available in this fathers start
let me write down this as a path 3 after
start I'll go to task a from a I will go
to task B from B I have an option to
look at the task e the task F and n
which is finish okay that's another path
now let me bring up another path and the
next path what you can look at us start
from start
I can see task D task B task C task F
finish
okay so now what you have understood is
that in the given Network diagram in the
given Network diagram the four options
what I have created to give you an idea
of how the critical path is gonna be
calculated I have seen before
different paths which we have to pass
through to reach through the finish
stage and what we need to now do is we
need to now sum up and add the total
time needed for a particular path so we
will calculate what is the total number
of days needed for finishing each of the
tasks as defined in V as defined in the
respective paths so let me first look at
the path a what is the time needed for
pathways that I will add up activity a
which has six days activity B which has
five six plus five is eleven activity C
which is a this 11 plus 8 is 19 then
comes F which is five days so path path
one becomes about 24 days so that's the
estimation on the time for us on the
path for the first activity now let us
look at the path which is gonna be
available for the activity two and
activity three and activity fourth now
the activity tours starts from the D
seven days seven and then five which is
task B e comes nine this is seven plus
five plus twelve twelve plus 9 21 21 and
five 26 which is 26 days the third
we have us start a which is six B which
is five that means 11 P which is nine
that means 11 plus nine 20s which is
five that means 25 so we have 25 days
and the fourth which we have as the path
for the path for what we defined is it
start and B D means seven days then
comes B B means 5 days 7 plus 5 is 12
then comes C 12 plus 8 is 20 and then
comes F which is 5 so that means 25 days
now if you look at this example what we
have done as we thought we would
identify the critical path out of the
various paths available in this network
diagram and now the by the definition of
a critical path means that's the
critical path means it is the longest
path in the network diagram with the
earliest and the latest and activity can
start so that means my start time and
end time of the project would primarily
be defined by the critical path date and
time and the critical path date and time
the point which will have to notice that
the path is critical because any delay
on the activities on a critical path
would lead to a delay in the overall
project remember we are into the process
group which is the planning we are into
the knowledge group area which is known
as project time management and what we
are doing this now is since we have to
develop a schedule and in order to
develop a schedule we are trying to look
at how fast how late
how early we can start and finish a
particular activity that is the purpose
of this exercise and with the help of
this diagram we are trying to analyze
and find out which is the longest path
available for us so the longest path
available to us now is path to becomes
the longest path okay which is B B E and
F so the longest path available to us
now is the path which is there at the
bottom which is the path number two what
we talked about and if I have to explain
if I have to highlight that path so I
would say the critical path is actually
here so this is what is the critical
path when we are actually going through
the task D task B task D task B task a
task F okay now some more things on this
which is a forward pass and the backward
pass now we know that the activity is
going to take six days time and for a
particular moment please assume that the
amount the value returned in each of
those blocks is empty just assume that
there is no value written in this block
so how we start writing down the forward
pass is that once we have identified the
critical path which is d b e f d v e f
so that is the way to start so first we
need to start filling up the block which
is the block task D Y task DS because
that is the first activity in the
critical path so we start filling up the
forward pass by the
activity on Tuscany first activity in
this net of the RAM which is task B so
since this task is going to take several
days so I have written one here and
seven this side okay one here and seven
this side would very clearly mean what
that day one I'm going to start this
activity day seven is the early finish
and then we'll move on to the second
task in this network diagram by the
critical path which is B in B we know
this activity is going to take five days
so what we have done is we have done the
calculation here that this activity
starts on day a and if you try to do a
calculation manually a 2 9 10 11 and 12
so on the fifth day on the first day
this activity is completing in which is
the early start and the early finish of
this activity that means this cannot
start before big 12 now the next path
critical path for us as II which is here
and this numbering will continue from
the last where we left 12 we have
written 13 and this task is like nine
days so 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 and 21 9
days here this task can be finished off
by the 21st day and then we'll move on
to the fourth task which is task F look
at Billy 6 days because keV and we will
put up the 22 to 26 so the way we will
start this numbering yes it will
actually start from the critical path
and the critical path now I have
highlighted back in the red color for
your convenience so that is the way we
will find out a critical path now by the
way of the critical path
and what we have now done is that we
have identified the critical path we
have now also done the forward pass and
for our parts means early start to early
finish we first we have first finished
up the block which is the block which is
the task D and if I have to tell you
whatever we have finished till now on
the critical path has that let me put up
a small arrow for us to notify that we
have completed this correct we have
completed task B correct we have
completed the task
E and the forth which we will have come
which we have completed as the task F so
the task where and I am putting these
four dots is the task where in we have
completed the forward pass the next
thing what we should do is that we
should complete the forward pass for the
remaining paths so let us start with the
path 1 which is path 1 is start ABC F
but we need to note here is that the
task a was needing six days so early
start and early finish six six now is
one thing which you need to pay
attention to remember by the time the
task B is starting up it is going to
start up
we ate today however we have the task a
getting completed in the day six so that
means there is a gap between the eight
and a six there is a one day gap why one
day gap is because task three was
requiring the seven days which is the
critical path method so this is like the
task a now carries a one day buffer
which is known as float so the one is
mentioned here which gives us an
indication of the float available for
this activity that means that is the one
day kind of time available for the
purpose of you sure doing certain things
or if you want to delay an activity you
want to wait for this is the one day
available to you as the float
so the time which is a free float means
a time and activity can be delayed
without delaying the early starts of the
next activity okay now you are getting
the definition of free float free float
is also known as slack SL ACK slack so
if we follow this diagram I will repeat
the definition the amount of time we can
delay an activity without delaying the
early start of the next activity so that
means I can delay the activity task a
for one day because they if this
activity is going to start there six the
task is go and so one day of buffer is
actually available here and then I'm
actually doing the numbering of the
early start and early finish when I'm
putting up the value remember this value
there is a circle here that means I have
already finished this value so it is
already mentioned here one so six you
can mention because task is almost like
six days but here I will not write the
seven because I have already killed a
based on the critical path that one day
I am mentioned here so I will remember
the why we're putting this one that
means there is a one-day float available
to me now I will move forward from task
to task B and then to task C now
remember one thing the task C says this
was going to be completed in eight days
so what I need to do is I need to pick
up the timing from the previous task
which was getting serious of on 12th so
13th day I can start up the activity C
and I can run this activity till thus
activities for eight days so 13 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 so the stars will be the
early finish list for this task is 20
now if I move further on the task F
remember the task he is gonna take nine
days time task AC is going to take at
this time so that means there is a one
day float available for you because the
next task is gonna start only on day
22nd right guys so what you need to now
understand is that if I follow this
methodology that is how I will fill up
the top portion of the block which is
early start to early finish which is
also known as forward bus so what I've
explained to you now as I've explained
to you on the floor I have explained to
you on the forward pass now let us start
and work on the backward pass backward
fast I told you when we move from the
late finish to late start he's called as
the backward pass and what we need to do
is we need to start the backward pass
from the critical path again critical
path has start DV e F finish so let me
start with this so the total time what
we have calculated was 26 so 26 is
written here this task was requiring
five days so we are going reverse now
which is a backward pass from 20s
2:22 the fighters have been consumed we
come back next activity is gonna take
nine days so from 20 to the next
available time is 21
- nine days becomes 13 which is late
start and likewise we'll have done the
backward pass till the activity D which
is the first activity so we we need to
finish the backward past again on the
critical path first and then the same
backward pass can be finished on the
remaining paths so this is what the
critical path method is all about and
now let me remove all the arrows for you
for the fairer understanding okay
so by completing the picture on the
screen now you have what I got in a
dress standing on the four different
paths which are available for us and we
talked about something called as the
forward pass backward pass early start
early finish late start late finish we
talked about floats free float is
something which you have witnessed in
the calculation what we just did in this
diagram that is called as free float the
free float for this is one day available
in this activity the second day
available in this activity and this is
primarily I believe the path a carries a
two days plot path three carries a one
day float path four carries a one day
float looking at the number of this you
can take a judgement and then you can
correlate back to the actual activity
wherein you will have that time
available this is going to be very much
important because the free the free free
float is something we can make use of at
a later stage when the project is
running out of scheduled project is
running in scheduled project as a head
project is delayed every such
understanding would matter for you in
order to reach to the conclusion okay so
what we have
we have drawn the corpus we have drawn
the backward pass we have also seen the
critical path and we know that critical
path has 26 days here
one very important point which you must
understand and absorb in your mind is
that critical path carries zero flawed
that means there cannot be any flaw in
the critical path remember there could
be questions around that a critical path
critical path will not have the free
buffer critical path will not have the
flawed okay so that's with zero flawed
so the way you have walked out this
diagram is we have moved in the critical
paths sequence first we have gone from a
forward pass then we have written back
as in backward pass and forward and
backward pass by going through the
forward and backward pass we have
actually filled in the early start early
finish late start late finish on this so
by doing this we are now getting to know
that which is the critical path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
