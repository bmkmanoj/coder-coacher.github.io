Rica and welcome to this SSRS tutorial
session so without wasting any time
let's move forward and look at today's
agenda now we'll begin the session by
first understanding why do we need data
visualization and what exactly is data
visualization because these things
contribute to the fundamentals of the
need for SSRS then we'll talk about why
SRS and what exactly is Microsoft sequel
server reporting source
ok so therein you get an understanding
as to why use SSRS over the other tools
and what exactly it is going on from
there we'll talk about the sequel server
reporting service architecture the
reporting lifecycle as well as will be
seen three major types of reports
today's session so we will be working on
on the practical aspect as to how you
can build a report in Microsoft sequel
server so I hope you guys are definitely
looking forward to what this session can
I get a quick confirmation in the chat
box okay I've heard a confirmation from
everyone seems everyone is excited for
today's session so without wasting any
time let's move forward and try to
understand why do we need visualization
now if you look at the image to the
right this is the amount of data that
gets generated every minute that is in
60 seconds okay and the data has been
compared with respect three years that
is 2013 2014 and 2015
again although the amount of email that
has been sent between 2014 and 15
remains almost same but when you see
with respect to different social media
you can see the variation that comes in
in 2013 there are close to over 80,000
posts but again in 2014 it reach to 2.5
2015 gave you 3.3 million as well
similarly there's variation with respect
to all social medias that you can see
across now here again you can see with
respect to Google there's been almost
double the amount of searches over the
years Instagram also is one of the most
popular platform where it has a huge
growth as well same time with respect to
Twitter WordPress and so forth so all
this data is with respect to a single
second in these three years now you need
to understand how much data gets
generated from all these platforms
okay in today's world we generate close
to point five quintillion bytes of data
that's a very huge set of data but for
you to understand what this data
computes to or what it means we need to
get it into a visual format and the
logic behind that is quite simple that
is our eyes to see faster than what we
can read and understand because again
it's mainly how the human body is being
decided okay to give you a rough idea
maybe the human eye can process
something close to the speed of light
okay so that's roughly about eight
megabytes of data per second but when we
talk about reading let's say if you're
reading even 120 words let's consider
each word to be a single byte as well
then it's only about 120 bytes per
second so you see the difference here
don't you so the main purpose of
visualization is to help a human mind or
any individual understand the process
data better now this is same with
respect to all of us
if I just throw rough numbers at you
would not be able to understand that but
let's say if I tell you the same detail
let's it's a sales data where I give you
different numbers or different quarters
then you may be still not quite sure but
if I show it you in a graphical
representation let's say I do it in a
line chart or a bar chart then you would
get a complete insight you will
understand which quarter has performed
better which quarter is gone down where
it has gone down where you need to
emphasize and better for so I hope you
guys are clear as to why we need
visualization okay that's great
so now that you've understood why we
need visualization let's go in depth and
try to understand what exactly is data
visualization data visualization
basically is a wish we'll access to the
data that we have now a well-designed
graph again as we have talked about it
does not just refer to a graph it could
be a report it could be a chart and so
forth any visual representation of a
data is always the simplest as well as
the most powerful form of representation
as an analyst it's quite easy for me to
understand numbers because I've been
used to it I've been working on numbers
since I started up but at the same time
let's say if I need to give some
information to my boss with respect to
the business then it is always best that
I give him it no issue
Chuck now this is not just my saliva
this is something that all of you can
relate to I'm quite sure okay Henry
agrees with me so does James now it's
great now again this is something that
everyone faces on a regular charge so
again data visualization is a visual
representation of the data which makes
it easy for you to understand and
process it okay but then your question
should be is which are the data
visualization tools in the market now
talking about the data visualization
tools you have a lot of STEM present in
the market at present okay you have our
which mainly is used by analytics you
have click view and click cents which is
again a visualization tool you have
power bi which is a Microsoft tool as
well apart from your sequel server you
have Microsoft sequel server and you
also have Python which is now being used
some extent visualization so as well as
tableau as such now again these are all
the available visualization tools in the
market at present but why do you need to
go with sequel server reporting service
that is Microsoft sequel server now
talking about the major reasons as to
why Microsoft sequel server these are
some of the four major reasons firstly
is because of the standard Microsoft
development environment now again when I
say Microsoft standard development
environment this is a standard
environment to which you complete data
is being processed now to give you a
simple understanding those of you who
are not familiar with Microsoft sequel
server it basically consists of three
tools you have Microsoft sequel server
integration service which deals with the
integration of data from different
sources you have Microsoft sequel server
analytical service which help you with
the analysis of this data and then you
have Microsoft sequel server reporting
service now if you are using the
Microsoft complete sequence server
product line then there is a complete
insure 'ti with respect to the quality
as well as the standard of data that
you're working now again this basically
computes to a huge standardization that
comes with respect to your overall
process which you may not seem with
respect to other tools now let's say
you're using a different tool like
tableau or
power bi then you're just taking your
data from a single source a multiple
source as per your requirement but again
there may be certain quality checks that
you need to perform you need to check
for inconsistencies and so forth but
again
when you're working on sequel server
reporting service there is a standard
process because you are already using
the same data with respect to other
services and then you're working with it
so definitely this data would have met
all these quality checks before you work
with it okay now coming down to the
second point that is the mobile support
now this is something that's quite
majorly useful because when we talk
about how easy it is to publish a report
and view it as well so again when you
publish a report it goes onto your
browser so anyone who wants to view it
even it's on the mobile application all
they need to do is just have the URL on
which the report is published and they
can be able to put so there by making it
quite easy for you to share your report
as well as quite easy for anyone to view
it now let's say my boss is in the US
and he suddenly needs a specific report
from my side for presenting the client
so all he has retired me is me make this
report from this data then once I have
prepared this I can publish it and just
give him the details of the report so
then wherever he is he can view it
without any problems as such so mobile
support is a major factor with respect
to any visualization - now again talking
about another product of Microsoft that
is Microsoft power bi there and if you
download the application of power bi
onto your phone then you can also view
sequel server reports there as well so
this is a major advantage that Microsoft
has been providing okay are you guys
clear over the first two points
okay our detail has a question here our
detail is asking me will power bi
replace exercise okay
definitely I'm quite sure that all of
you might have had this question now to
do those of you who are not familiar
with what barbie is while we are is
Microsoft's latest tool for data
visualization now I'll be there to
answer your question definitely not
because again when we talk about
Microsoft's SSRS product it comes as
part of your Microsoft sequel server
package itself so again it's a complete
package that you'll be using - I'm not
saying that any data that you have
created in sequel server cannot be prop
we flies using power bi but again the
purpose of power bi is to help those who
are working with Excel to display better
visuals on that aspect ok so there you
have more rich and vibrant visualization
that comes in but again sequel server is
mainly helpful for those who are working
on Microsoft sickle-cell so again it
would it's completely on a different
lines itself okay I hope you get the
understanding because again your sequel
server is a complete business
intelligence tool that helps you achieve
business intelligence so you have your
data processing you have your data
integration as well as data
visualization from a single package
itself but when you talk about power bi
that is just a data visualization - ok
so for that again if you let's say if
you want to process a data and provide
to it that can be done but as
individually it cannot be used for your
business intelligence solution aspect
but again definitely as I have mentioned
you can't feed your data from a
Microsoft sequel to power bi incase if
you want but if you ask me whether if
power bi is going to replace Microsoft
sequel server tools definitely not does
that answer your question Aria and this
is to anyone else as well
ok that's great ok now moving forward to
the next two points now the third point
is the cost factor now cost is one thing
that everybody is concerned about
because now investment is something that
everyone does now as an organization if
you need to provide additional cost for
your data visualization tools as well
then it becomes a hindrance because you
are already paying for your data
processing and integration tools and
then visualization adds on to it now for
those organizations that are just
working on the visualization aspect it's
not a big deal but
if you are working on the data
processing industry or on any industry
that deals with data then you definitely
need to consider the cost factor okay
but with Microsoft sequel server once
you've purchased the license for sequel
server then you do not need to provide
any additional amount for any of the
other tools that comes with it
especially about reporting tools like
SSRS as such now again this is a major
contributing factor mainly because let's
say if you take the other data
visualization tool like tableau now for
tableau for a single user that is for
tableau desktop you need to pay about
thousand dollars a year now that's a
huge amount that's it when you say
thousand dollars a year for an
organization maybe for one person or two
person yes it's possible but let's say
you have a team of analysts and usually
a team of analysts unless tracks about
ten to twenty five and it keeps going on
now for getting all of them licensed it
becomes a huge investment so this is
something that is that definitely helps
your because using the cost factor of
Microsoft you can definitely go with
sequel server and most organizations do
that as well for those who are using the
Microsoft standard environment okay
finally comes your analytical aspect now
using SSRS you can perform advanced
analytics as well as advanced
visualization as well because once
you've taken your data you can also
process and modify it filter it set
certain conditions and change the data
as per your requirements before you go
on to visualize this so this also gives
you the computer way to work around with
respect to the data before you go on to
visualizer
so all the freedom is in your hand to
play with the data before you wish lies
it in itself so this mainly means that
you become the complete responsible
person to work with that data okay so I
hope you guys are clear as to why a
slice over the other data visualization
tools that we have talked about can I
get a quick confirmation in the chat box
okay seems great everyone's given me a
confirmation
I've got Henry says clear so it's John
Adam AJ hole-saw Mia that's great now
it's good to see that you guys are
following me but at any point let's say
there's something that you're not clear
or something that this goes over your
head as well okay sometimes that tends
to happen so please talk me at that time
because I want you guys to have a
clear-cut understanding so at any point
if you're not here with something please
make sure you put across your questions
in the chat box if you want me to repeat
something feel free to let me know and
I'll be happy to do that as well okay so
let's say there's some other questions
apart from what we're discussing then
definitely hold onto it towards the end
of the session I will be taking the Q&amp;amp;A
around so there we can discuss that does
that sound fine to you guys great so
let's move forward to understand what
exactly is Microsoft sequel server
reporting service now eco-silver
reporting service is basically a server
based reporting platform okay again
every data that you're processing you're
working is stored on a server now this
could be present as part of your same
system if you are configuring it to be
part of that or it could also be your
organizational server where you're
storing your data processing it as well
as working with it now once your data is
stored on a server then it becomes easy
for you to work with it and then you can
also take your data as you wish to
create various reports and deliver them
in different formats as per your
requirement now one customer may require
it in a table format the other may
require it in the form of chart and then
so forth so what kind of representation
you choose is up to you but definitely
it is something that an analyst needs to
think before you present the data now
there are certain situations where you
get a request a ver you have to present
your report in a specific format but
usually what happens is it's up to the
understood or presented but so you need
to think well before you present any
data in a suspect format as to will this
report meet my requirement is this how I
can represent it or is there any way in
which if I represent it that people can
understand it better so it's all left in
your hands to try and work up on paper
okay so Mia is asking me our only
analyst who work with sixel Server
reporting service
definitely not somewhere again as I've
told you it's a Microsoft products that
is available to anyone so even if you're
a person who's not working on the
analyst side
and you have some data that you want to
represent then definitely you can use
sequel server this could be data present
in excel file as well but again we know
the capabilities of Excel in terms of
visualization so it's quite restricted
and limited but when you come to sequel
server reporting services there are
unlawful ization we will be talking
about these six different types of
reports as well that you can create in
sequel server in the upcoming slides as
well but for now you just need to
understand that analysts are not the
only people who use Microsoft sequel
server report except it's something that
anybody who has some technical knowledge
can use around right does that answer
your question somewhere okay that's
great okay Henry asked me does my data
have to always be on a server see Henry
it's again mainly because of how
organizations work your data when it's
on a server again the amount of data
that you work around varies okay it is
the single file then definitely you can
keep it on your system but let it's a
huge data set this could be your
organizational data it would be retail
data sales data and such not these
data's are usually very huge ok so it
makes more sense to store it on a server
and remotely access as per your
requirements so once when you need to
create a report all you need to do is
connect to that server take that data
and create your reports as per your
requirements ok so that's the reason
Microsoft mainly concentrates on server
based performance ok again in terms of
security in terms of processing all this
microsoft has taken a lot of
concentration and created these tools so
definitely since it's a Microsoft
product you can air Shrestha short about
the security aspect as well as its
privacy aspect ok so does that answer
your question Henry move forward let's
see the SSRS architecture now talking
about the users who work with your
reporting service there are mainly three
types of users 1 is the report user 1 is
the tuple designer and the third is a
report manager ok now this basically is
with respect to the three cycles itself
if you see report users or people who
work with the data as well as wanna have
some insights with respect to that so
these are people who will be working
mainly with respect to the first two
tools of Microsoft sequel server that is
your sis and SSS
but at the same time when they whoa
to create a report on their data then
definitely they can create it using SSRS
but apart from that you have your report
designers these are professionals who
extensively work with respect to
designing reports from the already
existing data okay and finally talking
about a report manager it's quite
straightforward that is these are people
who want to see the reports our people
whom you need to deliver this report to
okay and now let's look at the
architectural aspect of this okay okay
now you have a data source is present
here now this could be a sequel server
it could be an Oracle database it could
be coming from a different database that
could be a sample database it could be a
Terra data database your salesforce
database so all that can be linked to
your Microsoft sequel so once you've
extracted your data then your data
retrieval process as well as rendering
happens now again renting basically is
the process where you are filtering your
data analyzing it and making your
requirement once you've done that then
comes here with word processing segments
okay report processing mainly deals with
creation of reports publishing of
reports modifying of existing reports
and so forward okay now okay this is
just this is a spelling mistake it's XML
web service interface basically when
you're publishing a report that goes to
the web browser so it is mainly my
process by our web service interface so
that is something that makes it quite
easy for anyone to view it as well now
apart from that you have your security
and scheduling and delivery segment that
comes as part of your sequel server
right so these are individual services
that one with respect to your sequel
server always now again when you're
delivering your report this could be in
terms of a HTML file it could be an XML
file it could be a PDF file you want any
custom files that you want to require a
person that you can also share it by
emails you can share it as files and any
other custom method as per your
requirement as well
so I hope you guys have got a simple
idea with respect to the reporting
service architecture
okay that's great to see that you guys
are clear about this it's a quite simple
representation so I hope you guys are
now understood well okay now this is not
very important as such but this is just
to give you an idea of how things work
up okay now moving forward let's try to
understand this reporting a live SEC
because it's always important that you
there's a life cycle or a standard
process that you follow while you're
creating and working with reports okay
now there every organization that
actually works with respect to sequence
server
follows the three phases of reporting
life cycle
the first is authoring second is
management and third is delivering so
we'll talk about each one of them one by
one now first comes authoring okay now
in this phase report authors define the
layout and the source of the data okay
now the syntax that you use and report
is known as a report definition language
okay it's basically an XML defined in
the industry for defining reports and
working with them okay so it's standard
across back now when you talk about the
tools that you'll be using for authoring
this mainly deals with your sequel
server business intelligence development
studio and your support builder
application okay so these are tools that
you mainly be working while in the
authoring phase okay then comes your
management phase then this mainly
involves managing the published reports
which are as public at presently part of
the web cells
okay so reports which are presently on
the web interface the role based
security models that you need to create
so again when you talk about role-based
security models this mainly is to
identify who needs to view the report
who needs to have access to modify it
who needs to have access to share it and
so forth okay and also another thing you
need to consider while in the management
phase is to the control over the
execution as in when the report should
get that data now all these reports can
get updated on a real-time basis as well
so they need to have a real-time update
with respect to that data as well now
again every database from which this
data is being take database data
warehouse or a cube any source again
they get updated on regular basis now we
all know that because
it seems quite trivial to work with
static data and when you're working with
dynamic data you need to define when the
update should happen this could be every
day this could be within a few are again
all this is based on how your data is
being processed how often are you
gathering data and all that form so all
that needs to be considered in the
management phase of the life cycle then
comes your delivery section now in
delivery report you need to understand
when the reports need to be delivered to
the customers either on their demand or
based on a specific payment let's say
you've completed a phase of your project
and you want to give a specific report
to your customers then you can do that
as or let's say every quarter you need
to give a report to your customer based
on the sales and transactions that
you've done for them then you can do
that as well
or your customer is considering of a
merge then he suddenly comes and
requests you to give me a report based
on all that data so all that is
something that basically is done okay
now there is an interesting feature of
subscription which actually allows you
for automated to portal away ok so at
every fixed interval you can make sure
that a report gets delivered apart from
that you can again come to the privacy
part where you can work with URL axis
web service access even the report view
controller is something that helps you
with respect to the delivery sec now
don't worry about these key terms if
you're not quite clear on we'd be going
on the advanced part of this in the next
session but this is just an introduction
airy session to give you a complete in
fact with respect to this so I hope you
guys have got a simple understanding
with respect to three phases of the
reporting lifecycle as long as you have
simple understanding of what this does
it's more than enough so so I hope at
least you guys can give me a gist of
what these three phases are please pull
it across in the chat box okay just one
line answer what these three phases are
and what you have understood okay so
it's good to see that you guys have
understood I'm actually quite frankly
proud of for a few guys because I never
really expected every one of you to
understand but again it's quite great to
have such a good class that actually
listens to things okay so again any
point you're not clear with we'll
discuss it after the session great so
move forward
you could've raised types of report that
you can create in Microsoft sequel so
okay there are mainly six types of
report that you will be working on in
Microsoft sequel server reporting cells
now talking about the first type of
report that is tablets triple
now your tablet support is quite similar
to your normal table report itself so
again when we talk about a table to put
it basically is representation of your
data in form of a normal table now this
usually is a single data source table
that you'll be representing it with so
again this is quite similar to how you
see your data in Excel so I hope you
guys have got a simple idea of how that
works up okay wearing you have
individual columns that I four specific
values and again each row is to give you
the unique input to that Val okay now
the second type of report that is the
matrix support now this is something
that is quite interesting your matrix is
also quite similar to your table itself
but here what happens is you would be
working with more than a single value
where in both your column and row or day
into specific data now in terms of sales
let's say you want to understand the
number of sales for a specific product
and you want to identify that with
respect to different regions as well
then what you do is you go with the
matrix report as a tablet report okay so
I guess here with respect to the
difference between matrix and tablets
okay that's great now comes your chart
report now chart basically is a
collection of different kinds of your
visuals you have bar representation you
have pie chart representation you have
lined or presentation and so far so all
your kinds different kind graphical
representation comes on the chart
representation okay so here basically
what you're going to do is depending on
the type of data that you have then
you're going to choose between these
types of visuals and then work with it
now talking about your bar chart a bar
chart basically display CDs a set of
horizontal box and it's also the only
kind of data chart that displays your
data in horizontal format okay
now depending on a specific value that
you're working with noobs choose between
bar chart again when you talk about pie
chart here tighter basically is used to
display proportions of hold now let's
say you
understand the number of male to female
ratio then you can use a pie chart
itself here okay or it could be with
respect to different categories of your
products that are sold so again this is
something that is relative parts of a
whole so from your overall sales you
want to understand which category of
product has sold how much so in such
cases what you can do is you can use a
pie chart okay and then line is
something that is quite used
straightforward line basically is a
series that is basically represented as
set of points which are connected to a
single line okay now line basically is
used for evaluating a data over a
continuous period of time so again your
sales over a fixed time your number of
employees over a fixed time and so forth
ok
so then comes your fourth type of a put
that is a sub report now sub report is
something that's quite interesting sub
report basically is a report itself but
it is usually embedded inside another
report ok now this report is usually
independent and it can have its own data
set if you require it to have or it can
also be related to the same data that
you're working with now let's say you're
working with the overall sales but again
you want to have a sub report that tells
you sales in different regions so you
can do that using sub reports here so
you have one major report that talks
about your overall sales and multiple
sub reports that talk about sales in
different regions ok ok now comes your
drill down and drill to report these
reports are basically choose based on
how you process your data ok now a drill
down report basically is based on the
relationship where you talk about the
general relationship from the top and
you go down to the sublevels drill
through is also slightly different
operation where you drill through the
illusion instances of the data ok so I
hope you guys are clear with respect to
different types of reports that you can
create in ssize ok seems like all of you
are clear so what we'll be doing is
we'll be creating three different
reports as part of today's session we'll
start off my tab decks report ok so
first thing what you need to do is you
need to relaunch your microsoft visual
studio data tools so this is the tool
that you'll be using for your reports so
this is what your special
studio data tool looks like so first
start by creating a new project now here
it's going to be a reporting type
project so select the reporting service
option here and reporting server project
now first you need to rename this let's
call it my first report
okay and didn't just click on okay so
you would be getting this empty
workspace here okay so to the right you
have your solution Explorer to your left
you have server connections and to a
bottom is your output tree so now let's
begin by first importing a data source
so for that just right click on the
folder here and go to add new data
source option so here first you need to
name your data so so let me call it my
data source
and it tastes of a type Microsoft sequel
server because what I am doing is I'm
going to extract a table that's present
in my sequel server and then start
creating the visual report so what I'm
going to do is let the type be microsoft
SQL server and then connection string
needs to be modified you can read it so
your server name has to be selected here
now this may take some time because it
needs to check out all the possible
server connections and once it's done
loading you can find the name of your
server the name of my server is a
breaker 42 and then I need to select the
database so here are all the complete
data bases that are available to me so I
want to take the table from ad rekha
database so just click on ok so with
that I have created a new data source
now what I need to do is I need to
create a data set from this data source
I don't want to work with all the tables
closet in my data source I just want to
work with some of them so for that I'm
going to create a shared data set so
let's begin by creating a new data set
so right click and add data set option
here and I'll call this customers now
data source remains my data source and
here let's say select star from dbo dot
customer now I already have a customer
table present in my database and I am
sharing the same with all of you so make
sure you input to your database as well
and work with it ok so once you click on
OK you can see your data source also is
get included here ok so now come to the
third phase where we want to create our
report so go to add report so this
basically is a report wizard now first
thing what you need to do is specify the
data source
so now what we'll be doing is we'll be
adding a report here as well so for that
this right-click and go to add option
not add new report and click on new item
so here you have to choose between
report wizard report data source and
data set so we want a report so just
click on add so this is what your report
workspace looks like now to this you
need to add the type of visuals that you
want so let me begin by creating a new
table here it's also right-click and you
have option of insert so first thing
I'll insert is a table here okay so this
is my table so I'll just expand it a
little bit and then to this I can add
data okay so this data has been set as
customer so what I'll do is I'll say a
customer ID here same thing here what I
will do is let me set customer name here
then let me add the city and if you want
to add a new column insert column to the
right or left as per your requirement
I'll add one to the right and here let
me give the value of country let me just
stretch all this a little more so that
it's set and then corrected okay now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to the preview tab now the point of
going to the preview tab is that it
shows me how my report looks before I
publish it so this is how my report is
looking in it so customer name customer
ID city and country so let me just pull
all this
and I'll add some color let's say red
now if I go to the preview tab so you
can see these table these fields have
been modified
they've been bolded and their color has
been changed to red
now again I'll just Center align this
now again if you want to give a border
to your whole table itself so select all
and then go to the border tab and let's
say outside bottom then if you were to
the preview tab then you can see a
complete border has been added to the
stable
okay so again if you want to make it
even thicker then you can go back to
your bar you can again select everything
and then go in the borders option here
you can change the thickness here so if
I say if I just type it if I just change
it to two points
okay then in the preview tab you can see
the thickness has slightly changed okay
so it's not very huge but it's mind you
and all the details of the customers
have been added here so again it becomes
a quite simple report but again the
purpose of this is so that you can
understand how it looks like okay so
what I want you to do is I want you to
simultaneously try this out as well once
you've done this then we will go on to
the next report type that is matrix so
please go on and try this report in case
any of you are facing any challenges let
me know right away so that we can work
around with it
so it's great that all of you were
created your first report that is topics
report and even Henry had a problem so
we all helped a month so that's great to
see now going back to our presentation
okay so we've seen how to create a
simple tablets report okay now again if
you want to go a little more advanced
report type then you come with the
matrix report where you work with
different sets of data grouped together
so what we're going to do is we're going
to go ahead and create a matrix report
here so let me just delete this table so
you can select it then just press Delete
okay so this has removed my table from
here if you were to preview you can see
it's completely empty here so let's
begin by adding a new matrix so go to
insert option and go to matrix tab now
here what I'm going to do is let's say
for my rows I'm going to see 50 and my
columns what I'll do is I'll add the
customer names so this will tell me in
which city which customer is present
okay so you can see here the different
cities along with that correspondingly
the details of the customers now here
what I'll do is I want to add a new
value so I want to add the country as
well which they come from so what I'll
do is I'll just try a country you can
either add it here when the blue option
is highlighted or I can add it below
here as well now what I want to do is
I'll add it in country okay and then
what I'll do is I'll group them based on
the city okay now if you go to preview
here so you can see in Afghan these are
the cities that are present and they are
being grouped together with respect to
the country from which they're coming
now this is a rough data so don't go by
the actual values that are present in
the columns but again this is to just
give you an idea so for a specific
country okay how you can see the
variation that is all the cities as well
as details of the customers from those
cities okay they are correspondingly
grouped here so this is how a matrix
table works looks like so again I hope
you guys have got a simple understanding
how it works now this is something that
comes into essence again when you're
working with data that is being gathered
or a period of time so something that
will help you in classification as well
as grouping in such situations you can
use a matrix report okay are you guys
clear with respect to the matrix report
okay good
so I want you to try the matrix report
as well and meanwhile I'll just delete
this and we'll start with the next to
protect report but please go ahead and
try the matrix report in case anyone of
you face a trouble let me know against
this is applicable to you Henry in case
if you face a trouble let me know so
that we can work it out I don't want you
to be stuck at some point and not be
clear about something
okay that's good
great the last type of
what that we'll be seeing is a chart
report now charge report basically helps
you summarize your data in different
kinds of chart so for us what we were
doing is we'll be working with a new
table
so for that let me just add a new data
source
now here in the shadow
all right one more
data source one now here what I need to
do is I need to bring it my employee
step now how do I do that again who can
guess the query for this okay it's
select staff from
resource touch lies
okay so just click on okay
so I'll just need to modify this wait
I'll call it employees first
so okay we are going to import the
employees table from the human resource
database okay click on okay now what I
lose
I'll insert let's say a pie chart now
again charts you have different options
you have bar charts you have line charts
you have pie chart pyramid and so forth
you even have column charts present here
then again let's say you want area based
graph so you can use that for specific
ranges you have range graph you have
stock you have candlestick okay and then
you have scatterplot polar plots and so
forth so what I'll do is I'll just do a
pie chart here
and I'll import my employee search here
okay so from my employee set what I need
is now to this value all I'll address
gender
now in the preview let's check this out
okay so this is my by Jack
I'll do is I'll add gender okay but
gender has to come in category group so
always remember that that is important
here okay so if you just crawled on bit
group by gender and if you preview it
there's no value present here because
the value is not going to the rose so
also add to the Rose here as gender as
well okay now what we do is just check
the preview so here you can get the male
to female ratio now if you want to add
little more details to it that is let's
say you wanna add labeling to it okay
then what you can do is show data labels
once you do that you can see the number
okay off my to 90 employees 206 or may
eighty-four are female as well okay so
again again if you want to add some
effect 3d effects that can also be done
enable 3d effects so this is basically
giving entry inclined to the same so you
can see how it is variated here so
earlier went without the 3d effect let
me show you that so it what I'll do is
I'll just copy the same so again you can
see you can press the control C and
control V to copy/paste a graph okay so
for Andrews for the first one I will not
add a 3d effect and then let's see both
so this is without 3d effect and this is
with 3d effect so again there's a lot
you can play around with now again if
you go back to the design plane and if
you want to insert now in charts options
you have a lot of data charts that you
can prepare and work with okay so I want
you guys to try two of them okay I
already shared the data set with you now
so now this is basically a bar chart
okay now again any kind of chart that
you guys are creating okay make sure
there is some purpose set up of creating
has to be clear why you're creating this
specific chart now I used the pie chart
for me because I had only two values
male and female okay so pressure between
them I wanted to change again let's say
if I want to change with I want to see
I'll change the second chart to
and remove this and I'll add a new value
that is my little status okay
this come down just change this as well
okay now we'll see the preview here okay
now you're getting the error because
this chart is not giving any values now
you here you can see the ratio has been
changed from married and single kept
almost a 50/50 ratio so what we need to
do we need to add labels to this again
click on your values option and show
data labels in preview you can see the
ratio as well now again all these are
parts of a whole now what I want you to
do is I have shared the data set with
you I want you to figure out and create
one line chart and one bar chart okay so
please go ahead and try that out as well
and then we'll be open to questions so
with that we come to an end of this
session so in case if any of you do have
a question please submit for the others
