now for the final program for this
chapter we're going to write a program
to count the number of digits in a given
number so the user is going to enter a
number and we need to return the number
of digits in that number so let's say
the user enters 556 you're going to
print there are three digits in this
number sounds simple doesn't it because
if I were to give you a number you just
going to look at it count one two three
and you're done but if you asked write a
program to do the same it's not that
straightforward is it now let's see how
simple or difficult it is to do this I'm
going to start a new program as usual
start with the comments what is the
program supposed to do count number of
digits what is our input or number from
the user where the tasks count the
digits in the number finally the output
print the number of digits now we need
to write the algorithm for the task the
algorithm is not that straightforward
let's see why so let's say you had the
number five four six five if you are
asked to count the number of digits you
would just go one two three four now the
computer cannot do this because this
entire number will be stored in a single
variable how will you write a program to
count the number of digits in it because
each digit is not stored separately in a
different variable right it's just part
of one single variable entire thing is
just one single variable to perform any
kind of an operation or any kind of a
task on a computer it needs to be broken
down mathematically so you need to
figure out a mathematical solution
for this task so let's see how we do
that it's actually kind of simple
the idea is to decrease the number by
one digit every time so let's say I've
decreased one digit so I know there was
one digit then break down the next digit
now I have broken down two digits I
break down another digit broken down
three digits finally I remove the final
digit and the number becomes zero
so I've broken down four digits so I
know I have four digits in my number so
how do I break this down we know that
given a number if you divide a number by
ten large digit disappears and because
we know the number is an integer
every time we divide by ten we do not
get five hundred forty six point five we
only get five hundred forty six so first
time you divide by ten you get five
forty six so you've broken down one the
next time you divide the number by ten
you get 54 you've broken down twice then
you divide 54 by ten you get five you've
broken down thrice you divide five by
ten you finally get zero and you've
broken down four times wasn't that easy
let's put that in the form of a program
now so the algorithm for this first step
except the number from the user the
second step is to divide the number by
ten number by ten third step a ten we
divide the number by ten we increment
account so you counting how many digits
are there increment count the fourth
step is to again divide the number by
ten so go to step two and how long do we
keep dividing it until the number itself
becomes zero go to step two until number
is zero and finally print
Conte that's our algorithm let's break
this down into a program the first
statement hash include stdio.h then you
have the int main that's our curly
braces where the first thing we need we
need a variable to store the number the
user is going to enter so int num what
do we need to do next except the number
from the user so printf first will tell
the user to enter a number next is a
scanf percentage D comma ampersand num I
would like to leave a gap here yeah so
we accept the number from the user now
what do we need to do we need to divide
the number by 10 do you do num by 10
where we store the resulting number we
can store it back in the same variable
we don't need to store it in a different
variable so num equal to num by 10
every time I divide by 10 I need to
increment the count so let's have
another variable called count is equal
to count plus one so we need to have
another variable first count and count
needs to be zero in the beginning then
there's a shorter way of writing count
equal to count plus one and C and that's
called count plus plus so if I just say
count plus plus it's similar the same
count is equal to count plus one what do
I need to do next go back to step two
which means I have to just keep looping
these two statements until number
becomes zero which is like saying keep
looping these two statements as long as
the number is not equal to zero
so while num is not equal to zero
exclamation symbol here is not so as
long as the number is not equal
zero I would have to keep looping these
two statements as a number becomes zero
I come out of the loop what do I do
after that I print count printf number
of digits percentage D
Conte and finally system pause and
return zero let's compile our program to
save it
num digits
run intro number 6 4 7 5 number of
digits 4 let's try it again
run enter number 12 number of digits to
a lot of people always get confused with
loops as to what is the condition that
we need to check so always remember the
condition that you need to check for is
like an English statement just put the
statement as long as before your
condition so you want the loop to run as
long as the number is not 0 as soon as
the number becomes 0 you want to stop
looping so I want these two statements
to loop as long as the number is not 0
so while num is not equal to 0 it's as
simple as that so now we've learnt to
write a program to count the number of
digits so let's have a quick summary of
what we've learned in this chapter we've
learned how to use an ID to write
compile and execute our programs we've
learned the general structure of a C
program has two we need to include a
library first using hash include' then
you have a main braces and finally the
program within the main we've learnt
some data types like int and float we've
learned how to use printf and scanf
we've learnt the two types of loops as
for and while loop and finally we've
learnt what symbolic constants are and
how to use them you guys should now be
ready to easily do the assignment that's
given to you as it's pretty much based
on the last program that we've done just
think about a little bit and you guys
should easily be able to solve it
