interesting building block of Android
applications which is this services so
what I mean by services is a service cat
can be thought of as faceless companies
that run in the background I have a very
common example of a service which is the
music player you might have used the
music player applications on your
Android enabled handsets wherein you
just pass a playlist to the music player
and it keeps playing songs one after the
other without user intervention that
that is you don't need to tell them and
when a song ends you need to play the
another one so in this particular case
what happens is it does some tasks in
the back room without letting the user
know about it so this is the work of a
service in Android a service is an
application component which represents
either an applications desire to perform
a long-running task which is while not
interacting with the user or to supply
some functionality to other applications
so if I talk about the services a
service too has a life cycle but its
life cycle is a little different from
the activity life cycle as you can see
here it has a starting state it has a
running state and then it has a
destroyed state so now you can see here
a service does not have the causes all
state here or a service does not go into
the past mode the reason for that
particular state not being there with
the services is that because a service
never interacts with the user so it does
not have the power state here it can
either mean this running state or it can
either be in the destroyed State so this
is how services work in Android but let
me remind you one thing a service is not
a separate process it runs with the
applications process itself as I told
you with the help of dalvik virtual
machine we have access to various
applications so every application has a
separate process but the service also
runs in the same process as assigned by
the DVM to the application it does know
create a separate process for itself so
it's service clear to everyone about the
service lifecycle how service works what
is the use of service you can dry down
the chat window so that I can move or
proceed with the next topics I again
have one poll question for all of you
can you just answer the poll question
which is which of the following states
don't exist for an Android service is it
the power state is a destroyed state or
is it the running state that does not
exist for any Android service
majority of the people have answered it
correctly it is the pause state because
a service never interacts with the user
so that is why it goes into deposited
the has asked her query here when a call
comes then the music goes in a poorer
state or not it is how you implement a
service suppose if I'm implementing a
service and what I'm doing is I use um
as soon as a calls call comes up I save
the buffer and I just pause the app
media player the example that I told you
of a service it is with respect to how
we implement the service suppose a call
comes up I get notified that a call is
coming up so I can pause the media
player but I'm not pausing the service
or I'm not destroying the service I'll
just find the service again well from
where it has to start so niha this is
how a service works in Android British
has a question how not Network download
is a service if I say I am using a
Facebook application and what I am doing
is I am just surfing my news feeds at
any point of time you might not come
across but there is a there is a refresh
that takes place as soon as new feeds
comes up so pradesh if i have registered
a service which keeps looking for
updates and registering those updates
and notifying to the user so there that
in that case it does and works in this
man in a service is this clear to you
pradesh so it is not something if if i
talk about that it gets paused we are
talking about the literal meaning of the
term paused but when we when I say
paused in terms of service then I what I
say is I stopped the needy appear or I
don't look for the updates and then I
again bind with the service that ok this
is the percentage of media that was
played and now play it from this
percentage I hope it does
to everyone you can write on the chat
window if this particular examples tells
you how the service never enters into
into the poorer state what it does is it
just runs again all right so it's
service clear to everyone how a service
works what is the use of service in
Android now I'll move forward so an
example of the service as you can see
here is the various feeds by friends
notifications about friend requests and
they all all as you can see here so I
coming up from Moorhead lecture and he
says can a service affect the activity
yes mohith if I am having a network
download request so after it downloads
the data from the network it has to
notify me so an activity has to respond
to the changes from the service so this
is how it has done so a service can
affect the activity whether the saying
how buffer works in Android whether it
is a concept which is totally say I
would say which totally belongs to the
media player when I'm playing the media
and I play it with buffer size I played
by it by byte so if I know how much
music I have played I can use the byte
by byte mechanism and then I can restart
or rebind the service with that
particular media player is this clear to
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
