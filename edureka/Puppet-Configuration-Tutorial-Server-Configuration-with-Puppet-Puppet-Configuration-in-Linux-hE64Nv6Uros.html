this is all about your configuration
tools right so it it's a puppet and
check has created a big big storm on
this particular stuff called the
configuration management and much before
puppet and check came into the market
Yahoo and google were already in this
business with their own set of custom
tools okay even before this there was
another tool widget if nobody talks
about I I do not know whether you book
you've ever come across this tool so see
if engine was probably the first attempt
to create this configuration and
unfortunately nobody talks about it and
you know why this was not a successful
product a very very strange reason this
was actually based on using C and C++
code okay so which was not possible see
that's where you know a lot of people
were put off once you write code in
those kind of languages it was never it
is very easy for normal people to make
changes but how what made them you know
puppet and check so successful is the
use of the language to develop this tool
it was it was built on Ruby and
everything was on Ruby so anybody could
who understood who comes from a
background of either Python or Perl very
able to quickly get on to the death the
development stuff on Ruby and they could
start work on it okay so these puppet
beat so the check right check every
other tool for configuration manager
both the built up movie now the one tool
which appeals to me basically though
not mentioned in this is called
saltstack okay now saltstack okay what
makes all stack so different compared to
these tools errs the way it can scale
see why do we use these tools because we
have to handle hundreds of servers right
sorry not even hundreds and thousands of
servers when you want to handle such
such kind of numbers then tools then you
should also have the application scaling
and saltstack was designed for them for
environments which are of a public
public Internet in size and that was
built up right there and the other tool
which is again becoming popular is
ansible okay a paycheck and saltstack
are designed off it is you know the
architecture of what he called
client-server model then as ansible has
tried to push an architecture of your
job for which is more of server model
that means I'm not trying to install an
agent to do my work okay it's a non
agent less base of one so it appeals to
some some organizations that way so of
various various technologies various
architectures to go about doing okay so
so at this moment these are the four
tools which are kind of getting popular
ansible seems to be appealing to a lot
of enterprises but no way to match
puppet in any way puppet is be standard
the most popular most popular among all
these and the salt stack is kind of
taking the role more towards internet
companies because it can scale in a big
way compared to in here that so if you
have a I feel if you have organizations
like as an example either your food cart
and snap beings and Bailey's other they
tend to prefer to you saltstack compared
to use compared to puppet
a check and puppet seems to be standard
or enterprises today and and and the
most popular okay most popular among
these things okay
so I think by now you understand that
what what puppet it
it's a configuration management tool now
the world confuses the word confuses
because when I say it's on figuration
management pool too many people they
think it is CMDB as in ITIL definitely
not right we know that it's not a
configuration management database tool
where you will keep your IP address and
hostname yeah that is also some kind of
configuration but this is much more than
that
it is not an ITIL okay you and and bye
bye love you
even know the use cases where you will
apply your puppet asset right so let's
go okay so why puppet it is tough to do
this on one node what happens when there
are right it's a simple use case if
there are thousands of nodes I today
then we talk thousands of nodes it
doesn't mean that we may have thousands
of servers sometimes you may have maybe
you know 100 or 200 service but you have
hundreds and thousands of VMs
that's where are the caches right then
you have games and there is
uncontrollable scroll of be ends oh it
did did the configuration becomes so
very complicated okay so an old need not
be a physical instance it can also be a
virtual instance okay so that's what you
need to understand as well
you
okay so puppet is a configuration
management tool that is used to deploy
configure manage a server machine now if
you ask this question to me can I use I
told you I can use puppet to deploy
virtual machines okay now now my next
clip arises can I did can I use puppet
to install bare metal imaging let me
just like how to use in exe okay can we
do this we can write company so that's
where people come and get a little
confused will I use will my puppet
replace even the PXE environment he
can't write God for a simple reason
what puppet to work once I install my OS
I had to install the puppet agent right
so only when the puppet agent is
installed this tool is ready for
configuration okay so you install the
puppet agent and then the puppet agent
will talk to your puppet server and pull
down all the configuration files so
example now you see me that every time I
want to make a change to my EDC resolve
dot corner if I have to go to each
machine make a change right now I don't
have to do I do that I can go to my
puppet server and do a push to all these
servers to the to the respective file
that I want to push on the puppet agent
itself will pull this file then it
notices that a new version is the right
okay
so as I said your own board pocket is a
server agent based architecture okay so
it controls all the steps right fun okay
bootstrapping to the end of our life
okay I
just want to qualify this thing it
doesn't do us installation but why the
statement that there is basically it it
can also do the complete William
installed when I say then I'm doing a BM
for getting in front in yours itself
right okay can different configuration
at the node level can group them
according to roles like that server or
database server whatever maintain a
consistent constancy across north if a
change is done locally it is rolled back
to be a configuration so what I want to
tell you here is the line the changes
done locally it is rolled back now
imagine I made a change in my
configuration file in you say if you see
configuration pointing to a different
VMs after made the change you you can go
back and see if Papa does configure it
Papa does installed it me quickly
restore back to the old configuration
why because your server has a has a list
of configuration for that machine if
everything changes he pushes back that
is another advantage okay it is not
about this pulling and pushing it's also
about keeping a consistent configuration
throughout its lifecycle without your
intervention okay so I don't want to do
the puppet keep kids verifying the
configuration at specific intervals it
like you know defines configuration with
the help of poles large open source
developer base okay I mean that is
something you may or may not be in
advantage it work smoothly with even
large configurations
language yield is very easy
unlike Ruby or others sorry any PP this
line may be a mistake sometimes it's
built up Ruby but certain portions of
this land of this tool is
is being used by another language called
closure okay
it's a I don't know how much of that
potion has gone into the this
environment to close a language called
closure so closure is a language built
on top of Jamia so basically you require
JVM for it to work so there is a little
bit of architectural redesign which is
happening within puppet and I'm not sure
physically why they would they would
want to do looking at Swami I mean I
said using our salt the salt stack salts
fact is such a tool that I'm able to
scale scale in in thousands okay they
are promising that this is the toluene
good but there may be very specific
request a you schedule where puppet
might have realized that they would want
to go in for such a language but puppet
is not targeted for the internet I am
telling you no organization from the
infinite space full to use puppet but
perfect is a great tool within the
enterprise environment so today puppet
as a tool literally does everything what
once a while your what you call this
Microsoft Microsoft the System Center
Configuration Manager would do which is
updating your OS also see puppet can't
do that but I can do that in a way what
contracting system configure it is there
a CCM does but good enough to install
all your applications on top of your OS
and of course the configuration itself
and keep it consistent that is most
important that means any changes that
happens is immediately reverted because
of the architecture there is a server
there is a client and it keeps in sync
continuously okay
so okay so doing what I was trying to
tell you some puppet works on a master
server model so puppet master this
machine contains all the configuration
for different roles the puppet master
will run as a daemon on the master
server okay puppet agent this is a demon
bitch around on each node and talks to
the ma talks to the master okay and the
connection between these two machines is
made is made in a secure encrypted
channel with the help of SSL now one
tool which is in between all of this I
see that is the tool which which will
actually tell you how much it can stay
is called the middle then there is a
middleware which is connecting your
puppet master puppet master and I sorry
peg a puppet master your puppet holes in
between there is a tool called or
middleware so now this middleware is
nothing but it could be anything it
could be maybe you do I don't know
whether you are aware of these tools
like rabbitmq Inc and you must have
heard before this IBM adder a big tool
called MQ CDs and things like so it is
the middleware actually which defines
how much you can scale so there is
another tool in in between there but I
think pappardelle using what they have
developed on their own then okay so how
puppet works so there is a manifest
there is a configuration DV okay and it
is all the master side there is a report
folder there is a file server and then
certificate authority which you use your
certificate so your configurator your
agent you know concert configurated yep
it evaluates rather than generates a
report and then it's it sends back now
a manifest is that all your files stored
what body
what manifest is there the
configurations are let's take an example
ok ok so this is how it looks like your
declaration off of your files are and
you use one of those languages which are
there in the puppet the puppet for the
language need you to create this stuff
and then you push it across so so the
following steps are the steps for puppet
country the client connects to your mass
server identify the configuration
according to the client
the master builds the configuration that
needs to be applied to those compiles it
and makes it ready he declined and pull
the configuration and applies them to
the server so this is how that whole
process works but all these declarations
what you the config lines what you do
are in normal text format ok so so that
way it makes your life a loom easy to
edit and you're not making any
reconfiguring it so resources the puppet
code is primarily come composed all
through so speculations a resource
describes about the state of the system
example a certain user or file should
exist or a package should be installed
ok so resources anything it could be a
configuration file it could be a pad
cage that needs to be existing in a
particular node ok and you need to
declare this at your server side before
it can be applied to your client side
so there's our resources declared this
is a case of the user so this this
resource declaring describes a user
resource named Mitchell that the
specified attribute and this resource
I'll use that like this will then be
applied across all your are all your
systems that it needs to be applied okay
and to list all the whole you can around
this country
you
okay so puppet programs are called as
manifests so manifest compost or puppet
code and their file names you peepee as
a censor default main manifest is your
site which contains all the
configuration for all your nodes as such
and it is from see below the database
which which is always referred to by the
clients to keep the consistency okay and
I mainly do those we would kind of get a
better idea of this
okay and I mean puppets classes are a
code block that can be used can be
called in a code elsewhere using class
allows you to use puppet code and make
them reading your guillotine here but
okay so the class we will try to write
one of these things that yeah yeah these
are the many complicated parts of it now
you should meet other puppet engineer
you should know how to write right
these clauses the manifest file that
means you need to understand a little
bit of a bit of a coding okay and this
is there your skills will come in using
these tools and you need to as I said
you need to master one of these either a
puppet or a ship or the salt stack to do
this entire configuration information
and and this is sometimes some organized
didn't have a separate team handling all
these work together okay
so across the creation occurs when a
class is called in a manifest
classification tells puppet to evaluate
the code within the class that comes in
two flavors and normal and resource like
our normal decline occurs then included
with the keyboard is using puppet cold
like example class and a resource like
declare occurs when a class is declared
like a resource okay so yeah so include
is to pull it from another place and
here you are actually making it appear
within the team of pilots okay okay so
module is the collection of manifests
and data and they have a specific
directory structure so modules are
useful for organizing your puppet code
because they allow you to split your
code into multiple manifest it is
considered best practice to use modules
to organize almost all of the poppers
management to add a module to a puppet
you go into this mod so little there you
bring in what kind of configurations
that you would need to apply to a group
of a system so understand here
we are in a heterogeneous environment
sorry when I say pop it is mainly used
in enterprise and enterprises are at to
Geneva in Vienna so you will have
sometimes Windows you have UNIX and and
in and in the situation you need to
organize these templates in a way which
which can be utilized by values of these
guys and and not to get mixed up so
sometimes you are separate teams
creating and using these a building
these modules okay okay installation
okay yeah installing it is pretty simple
you just need to you can do a yum and
then there is a bit of a configuration
that needs to be done on and you need to
do two to two sides your puppet master
and your pocket agent agent
aricept runs on the other side and the
only thing you need to do is just
specify where your master is in the
configuration file NL and then that is
good to work with then the next thing is
only to start configuring of what files
you may want to push it into it or what
applications you may want to push it
into it and create your groups and gain
these other things
