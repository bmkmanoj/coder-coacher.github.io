what it offers for us in the next five
or six modules and we'll end up with the
solar project so what we're gonna focus
today on is basically getting introduced
to solar understand what solar offers
and how is it different from traditional
RDBMS is we're gonna do a small contrast
of the RPMs and how is different from
the traditional Arkell are my sickle and
we will just see how do we use solar in
a quick in a quick way and we just walk
through some of the admin UI comments
and getting some of the solar insights
on the architecture
we'll start with getting details into
the schema and feels and types and we'll
sue will also choose to do some
introductory lab as well okay so
basically they have learned about
leucine right so why why do we think we
have to still look into a better one
like solar even though the solar is
built on top of leucine why do you guys
think we should have sonar in in our
skill set or why do you think we should
even bother about looking into solar so
what are the challenges you guys have
seen working with losing or solar could
give you a little bit backup just
without even understanding what solar is
all about I'm just trying to understand
what is it all about
great so the first thing is if you guys
have noticed in losing we have to write
a lot of java code right
so for each and every small aspect you
have to
right Java code so if you are trying to
build an first application something
similar to what we have seen on Flipkart
so you may end up writing not of java
code that's the first thing okay the
second thing is say for example if I am
trying to build it or to complete
something like this so you have to build
this entire autocomplete or sometimes we
even call it as suggestions so this
feature
even though losing supports the raw API
is you don't have any service as such
where you can go ahead and build it
right so you may end up writing four to
five components and fortify applications
to build something like this and that or
the period of time it may get really
tedious for you to manage all those
classes because as it may get bigger and
bigger and also the second thing is then
scalability problem so loosing does not
tell you how to scale your index how to
distribute or index and how to manage
your index kind of a thing so it just
gives you a raw API and that's where
solar comes in and helps us out in
managing all these things for large
scale applications so apart from what
Lusine offers solar extends some of the
features and it adds its own additional
features like it does provide the
architecture to scale the search
application for horizontal needs or for
big data means and it provides
separation of concerns and on top of it
it also provides the complete complete
graph
of all the new sing features on a
service-based model basically you don't
have to write even a single line of Java
code or any other coding so all you have
to do is use the solar application and
consume all the content or index the
content using the rest paste web
services either XML or JSON or there are
a lot of other formats so that's a
beauty of it and you can manage all the
documents everything using the HTTP REST
base excellent so you don't have to
interact with the index using the core
Java APs we have seen this example
already so we have said we may require a
search engine when we have something
like this the text base search so solar
might be appropriate when you may
require a suggestion feature which is a
free text based search and when you need
a lot of faceting and the content is
based on the document based store so
each item what we see on the screen is
primarily referred as a document ok so
the first thumb rule is when if you have
to decide when I have to use solar so
this is your indicators when you are
looking for a free text based search
with suggestions and lot of facets and
your record is document oriented is it
clear just a quick way of identifying
when you may have to use solar
guys yeah so this is a very useful thing
because most of the time people just ask
when should I use sonar and when should
I not use so now so some of the
recommendations for when you should not
use I would also just give you some
basic information so when the data is
not structured and hierarchical so too
much of structure done too much of
hierarchy and you don't need lot of text
based search and it has lot of relations
okay and you don't have to use the key
base search or token based search and it
has a lot of transactional needs like
locking a record and it has to be
consistent
even though solar does support some
level of consistency but not to the
level or the extent of what your
traditional RDBMS does okay and if it is
too much of right dominant and little of
reads so solar is primarily good when
you have lot of reads and the ratio of
reads is more compared to the ratio of
tides so solar is a better choice if you
have more number of writes versus less
number of reads you should not choose
solar in those cases just a very high
level best practices but you can adapt
so looking at our previous example
Flipkart example so at the functional
non-functional it's a features so
what kind of features do you think your
search platform should support roughly
say for example if you need something
like solar what kind of things do you
think you should support them I briefly
explained some of those things right yes
of course it has to be really fast so
the reads has to be very fast right and
since the documents every document had
its own attribute so you cannot have a
fixed schema so you have to have a
flexible or dynamic schema based on the
document content right and it should
have a huge scale support where you can
add say millions of millions of or
billions of records and you should scale
it horizontally right so these are some
of the characteristics what we are
looking in to a search engine which we
will be exploring it in solar ok fine so
so will briefly introduce what solar is
will understand what its capability is
all about so the first of all solar as
you guys have might have it about it so
it is a and open source Apache licensed
Enterprise search server so it's it's in
some simple terms what it does is it
takes all the Lucene libraries and it
had provided some configuration files to
access those loose in libraries and
features and provided it as a simple web
application so you can use that web
application to install it into any web
container and access all the services
through the web container using the I
should
services so in in a nutshell that's what
it is what we will explore more and more
as we move forward so as a lot of growth
in the social media cloud computing and
all the big data right so most of the
time the data is keep growing and you
need a little bit more flexible options
to store all the big data of massive
volumes what the organizations are
applications are generating so to
address all the big data needs and the
scalability needs so solar earlier was
not a big data scalable platform when I
am meant not Big Data scalable platform
solar was in its in its early stages was
only limited to master/slave
architecture so master/slave
architectures usually have the
scalability issues because it has
boundaries after in certain extent you
cannot scale master/slave architectures
okay so solar has evolved and it has
evolved into a more distributed
architecture in the latest versions and
it has dropped that scalability
bottlenecks or the scalability problems
and even it is now called as a no sequel
get a data base in in the no sequel
world okay so as I said so solar in the
current versions it's also treated as
the no sequel technology but when I say
no sequel it is not exactly like your
our DBMS storage engine or your our DBMS
database basically it is optimized for
big data scale
so now you can distribute your work
horizontally in Sola for indexing and
querying purposes within the cluster in
multiple nodes okay
so we were discussing do we discuss
about how do I distribute the queries
and all that stuff yes we will discuss
all those things I am just briefly
introducing all these aspects since it
is open source you don't have to worry
about buying any commercial licenses and
it is very simple web app so it can be
easily deployed and configurable it
doesn't come up with huge set of
configurations it's a simple web app
wire file you can just dump and set the
data locations you are all set you
should be ready to run very simple to
run and as I mentioned it is really
scalable for lots of lots of documents
so without any hazards so just in case
if you guys are wondering when I am
referring search engine it is not the
search engine what we are referring to
like say Google or Bing Google and Bing
they are completely different the crawl
web sites and they index the content for
searching the web site content and
taking to the right place
even though solar has been designed and
derived from the principles of the
search engine they both serve different
purposes altogether okay and also
sometimes people has some questions like
what is the correlation between solar
and SEO in fact there is no correlation
at all okay and
also solar as I mentioned it is
information retrieval engine the same
definition what he gave it for losing so
it extends that and provides lot of
additional features with lot of
flexibility on the schema and
distributed scale and lot of
extensibility on the plugins and
moreover it adds all the service access
for indexing and querying through HTTP
restful services okay so you can access
the solar index for indexing or for
querying a there or has should be
restful services on XML JSON CSV or
there are few other formats which we'll
be exploring okay for a brief history
about sonar so sonar
actually it started in seen it okay so
in seen it what happened was so there
was a need for adding search capability
for an in-house internal or interment
website so yannick is the guy who
derived this web app using the Lucine
libraries and provided the services or
HTTP so that anyone can access it so
they have contributed to open source and
it started evolving as a search platform
so in the recent four dot o which
includes the new solar cloud feature is
the one which is treated as a
significant breakthrough in the
architecture where now solar is more of
a distributed no sequel architecture
where you can go ahead and all those
aspects of horizontal scale and
distribute all the requests kind of
thing so when Kurt has a question can
you also give information on security in
solar definitely when could we are going
to cover a one portion there is a topic
on security and administration stuff
will definitely be covering that aspect
there okay so there is not there is no
lot of security or role-based axes or if
you are expecting something like
traditional RDBMS where you can restrict
the content based on role based on user
and based on operations and on that
level of security is not the concern of
solar on loosing even if you would have
noticed loosing does not tell you all
those things some level of security can
be rocked and it can be accessed or
restricted at the application to some
level of operations okay we will discuss
some of those things
so security is more of a convention
browser rather than enforcement in solar
so there are lot of types of securities
one is through convention and the other
one is through enforcement so the
enforcement when you code an application
it enforces you to follow that security
principles because it has been coded to
enforce in solar and in big data no
sequel technologies we don't follow the
enforcement methodology we follow it
with convention so if there is an
application which is talking internally
there there is an assumption that you
don't need enforcement's you can
mutually agree and you can mutually have
a consent saying that this security
concerns I will follow so the
application takes care of most of the
security aspects and when it deals with
the data it is dealing in a responsible
way that it won't abuse or it won't hack
the database there are some things which
we'll discuss how to still secure it
from the applications okay fine so let's
see
little bit on the databases versus solar
so usually databases offers you
something like SQL syntax but the solar
are loosing also offer some level of
query parser where we have seen the
query syntax but it is not the exactly
same and when you when it comes to
partitioning and on you may see some
level of sharding in these search
engines and very effective and very
stringent partitions in the IDB emesis
so most of the our DBMS follow the
master/slave or the cluster for load
balancing and data distribution in solar
we do follow master/slave as well as the
distributed or the horizontal scale no
seek where the cloud solar cloud model
which will be discussing consistency
it's not that strong but it is treated
eventually it will be consistent so
there are no concepts of foreign keys or
constraints kind of a thing so in
traditional databases you can put
constraints you can have relationships
you can have constraints on the columns
so so Lakshmi Khan has a question what
is Charlie ok I'm charting is nothing
but say if you have a huge table of data
which cannot fit everything into one
table it is similar to partition we
sometimes people also refer refer it as
shards
so table partition is nothing but
physically they separate the table
content within the same physical
hardware in the same database when it
comes to shards shards does not
recommend to separate the same data in a
same physical machine rather it
separates the content onto a totally
complete different machine so it's like
the same table half the data is in with
machine one and half the data is in
Machine 2 that's the basic difference so
but when you access through a framework
or a platform so for the application or
for the user it is seamless and the user
doesn't know that it is in three
machines and it seems like you are
querying a system and you are getting
all the data from one place so you keep
shouting the data based on the size are
based on the range of the tokens and all
that stuff the partitions it is a little
bit different so it can be also stored
in different machines but most of the
time it is only the splitting of the
table into smaller chunks but not only
the focus is not on splitting into
machines primarily the both are used for
similar reasons just to keep the data
size smaller fine so the transaction
concepts are dbmss are very strong in
acid properties but when it comes to
solar it is more of a optimistic locking
and in databases they are pessimistic so
databases are more proactive in locking
and
solar is more of a optimistic so that
there could be lot of flexibility and
room in multiple threads reading or
writing into the same content okay so in
pessimistic locking so once a table or
record is locked no other session or no
other user can access but an optimistic
locking so even though if someone is
locking so it is allowed to you to write
from all the sessions at all point of
time so after that the merging and the
updating happens based only recorded
timestamp of that version of the data on
that particular record okay so Lakshmi
Khan has a question can I use solar as
LTP I mean for more frequent reads and
updates absolutely no if you have an
OLTP kind of in need so that is not the
right choice
so solar is recommended when you have
read dominant pre-show versus right and
that - definitely not
o LTP needs or it appears like online
transactions so you cannot run huge
online transactions like booking a
flight booking so what people usually do
is for searching and displaying they use
solar when they go for booking or
placing the order they use a traditional
databases so in large scale applications
or systems there is no one single
database which will provide all these
features you have to use a hybrid of
database system okay
so in fact solar also provides a lot of
concurrent reads and writes and when it
comes to speed or freeze so there is
much more faster and much more efficient
in reads but it is bit slower in writes
because it has to index the content and
it would be definitely bit slower not
bit in fact very pretty much slower
compared to your hardy BMS okay
so that was just the high-level overview
of the ADI BMS and the solar so some of
the features which we've already spoken
so just just to give so it is a
full-blown full-text search capability
with lot of features like suggestions
highlighting spatial search facets
grouping joins lot of other things ok
and it is optimized for web scale
everything can be accessed over HTTP
services XML jason has should it be and
few more other for other formats and you
have lot of administrative interfaces to
manage and control this all our cluster
RB interface everything all the basic
statistics can be accessed through the
JMX monitoring and it has lot of
scalability by having auto failover lot
of application and all that stuff so we
had a question like is it really good
for me to how so
if if I have a need of a real-time OLTP
where I have frequent reads and updates
happening in fact I would recommend not
to use it but still solar claims it to
be providing that near real-time
indexing so when I say me a real-time
indexing it is not immediate but it is
still faster okay
so it may happen in few minutes in some
cases based on the documents and based
on the size and it may take few seconds
as well but compared to traditional hard
appearances most of the times it would
turn back within few milliseconds so
that's the basic difference and as I
said it has everything configured and
customizable through XML configurations
and lot of extensible plugins as well so
some of the features which I did not
mention is like you could do pagination
sorting spell checking geospatial search
all that stuff so we have seen the
briefing of faceting highlighting and
synonyms stop words everything whatever
we have seen can be done in solar the
way how we used to do in solar is by
writing java code but in case of but in
case of solar everything can be
configured in XML configurations ok
one thing which we have not seen in
losing is there is lot of features like
spell checking Auto suggestions which
will be very handy in most of the cases
when the user is typing something wrong
and I would like to correct him and ask
him is this what he's meant ok so if I
had to divide the features so I would
divide it into three sections so the
user experience features like the
pagination and sorting the face setting
which we will explore it more in detail
but we have seen glimpse of it in Lucene
and also using the Flipkart example so
the author suggestion is not nothing but
the drop-down this is what we are
referring and I am saying autocomplete
so what I am saying quad-core mobile I
am getting list of recommendations
exactly is this what you are looking by
looking into some of these carbon
documents which people are searching so
spell-checking is if someone is typing
some wrong word so it would recommend me
the exact spell with the exact words
with the right Spelling's highlighting
is basically you highlight the term in
the document when you get the results
back special search is basically used
for location-based search and most of
the time on the lat/long so the data
modeling is basically like grouping
collapsing the free lead and the
flexible query supports document
clustering importing rich documents
using both solar cell and importing data
from relational databases and lot of
multi-language support
we will see some of these features user
experience features will explore
everything data modelling will see most
of it whatever is required for our
application and in solar dot 4 dot o
there are some features like near
real-time read and near real-time
indexing we'll explore all of those
concepts and real time get transaction
logs
we'll see how do we do the for dot o
architecture with sharding applications
and zookeeper we'll cover all of these
topics okay most of it fine so we are
saying solar extends loosing so it has
most of the things exactly the same with
additional features ok so you could have
all the types whatever losing supports
directly available in solar and you
could have the same loosing query
language with some additions to it lot
of faceted and filtering aspects which
is enhance and lot of geospatial filters
also extended and all the API coding is
done through configurations so the class
choosing which analyzer which filter all
that stuff is configured in XML and
moreover you have lot of admin
administrative UI where you can use it
I think we have seen this so it is near
real-time for faster search and index
you can distribute the search or index
across multiple nodes in the distributed
environment or in solar cloud kind of a
setup so as I mentioned there are
multiple formats we will see that other
than j is a maximal CSV and you can
directly also get the few language code
like PHP as their response from your
solar server or who be kind of things
and you can also import lot of rich
content and we can have lot of plugins
as well great
so just a very few I am NOT going
through the entire list most of the big
companies are using blue scene this is
just losing solar this is just a small
list maybe there is a huge set of people
who are using it yeah maybe I think
there is lot of people in fact I'm not
sure this list is the updated one but in
fact there are a lot of people who are
solar implementations and their
organizations for search leads
