we'll be seeing some good practical
examples right here in ArrayList the
ArrayList is a class rlist class as a
concrete implementation of the list
interface ashraf says dynamic size
allocation exactly correct
from the per se sequence of data praana
says elements the word is dynamic
dynamic size allocation that is not
present in array if you are if you do
not require the dynamic size allocation
there is no need for dynamic allocation
then it has always said that instead of
using array list you should always use
an array okay so the oiliness ArrayList
class is a concrete implementation of
the list interface allows duplicate
values within it okay a list can grow
our string dynamically that is the main
advantage that is the significance of an
ArrayList nowadays it can grow and
shrink dynamically on the other hand
array is fixed once it is created that
was big demerit of an array now if your
application does not require insertion
or deletion of elements the most
efficient data structure is array as I
said before so this is a small diagram
that depicts an RLS so you got ArrayList
that is present in util Java
size 5 the size of the ArrayList is 5
right now because 5 elements have been
inserted like raja ravi gaji maker sonny
and author okay so it will come like
this index always starts from 0 that is
0 1 2 3 4 like this ok now has anyone of
you seen the source code for an
ArrayList the actual implementation of
an ArrayList please write down on the
chat window and on this node I lost also
ask your question regarding ArrayList
Emma chase no what about the rest of you
so I says no yogi says no Astro says yes
pronoun say yes mine says yes yes and no
ok ashraf and pro now can you tell me
where i can find in my system the code
for an ArrayList
can you tell me can you start in this
from where instead of zero no concept is
done in key given that and it will be
starting from zero itself Ashraf says
Java dot util ArrayList package ok you
are quite specific but I would like to
show you maybe I've forgotten but still
let's try go to C Drive in your systems
as well go to users
sorry not users go to program files in
that go to Java folder and the job
folder go to JDK now in the jdk half you
can find this RAR file that is SRC file
that is source ok
just open it up in that you'll find Java
you'll find util and within that he can
find RLS right you can find out a list
of Java so this is the code so everyone
can you now find where is the code for a
realist when you open our top you'll
find it like this so just try to paste
it somewhere do something and try to
find out how it is actually implemented
okay so everyone is that clear to you
this was just some extra calls I wanted
to give it to you so that you can find
out you can tell someone that yes I know
where is the source code present on my
system for an ArrayList
similarly you've got the source code for
each and everything present on to your
system in your JDK ok moving on there
are several methods that are present
with an ArrayList that is like boolean
odd he passed the objects you can add an
object using the odd function void are
you pass the index and you pass the
element that has to be added boolean add
all you can pass the entire collection
you cannot the entire ArrayList like
that within this object not get you past
the index and you can get the object of
the ArrayList said you pass the index
you pass the object and it will set to
value
now object remove in index you just have
to pass the index you can remove the
value or the object on the element I
traitor okay I traitor is used fetching
technique pronounce a is exactly for
fetching technique science is maybe Luke
yes it axle has a loop so that you can
retrieve the elements of an array list
using I traitor
let's try traitor index off index of
gives the index of a mine says repeater
now index of gives the index of a
particular element last index off you
can use all those functions and try and
see what are the reserves that you are
receiving right size gives the size of
the array less clear clear CRLs okay
so first we'll understand what is an
ArrayList then we will see how to trace
the elements of ArrayList so I come here
in an ArrayList okay I've already used
an eye theater right here so I declared
an array list of a string tied so RLS
string ArrayList new ArrayList I pass
the string so this is the object of an
ArrayList that I created after that I
use the add function to add the values
so dot add rows not at Lily Tata just
mean and finally ro rose again so what
you can understand duplicate values have
been posted into the ArrayList as well
as using the index - I am removing a
particular element so if I pass - can
you tell me which element will get
removed now I make an object of an eye
crater which is using the which is
telling that a string type will be there
in the error less so you write R theta
equal to ArrayList dot I traitor okay
you task the I theta with here LS now
using the I theta you can access the
element by using a function that is
passed next so in while I theta dot has
nest till the time it is not false okay
it will go inside string element I Rita
dot next to string okay you can convert
the value to string and save it in the
element and finally print the element
when I run this code I received the
answer rose Lily Rose because I actually
deleted the value that was present on
the second index now if I write system
dot out dot println and I mentioned that
is ArrayList ok RLS dot index off and
within that I pass rose but can you tell
me what will be the result that I would
receive on the console window I run this
code and I receive ok
since I am printing in while loop it is
getting printed again and again ok run
this code again so Rose Lily Rose and I
receive 0 in the end ok
because slice is on an exception now it
won't give you an exception it will read
the first element and caught the index
and it will get back ok it won't go for
the second element now right now if I
what I do I come here oralist
not get index now if I pass to itself
now tell me what will be the result that
I would see I stop says rose so I'll
press control and f11 I receive rose
once again that's good
so you similarly you can use different
functions that are available with an
ArrayList and you can try it okay can
experiment with that getting back to the
presentation now how to trace the
elements of ArrayList you can use for
each loop you can use I theta you can
use list I traitor you can use
enumeration and of course you can use
for loop simple for loop while loop
do-while loop
okay so we'll be seeing each one of them
first of all before each loop its action
similar to follow it races through all
the elements of array or ArrayList okay
no need to mention the size of the
ArrayList just you have to write for
bracket string s and you pass the
ArrayList underscore name now what is
the significance of this line no need to
mention size of an ArrayList do you have
to mention the size of here LS in some
other loop okay the actual significance
is that in for each loop you do not have
to mention the size but if you are using
a simple for loop you have to give the
size of ArrayList as well so you'll be
using the ArrayList that is a realist
underscore name dot size function so
that you can get the size until that
time you can iterate the loop okay but
in case of for each loop you do not have
to do that you just have to pass the
structure like the RLS right here and
since you know this ArrayList is storing
the string elements so you create an
object string you create an variable of
a string back and datatype
okay so type of tada stored in a realist
and finally the name of ArrayList this
is how you'll be using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
