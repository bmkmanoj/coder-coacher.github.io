contract can you come here tell you tell
me what is a contract contract is an
agreement right i mean a formal kind of
an agreement okay to start with an
iconic contract is nothing but a formal
documentation within the team or a
vendor or a neckline so in you know you
ite terms it sells formal communication
did incarcerated in talking like witches
has this agreed upon between the project
team and a business and i can confuse
what would become and what would not be
covered what would be the scope of
project how the school project would be
handled and what are the third part is
that would be in a typical car
contracting so now how will a jail
contract different come a long way
contract in a waterfall model or
basically or any other software
lifecycle technique the project could be
fixed price as well where a fixed time
and fixed scopes but since we are a
giant we tend to avoid fixed price
thanks opus next time can one of you
tell me why we should have all surprised
and let's go fix time is FS ft similarly
with in the case of a fixed price if
let's assume if i stay okay i will
deliver this website and hundred dollars
because it thoroughly I thought just
we'll just take 20 20 hours of my effort
but eventually it since I was a giant I
started there was a creep the kids kick
started changing whatever was decided at
the very initial phase did not turn out
there to me and it took 50 hours of my
life but since it was a fixed price
contract I can't ask for more money but
I almost spent 150 percent of additional
effort right mm-hmm so in edge I
projects which price SSX it should be
avoided
best one of the best approach that is
recommended is fixed price for hydration
so for alteration in agile the size of
hydration remains fixed if in that
building of the project the size of
hydration is decided so between weeks or
maybe four weeks no matter what
hydration size does not increase
depending upon the situation we might
choose to draw a pickup in traditional
stories but the size of the iteration
would not increase so this would be a
reflective of the stories or the
features I delivered okay so one of the
best recommended technique is fixed
price hydration so my team had had eight
people 8 into 8 into 8 is 64 and 64 into
what 16 days probably in case of through
the earth to this for 15 days in the
case of three weeks it would be just
give the cost right I know the cost and
it would be a respective of the features
I give up right so one of the ways is
this another is progressive contracts so
the progressive contracts are the one
where we can have a variable scope or
tnm kind of a projects which again they
should be again based on for hydration
we should we cannot engage complete
project when we are working on a time
since the we are talking about we will
accept change so it should is we are
working on a TNR model as well it should
be based on each operation right then
there are certain other ones which are
like variable price and variable scope
fixed price for unit of work so for
example I say okay so this there is this
point story point do you have any idea
about the story point no okay no law
even took joy
okay so story for it is nothing but an
edge I when we have to describe the
complexity of those requirement we
define at in the story point or make
there is another thing which is used
which is called a t-shirt sizes right so
if i have a huge requirement i would put
it call it as excel if it's a small
requirement it would be small similarly
so we have small medium large XL in
double axel depending upon how big the
project is where as in numbers if i have
to define I a we generally use harmonica
series which is 1 2 3 5 and so on 5 8 13
and so on so so what we do is we charge
of the basis of a story point so now i
know my stories I know my requirements
ok I each requirement i give a story
point i define the complexity so based
on that i say okay any requirement which
i will take with three story points
would be charged for this mushroom hours
ago so it is calculated in the sense of
its analog into words by the time you
have one or two hour I treasures down
you would be able to gauge ok three
story points only takes five hours of
effort so this is how you can calculate
so these are the typical agile contracts
for me acting beds is a fixed price I
tration first and again if here we are
using p.m. it it should be again now
high pressure on basis of the expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
