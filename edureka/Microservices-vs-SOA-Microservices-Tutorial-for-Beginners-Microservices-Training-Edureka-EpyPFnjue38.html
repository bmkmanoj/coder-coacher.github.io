everyone present in this session my name
is Vardhan and on behalf of Frederica i
will be delivering this session and this
session is about the difference between
the applications which are implementing
SOA which is service-oriented
architecture and software applications
which are implementing the micro
services architecture so without wasting
any time let me get started now before
we go into details about SOA and micro
services let's see what is a monolithic
application and how that functioned
first of all you can think of a
monolithic application as a container
which is basically hosting a number of
software components right there can be a
number of software components as part of
your software application and if they
are all hosted together and delivered
together then that's called a monolithic
application now there are various
challenges with any software application
which is implementing the monolithic
architecture first of all they are not
flexible
okay monolithic applications they cannot
be built using different technologies
that's the problem the second challenge
is that they are unreliable even if one
feature of the system does not work then
the entire system will not work the
third challenge is that these monolithic
applications are not scalable they
cannot be easily scaled and even if the
application needs to be updated then the
complete system has to be rebuilt the
next problem is that with these
monolithic applications they block
continuous development all the features
cannot be built and deployed at the same
time they will have to be done
separately the next challenge with
monolithic applications is that the
development is very slow they take a lot
of time to be built since each and every
time every feature has to be built one
after the other and most of all the
monolithic applications are not fit for
complex architecture because of course
you cannot use different technologies
you're very limited and very constrained
right so that is the challenge with
monolithic applications so now let's go
on to so8
which is nothing but a service-oriented
architecture now with SOA these services
or features they are broken down right
the entire software application is not
built as one but the different features
and the different services are broken
down
two smaller components right so that's
why it's called coarse grained
architecture and over here if we have
let's say one software application
inside which it provides and if it
provides like five features or four
features then all those off word
features are delivered by four different
services and that is what you can see
over here right there are four different
services and each of these services
would have multiple tasks inside them
and these smaller tasks are together
Delaware has one particular feature and
the whole software application comprises
of a number of these features but with
micro services it's a little more
different now these features or services
are further broken down into task level
services so here it was feature level
services whereas the services here they
are task level each and every task in a
particular feature that was broken down
and that's why you have multiple tasks
and multiple services in a micro service
architecture and that is why this is
called fine grained architecture so that
is what the differences are between
these three on a high level now before I
go further and confuse you people let me
just go into more details about the
differences between SOA and micro
services you can think of the difference
between SOA and micro services with the
help of these images so SOA is like an
orchestra similar to you having multiple
performers you will have multiple
services but each of these performers
will be controlled by one particular
actor and similarly in s away even
though you have multiple services these
services will be interacting with one
another and then they will be delivered
as one particular software application
but whereas in case of a micro service
there are multiple or let's say there
are independent performers but these
independent performers are not
controlled by any director so they work
separately and they work in silos so
that is a difference so I hope you can
understand the difference between the
two from these images right even though
they work together they are controlled
by one particular director and that's
why this is called a centrally governed
architecture and whereas micro services
you do not have a centrally Garn
architecture and that's why it's called
a decentralized governing architecture
so let me go forward and talk about
the difference between these two which
is nothing but microservice and s away
with respect to certain parameters let's
look at the difference between them with
respect to architecture and coordination
so first of all in SOA there are four
different types of services versus
business service the next is enterprise
service then we have application service
and then we have infrastructure service
so these four service types together
form your SOA and they together deliver
your software application now what are
these different services and what do
they do
let's see that first is business service
right so your business service is the
one that's going to be performing your
core business operations and it can be
either a represented by your XML or by
web service definition language and then
we have Enterprise Service the
enterprise services or that service
which implements the functionality
defined by your business service and the
Enterprise Service does it with the help
of the application service and the
infrastructure service now moving on we
have application servers the application
service is the actual core application
or the core functionality of that
feature and these application services
can be either
invoked directly or they can be invoked
through a user interface and now we have
an infrastructure service the
infrastructure service refers to those
non-business or those non-technical
operations such as auditing scaling or
security and all these things those are
the different services in a SOA but in
case of micro services architecture you
do not have these many types of services
you just have a functional service and
you have a infrastructure service the
functional service is basically the
combination of a business service and
enterprise service and an application
servers now a functional service is a
fine-grained service so basically if
your business logic or your business
operations requires a particular feature
to work then the task that is related to
exactly that particular feature that is
performed by the functional service and
besides the functional service we have
an infrastructure service and the
infrastructure service over here is very
similar to the infrastructure service
that is there in SOA the it does all the
non business or the non-technical
operations such as
your security auditing and logging okay
so that is the difference with respect
to architecture and coordination so now
moving on to the next slide we have
heterogeneous interoperability now what
this means is any software application
and need not be developed on the same
programming language now when your main
a software application you might have
smaller applications right and each of
those smaller applications could be
written on Java or it could be written
on Aussie dot dot net or it could be
written on c-sharp or Python or anything
now when it's written in different
programming languages it's tough for
them to interact with one another and if
you want the different services to
communicate with one another
then you would have to bring a
particular platform right so that's
where you have this messaging middleware
so in case of SOA there is something
called as a messaging middleware which
acts as a communication point or the
interaction point between the different
applications which are in a different
language so you can see that this
application is on either C shark or
dotnet and this is on classic Java beans
right so lonely here it's c plus plus
and here is Java so and all of these
communications they go through this one
culture messaging middleware but in case
of microservices
we do not have any broker here the
communication happens directly between
application to application even if they
are in different programming languages
even if they are structurally different
and even if they are built in different
grounds so look at this if you have a C
shot or a dotnet application which is
communicating with a java application
but then how does it happen it happens
with the help of a REST API there is a
direct communication between these two
services and similarly if you have
another java application which wants to
communicate with another java
application the communication would take
place with the help of REST API
Thanks similarly Java to C sharp or
dotnet would again take place with the
help of a REST API so there is no broker
here or middleman which is a messaging
middleware the communication is directly
to the other application then comes
service granularity if you can remember
I earlier told that in micro services
you do not have the software delivered
as a whole right it is broken down into
smaller features and if you are
basically performing an operation which
involves multiple
applications or multiple services then
those services are called by one another
when it's needed so as an end user as a
consumer you might be performing one
operation okay
so that one operation would not be
calling all the different services it
would call one service and this service
when it needs to interact with the
second service this would make the call
to service too and similarly your
service too when needed it would call a
service number three and similarly the
ones the service requested made the
service response is also given to the
one that's invoking the request now the
cat showed us each and every service
request and service response takes 100
milliseconds okay so let's assume it
takes this much time the API calls and
this is in case of micro services so in
the - of this architecture when each
call takes 100 milliseconds in total for
this service to get successfully
returned it would take 600 milliseconds
now that's an awful lot of time for an
API call to complete successfully right
for an API call to be made successfully
and to be returned and this is where it
is different from an SOA so in case of
an SOA the service consumer would again
be calling would be would be performing
one particular operation and what
happens here is this operation would be
calling the different services all at
the same time so the operation over here
would be calling the service number one
service number two and service number
three it should be encompassed all
together so one particular call will be
made to the service and all three would
be so is at the same time and by this
you would be saving time because all the
three requests and responses would be
made simultaneously so you would be
saving a good 400 milliseconds over here
so that is the difference in service
granularity between SOA and micro
services so the next difference we are
going to see is with respect to
component sharing this is very similar
to the previous slide again right
because then it would be the same order
service which would be interacting with
your different smaller applications each
for customer management and for various
management and for order fulfillment
and the data again would be stolen
different databases but there again is
the difference in microservices because
in the micro services architecture for
each and every application so for
customer management we have a separate
order service and that order service
would be accessing its own database for
various management you have a separate
order service which will be accessing a
different database and then for order
fulfillment which is again a different
application this would be using a
different order service and this order
service would be using a different
database from where it would be
accessing data right so that's how
there's a difference in even component
sharing between these two architectures
and then we have the next difference
between them and that is the middleware
busses API layer this we also spoke
about earlier right
your SOA uses middleware for
communication and your micro-services
uses an API layer for communication so
that is about the differences between
SOA and micro services now let's go
ahead and look at the differences
between the two
by understanding within an example of a
shopping cart so every e-commerce portal
will have a shopping cart right where
you can add your products to the cart
and then you can check out later so for
adding an item for removing an item for
checking what is the tax for checking
the total bill amount for all those or
things you have a shopping cart
application and then finally we have
another application which is the main
application which gives details about
the product so it will give us details
about the product name what is the
product ID what is the product
rate how many quantities are present and
all different other options right what
color the product is and all these
things now these are three different
applications and when they work together
you get the complete software
application right now each of these
applications would have smaller tasks a
shopping cart application like I told
you before it would have an add or
remove functionality where you can add a
product your cart you can remove a
product from your cart you can check
what is the bill in your cart you can
check out what is the tax that is there
and all these things similarly if you
talk about a product catalog you have
other tasks right so all these tasks
together form one particular application
service in case of s of a shopping
application
but in case of microservices shopping
application each of the different tasks
that these services provide those tasks
are broken down into smaller
fine-grained services so here we have
feature level services where shopping
cart is one feature product catalog is
one feature and user account application
is one more feature but in case of micro
services we have a separate billing
service for shipping we have a shipping
options service we have a tax
calculation service right with the
different tasks in this particular
feature it's broken down similarly for
product catalog application we have
different task level breakdown such as
display products service we have an
update display service we have user
default service and many more similar
for user account application right we
have a send email service and many more
now that you've understood that micro
services is all about breaking a
particular feature or a feature level
service into task level services so
let's see how micro services shopping
application is different so first let's
take the case of where a micro service
shopping application is better so here
we'll have bar certain features which
are common to multiple applications
right so we have but something like a
display image service so it's a smaller
task level service over here but the
image of the product of being displayed
might be common across all the three
applications it might be present in the
shopping cart also and the image of the
product might be present in the user
account application also with us showing
which are the products which the
particular user bought and then you
might have the product you might have
the image of the product in the product
catalog
application also so in this case if
there's a change in the image dimensions
or in the license of the image or
anything with respect to the products
image then the code of course would be
similar in all the three applications
right the code may be similar but the
code has to be changed everywhere right
and when you change the code when you
rework then it causes a lot of problem
and ghin now when you change the code
here you are changing the functionality
and that might cause this particular
application to behave abnormally it
might have bugs or the application might
cause a failure and similarly if you
change the code over here then even this
might throw errors and
you might have bugs similarly to this
particular application also so if you
want to avoid all those things you have
to test each of these applications
separately after changing the code and
after updating the required details and
after testing it you'll have to deploy
each of these applications and you have
to deploy them separately now all these
things is time consuming right so it is
the same change that you are doing
across all the different parts of your
application but even though you're doing
it everywhere even though you're doing
something similar you will have to test
and deploy each of them and sometimes
you might have errors in only one
particular application and not
everywhere so these are all time
consuming tasks but if it's in case of a
microservices shopping application you
would not have this problem because all
the different tasks over here they are
provided as a service if you want to
change the way the products image looks
then you will have to change only this
particular application right so by only
changing this service your job will be
done you do not have to worry about the
other services and you do not have to
change anything over there so the main
change you will have to be doing will be
restricted to only this particular
service so you save time and you save
effort over here in case of
microservices shopping application and
this was a use case where the
microservices shopping application was
better but then there are also Tiny's
when an SOA shopping application is
better for you so this was a classic use
case of where a microserver shopping
application is a best fit but let's see
a use case where an SOA type of a
shopping application and the SOA
architecture comes out better and that
example is when your product is not
actually that big so in this case yeah
you have a lot of functionalities you
have a lot of features and tasks so just
consider the example of a very simple a
software application which show needs
three primary functionalities one misses
our shopping cart which into where you
can add your raw or you can add your
items and then you have another user
account application where you will have
the user profile and then you will have
a product information application right
so over here all these different
applications will not have too many sub
level features or sub level applications
yeah very straightforward they are very
simple in this case if you are having if
you're implementing microservices
architecture then you will have to go
through a lot of trouble this
you'll simply be avoided because your
application is in itself very simple you
have to just you know create one one
website where you can have one website
in which you have a cart wherein you can
add your products which you want to buy
then when you are checking out you can
have the user information displayed and
then you have details about the product
which is a separate application so in
this case it could just be these three
different services so that is a
difference between an SOA so I think by
now you understand that neither of them
is better than the other right so there
are times when micro services is
preferred and there are times when SOA
is preferred and you cannot hard-coded
by saying that one is better than the
other so on that note I would like to
conclude today's session so guys our
