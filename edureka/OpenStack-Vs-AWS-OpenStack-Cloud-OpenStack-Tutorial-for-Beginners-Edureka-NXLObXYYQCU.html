to few people and good morning to few
others and welcome to this session of
mastering OpenStack or you know as per
say the you know you will learn or get a
get a clarification on what basically
OpenStack is and what is interval us
what you need to pick up what you don't
need to pick up and and all those things
so we will have lot many things that we
will have in this introduction session
of OpenStack I will take you through the
slides and I will also take you through
what it Eureka has what modules they
have and what batches that they have so
that you guys can enroll yourself to the
sessions to the classes so this is an
introductory you know webinar for
OpenStack to get a clear picture of what
basically business what markets role
does it have and where does it actually
stand so before we get started
can I can I quickly get to know
everyone's technology and what they are
working on at this point of time it's
just a one word is fine with me to get
to know what you guys are working on
okay so we have a mixture of a lot of
people the different different domain ok
ok ok that's great ok that is fantastic
ok ok ok so we've a lot of people with
lot of different you know we're idea of
knowledge that they have the domains
that they have so every one of you have
same goal in your
that you need to know what OpenStack
basically is and why there is a there is
a you know there is a storm about
OpenStack and what it is talking about
these dates so we will move towards
understanding OpenStack step-by-step we
will go through a small introduction
about what OpenStack is we will
basically see how it looks like in an
environment and how you can actually
work on OpenStack
we may not be able to go into the
in-depth of any of the topics but we
will definitely grab an opportunity to
check the check though you know
infrastructure just a bit so we will see
that we will also discuss a little bit
about the differences between AWS and
OpenStack basically both of the
infrastructure as a service but there is
a different approach to both of them
the destination for both are the reason
for which they stand is kind of the same
but the way it is approached is a little
bit different so we will discuss about
that then there is when and where we
actually want to implement OpenStack
what kind of infrastructure will
basically support infra OpenStack we'll
see a little bit about DevOps and its
orchestration management tools so it's
basically about what is before open
stack and what is after OpenStack many
of you must already be aware of what is
before opens tab but we will brush it up
a little and we will discuss about
OpenStack and then there on their fourth
we will discuss what to do after after
we have you know an infrastructure or
a private cloud of our own with
OpenStack okay in the meantime I would I
would see or find certain amount of time
to discuss the questions that you guys
have and and we will see what you guys
have so I will address to the questions
later on so let's begin let's talk about
let's talk about what basically
OpenStack is my simple definition to
OpenStack is that it is a framework that
that facilitate a private cloud okay so
it has got certain set of modules
certain set of repositories which
facilitate you know or which facilitate
you to achieve a private cloud within an
organization this is also known as
infrastructure as a service because it
has delivered the infrastructure on the
top of it whatever applications and
whatever operating systems that you want
to deploy is completely your own choice
OpenStack is based on Linux platform so
if you guys who are wondering what about
Windows then at this point of time
OpenStack is not on on Windows platform
this is completely on a Linux platform
the contributors and the developers who
had come together for OpenStack they
specifically rely on Linux platform so
it could be anything it could be Debian
it could be Susie it could be that hard
or Ubuntu okay so it depends on what
kind of operating system that you want
to opt for but it specifically has to be
a Linux operating system to make the
OpenStack work properly OpenStack is
also an open source okay so it's it's
freely
to you out there so that you know you
guys can actually check the modules
deploy the modules in your production
environment it's basically very suitable
for the commodity hardware so the
infrastructures there there is not much
of the cost involved people usually do
want to go with the open star because
they don't want to spend a lot of money
with the other technology savory in
there where they have be realized or or
AWS so it's like it's the same model as
pay-as-you-go there it gives their out
there OpenStack has the infrastructure
which you guys will be supporting and
giving it to the customers and charging
them according to the utilizations that
they make so if you guys if anyone of
you guys have the front end you know
exposure to AWS you must understand that
when we talk about the OpenStack we mean
that we are standing at the back end but
not at the so we will not be the
utilizers but we will kind of create a
private cloud and give it to the
customers to utilize so this is same as
pay-as-you-go model which which is being
opted in AWS as well so this is this is
what is OpenStack there are many
contributors that have come to support
OpenStack there are many developers who
are working on various modules various
scripts configuration files of OpenStack
to help it grow stronger it's just been
like five years for OpenStack in the
market but it's it's really taking off
the pace you know so it's really good
for the infrastructure which is small
and doesn't want to invest too much
money into licensing and bind the new
hardware's which are upgraded updated
versions so it's safe to work on the
commodity hardware if you're if you're
if you're using open stuff okay
so let's that's that about OpenStack so
what it says is OpenStack is a set of
software tools for building and managing
the cloud computing platforms for both
public as well as the private clouds so
when you want to achieve a public cloud
that is possible when you want to
achieve a private cloud that is possible
so it's kind of a framework basically
when you want to achieve the cloud
functionality that the pay-as-you-go
model everything will be connected by a
networking in your infrastructure ok
backed by some of the biggest
organizations in the software
development this is as true as it gets
there are many companies marathas Red
Hat PayPal eBay HP Dell cluster safe
there these are just to name a few there
are many companies there are many
contributors to the OpenStack there is a
community of the developers for the
OpenStack where you know they are
constantly working on developing the
modules developing the scripts and
facilitating you with your
infrastructure so one thing that you
need to note about OpenStack is you
cannot expect a rental support out of
OpenStack because it is an open source
so the people who are working on the
Linux platform or who have an experience
on open source they would understand
that why there is no specific vendor
support which is available and how they
need to actually work around with the
things which are open source ok so
that's that's that's that's the basic um
you know um terminologies or the
statements which will introduce you with
to OpenStack ok so as we move along we
have many components which are there
basic components are compute modules
Network modules
well as the storage modules these
modules are integrated these are the
certain set of files which are
integrated with the infrastructure to
facilitate the cloud to facilitate the
private cloud one thing that has to be
noticed over here is that it is a shared
service so when you have the compute
module on the network module on the
storage module these are the shared
services when you create when you want
to create a cloud infrastructure using
OpenStack okay and the web interface
which is available for you within
OpenStack is a dashboard which is a
stateless GUI model which facilitate you
to provide a front-end the most flexible
way to approach OpenStack is wire become
online it's more stronger it gives you
more of you know openness towards the
configurations and the management mode
management of the tool so we will be we
will go through a lot of modules which
are there in OpenStack but these are the
building blocks of OpenStack say the
first one is to compute the second one
is the networking the third one is the
story and the rest is the way that you
actually want to access the OpenStack so
this is this is what basically OpenStack
is there is a very interesting history
that is associated with OpenStack
it was a basic it was a it was a project
initially by NASA one moment
okay so the the the the journey that
OpenStack had was initially with NASA
and it was not available to the public
they used it in their own private cloud
because of their own security reasons
then later on they launched it to the
public they launched it in the market it
was in it was um immediately picked up
because o because it was an open source
of course n companies they always
actually look up to something that is
cost effective and the way that they can
make use of the commodity hardware's in
the best possible manner so it was
launched to help the organization's with
their cloud computing services at that
point of time cloud was still a
challenge it is not still a challenge
way because we've achieved a lot many
things with the cloud but yes there are
still many challenges that we need to
face because cloud computing is not as
good as what we sleep or what we
expected to do so there are many
components you know in order to achieve
you or in order to provide you with the
cloud computing as I have already told
you like VMware has their own type in
cloud components then there is AWS so in
the similar manner then ladies OpenStack
it's a non-profitable and a corporate
funded entity so as you as I've already
told you that this is an open-source so
it's it's like you know various
companies or contributors they've come
together to work upon OpenStack it's an
open source and thereby the community of
it of the pulse there are more than more
than 500 companies that have joined this
project this is one of the fastest
growing open-source communities at this
point of time there are many other but
when it comes to the private cloud this
this is one of the best at this point of
time seeing the response that it is
getting these getting um you know it has
started grabbing up a lot of importance
it has started grabbing up a lot of beat
it so it's hard to actually neglect such
kind of technology
okay so then what are the components of
OpenStack so we had we had a slide
earlier which was stating the building
blocks of OpenStack where we needed some
compute resources where we needed some
networking component where we needed the
storage but let me chunk it down a bit
we will find that there are lot more
other modules which are also associated
with OpenStack there is the - phone
which I've already told you that the GUI
which is used to basically access the
infrastructure that is known as the
Verizon dashboard as you see on the top
of it eh otherwise it is going to be any
REST API or it is going to be the
command-line interface with which you
will access the infrastructure of
OpenStack then there are these services
which are compute Neutron storage in
storage there are many components which
are integrated there is Swift cylinder
that is Manila that is compute compute
means the resources so it's its CPU it's
your around its your formal disks the
CPU cycles
um the security groups the floating IPS
which are the public IP so these are the
pool which is included in the compute
module which helps you launch a
particular instance on the top of the
infrastructure the similar manner that
you launch our chilled my scene in a
VMware or in an Citrix environment or
maybe say hyper-v infrastructure within
Microsoft okay so it's in the same
manner the approach is a bit different
how you do it or how you achieve it then
there is another compute which is ironic
ironic is basically used to my use to
manage the hypervisor or the cluster of
hypervisors then there is telemetry
service which is scope which is
basically you know grabbing the metrics
the utilization of the resources then
there is triple
the niggas on heat orchestration module
it's the same as puppet or chef or salt
or ansible these are the orchestration
tools which are used to actually manage
the infrastructure when it comes to the
automation when you want to automate a
lot of things we we actually want to
depend on the orchestration tools
so either you use heat which is a module
which is already there with an open
stack or you can integrate it with the
other orchestration tools say puppet or
chef so it depends on what what modules
you are comfortable with then there is
the database management trove is one
database by default
Marya DB is used within OpenStack
you want to integrate it with any other
SQL database that is completely possible
then there is a message queue which is
known as the car rabbitmq is another
Message Queuing protocol which is used
in OpenStack then there is an identity
service so identity service is nothing
but the authentication and the
automation of authentication and
authorization service um which is
available to authenticate you when you
log into the OpenStack and give the
access to any other modules within the
OpenStack then there is data processing
which is suhara
same as what you have is a indicator or
group so if you want to have an
infrastructure for the big data or
Hadoop you want to have the Sahara
module also added to your infrastructure
so that it can support your data then it
is a key management
Barbican and the DNS management system
which is known as the Signet so you have
designate facilitate your domain
services easily so that change that that
relieves a lot of your own headache um
so these are these are the modules but
these are not just the modules with
OpenStack there are not many monuments
there is the resep there is cluster FS
there are ready to integrate this
OpenStack with the underlying VMware
infrastructure
okay so these these things make
OpenStack ok these this when you have
these things in your infrastructure this
will give you a complete feel a complete
look of infrastructure where you can
achieve a private cloud of your own
within an organization okay so these are
the components of OpenStack so this is
the similar thing when we are talking
about this Center we are talking about
the storage when we are talking about
the neutron we are talking about the
networking so these are the
terminologies which are basically used
in OpenStack okay
when we talk about this wealth we mean
that we are talking about the object
store when we are talking about the
glance glances animate service where you
upload your images then there is Nova
which is the compute module but there is
Keystone which is known as the identity
service and then there is rice and
dashboard so these these are the
terminologies which we need to
understand which is which is the
standard terminology is used in
OpenStack OpenStack even though it is an
open source it follows these standards
which are out there in the work so you
don't have to worry about it not working
with something you know some other
third-party plugins because it follows
the standard so you can always integrate
this with the third-party plugins as
much as possible so let's say the
storage components will have lot of
third parties you might have storage
provided by the Dell or or by the IBM or
a
see those third-party drivers can easily
be integrated with OpenStack and you
wouldn't have much of a problem in
integrating the volumes okay so um now
that we float about OpenStack we we want
to compare the differences between what
is OpenStack and what is AWS AWS is also
something which is infrastructure as a
service which is being provided to you
in the market it has been there for a
very very long time basically so it is
it is like safe to say that EWS is at
this point of time the main competitor
in the market and it's it's basically on
the top it's it's safe to say that it is
basically on the top but um what makes
OpenStack different from EWS the first
thing is the naming conventions which
are being used so the way your AWS works
um is nothing more different in what we
want with OpenStack
but yes the infrastructure in OpenStack
is completely based on the Linux and the
modules which you install in OpenStack
is in your hand okay so it's easy to
work around with the files if you're a
Linux administrator you would find
yourself much more comfortable with
OpenStack the naming conventions are
different so you can always google
around with what naming conventions is
being used the most important ones which
people aren't most familiar with in AWS
is EBS s3 and ec2 so easy to is like a
compute node in OpenStack which is known
as Nova history in AWS is known as Swift
in OpenStack EBS in AWS is known as
cinder in OpenStack okay so um those of
you who have already had an exposure in
it
Louis you would find a openstack a
little bit similar to walk with but with
better exposure basically yeah so then
there's yeah and and of course um the
orchestration in EWS is known as cloud
formation and in OpenStack it is known
as heat okay so that's that's that's one
difference so when you have when you
have an open stack look and feel when
you when you actually install its
modules work around with the single node
as well as the multi node and dance
around with the files you you find
yourself much more closer with
infrastructure you find that the
infrastructure is kind of in your hands
to make basically modulate or work
around with it becomes not more easier
to operate it in that way that's what
open stacks mean in is okay so that's
what I said if you are a Linux
administrator you would find yourself
much more comfortable with OpenStack
if you are more of a GUI kind of person
you might find yourself comfortable with
AWS
now it depends upon your interest self
interests and of course the interest of
an organization that what it wants okay
so DevOps and the difference of
different orchestration tools so we've
discussed what is before open stack what
is open stack what then so once you have
an open stack infrastructure up and
running
and you're ready to go out there in the
market and and you call the customer
says well what do you want to do then
you obviously have achieved African
infrastructure now what do you want to
do later on you want to orchestrate you
want to automate the system you want to
do the less manual work and you want to
be poor dependent on the automation
that's where puppet chef rocker ansible
sauce
these these stools come into picture so
you can always integrate OpenStack with
these tools again the choice of the
tools is um something that you want to
understand yourself that which one you
are comfortable with and the way the out
plate is different so which one you're
comfortable with you want to opt for it
and then integrate it with your private
cloud okay so that will give you a
better infrastructure that will give you
a better focus on what do you want to do
you can invest more of your time into
quality work leave the rest of these
things on the automation so so that's
what OpenStack will do that's what you
should do that's how you should approach
you should know what is before open
stack then what you need to know before
you start learning about OpenStack and
what do you want to do after you've
learned OpenStack again so before I go
into a little bit of a look and lookie
of OpenStack um I'll just take a couple
of questions that you guys have so um
someone is asking is still ops training
is given at at Eureka
so the answer is yes
OpenStack um we can install just AWS
also be done in the same way basically
no that's not how
AWS have their way so that's not an open
source okay just what does it support
Windows operating system no it's just
not as simple as that it is not red head
is not providing OpenStack support so
again it's it's like it's like you um
it's like you asking me that you watered
audit from swiggy or from one restaurant
and then you ask swiggy that are you not
going to give me the support out of it
so sweetie is only responsible to answer
or deliver its responsibilities only to
deliver so great hat of course we'll
help you out with its server um with its
red hats at like the world's or with
other modules but if then when it comes
to a big because infrastructure when you
integrated a lot of OpenStack tools
where hat may not be of use for you okay
OpenStack sits on the top of the Linux
levels yes what is orchestration
orchestration basically means automation
okay
can we launch our windows vm in the
OpenStack environment yes of course you
can do that
who is mantas and what they actually do
paralysis is basically a third party
which is the voting OpenStack this is
Sudhir certain set of the flippers who
are working neurons is has got their own
OpenStack so they have their own virtual
machines being launched you have to have
to cut your box state the virtual
machine in um change certain set of
files and you can have your own
OpenStack running
Red Hat has our do Ubuntu has canonical
branches has their own so they have
their own okay so different different
Linux supporters have their own versions
of OpenStack okay so that's what it is
um so um let's take a look a little bit
of the look-see on how its gonna be
looking like oh then we have in
OpenStack running in our environment so
just stay put for a couple of minutes
till I take a look see so so I have I
have my arm
OpenStack running in my own lab set up
at this point of time okay so this is
this is like the front
and login that you get while you when
you install your OpenStack for the first
time and when you want to log into the
infrastructure why are the GUI
so all you have to do is you have to
give your credentials into the
infrastructure of course your services
should be up and running for to
facilitate your login and to facilitate
the authentication this is a bit slow
because of the resources available but
yeah so there you go so this is no it's
gonna look like um you're gonna have you
know your compute where you could see
your overview instances that means the
virtual machines the volumes means the
disks rise which is being added to the
virtual machines your images your access
and security then then there is your
network then there is your orchestration
which which which is basically your
automation where you want to work with
so this is your heat module then then
there is your object store then your
admin profile with lot of information
then your identity so this is how it
looks like tically from the GUI so this
is this is your horizon dashboard it
should be properly integrated with your
I mean your apache' should be working
properly and nicely for this to work
properly then then you know you can you
can access your infrastructure from the
dashboard at the same time you can in
you can you know um access your
infrastructure with your command line as
well so I have to
source myself to the admin and I can
have you know the stages for all the
services which are running so there will
be many services which will be running
in the OpenStack which will give you the
front end you know look and feel of how
these how this looks and how the
services are working with the services
are up or not whether they're active or
not if they're not active if they're not
working properly if your module is not
incomes occurred in the right manner you
will not be able to access your
infrastructure properly and you might
run into certain kind of errors but then
again it completely depends on what you
want how you've configured the
infrastructure what you're chosen to
download and what you've chosen to
implement what you've not chosen to
implement ok so this is how it sits it's
going to look like um now this is going
to load a lot of things for me at this
point of time so this is going to go on
and on and on and on and it's going to
tell me what are the things that are
there in my infrastructure so what's
going to tell me um modules um what are
the computes I'm running what are the
images that I have in my infrastructure
what are the flavors that I am using
what are the instances which are up and
running what is the status of those
instances a lot more things basically
it's going to tell me a lot many things
so yeah so this this is how you're going
to access the command line ah and then
there is your authorized and dashboard
so you have two ways of accessing the
OpenStack unless you have any other REST
API for you to facilitate the access of
OpenStack so this just look feel of how
it's gonna look
um you know and how this infrastructure
is basically build upon ok so um let's
let's go back to the slides and let's
continue from there on so ok ok
so this is this is this is what it's
basically OpenStack is there a lot many
modules within OpenStack the one
important thing that you must know is
OpenStack you can learn OpenStack but
you have to give a lot of before it you
have to try a lot and feel a lot many
times so um that's how you're going to
learn um what basically it is and how it
works to basically understand the
infrastructure ok so once you get once
you get to know it it's it's really
interesting to work upon ok so these are
the batch details which are available to
you I hope you guys already had a
discussion or already had a conversation
over it so we basically have a 42 hours
40 to 42 hours of classroom you know and
we have got a lot of assignments at the
same time for you guys to do so
assignments is something that you guys
need to do and apart from the
presentations that we have so you guys
can actually you know go ahead and take
a look and feel of it we have usually
the weekend classes which are on
Saturdays and Sundays um you have got an
offer which is 50 for 15% off at this
point of time
it will be valid till 17th of June so
you guys can you know call it Utica and
ask them for the details the recording
of this session will be mailed to you
within 24 hours and presentation will
also be shared to you guys so you know
get a closer picture of the recordings
the modules which are basically carried
upon and open in in in mastering for
OpenStack is we have no car neutron
glance Keystone Salvatore heat strobes
central logins endo ends with these
these are these are the basic basic
components of OpenStack for you to
actually achieve the infrastructure so
these these are the discussions that we
carry upon when we you are taking this
taking the batches so so you guys can
you know go ahead and enroll yourself or
if you have any queries or if you are
interested in in any other modules you
can call the it Eureka support and these
guys are there to help you out 24/7 so
you guys should call them up and take
their help in deciding what you want to
do of course I do want to talk about the
opportunities of open sister again this
is something of your interest whether
you want to take it up or not
OpenStack certainly is a very you know
um adaptive open source technology at
this point of time the case people are
slowly is slowly moving towards cloud
computing they will not slowly they've
already moved towards cloud computing
and OpenStack is one of the fastest
growing platform which is available
today so it's more challenging it's more
to actually implement it's it's more
challenging it involves more learning it
involves more often awkward it involves
more of an upfront work to understand
the infrastructure it's it's it's very
mature at this point of time considering
that it has been in the market for five
years people basically claims that they
they have successfully achieved a
hundred percent of you know
infrastructure private cloud
infrastructure with the help of
OpenStack
but still they have to be dependent on
VMware networking components because
they are the strongest out there in the
market so there are many tools that
requires to be integrated with OpenStack
when I say about open-source I get not
many questions asking that does this
mean that OpenStack is free of cost I
would say that yes
OpenStack are the modules are free for
you to just download and then implement
but it's not just a standalone component
you you will need a lot many tools to
actually you know support your huge
infrastructure where there are thousands
of nodes you know and and you require
big tools to help you out with lot many
Logging's
ticketing access database so there are
not many things which are there to
understand okay so you guys should
always keep a bigger scenario in the
picture and understand what basically
OpenStack is and why it is there in the
market of course there are lot many
opportunities which are there for
OpenStack um so it is going to stay for
the next five years unless there is
something else which comes and
challenges it but yes yeah there are
there are many there are many you know
the market is pretty good for OpenStack
even the packages are pretty good if you
have this skill add it into your resume
a so you guys can actually you know
accordingly
my heart so to go ahead and actually
learn this so this is this is what the
career is with OpenStack ah
does it Erica help the trainees for the
jobs
um ah haha i I'd rather have you
contacted Utica support for this but um
I guess no I don't think so but you guys
can ask them will you provide the lab X
access to OpenStack um to do the
practice Oh what we basically actually
do here is that we we try to actually
help you set up your own lab the basic
lab okay so that you you could you would
access the infrastructure and understand
the modules so you know that's what will
help you to basically so if you require
further access or support you guys can
call the edge Erica to ask them okay
that what what's you if you require um
the infrastructure support you can
definitely ask them any courses on Sdn I
don't know I am not aware of Sdn so you
can ask the Eureka for the SDF much in
my course of mastering OpenStack no okay
so does anyone else have any questions
yes she was that is feasible that is
feasible a heterogeneous environment is
completely feasible um yeah you you will
have to develops training as well so if
you actually go to the devil go to the
Eureka and check the courses they you
can actually see you know I should be
able to actually yeah I mean I should be
able to actually show you guys um just
just hang on a moment
let me just which one is better AWS
OpenStack actually I would rather who
rather have you on so this yourself okay
I mean look you can understand once you
learn both the technologies you can find
yourself where you basically stand okay
so um I think you can see over here what
they what they have they're fighting
here over years who have it over here
the box so yeah so you can choose that
okay
so you guys can actually go to the site
and please look around the site choose
what you want to opt for if you wanna go
for the box or you wanna go for pythons
you wanna go for her ooh do you wanna go
for OpenStack you have them the curses
you know listed over here you can come
over here in your coaster session yeah
and then you can check okay
certification is completely your own
choice one which we have is the CL two
one zero
openstack once you have that much string
openstack you can they all move forward
with the other consoles or the other
certifications of OpenStack
okay what is the objective of OpenStack
course um what do you think is the
objective of OpenStack what in your
Tom's is the objective of even learning
OpenStack it's like asking what is the
what is the need should learn Java and
killer dotnet what is the need to learn
dotnet within his fight and what is the
need to learn Python if there is C C++
doubt sessions it depends on what kind
of lecture that you have in your course
okay if you have taken what what course
they want to take how they want to take
it it depends upon the instructor and
yes of course we are here to actually
clarify the doubts all the time okay
so if you have any issues with the setup
or anything of course we will help you
out that's what this video here so okay
guys I mean if you guys have any more
questions and he yes one more thing um
if you guys want to go ahead and learn
or know what the Manu who's that is that
that it take two while we go through the
mastering of OpenStack open to the sky
trophy dear a car go to the courses and
check out the check out the the content
that they have the course cut it they
have um you know while while they're
going to the OpenStack sessions okay so
that way that will help you over to see
you what you want to learn what you want
to know or whether it is suitable for
you at the post please if it is not then
don't take it out if it is then you take
it up okay so you guys should should be
very um you know understand and nibble
on what you want basically at the first
place
so go ahead and you know um scroll
around I mean they're not gonna charge
you on just scrolling around with the
courses so please do that okay and okay

you can convey to Rica they can help you
set up your timings okay they can help
you put in the session which is more
comfortable to you in your time so you
know your cam you can both work with
them call them up and ask them okay so
I'll take of the last question if anyone
has before I before I wrap up so if
anyone have any questions
I'll wait up take up the last question
you know okay okay so okay so I have one
I have one question um I will just take
it off um I'm going to eat here so in
case if anyone else has this question
they might understand the open stack you
can expect a lot many things that the
trip oils in OpenStack basically in a
heterogeneous environment when you
awaken you move on to a very very break
infrastructure which is let's say
production infrastructure you will have
lot many tools working around there is
going to be if at all it is supportive
you might have a variant you might have
HPSA you will have HP o-o you will have
novios
you will have many other tools which
which will be working along with
OpenStack what OpenStack is going to do
is help you create your own private
cloud launch your instances in a
heterogeneous environment where there
are multiple hypervisors from the
different different windows where you
have got many nodes that you want to
launch off you want to use OpenStack
under those scenarios so this is one
example where you actually caught me in
queues of OpenStack so this is same as
what AWS would
for you okay OpenStack would do for the
same depending upon what you want to
choose this is again on your choice but
when we talk about it kills production
environment this is not just going to be
the one tool you are going to use a lot
many tools available you want to use the
different kind of you know backup
maybe Symantec Backup maybe you let up
what do you want to use you maybe want
to depend be dependent on the other
switches maybe Cisco switch or some
other routers that you want to be
dependent upon so they are the
third-party plugins that you want to
integrate with OpenStack okay so the
production environment is going to get
bigger and bigger according to the
facilities or according to your
requirement of the company okay so that
this disk on this is gonna get huge this
is gonna get very very very huge
actually okay in the production
environments the minimum requirement
basically the official site of the red
hat or Ubuntu say is that it is safe to
use or work on OpenStack when you have
three cheating's of the virtual machines
running but I have had my personal
experiences it gives a lot of issues
when you want to install more modules
and work around with them should have at
least half minimum of 8 GB of RAM to
work properly
on top of virtual machine so so that you
know you have a good or a better feel of
you you you get more comfortable working
in such kind of environments so here I
mean these this my recommendation
so basically um if you have a
development background it's this is this
is an additional skill of OpenStack for
you if you have an administration
administrative background this this is
gonna have another skill set added in
both cases a bit of a knowledge on a
linux platform or Neutron and having
networking and and virtualization is
always recommended but if not then
that's okay because you know you have to
start at some point okay some technology
would request some things from your and
some things from the instructor and so
here
so okay guys um I think I'm gonna wrap
it up any other questions that you guys
have are you guys can always call it
Eureka and decide what you want to do
okay please go through this the course
