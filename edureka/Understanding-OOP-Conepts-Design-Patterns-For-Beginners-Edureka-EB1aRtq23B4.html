and I'll be your instructor for the
design patterns course little bit about
myself I am an enterprise architect with
about 11 years of experience these are
our objectives we want to make sure that
we understood the object-oriented
concepts we learn about interfaces and
general field attributes like things
let's talk about something which you may
have seen many many many times a banking
system a banking system will have some
data and some operation and all of them
can be clubbed together to show as
entities for example a data item could
be a savings account a current account
or some sort of FD R D and some Bank
even offer a three even one for in one
kind of account although stuffing but
almost all those accounts will have some
common operations for example withdrawal
transfer and deposit so what can we do
we can take this data we can take these
operations Club them together and that's
our that's our entity that's our object
moving on so let's look at the object
oriented world and the principles that
we should be aware of in those cases
four important principles abstraction
encapsulation inheritance and
polymorphism and we will talk about them
one by one an abstraction I'll read this
for you but I'm gonna give you other
examples too abstraction essentially is
a principle of ignoring those aspects of
subject that are not relevant to the
current purpose of the discussion and
that allows us to concentrate on what is
it Lord we use abstraction in the
development or to manage the complexity
around
and managing the complexity is one of
the key skill how do you manage it one
of the principle that you apply is that
of abstraction let me give you an
example let's say you are walking in a
garden and it's a huge garden right and
you see over a distance a figure you're
not able to see the exact features of
that figure but you can you can perhaps
deduce that that figure is that of a
human
why because let's say there are four
limbs there are two hands two legs and a
head and that figure is walking straight
right perhaps are standing and by just
looking at that that figure you are able
to know that it is a human if that human
is rose you can also be able to tell
whether it is a man or a woman that's an
abstraction for your purposes you can
only see the person and you can tell
that it is a human and you don't need to
know the complexity of whether that
human is wearing spectacles or what
color of clothes that human is wearing
and all that stuff it is good for you to
just tell that there is another human
being on the garden let's zoom in let's
say the same person goes to a high
clinic and wants to check the power
right eye if you know maybe he is also
software developer like us and has to go
routine check every six months I hope
you do so for the eye surgeons
perspective what matters is the eye
perhaps the retina and you know if it is
dry or is it is it good how the power is
can the person see it with one eye
versus the other at that point in time
that eye surgeon does not need to know
about what is the height of the person
or weight of a person are
whether this person is suffering with a
backache may be very common in our word
that's irrelevant so what is the level
of abstraction for an eye surgeon the
eye and it doesn't matter the other
aspects do not matter so when you think
of abstraction going forward I want you
to think of this I want you to think for
a given object or maybe in the real or
virtual world what is it that you are
looking for and that's your level of
abstraction moving on here are the key
concepts around abstraction it
concentrates on only essential objects
essential flag characteristics for
example for up for a figure in a garden
you are only looking for are there four
limbs is that person standing is that
figure standing straight or walking on
all four right is there a kind of
oval-shaped or you know circle shape
head and that tells you that that's a
human perhaps it may not even be human
in some case it may just be a some sort
of statue but you know that it is a
statue of a human it allows you to
manage complexity more easily as I said
in case of an eye surgeon eye surgeon
wouldn't care about your backache he
doesn't care right now it needs to focus
is on the eye there are many different
views of the same objects the same human
we will just be looking at the outline
in a garden but with an eye search and
we will be looking at my same object
multiple views an abstraction is always
related to the perspective viewer if you
were looking at that human figure it is
your point of view when you are looking
when you are an eye surgeon and looking
at the human your point of view is
different and therefore your level of
abstraction is different let's talk
about encapsulation encapsulation is
really about information hiding
you only tell as much as needed let's
say when we introduce each other today
we only told about what's named evil you
know the years of experiences the
expectations but we did not talk about
for example did you have back first and
what did you have in breakfast and
neither did I why because it doesn't
matter right what matters right now is
who are we and why are we here and
therefore we are only exposing the
information that is relevant in that
context and we don't show any other
information to the outside world it is
likely that while you are listening to
me you are having your breakfast but
that's the complexity that you have to
manage within yourself talking of which
the information hiding allows you or to
change the underlying implementation
without telling it outside word for
example if you are feeling hungry you
can eat it without telling me although I
wouldn't advise it because it may break
your concentration but for in the in a
manner of speaking and as an example it
doesn't matter right that allows you to
manage something that will talk about a
ripple effect and very important during
the maintenance of the project that if
it is at a right level of encapsulation
you should be able to change the
underlying implementation internals of
your package or an object or a class
without affecting any other world for
example if I want to take a most of us
may be driving a car right in a car what
is the information that you get maybe
the the speed with which you are
traveling or the engine speed with which
it is happening that's the level of
information does it ever tell you how is
it measuring the speed where is the
actual sensor for the speed mounted no
it does not
so therefore because it is only showing
you the speed and because that's what is
important for you even if the different
car has a different mechanism of
measuring a speed and different places
where the sensor can be mounted
it doesn't matter to you you know we're
about where to look for a speed or
speedometer and that's about it a relay
other things are irrelevant from the
perspective of the of the driver now let
me let me put it in other perspective
and also tell you that the guys who will
manufacture the sensor will not have to
worry about how the information is
presented to the user right whether it
where's the speedometer mounted is it
digital or you know manual that analog
style and all that stuff it doesn't
matter from the sensors perspective what
it will give out it will give out
probably a voltage level if it is an
electronic sensor and that voltage level
will be converted but what is the level
of encapsulation there the level of
encapsulation is only giving out the
voltage level the user of that sensor
does not need to know how the voltage
it's getting computed doesn't matter and
therefore you can replace one sensor
with another if the specifications match
that's the advantage of being using
encapsulation now all I'm giving you are
the real world example because I'm going
with the basis of everything in the real
world can be transferred into object
world or virtual world by way of
representing it and key concept in the
encapsulation are we combine the
behavior and the package structure
together to make those objects
independent they only depend on the
information that is exposed and do not
care about any information that is
hidden and how do you expose that
information perhaps by having an
interface and that is where when you
write those objects classes right it is
important to consider the visibility
modifiers and be careful about what do
you make public washes what do you make
private versus what do you make package
for default visibility
