Eureka and into the session we'll learn
how to install reactors on our system as
you know there are many different ways
in which we can install we are tears on
your systems but today I'll be showing
you the two major ones the first will be
installation by downloading the
dependencies via NPM and then we'll see
how to install by appearing the
dependencies both of the processes will
be followed by the respective programs
so let's get started with our first
method that is installation by
downloading via NPM
so in order to install by downloading
the dependencies you need to follow some
set let's see what are they so the first
step is download and install NPM so if
you guys are not familiar with NPM then
let me tell you that NPM is a package
manager for JavaScript programming
language and you must have it on your
system so let me show you from where you
can download it for that let's go to
okay so here you can see that we have
one site it's called no tails dot o-r-g
slash n slash download from this site
you can see that we have different kind
of a file for different configuration
now according to your system
configuration you can choose your file
so as for me I'm using a 64-bit windows
so for me I have to download this file
once you have downloaded you need to
open it and install it just click on run
and go through the installation I have
already installed it in my system so let
me just follow the next steps quickly
okay so next is open CMD and go to the
folder so here it is saying to go to
your project folder so now let me go
back to my project folder so this is my
project folder inside our e Drive I have
reactors as my project folder so what
I'll do I'll open the C and D and inside
I will change my directory to e and then
go to reactors okay now
as you can see I am inside my project
folder so now you need to set up the NPM
environment so just type and see whether
NPM is working or not okay so now here
you can see that my usual NPM is working
if you get this kind of message that
this means that your NPM is properly
configured and is good to go in case you
don't get this kind of message you need
to configure it again so now let's move
on to our next step what is the next
step okay so our next step is using NPM
start installation so I need my command
prompt and first I need to tell it that
the NPM in it now this NPM in it will
create one package dot JSON file as you
can see I have my package dot JSON file
over here now it is asking me whether my
name is react.js or not so here
everything should be in lowercase so
just give it a name as react
yes you can give it anything then
version you need not to fill all the
details it's asking for just give the
necessary one as for the name is the
Minda tree and then we have the author
banner
so for author LLC Ericka and I will
proceed okay so this is fine with me
all the description I want all the
details like this so I will say yes and
then I'll proceed with the installation
next step we have is installed web pack
using NPM
so now we need to install the web pack
for that we will say npm install web
pack
okay so here we are using saved if
because we wanted as a developer version
not the production version so just hit
enter and it will start installing the
web pack now this web pack is
responsible for combining all the
dynamic components in our code it will
help in importing the data from
different code files so let it get
installed
so it's done installing the web back now
next we have to install the react so
we'll say is npm install' react
along with reactant and save
again so it's done with the reactance
relation as well now we will move on and
install the babble for this
so we'll say npm install
okay so here we go let it get installed
okay so here we are done with all our
modules so now we are good to go with
the recording fill it move ahead and see
how our programs are created so now the
Creator program will be creating three
files one will be webpack conflict
audience one will be HTML file and last
one is the g65
now this is webpack config dot this is a
configuration file which will contain
the information about the dependencies
and the files from where the browser
should start rendering now then we will
have the HTML file which will contain
the HTML template which is used by the
browser to render the elements on the
web page then lastly we will have the
ga6 fine it will contain description of
what all elements we want to display on
our web page so let's move on and see
how the web pack conflict dot JS file is
created so now this is how the web
backdrop quantity is file it looks like
in this you provide the entry and output
point from where the rendering should
start so here we are telling that we
have script rj6 file in which we have
the react code and then this code will
be transpired by the babel loader into
this file transpired on trees basically
in this file we are just telling which
files will be transpiled to which one
and how it will be done okay so next we
have one HTML file this is the basic
HTML file in which we just need to add
one div tag and one script ID inside the
div tag we will provide one ID so that
teacher we can refer it from the basics
file and then we have the script tag in
which we will tell one strands file file
which will be created by the Babel next
we have the j65 now in this you need to
import react and react Dom from the
respective directory and then create a
component that is my component or you
can name it anything you want
which should extend react dot component
because in react everything is a
component and then inside this we will
create word render function in order to
return the HTML
which in the end presented my component
over the tip tag which we use in the
HTML file and we will get it through it
I that is content so this is how all our
file will look like on addition to all
those files what you need to do is you
need to open this package Chasen which
will be created by your npm now here
when you open this you will find
something else test that is equal error
note is specified now you need to remove
this whole of the thing and instead of
this what you need to do is it's a web
app dev server that is hot so now you
need to add this line because using this
we'll be running our code so now we are
done with our code we have all our files
you can see these are the same code and
then we will go back to our CMD and
we'll check whether this code is working
or not so for that will say npm run it
as you can see it successfully working
so next thing I need to do is I'll go to
the browser and I'll say localhost it's
8 0 and here my code is working so this
is how we code by downloading the
dependencies by the NPM so let's go back
to our PPD and let's see how to install
by embedding the dependencies now in
order to do so we need to follow two
simple steps first is download the zip
file from the official site and then
second one is to add them to your
project folder so let's see how it's
done
okay so now let's see from where we can
download the zip file so let's go to the
browser ok here you can see I have this
site that is HTTP colon double slash
react - CN dot github dot you slash
react /downloads dot HTML now if you go
to this site you can see that you have
one download link over here now as soon
as you click on this it will give you
one zip file with all the dependencies
inside it so I have downloaded it let me
go to my downloads here I have this
folder this zip file now when you open
the zip file you can see we have one
react folder inside ER and inside that
we have built and examples so you just
need this bill folder over here so just
track this once you are done the
extraction you will get one build file
like this and inside this you will have
all the dependencies now what you need
to do is just copy this and go to your
project folder and paste it over there
let me show you ok so here I am inside
my your project folder here I will just
paste it now if you open this file you
can see that I have all my dependencies
over here so let's go to the PVD and see
how the programs are created so now for
the program you will need one
Shaymin file and one three six five okay
so now in this HTML file you have to
explicitly add all the dependencies
unlike the previous file which we
created by either npm in that everything
was done implicitly by the npm itself
but here you need to create it and then
add it explicitly so here as you can see
I have added my script file as bin which
says that my area code lies over script
or tails and similarly I am providing
when div tag with one ID so that later
on I can render my component with the
help of this ID so now let's see how the
j65 works so here so if you guys
remember in the previous cases file
which we created using NPM in that we
created one class my component and here
we are creating variable by component so
these are few minor differences over
here so now if you see variable my
component it has when a function which
is called create class and inside that
we have render function which will
return the HTML representation for it
now similarly as we have done over this
here also will call the react Dom dot
render in which we will mention our
component to be rendered and place where
we have to render it so let's see how
it's practically works so I'll go to my
code okay so now inside this project
folder I have already created my files
as index.html and script rj6 inside this
bill folder you can see all my
dependencies are there so here you can
see the code is same okay so now what I
will do I will just run it and show you
guys this code is working or not so for
this I will go to the browser and I'll
say localhost
as you can see hello world so this means
our code is up and running
okay so we are done here with this fight
so now I hope that you guys understand
that how the files very different
depending on the installation processes
so this will be all for today
