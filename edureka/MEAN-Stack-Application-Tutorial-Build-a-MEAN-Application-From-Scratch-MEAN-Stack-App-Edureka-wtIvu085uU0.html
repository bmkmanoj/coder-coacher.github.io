Rekha and today we are going to learn
how to build a mean stack application
from scratch so before moving ahead let
us discuss the agenda for today's
session so we'll start with what is the
mean a patient then we'll talk about
MongoDB Express angular 2 n nodes or
chase basically mean is an acronym for
long body be expressed angular 2 and
node or chase so we are talking about
all these four technologies they will
talk about curtain and at last we'll
start building our application which is
contactless mean up so are we clear with
the agenda guys
so let's start with very first topic of
today's session which is what is the
mean African means that refers to a
collection of JavaScript based
technologies used to develop web
application so from client to server to
database everything will be based on
JavaScript if you see the diagram which
shows a simple client-server
architecture that will be following in
our main application if you see there
you will find angular 2 that we'll be
using for a client-side development then
we are using Express which is based on
node or shares for our server-side
development and at last we'll be using
MongoDB as our database so this is the
architecture that will be following so
let us talk about these four
technologies starting with MongoDB so
normal DV is an open source schema lace
no sequel database system so if you are
working on MongoDB you will be working
on collections and document a collection
is a group of documents whereas document
is a set of key value pairs you can
refer to a collection as that of a table
in our DBMS system so basically all the
data that we'll be working on inside
MongoDB will be in the form of key and
values mama Dee Vee says data in binary
it is on format which makes it easier to
pass data between client and server now
let us talk about Express which is our
next framework in our list so I have a
quick question coming here which other
database can we use with Express ok Bank
since we are building a mean stacker app
that is why we are going it with
Normandy be buddy of course you can go
ahead with other database as well and
integrate with your Express framework
let me show you the documentation so
that you can know all those data base
which are there and can be integrated
with Express
you go to express a dot-com guide
database integration
so these are the data
we can integrate with our Express
framework you can go ed with Cassandra
which is also a no sequel database and
go ahead with my sequel we are working
on MongoDB right now you can go ahead
with SQLite which is also using Android
apps so these are the database that you
can work with your express framework so
I hope your doubt is clear man okay so
let's get back to our topic
so let's now list is Express so Express
is a lightweight framework used to build
web application based on node or TS it
provides you a set of proposed features
which you can use to build single page
application as well as multi page
application the idea of Express came
from Sinatra which is a very popular
framework based on Ruby so basically
Express provides you boilerplate by
encapsulating the functionalities of
node or shares so that the whole app
building process becomes easier and fast
now let us talk about angular 2 using
angular 2 you can make application for
your mobile as well as your desktop
annular is by far the most popular
JavaScript framework available today and
with the introduction of typescript
angular 2 is bringing a true
object-oriented web development into
mainstream so we will be using our
interface through which our client will
be interacting using angular 2 so at
last let us talk about nodes or chairs
so no doubt J's is a server-side
JavaScript execution environment built
on Google Chrome's v8 JavaScript engine
it follows an event-driven architecture
where there is a single thread mechanism
to process your events and event can be
a clicking a button or filling a form in
a website so all these events are then
sent back to your server for processing
and then the server after the processing
is done generates the response the
processing of these events are done
asynchronously that is if we have
multiple events in our event queue
our node server doesn't pay it for a
particular event to complete so it can
process or serve multiple requests at
the same time so this very whole event
driven architecture makes our node.js
server highly optimized and scalable
so I hope guys you have a clear overview
of all the technologies that we'll be
using in our main stacker
so now let us talk about credit
operation droid is an acronym that
stands for create read update and delete
so basically these four operations will
be performed on our database so we will
be using post method for inserting new
data into our database we will be using
gate for the trimming data from our
database we will be using put for
modifying or updating any data that is
there in our database and at last we'll
be using delete method for deleting
resources or deleting any data that is
there in our database so we will be
implementing all of these four
functionalities or operations using
restful api that will be learning while
building our whole application so why
let us starts with building our
application before that we need to
install MongoDB and node.js locally into
our system so let us go ahead and do
that so for installing node.js you need
to visit this website called ods.osu.edu
or controller and download it so I'm
going overhead with Windows so basically
installing no tears or longer live in
your system is pretty easy you just have
to go through setup like a bunch of next
buttons and specify your location where
you want to install it or go with the
default and that's it so my download is
complete and well install
I have already downloaded and installed
node or chairs in my system so I'm not
going to install it but I'm going to
show you the procedure or way to do it
pretty easy and then we're gonna install
MongoDB I think I have also installed a
MongoDB in my system but I'll tell you
how to do that so specify your location
here then click on next next and then
finally install so once your
installation is completed click the
finish button and open the node
Carcharias command from so basically we
will be using this command from node.js
command prompt to build our entire
project so let's check out the node
version
then you can go ahead and check out the
NPM Berlin
NPM stands for node package manager
which is there for managing your
dependencies and their versions so
whatever dependencies you need to run
your application or for your project
you're going to use NPM to manage that
now let us install MongoDB into our
system so you go to MongoDB calm
you click on download then again as per
your operating system choose the
installer I'm going to go ahead with
this way version and I'm going to
download the MSI
topic 5 148 and B so I have already
downloaded it so I'm not going to go
ahead with the download
you have to run this set up
click on next
I have MongoDB already installed in my
system so I'm going to remove it first
then you can show you the installation I
could have done that with no door cheers
as well but it's pretty same they use it
at a big bunch of next if they specify
your path and that's it I have
uninstalled it then go next agree next I
want complete install you can go it with
the custom options as well where you can
specify the location and other
configurations but I'm going to go ahead
with other default mode or the complete
it's collision and the MongoDB files
have been stored in my Program Files
if you're using Windows and you can go
ahead and check out that so I'm going to
show you that once the installation has
been completed
yeah so click on finish your files will
be installed by default in your program
files using Windows go to Mongo DB
server 3.4 then so this is where your
all the files reside in your system
now for running your MongoDB service for
example whenever you are creating a mean
app you need to run the MongoDB service
so that you can make connection to it
and perform data operations so for that
what you can do is go to dock in MongoDB
calm because it will get the whole
procedure or step-by-step process to do
that with the MongoDB server
installation momentary Community Edition
windows we have already completed this
very step that is installed MongoDB
Community Edition now we need to run
this MongoDB service so for that we need
to create two directories called as data
and one subdirectory a steamie so let's
go ahead and do that this is open
command prompt
let me delete the data file because I
had mungry we already installed in my
system and I deleted
so yeah DB has been created now the next
step is to tell long would you be that
this is the path where my data is data
or data for the database will be
residing I'm going to copy this command
and I'm going to paste it here I'm going
to change my path which is
see
and slash data session
so my connection has been started my
service has been started and sweating
for connections on port 27 0 17 which is
a default port for MongoDB - correct
if in case like if you go it with this
very step and it doesn't work out and
you have to execute the Mongo G dot exe
which is the third step you can do that
as well so we have MongoDB ID and node
or chase ready so now we need to create
our project so I'm going to go ahead and
start building my application for that
I'm going to go to my project directory
which is entry type
yeah so I'm going to make a folder where
I'll be putting all my source code set
aside as well as my client side so that
flame is as the name of our application
which is contactless
now I'm going to use NPM and it command
to bend my project as well as create
packages or JSON files which will
contain all my dependencies and
diversion
so you go ahead with NPM and it will ask
you your project name
version description of the project net
your building
employ me an application
entry point is a file from with where
your server-side exhibition will start
so let's name it as a broad case you can
go ahead with in-depth OJ's as
I always use a broad gear so it's up to
you to name whatever you want to name
that pal you can do that
you can put your name as altered I'm
going to put mine right now
so let's open this folder or project
okay I have already opened in my vs code
so I am going to use V export as an
editor you can use any ater of your
choice so this is your package courtesan
file which contains all the information
regarding projects we haven't installed
any dependencies yet that's why you're
not seeing any dependencies or anything
like that
we run have forehead and Buddha so for
that I'm going to use the command + PF
installed so for installing any
dependency or modules you use npm
install command followed by the name of
that particular module which is
expressed
then you can use - - say plug in that
way whatever dependencies or modules
you're installing it will be written to
your package or JSON files
so I haven't told my express and you can
see over here in the dependencies
section we have Express of version 4.1
5.2 and so this is how you do things so
now if you want to share your project
with your friend or colleague so you
don't need to send the entire project
along with the dependencies so you just
need to send them the source code and
this package or JSON file so that they
can download the dependencies or install
the dependencies and start working with
your project you can also install
multiple dependencies or modules or at
the same time what I meant to say is
using a single command install words
with Mongoose and then we need chords we
need 20 part
so Mongoose is an object document mapper
for using MongoDB and body butter is
used for our finger incoming JSON data
and all support because we will be
having our server code running at port
3000 whereas our client-side code run on
4,200 4,200 so that's why we need to
enable course so that we don't get an
error which is not allowed by the earth
now as I told earlier we have our entry
point for you called ab dot tears from
where our server-side execution is start
so you start server-side code by making
that very file of creating that WAV file
in the first place so we'll go ahead and
do that
AB dot kid
then what we'll do we will import the
modules or dependencies that we need to
build our project or our server-side
code so importing modules
suppose we need extras
we need Mongoose
you
when in body butter
you
with it called
you
and we need part
we have an installed park because it's
one of the cold model
so you don't need to install it
separately
you
now now for making a Express application
or using Express believe two or use
Express method and assign it to some
variables so we'll hand it to app
okay now we need to define a pose number
you
now we need to bind ourselves with this
port so
you
this is a fallback you can go in and I
am using arrow function you can use
function as well as the JavaScript
function
after a successful connection we need we
want to say that servers target at both
concatenate the pose number
now what we need to do is we need to add
our out so that if we go to localhost
3000 then we need to specify our server
what it needs to render for that
homepage Oh
testing server because you cannot later
on create all our doubts in a separate
file called route dot J's or something
like that so that all our routes are in
particular files and it's not in our
advert year side
for creating route you need to use get
method for example like this is how I am
defining a row and the route is for my
home page that's why I am using slash
the next argument is the first response
whereas dot sin
now let's go ahead and run our server
for that you need to execute note space
your entry point violent
has been started go ahead and check that
so we have a full bar so everything is
running fine now so remember I told you
that I want all my routes to be in a
particular folder so I'm going to create
a folder called route
or we can simply put it in a five
because it's a simple application so
we'll do that or we can create our food
respect
door to you
now we want to use this a particular
folder so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to define this particular file
with a variable so first I'm going to
use route
/
we need health /
now we need to use it so
so I want all my earth which is
proceeding with Slash contact or slash
API or slash ABCD to be forwarded to
that very particular file so for that
for example I want it to be flash API so
all that outs with Slash aps large ABC
let's say will be directed to my route
gorgeous but and where I have defined
what to do with that particular route
call for example I'm having slash APA
slash a contact for adding the contact
so whenever a client needs to add
contact it would make a power to this
way API slash
API slash add contact and I would be
defining my music for adding contact to
my database or there in my dog or JS
file beside that very particular route
that is slash API slash add contact so
that's how things work right so we need
to define route so that we can make call
to it and we can perform our data
operation so far now this is the reason
that we are making the route
so it's done now we need to add our
middleware so that we can parse our data
and we can use course so let's go ahead
and do that
adding
so we need course
we need body parts as well
you
so you want to parse our JSON data
I and we need to do one more thing we
want all our static files to be in a
particular folder so for that I'm going
to create a folder called
public and inside that I'm gonna create
my four index dot HTML which will be
rendered by our front-end application
so
take pride
you
but God shine
basically I am defining the parterre you
can directly go and specify the path of
this folder public folder or canoes
underscore underscore dir name which
will point to your current directory and
you want to join it with public
so that is we are done here now let's
create some route
so we need to bring Xpress
you
you can use cost or whatever you want
but in general the us cause the cuz the
value of Xpress is not going to change I
mean the value of variables Xpress is
not gonna change in our code
same with all so we're going to use
Express routers
you
remember I told you that we'll be adding
the outs here so whatever call and
making - slash API which is there let me
show you
slash API slash contact it will be
directed to this very particular dot ket
method
the first response and next
now this is my slash contacts folder so
and I'm going to use this very out for
retrieving the contact list
you
okay so every time you make changes to
your server-side code you need to
restart your server all what you can do
you can go ahead and install node mode
which will continuously watch your
source code files for any changes so
whenever there is a change it will
restart your server on its own so we
want to do that
you
now you go ahead with note Mon command
the starter server so they are getting a
error so priorities are creating route
you need to export your router as well
you
so basically what it does it goes to
your package or is on fire and where it
finds a node more that our main entry
point file is AB dot J's and finally
start the server using this a particular
file
so if you see over here the same command
that we use to execute for starting our
server note app gardius has been used by
node model now if I go ahead with slash
API slash contact see we can have the
data so now what we're going to do you
going to connect to our database and
then here we gonna write our logic for
including data from our database and
that's how we will send data to our
client-side application which will make
a foil to this very particular API and
it took the risk of contact we need few
more methods for example for freezing
data
we need them like a to add data add
contact
you
for that we'll be using post method
you
then we need a method for deleting
contact
you
pretty similar the syntax or the
signature of these methods
so how I am going to eat a particular
contact is by referring to that very
particular contact using its ID
so it's done now what we need we need to
create kima for our contact that will be
inserted into our database and we need
to make connection to our database
so we're going to make a folder called
models
inside that we need a file contact god
chase so this very particular file will
be having all our schema our contact
schema so that is the reason I am making
this file
so we need to bring in Mongoose for
since we are going to make schema for a
MongoDB so into brain longest which will
be talking to MongoDB or true that will
be using our motivated
you
contact FEMA
Mongo's schema
so this is a function and I'm going to
pass the schema that I am going to use
for my contact
so I'm going to go it with first name
and last date
you
type string
you
- quite cool
then we need lastname
you
let's make it required also
you can make it fall as well but since
it's a demo so I'm going to go ahead
with true
a lot P will wait for contact number or
phone number
let's keep it clean only
now we need to export this very schema
you
so it's done
now what we need is we need to create
connection or way to connect to our
MongoDB
so we're going to go ahead and do that
so we have Mongoose already here so now
for connection will be using Mongol tour
connect function so let's go ahead and
do that
connects to you
Mongo dB
bond will start connect
then we need to pass no you are along
with port number two which we gonna
connect to our MongoDB so it is long
would I be
localhost
- seven zero one seven so we're going to
go ahead with our default port
now on successful connection we need to
display a message that yeah the
connection has been established
successfully
one connection we need to say
man will start
connection dot on
next step then we want to say that
connected to database
Maru TV ad
yes that's it now in case of Earth
suppose we have an error while doing the
connection or wise establishing the
connection
if there
we need to know that what is the error
that we are having
you
print some message as well
Oh
it a page connection
yeah we don't need
you
so it's done
I think now we can check out if we have
met the successful connection or not yet
so we have been connected to our
database at both to 7 0 &amp;amp; 7
now what we need to do is create a ps4
you trippin contacts or adding contact
or database or deleting contact from our
database so you can't do that so first
we need to bring the schema the contact
schema that we have created in our
contacts dot js5
you
now for retrieving contact we're going
to use find method or function
then you're going to call back so this
is one other way to define a callback or
function the JavaScript play
you
yes star tears on
so after retrieving the contact all the
contact or the contact list will be
saved in our contacts variable which we
are sending or responding back to our
client in JSON format now we need our
post so first what we need we need to
create a new contact which we'll be
adding to our database so I'm going to
make an object new contact and go to new
contact it will be of type contact
name
I want my first name to be from my
request body
dog first
name
last name
so it will be lost
you
then we need phone number
you
that's it guys now we want to insert
this very new contact into our database
so for that we're going to use
you
like that
dog saved
and we need a callback
let's go ahead with the error function
if earth
wait to send or we want to send
message
phase
to add contact
as
you
on dark added
successfully
that's it guys
now for to eat what I'm trying to show
you is that if you are inserting any
data into your database what our mom
would be does it creates an ID for each
document or each contact
so using that very particular ID we're
going to refer to that particular
contact which we want to deed and we'll
perform our trade operation so that's
how we want to do things so from client
side we'll be receiving that very
particular request for relating our
particular contact then using that very
ID we're gonna issue our delete command
so contact dot to move
now as I said we need to retrieve the ID
this ID and then our callback
you
the earth
you
Oh
you
that's it guys so our delete method has
been added to our doubt files
Chris Foley so we have three methods now
later on we will also add our update
method so it's done we have no error or
no issues now for checking our API is
we're going to use postman which is a
Chrome extension which you can add to
your web browser Chrome browser and go
ahead and check your API
we went above it post nine proof
here you will get an option for adding
it to your browser or to your Chrome
now first of all we need to insert some
data so that we can fetch it throw in a
word with our post method then we want
our header as content type to be JSON
then we need to send draw or echo so
first name
Ruth
last name
wait
then poll number
you
okay I'm gonna go ahead with string but
yeah let's add some random number here
now we have to enter the URL or the URL
of the API that we want to make the call
to so that it can be directed to that
particular post method so we're going to
go ahead with
localhost 3000 slash API slash contract
so contact our xxxp let's add some more
contact Peter
you
now let us retrieve the contact that we
have already added into our database
for that we'll be using API slash
contact so we have these two contact so
that's what I was talking about you can
see over here we haven't added any ID
field while inserting our contact so
this is automatically generated by
MongoDB and this is what we are
referring to in our delete method so
what we're going to do is copy this very
particular ID
now we will not issue a delete command
so now our method will fetch this very
particular ID from our URL and it will
refer to that very particular document
or that very particular contact and
delete it so the contact has been
deleted
now let's check that
we are having issues here so we can see
that our Peter Parker has been deleted
so this is how you can check your API is
now what we are going to do we're going
to make our client application and where
we will be making call to our API is for
performing various kind of data
operations that we have defined in our
server file or server-side code
so that's it guys our server-side code
is complete now we're going to go ahead
with our client side application using
angular 2 and we'll be creating view
templates and all to show a contact list
we'll add buttons for delete for adding
contacts and all that let's go ahead and
do that so for that I'll be using
angular CLI or command line interface
that we'll be using to build our entire
client side project so go ahead and open
our new instance of node dot JSC MD then
go to the project directory
you
so now we need to install angular CLI
for that you'll be using again NPM
install a direct angle
/ feeling
so basically angular CLI will help you
to provide all the boilerplate or all
the files which is necessary to run your
client-side angular application it will
also provide you the core node modules
or code modules which we are going to
use in our angular app
you
yeah so NPM install has completed and
our angular CLI has been installed
now we gonna go ahead with creating a
angular project so for that you'll use
ng new and the polar name where your
angular app will be deciding so engineer
client
name it as kind because it's a
client-side application so as I said it
will provide your boiler plates or all
the files so these are the files that
will be created using your ingenue
command
so you'll have a basic component called
as a broad component and you will have a
basic model AB dot module where you will
be specifying all the modules which
you're going to use across the
application as well as your components
and services then we will have index dot
HTML which is the file that will be
rendered in the first place to your web
browser so which we have specified in
our public folder then we have packaged
a zone there are other files as well if
you see over here we have protractor for
testing and for linking we have TS link
got a zone and all the configuration for
our angular CLI is in angular - realize
or Kazon so couple others are there so
which is not required for now like don't
need to know all of that
you
so our project has been created
successfully
now we're going at that very particular
folder
now what we need we need to create
component okay let me just give you a
quick walkthrough so inside our client
folder we have source then app this our
component our basic component colors AB
dot component so if you look at index
dot HTML file which I told you is gonna
render in the first place so here in
body we have AB - hoop so this is a
selector or tag which will load our ab
dot component for this so basically we
will have AB dot component or app
component Clause to be render in the
first place so here you can see we have
AB - root as selector so for building an
angular 2 application to use typescript
as language which is based on object
oriented features so here you can see
that it's a Thai script class called as
AZ component now we have something
called as decorator at rate component
decorator
which is angular that this very class is
a component and we have template URL
over here which is specify the template
for our component which is over here and
then we have CSS for styling so let's
run this very particular application
and p.m. start is the command
or you can go ahead with ng serve
you
no record and
for 200 you are having that very
particular thing as app works so
basically for our index dot HTML file is
rendered which is calling our app route
or app component so if you check out the
a dot component or template - in this
template we have what we call an
interpolation or one-way data-binding so
we are winding this value as app works
so left
let's make it better coming to Edgar
it has been changed so a lick for in
case of server-side application while we
were creating the Express app we had to
run server every time whenever there is
a change and for that we use node more
similarly in our Android application
there is a difference is that we don't
need to restart our application or it
continuously watches for any changes
that we make in our source code and it
reinsures or restart the whole
application each time so you can go
ahead and check that so if you see over
here then we had a change over here so
it recompile it and start the whole
application all these ts files are
converted to JavaScript files or
transferring to JavaScript file and then
are rendered now we need a basic
component colors a contact for listing
our contact as the last there will be a
form over there which will have three
for adding contact we will have button
for deleting contacts so let's go ahead
and do all of these so first of all we
need to create a component so I'm going
to stop it for now we'll be using ng T
or ng generate for generating component
or services
component will be contacts we need a
service to so basically it's considered
to be a good practice to separate your
business logic or your data retrieving
or data operation logic in a separate
file which we call as a service then
what we do is we inject those services
into our component or wherever it is
necessary so as to use those services
now you can see your warning here that
service is generated but not provided so
basically whenever you have to use or in
whichever component you have to use the
service you have to provide it in your
advert component decorator so there will
be a field here called as providers and
we will add the service that we will be
creating now so we have contact dot
service of TS or contact service class
where we'll be writing our business
logic or our data or retrieving or ritto
operation logic and we'll have a
contacts component where we'll be
creating our template and all the logic
behind us so we'll start with creating
our service so that we can retrieve the
data first then we'll start with
creating this contacts component
now one more thing we need is we need a
schema for our contact so let's go ahead
and make a file called as contact or
chairs or TS that will transfer into
gist
so through that contact dot TS
we'll have a class called
contact
which will have portraits
id3 of ice cream
then we need first name
three
last name
string
and full
optional field
now we need to import our HTTP module
for all getting all HTTP methods for
retrieving data or for sending data or
in other words contacts
so input
Chicopee
we need headers as well
Brom
angular activity
then we need our contact glass to be
imported here so that we can use the
schema support
contact
from
you
then we need the reactive gears
operators basically we will be using
Knapp operator
you
so it's done now
we need to use our HTTP module so for
that
you
stun north create the methods for
retrieving contact then we will add
contact and we will give contacts so we
have breathing contact
so which is get contacts
and I want to return all the contact
called the contacts or put the contact
list which I will be getting to while I
am going to my API
you
then the API URL you can see over here
this is the signature or syntax of your
get method or signature you can call
like we will have first argument at URL
string so we'll have as HTTP slash locus
Flagg
and poor gamble
then we'll have API then we have
contacts then we are mapping to
days on former
so we have our pet contact method ready
over here
you
now we need add contact
Razak
and on that
which will be taking new contact as an
argument
you
we're going to append the content type
in our header which is
you
so now I wanna return
the response
and I wanna make a call too
my art contact API which is /ap air
slash contact
I'm going to copy this very same thing
you
and
I'm going to pass the new contact
then the header
we'll map response as a zone
now either delete method
you
remember I told you that portal eating
of contact will be using ID so as to
refer that very particular contact in
our database so we need ideas our
parameter
you
then I'm going to append or concatenate
the ID
you
so we have our service ready now we'll
be using all of this method or injecting
these services into our component and
then we're going to use all of this
method to retrieve data and finally do
something on it for example is going to
show the contact list so we will do that
then for adding contact will use this
add contact method so that's how we'll
be doing things so let's go ahead and
create our component so we'll go to our
contacts dot component or TS
private contact
stutters yeah but we need
to import it was
so we have cantar
service
from
not slash contact
yeah so now we need our
contact class or schema
you
that's it now we're going to initialize
our contact service or we want an
instance of that very contact service
class so that we can use the methods
that we have defined this so for that
what we'll do we'll
right we'll pass the argument as private
contact service
of type
contact service class so this very
process is called dependency induction
or that's how we inject our services
into our component and second thing is
you need to provide your service so as
to use providers
you
now let us go ahead and retrieve data so
we'll be putting our retrieving data
logic inside MGR init method which will
be initiated once your component is
being loaded into your browser so every
time you load your component it will
automatically call this very particular
method to retrieve all the data so
you'll be having this thought contact
service and you're going to use get
contact method so you can see over here
that we have three methods
add contact click contact and get
contacts we going to each get contact
and since it will be returning an
observable we need to subscribe that
we want our contacts to be set as
to restore contact
no showing an error because I haven't
made any variable for contact so let's
go ahead and do that so it will be
contacts of type
on that and it will be an error
yeah so we have done that which creates
a more variable that we'll be needing it
round we need one then we need first
name
a sling
then last name
then phone number
that's it last
remember I told you that the bootstrap
component is AB dot components so we
need to specify in our ab dot component
that now this particular component
should be loaded so we will go to
template and
we're going to use app that on tap
because if you go ahead and look at
other selector it's AB - contact so
contacts works so wise we have retrieved
the data here now let's create our
template so that we can display this
very particular data so I'm going to go
it with my contacts dot component dot
HTML and
you
so before doing this we need to refer to
our bootstrap style sheet so that we can
incorporate it into our template so
we'll go ahead with boots watch
then
these are the ties that's available
which you can use so I will go ahead
with something super you so you can go
ahead and click the download and copy
this very thing and put it into your
HTML or index dot HTML file so we'll go
there
we'll copy this very thing and paste it
here and then we need to write style
shape
and will remove this very particular
feeling and will cop it here in our HS
so that it can refer to
so it's done
now we can go to our component and here
what we want is we want to iterate over
our list so product we'll be using
something called as ng 4 which is a
structural our directive so dope-ass
track ng
Alette
on contact
so we'll be iterating over contact using
contact variable so each contact in our
contacts array will be retrieved in this
very particular variable and that very
variable will be displaying as a list so
go ahead and do that so we need our
class
md3
again a deaf closing the start so now
again we will be using that very
interpolation or one-way data-binding
to display our contact dot first name
then we need similar columns for our
last name and phone number
you
so it's done
so let's check out our
yeah so we can see over here that our
list is being generated we'll put some
more styles so that it was good in the
end so what we'll do right now it will
add a delete button or using that we can
delete any contact so we'll go ahead and
do that so for that as we copying this
well thing again and I need my
would type
button
you
then click which will call a method call
as a contact
which we haven't created yet but we'll
do it soon now what we want is we'll be
referring to that very particular
contact using ID as I told you earlier
so
maybe so
the value should be the
using a class call
but the danger
so it's done so we have this very
particular thing over here now what we
need is will add few bricks so that we
are iterating over the list so yeah
we'll do it later on this sidings so now
we'll add our elite method over here
which we'll be using and we also need
something called as adding contacts add
method or add contact method so let's go
ahead with our delete first so we need T
on track
that's kind ID as any type type any now
so basically we'll be calling our
service again so this dot
yes
that service dot delete contact and then
will passing the ID and since it returns
an observable we need to subscribe that
very particular observable so we'll go
ahead and do that
now what we need to do is even if we
have polluted the data or the contact
from our back-end site or from my
database I need to remove it from my
contact error as with this very
particular contact where all the contact
has been saved so we'll go ahead and do
that
if the relief operation was successful
then
our
sent
then okay so I'm having an error because
I haven't defined the variable contact
so
going to distort contacts
sister
now we need to increment our iterator
so if
contact
i dot underscore ID is equal to the ID
that has been provided to my method
then I want to remove it
like I
so our delete contact is done
now in to add our new method for our
adding contact
so delete functionality is done so let's
add our add contact method so that we
can add more contact and delete them and
see everything is working fine or not so
for that I'll be using an contact and
this is creating new contact
here I need first name to be just
thought first name then I need last name
to be this God last night and I need
phone to be
this start pool
now I need to provide this particular
contact that I have created to my
service or in other words I need to call
the method that is defined in our
service so for that we'll be going ahead
contact service dot add contact and
we'll be passing this particular
variable please not subscribe it
till start contact
put
so we are putting the new contact into
our array you are having her okay so
it's not able to find any cannot find
name very contact and I don't know why
we are having this error okay let's
check it out
so yeah
so it's done
so these are add contact method now we
need to call it from a template so
you're going to modify our template so
that we can add a form on top of our
class and which will have three fields
one for name one for last name and then
for one for phone and then a submit
button for adding the contact finally so
for form we need to use form tag or
submit event
and then we'll add add contact
so this is a method that people call
when the bomb has been submitted close
the tag from that now we need creepy
guys so the first one will be all power
first name so let's go ahead and do that
so for that will be using depth glass
equal to
they've claws equals to form grouped
now we need to close this particular tag
and I won my label has
first thing
yep now I need input type equal to text
then we gonna use something called as
ngmodel for two-way data-binding so
whatever changes that we want to make
there should be reflected in our list as
well where we'll be showing the contact
list so we want to use that
and G model
close to
name suppose to
first name
plus equal to four
so I've done we have our first three
four
you know poisoning similarly we need it
for our last name and then for our phone
number so
will electric as last name and then we
need to write it as last impaired
finally we need for phone number so
for number
so you wanna put this value to our phone
variable
yeah everything is done here now we can
add something goal is required so if you
are not putting that very or filling
that very field then it will pop up a
message or there will be a message
popped up stating that you need to fill
that very particular form or particular
field so we can use this required here
now we need a one button
also for our
submit button for submitting our form
now on top of that we need to add some
heading stating that this is the section
for our add contact so
you
extend our everything here or going
either
horizontal line or cooler
yeah so basically these are add contact
form using which we can add our contact
and this our delete button everything is
there let's slide my knee
we are having it here but yeah it's
there and the second thing is that if
you are saying this that every time we
are adding a data we need to reload it
is happening because our this very
method for retrieving the contacts so
basically whenever you are retrieving
the contact and displaying it at that
particular time like your browser never
allows you to block your UI so that is
what is happening right now so what we
can do to fix it is we can copy this
very particular thing over here and we
are going to put it inside our add
contact to be called just after we have
put the contact so now if we go ahead
and
to that then you can see where okay we
should add some PR tag so that looks
quick or present table over here so
we're going to do that here
so this is so far now let's check our
delete button it's working as well so
our goal application is working let me
give you a quick walk throughs or a
quick recap so that we can defer edge
all the things that we did for creating
this very particular mean application so
what we did we start with our
server-side coding where we had our app
dot J's or entry point file where we
imported all the motors that we required
for our application then we used
middleware for applying cords and a body
parser to parse the json data and then
we put all our out in a separate file
callers route yes this is over here now
there we created routes for each
operation and then we created schema for
our database for contact
like for example first name will be like
this last name will be this and phone
this
now we have our client side or client
folder
where we started with creating our
component so these are component and
then we had a service called as contact
or service where we have mentioned all
the data operation logic and we have
injected reservation service into the
component that we need to use or we want
to use so that's it guys this was the
whole angular application and Express
and MongoDB so we have created our main
app successfully I hope you find this

your LMS you can download it and in case
of any query you can go ahead and ask
those queries or put those queries to
