I am really happy to be here on this live
hangout to talk to you about Entrepreneurship.
I think India is a very exciting and fertile
base for entrepreneurship and I became an
entrepreneur as a co-founder of Infosys way
back in 1981
At that time, we started Infosys 7 of us under
the leadership of Mr. Narayan Murthy and in
those days it was very difficult to convince
people to become entrepreneurs. We were from
middle-class backgrounds and our parents would
dissuade us from doing all these risky activities
like becoming entrepreneurs
So we went against the tide in some sense
to become entrepreneurs
But I think there's been a remarkable change
in the societal and public perception since
then and today being an entrepreneur is a
very exciting thing and a very cool thing
And it really means that we've created a social
environment for more and more people mostly
from non-traditional backgrounds to become
entrepreneurs
The big thing is that we were not from business
families, our parents were all professionals
and we were the first generation of entrepreneurs
in our families and I think many more people
today can aspire for entrepreneurship. Our
lessons from Infosys were very important.
One was that we must have a clear vision and
mission. Our goals was to create a global
world class software company from India
We had to have a set of core values that all
of us believed in, so for us ethics and values
were very important They show that we want
to run a professional and value drive company
who's dedicated to high standards of corporate
governance and quality. We were clear that
we want to be a global company, we were clear
that we create a company that would outlast
us and continue with great leadership in the
future that is happening today with Mr.Vishal
Sikka as the CEO.
So, I think there were many things which allowed
Infosys to become a multi-billion dollar company
employing 100s-1000s of people. Today I think
situation has become much easier for entrepreneurship
than when we began over 30 years back. First
of all, as I mentioned, it's quite cool to
be an entrepreneur and people around the country,
not just in metros, but in cities all over
the country are wanting to be entrepreneurs
and their society and their parents are quite
agreeable with the idea There is also a lot
more money, whether it's angel funding or
VC funding or mezzanine funding or PE funding
and all kinds of funding which makes entrepreneurship
possible today and finding the money for that.
I believe that the rise of the internet, the
rise of the smartphone, the rise of the cloud,
the rise of the analytics, the rise of the
digital platforms like Aadhar which we created
when I was in the government, are all very
fertile ways to think of designing innovative
products and services for the future When
we think about it, when we setup Aadhar, we
designed it as a platform. Aadhar was not
just giving an id card, it was about creating
a number on the cloud with a set of API�s
which allowed anyone to build an app and access
the Aadhaar API to authenticate a person's
identity. Similarly with the Aadhaar eKYC
API, we've allowed anyone, anywhere to use
the Aadhaar approved photo id for opening
a bank account or an insurance policy instantly..
So this API based approach was designed not
just for building government applications,
but also for innovators to build other applications
that would ride on top of this API. And today
we are seeing a huge interest in innovations
coming and entrepreneurs are using Aadhar
API's to create very interesting products
and services for the consumers.
So I think the rise of consumer internet has
been a dramatic change in India and today
we are saying company is multi-billion dollar
valuations be it Flipkart, or OLA or InMobi
and many other firms started by young entrepreneurs.
So I think we are really going to see a really
huge wave of entrepreneurship especially using
technology. I think the other important thing
is to understand that today with the rise
of the on-demand economy and the ability of
using technology to aggregate large number
of people together, you don't need to have
large firms in the old way. If you look at
what happen in the industrial revolution in
the west, you have to build large farms so
people bought up all the small farms and made
large farms and invested in huge equipment
or people aggregated small retailers and created
large chains like Walmart or Tesco or Sainsbury
or you build large companies like Automotive
companies or so on. But in today's world technology
allows you to aggregate individual producers.
So Uber or OLA is a platform which aggregate
thousands of people who drive taxis around
and they don't have to own those taxis nor
do the drivers of those vehicles have to be
employees of the company, they just use the
platform. So tomorrow we are going to see
the same situation where they'll be a platform
that'll aggregate thousands of small farmers
and they'll be given the latest technology
and insurance and so on and they will produce
and behave like a large virtual farm.
Or somebody will aggregate thousands of retailers
and create a virtual mega store
So this technology allows us to reconfigure
things in different ways and this is just
two examples I gave you of how small farmers
can aggregated or small retailers can be aggregated
but this technology stuff will fundamentally
change the way we think of the organization
structure and so I think there is going be
the huge wave of innovation possible by people
to reuse the technology to reimagine different
industries. You�ve already seen the impact
of technology on music, on video, on books,
on retail, on mobility of taxis, on hotels
through people like Airbnb, on advertising
with new models like InMobi, so you are seeing
a lot of that happening and I believe that
this is only the beginning. I also believe
that ecommerce and e-enabled applications
will leapfrog and today if I want to reach
the whole country, if I want to reach the
whole consumers in the small town in remote
corner of Bihar the best way to do that is
actually using the smart phone and technology.
So I think you guys will see a lot of very
innovative business model here. Now as an
entrepreneur one thing I have learnt is the
value of having a long term vision, the value
of having a core set of values that we believe
in or being part of the team like we were
in Infosys, people who got together and stay
together for 30 odd years because we all believed
in a common vision and we all had complimentary
skills so there is a group we are able to
do too many things, but also entrepreneurship
is about persistence it�s been able to withstand
adversity and setbacks and brush them away
and to go forward and I think if you really
want to think you need to think big, you need
to think long-term, you need to imagine that
you are running a marathon and you need to
not be disadvantaged or be disillusioned by
small setbacks because if the goal is big
enough and bold enough, then you will succeed
in the end. I also believe and I wrote about
this in my book �Imagining India� that
one of the key requirements for India�s
future success would be the �entrepreneurship�,
because we have 18-20 million people joining
the workforce every year. We are going to
see massive migration of farms to cities and
to industrial jobs and unless we have millions
of entrepreneurs who in turn create jobs,
we will not be able to meet the aspirations
of our young people. So making sure that we
have millions of entrepreneurs, who in turn
hire other people in their firms is critical
to solving the aspirations and job challenges
of India. So I think entrepreneurship is not
just about one or two people becoming entrepreneurs,
but millions of Indians becoming entrepreneurs
and creating innovative firms that provide
goods and services. So entrepreneurship is
very much required as a fundamental way to
address India�s economic growth. It�s
only through entrepreneurship that we can
enable jobs and meet the aspirations of our
people and therefore the role of the government
becomes how do we create the level playing
field, how do we make it easy to do business,
how do we make it easier for companies to
hire, companies to grow, companies to sell
across the country. So really the government
has to put in place a great set of rules and
processes and level playing fields which then
allows innovators to build their companies.
And so I have always believed that the job
of the government is to build a platform for
innovation and then allow individual innovation
and entrepreneurship flourish. And that�s
the philosophy that we had in Aadhaar where
we designed Aadhaar as a platform and then
entrepreneurs using the Aadhaar authentication
or the Aadhaar eKYC could then build applications
and enterprise around it. And I think that
concept can be extended across the board.
So I am great believer in this, and I am very
delighted to be here and I am very delighted
to talk to you on entrepreneurship
And I'll be happy now to take questions from
all of you.
Question - Why are Indian companies still
following the model from US for e.g. Flipkart-Amazon
and more recently Ola-Uber. When will we be
creating our own innovative products/services
model- Vinti Sharma from Patna.
Well I think, I think what Flipkart, Uber
and Ola have done is amazing achievements,
I think they have created wonderful Indian
companies and taken on these big companies
from the west. So I think we must recognize
and respect their accomplishment at what they
have done. But also I do see a lot of companies
coming up today which will not only necessarily
build a model which was created somewhere,
but build a model which is unique to our circumstances
or our situations. And I think India is a
country with millions of small farmers, the
average farmers have just an acre or two of
land. India is a country of millions of small
retailers, India is going to be a country
of millions of small entrepreneurs. So I think
those who are able to organize and aggregate
these entities using technology, have the
chance to build really great companies. So
there are many many things like that that
can be done. I think it�s a process. I think
what has that happened is that, the growth
of the successful company has shown the power
of what can be done. And every-day 100�s
of new entrepreneurs are coming in and I meet
many of them and many of them have very exciting
original ideas. So no doubt that you will
see many companies in next 5 to 10 years,
that build fundamentally Indian origin destructive
models.
Question- In the hunt for the next unicorn
amongst the startups is the VC community creating
a bubble and if so what will the repercussions
be for Indian entrepreneurship will it be
2001 all over again?-Piyush from Ahmadabad
Well, you know people don't really feel that
this time�s momentum is what happened in
the dot com moment bust, because In the dot
com moment bust was based on, it was the time
when there were only 30 - 40 million internet
users. Today you have 2 billion internet users.
At that it was only landline, today you have
smart phones. That time it was all based on
eye-balls, today it�s based on real revenue.
So I think a lot difference between that time
and this time. And I think you have to understand
what's happening in this market to understand
why these evaluations are being created. Fundamentally,
people believe that different industries are
getting re-imagined, in other words the way
you do music was changed by iPod, the way
you do video was changed by YouTube, the way
you do retail was changed by Amazon and so
on. So fundamentally industries are getting
re-architect-ed. The way you do taxi hailing
has been re-imagined by Uber and Ola, and
so on. So what is happening is that industry
by industry you are seeing fundamental re-imagination
of sectors. And when that happens there are
going to be one at best two winners, typically
there is only 1 winner and that's called the
winner take all model. Today in India, OLA
is becoming the winner, globally UBER has
got a valuation of 40-50 billion. So what's
happening is that as, when you have winner
take all kind of a world then the VC's put
more and more money behind the company which
they think is going to be winner of a particular
segment. Because they know that once that
winner becomes the winner then it�s going
to get a value and revenue and profits that
are disproportionate. Therefore I think that's
why this whole unicorn thing is happening.
And it�s possible that you know there is
some more valuation. It�s possible that
some of these unicorns will flame out and
collapse, it�s entirely possible .But overall
I would say that this will based on fundamentally
real trend that the power of smart phones,
the power of analytics, the power of cloud,
the power of mobile, the power of big data
and all that is fundamentally allowing us
to re-imagine everything and that will create
massive opportunities.
Question- What do you think is the difference
between Indian start-ups and those in Silicon
Valley? Ramesh Ranjan from Gwalior
You know I meet startups in Silicon Valley
and India, I go to valley at least once a
year maybe twice. Whenever I go, I make it
a point to meet with startups either through
my friends or through the VCs. I meet a lot
of startups in Bangalore. I live in Koramangla.
I live in the heart of this activity and may
be there 100 startups in walking distance
of my house. And lot of people drop by to
see me. And I have found that the startups
here are as good as the startups in the west.
I think our young entrepreneurs are as knowledgeable,
as sophisticated, as globally aware, as ambitious.
So I am really very very very bullish on Indian
entrepreneurs - these are all people very
young, in there 20's and 30' s and they think
big, they think bold, they understand that
you have to spend a lot of money to create
scale. So I see absolutely no difference in
the mettle, the caliber of the entrepreneurs
in the valley and here. Obviously there a
lot of things here from the ecosystem point
of view which we need to provide to our entrepreneur.
But I think if we can provide the same level
of service, they will do extremely well.
Question-What are you focusing on these days?
- Siva S. from Bangalore
Actually I am working, I continue to work
80% of my time on public issues. The big thing
which my wife Rohini and I have set up along
with Shankar Maruwada is Project called �EK
STEP�, which is a non-profit, philanthropic
initiative to address applied literacy and
numeracy. So that billions of children can
learn how to read, write and do arithmetic
better. Because, this comes from our belief
that if digital regulation happens, those
who are not educated enough will actually
going to lose further and there will be a
further divide, and if they have to come onto
the system, they need to have the basic tools
of reading writing and arithmetic. And the
current school system is not delivering the
report, which says that more than half of
kids in class 5 can't even read class 2 text
or do addition of 2 numbers. So that's one
public service initiative that I am involved
with. I am also involved as an adviser with
NPC and mobile payments -as mobile payment
is going to be the future. My book is coming
out, I am co-authoring a book with Dr. Viral
Shah named �Rebooting India and leading
the aspirations of a billion people� - where
I am going to talk to about how the technology
is the only way we can leapfrog on India's
development . Then I am also doing some selective
investment in start-ups. I am involved with
urban issues of human settlement. So I actually
have portfolio of things that I am doing.
I�m very busy and very happy being productive.
Question- With the spurt in tech entrepreneurship
we are witnessing the death of a lot of traditional
professions- post-offices, travel agencies
etc. leading to unemployment, will this lead
to social unrest?- Suraj Deep from Ranchi
So I think Suraj, my feeling is net-net. The
job creation from the new technology will
far out with the job loss from the old. And
that is the necessary part of technical evolution.
I mean if you go back and look at 100 years
back before the automobile, the people went
around with horse carriages. And you had horse
carriages, and you had companies that made
horse carriages, and you had horses and people
who drove horse carriages. And then they became,
you don't need them in the automobile world.
Similarly before the invention of telephone
switching, you had people actually sitting
and switching calls. So you had 1000�s of
telephone switchboard operators. And that
was essentially obsoleted by technology. So
technology will always obsolete some profession.
But I think the big prize we have is that
this technology by fundamentally reorganizing
the way we do things can dramatically improve
the efficiency and productivity of a society,
dramatically reduce the inequality between
urban and rural India and create jobs for
millions of people. So, I think net-net it
will be far bigger positive impact on the
economy when job loss that will happen on
some professions that will get re-imagined
by this technology.
Question- Your view on when should a start-up
go for funding? - Aakash from Santa Clara,
US
As late as possible. So I think when you start
you would like to bootstrap, you would like
to take some angel funding from friends and
family or even from regular angels which is
a good thing. And as far as possible you should
use that money to grow, because the later
you raise funding the bigger the value you
have, the bigger the value you have the less
you need to dilute. So I think at the same
time if your business strategy requires a
huge dose of capital to grow rapidly then
you must bring in that capital. So one does
not compromise capital raising for business
strategy. In other words if business strategy
demands capital raising we must go and get
it. Otherwise we should really do it as late
as possible in the game when you have achieved
a certain market value when market dilution
is minimal.
Question by Imran, San Jose - Are we entering
an age of Digital Haves and have nots wherein
people with access to Information &amp;amp; Technology
would rule or frame guidance for those who
don�t?
I think there's definitely, there are two
types of digital divide, it is a very important
point, One is obviously those who have access
and one who don't have access, Clearly somebody,
if a child in Santa Clara
who is two years old and her parents have
bought her an iPad and got her lot of reading
material and games on the iPad and we have
a child in village in Jharkhand who doesn't
have any technology
As it is a child in Jharkhand doesn't have
access to education and then the child in
Santa Clara has got access to latest iPad
with games, then you are already creating
an imbalance of access which leads to inequality.
And the other inequality I think is you know
being able to use these technologies, So even
if you say you go and give a child a smartphone
in a village, the child doesn't know how to
read or write or to do arithmetic. They can't
use these tools and then that creates a trend
to divide. So I think you are absolutely right
unless we intervene strategically, technology
has the ability to create further divide and
technology creates disproportionate power
among a few plates. We talked about this winner
take all syndrome, where in every sector one
company will dominate and obviously the company
that dominates will create people will lot
of money and the ability to influence the
discourse so that's all the risk that you
have with all this.
Question by Shashank Kale from Pune - India�s
ease of doing business rank is 142! Is India
really a good place to start my startup? Well
I think, I mean obviously the government is
making effort's to Improve India's rating
on ease of doing business by simplifying business
process by automating, by having single vendor
and all, so that's what government is doing.
But I think notwithstanding the challenge
of doing business, the fact that we have a
population of over a billion people, rising
aspirations where everybody wants to get ahead,
rising incomes, two thousand dollars per capita
going up to maybe five thousand's dollar per
capita in next ten to twelve years. Ubiquitous
connectivity through mobile broadband, smartphones
becoming relevant, population that adopts
technology easily. I think notwithstanding
the challenges of doing business, this is
still one of the best place in the world to
start a company and create value.
Question by Ananya from Chennai - The biggest
question for any aspiring entrepreneur is
how to start &amp;amp; where to start? Can you give
us your example how you started so that it
might help us? Ananya I think, you know we
began a company more than 30 years back. But
let's say when we began, as I said when Infosys
began, Mr. Narayan Murthy was the chairman
and we all were working with him because at
that time we felt that software was going
to be a very big industry, that Indians would
do very well at software., that there was
a role for an Indian owned and Indian managed
company, that would be global and if that
company adopted the highest standards of quality,
values, corporate governance it could grow
very big and the technology would make it
possible to sit anywhere and do software for
anyone. So this broad fundamental tenants
allowed us to create Infosys. So I think when
you look at the situation you have to examine
what's on the ground, you look for opportunities
you look for gaps. India is an underserved
country in the sense that billion people are
not getting services that they deserve, the
service that they want. And now the technology
is allowing to reconfigure the way we deliver
that in a much cheaper kind of fashion. So
I think there are so many opportunities today
for improving the customer experience and
creating new products and services for the
underserved population that are hugely demanding.
I think the sky is the limit in trying to
identifying sectors or opportunities.
What were the sacrifices you had to make to
reach where you have reached right now? This
is from Norin, Mexico.
Norin I think, this is very important, I think
as you rightly said there are both personal
and other sacrifices, for example at Infosys
for the first eight to ten years we took very
low salaries, we lived very frugally,
we didn't own a car, company saved money and
bootstrapped it back and so on. There were
lots of sacrifices in terms of our lifestyle,
which I could have easily got if I would have
taken a job in a company. Similarly, I use
to travel two to three weeks a month, I would
be on the road meeting customers. So there
was a lot of sacrifice in being away from
your family, especially when your children
are young and so forth
So, there are a lot of personal sacrifices
at the things you do. Also when you work in
an entrepreneurship you must be willing to
take, you know criticism from anyone, you
must be willing to work with different kinds
of people so you have to become mature and
humble in your approach. So all these things
are huge things that you can do but at the
end of the day because you make an impact
like creating jobs and creating services for
customers it�s well worth the sacrifices
to get there.
What traits define a good CEO? Question by
Neha from Ambala
I think, today I believe that being a good
CEO is first of all, you have to be a very
effective motivator of people. Plus more and
more the success of firm is going to come
on the quality of people they're attracting,
the execution of the projects that they do
and this can only be done with great people
or highly motivated. So leadership is a lot
about empowering and motivating a great team.
A leadership is also about I think, a good
CEO is someone who understands both strategy
and execution. So strategy and vision is important
to get the long term thing right and figure
out how to navigate. But day to day execution
is equally important to get there. Now if
you have only vision and strategy without
execution you'll only be a dreamer, and if
I do only execution without vision than you
are just an implementer. But if you want to
be a Successful CEO you need to be both a
visionary and an implementation on the ground
day to day So you sort of navigate between
these two levels. and then you should be a
great consensus builder because ideas have
to come from everywhere you bring different
kinds of people together you need to do that
and you must have a firm set of values which
you lay down for the company that you run.
There are many other things but probably these
are some of the main things.
Thank you Sir.
Question by Senthil from Hasan - How to create
and maintain the company culture as start-ups
scale up?
I think culture is something which is sort
of difficult to define but I think one is
of course you can embed the culture in the
rules of the company and so on. But equally
important it is to be embedded in the behavior
of the officers in the conduct of the business.
So if you have set a particular rule then
that rule should be practiced and if for any
reason the rule is violated then no matter
how high up the person is the rule has to
be enforced. So I think re-enforcing culture
and rules is very very important.
One more question sir this from Manish from
Singapore - Why are Indian companies registering
themselves in Singapore and other countries?
Well you know I think, generally companies
find it easier to register abroad because
they can raise money easier. The VCs often
asked for them to be registered abroad because
it going to be liquidity event with that company,
the company is going to be sold or merged
or taken public then it�s simpler for them
to do it in these markets and So these are
some of reasons. But you know there is a big
movement in India to encourage companies to
list in India for example there is very good
volunteer organization called iSPIRT which
wants to make India a software product nation
and they are working closely with SEBI which
is the market regulate in India. SEBI has
been very pro active in coming out with guidelines
to make it simpler for companies to list in
India, So we hope that as it becomes easier
for companies to list in India, then more
companies will incorporate here and list here.
Question from Ankur Maheshwari Bangalore - In
a diverse country like India does the winners
takes all business model make sense?
I think in the digital world it is possible
because what happens with &quot;winners take all&quot;
is that it creates a virtuous flywheel, so
let�s say that you have a retailer or you
have a taxi aggregator, for the bigger it
gets the more taxi drivers want to be a part
of that company. Bigger the number of taxi�s
they have the more customer will want to use
that app because liquidity is very important
in the sense that, suppose I am sitting in
my house in Koramangla and I want to order
a taxi from my friend Bhavish Aggarwal at
OLA and I look up his app I want to see four
or five taxi's within three minutes of my
house. So liquidity is important, you know
the taxi is moving around. So when you create
a liquid market which allows millions of customers
on one side to use it and millions of taxi
drivers on other side. Then it is very difficult
for somebody else to come into this place
because you have to create both supply and
demand and so even in India I think winners
takes all is a valid thing. Now if you are
in a business that is a physical world business
that is a localization regionalized aspect
then I agree with you. It's very difficult
to say how do you create a national hospital
chain because hospital may be local and so
on. But in technology based businesses I think
winners takes all is equally valid in India.
And that is a big price that's why people
are pouring in billions into these companies
because they see them as winners takes all
in their sector.
One more question which is a very interesting
question by Neena Gulati from Meerut that
is - Are they any books should I read to better
prepare me for entrepreneurship?
Well I think, I mean there are lot of books
but typically on the books front I tend to
read more strategy books, you know books by
people like Peter Drucker who was the real
guru of strategy or Clayton Christensen who
has been a big guru on innovation or Michael
Porter on strategic competitive advantage
or the Late. CK Prahalad another genius on
bottom on the pyramid, core competency you
know he came out with terrific ides so that�s
one area. But I think I dint know you can
learn entrepreneurship from books. I think
finally it is about your commitment your passion
your desire to change the world, your persistence,
your ability to deal with adversity, your
ability to stick to your values in the pace
of challenges, your ability to build a team,
you know these are the things and those are
not things you can learn from a book.
From an IT background, how difficult is it
to get into B2B business? This is from Abbas
Mohsin
I think the best way to get funding is to
prove the model. I mean if you go with an
idea which is just a power point presentation
and you don't have the background then often
people are skeptical about it. But actually
if you launch the application of the product,
get a few thousand people to use it then it
is something real it is something you can
demonstrate you can say that people are using
it and that will inspire confidence in funders
to get involved with you. So I think especially
because as you rightly said those are first
from a technology background you know I spend
my time running a B2B Business stuff, where
in our Infosys our customers are other large
fortune thousand customers but today increasingly
the new wave of companies are B2C whether
it's Flipkart, Ola, Housing, InMobi all that
and so they have to think differently. So
I think in the B2C business, it is better
to do it somehow scrambling, bootstrapping,
make it work and then go for the big bucks.
Last Question is from Roshni, the question
is about I think market research is very important
to understand the broad trends of what�s
happening and to understand how to position
a product, how to brand it, what is the key
USP that is going to click and so on. But
finally your decision to go into something
has to be driven by your fundamental belief
that there is a huge pain point that needs
to be sorted out. I'll explain it to you Rohini
and I co-founded along with Shankar Maruwada,
a nonprofit project called �Startup�,
which is a section 8 company to address literacy
and numeracy. Now obviously we are going to
use market research and analytics to figure
out how to solve it but fundamentally we are
doing it because we believe it�s a core
issue, which is millions of children in the
country with lack of their right educational
skills and if we don�t get it right in the
beginning then they are going to be permanently
handicapped in this increasingly online world
and that belief is what is driving us, that
belief is not based on market research, that
belief is a deep belief that this is a huge
social problem to be solved. So market research
is something you apply on top of that belief
that you have. Sometimes market research may
come back in completely negative belief in
which case you need to rethink that. But fundamentally
belief is important and market research to
validate that is the way out, to think about
it.
Thank you Edureka for having me and I do hope
all the young entrepreneurs on this hangout
have gained from this conversation.
