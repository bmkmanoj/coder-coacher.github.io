course with me I've been a marketer and
hard for the last 10 years and across
the fields of telecom ecommerce bringing
brands to life is my passion I've
graduated from the Indian School of
Business a machine missile essence and
marketing excellence winner and right
from the day one reaching the right
audience in creating a story has been my
source of truth for marketing and when
social media could none of what I peace
comes from a book in fact anything that
you go through my course content will
not come from any book it's something
that I have learned by working with
brands by getting them to life from
Ground Zero by seeing through their
presence all across which is why what
you get is one of this course is real
life examples what you could apply that
and came back to your brand's what you
can apply directly back to your work the
course structure is very lucid and
simple as well it starts by introducing
you to rethink social media takes you
through all the available leading
channels as to what you can do with them
directly leading you to creating a
social media action plan a social media
roadmap and eventually closing out with
all the tips and tricks to make it a
solid success with the social media
marketing efforts so definitely don't
think again and just jump in for this is
not something that's off a textbook this
is something that comes from experience
and it is self with you piping hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
