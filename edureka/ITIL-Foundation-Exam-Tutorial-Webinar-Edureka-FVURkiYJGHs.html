course I'm an instructor sir AGP have
been in this industry for 14 plus years
in different domains of manufacturing
insurance and education I spent about
last 10 plus years in different
positions of being a global delivery
head business consultant solution
architect and program manager I was
awarded the ITSM contribute of the Year
by itesm of Singapore I keep speaking in
these conferences and have conducted two
hundred-plus management workshops and
some of the client lists you can you can
see it for yourself and the list goes on
so I'm a certified title III expert I
come from the itv2 service manager since
2005 a project management professional
certified in governance of enterprise IT
ISO 20000 and lead auditor so what we
will learn today is to understand first
the context of the exam or context
setting what are we going to learn today
so we are going to completely focus on
how to crack the ITIL v3 foundation exam
right and we're going to talk about you
know irrespective whether you're an IT
whether you're not an IT whether you
have one year of experience three year
of experience it doesn't matter what
really matters is how are we going to
take you adopt you in the in the inner
program and curriculum that you all get
yourself familiar eyes and are able to
crack the exam first time there's a lot
of Institute's today say that there is a
hundred percent guarantee of pass but in
ready Rica we think differently we want
to master the signs of cracking the
exams we don't really give those bold
statements as part of 100 percent pass
but we have practitioners who could give
you those real basis framework and
understanding and foundation that you
can crack the exams because we we bring
in real time experiences that we share
with you so that you are able to
understand the concepts even though you
were not working in those domain
our IT specific needs so you'll talk
about preparation method and timelines
we will talk about important topics in
the foundation exam we will also talk
about how is the exam structure that is
the semantics that means is it a
multiple-choice question or an essay
type what is the minimum pass how do you
register for an exam and so on and so
forth so that you get your familiarized
with the pattern of the exam we will
talk about tips and tricks basically
look and I have delivered these courses
across different geographies of Hong
Kong China Singapore Malaysia and rest
of Asia is that we have seen people
where did they go wrong and what are the
real issues that they that they are able
to you know be able to address so based
on collective experience that you have
done or a period of the last ten plus
years in the training industry we would
give him a lot more practical insights
and we will talk about some of the
common pitfalls people do that you
should avoid if you take up an example
we will talk about that we will talk
about also about ideal preparation
timeline and Q&amp;amp;A so so feel free to post
your questions into into the question
pane and sorry that we had a little bit
of thing I was on mute but feel free to
talk and post your questions and we will
take this question at the end of the
session right so with that I will go
ahead and jump into the qualification
now one of the best advantages of this
title course is there are new no
prerequisites what does it mean you
could have experience you you were just
new to IT you're not at all from IIT you
could be in manufacturing you could be
in pharmaceuticals you could be in
retail it doesn't matter
anybody who is involved in delivery of
service can be a part of this particular
exam or it can take this exam so this
item ITIL
it starts four stands for IT
infrastructure library best that I to
the IT infrastructure library is
primarily focused on anybody who is
delivering service like for internal
custom internal employees or external
customers it could be a broadband
service it could be a desktop support it
could be a retail service it could be a
product that you release for your
customer irrespective of whether
whatever you are in service business if
you're delivering a service then you can
actually go ahead and apply for an ITIL
foundation exam so it is it is aimed at
people professionals working within an
organization be it IT or others who are
adapting or adopting ITIL and
understands how to improve the way the
services needs to be provided right so
that that is what we need to be talking
about in terms of qualification so the
good news is each and every one of you
can go ahead and apply for an exam it
will all be useful if you are in service
based industry or anybody who provides
service now kick-starting your
foundation preparation in terms of this
ITIL foundation you don't need to really
enroll for a course it's not mandatory
as opposed to the ITIL intermediate
which is mandatory that you need to
enroll for a course but we strongly
recommend now why do we say strongly
recommend to enroll and of course now we
see a lot of people who have either
background and IT or do not have any
background in IT they they they actually
want to come here and understand the
concepts easily so they we have
practitioners who deliver this courses I
deliver this courses right from ITIL
foundation intermediate to expert now
what we bring is very lucid examples
real time examples of what is a service
what are the different
what do you mean by value what are the
different kind of stakeholders internal
external shared and so on on so we we
give some definition some very
basic examples where you will be able to
relate whether you belong to IT or you
have experience or not right so I would
strongly recommend you to enroll into a
course Federica offers this course as
part of ITIL foundation intermediate and
expert where you get familiarize with
the terminology and definition what is a
service what do you buy utility what do
you may warranty wedding by service
design package and so on and so forth
it's a 16 of course but we split it into
two weekends right we know that most of
you guys are working so we spend about
for us on Saturday for us on Sunday for
two weekends and then you are done with
the course the beauty is also that when
you enroll for this course you are given
an exam motor for it so you undertake
this course where we teach you across
all the principles concepts and
definitions once we do that you we also
conduct module wise sections so if we
have five core volumes which we'll talk
about shortly we will have model wise
exam so that you get yourself familiar
ace and test your understanding of what
we are saying and we spend a lot of time
reviewing the questions right it's not
about getting everything right what is
important is to understand where you are
going wrong and what needs to be dealt
with right and once you complete the
training depending on the level of
preparedness we have some to mock tests
that you can take on it's a full fledged
mock test from AXA laws AXA laws is the
intellectual property owners of ITIL and
people cert is the accrediting training
organization which which provides you
the certificate right so EDA Rica is
tied up with people cert to provide this
exam so you will be given an exam sure
that you can schedule online and take up
this exam ok any questions so far in in
this particular slide so far okay so we
moron now at it as I told you each one
of you come from different background
different experiences so we need to
understand and set the context correct
right so everybody are on the same page
so just think about yourself at this
moment you could be from IT where you
are working in IT your familiarize with
service right anything which you buy a
product to give a service say for
example you enroll for a course and a
dareka provides you a training service
right so you you pay an amount you
enroll for a training and take the exam
and go on right so it's it's a service
as well so you might be a person who's
based out of IT you might be also a non
IT guy like a manufacturing or you could
be from retail so we you need to
probably understand some of the IT
concepts and we will teach you this key
principles of ITIL in context of non
eighty how does it work in manufacturing
industry how does it work in a retail
industry so we talk about it from an
experience we have seen people from one
to two years to three years and more so
it doesn't matter in terms of experience
he doesn't matter in terms of how much
you know which background do you come
from which no prerequisites right so we
would accommodate each and every one of
you he respective where you come across
but during the introduction session we
will try to understand more those
details so that I normally place those
examples and any of your instructors
will play the examples in the context
that you will understand better right so
each and every one of us attend attempts
to understand based on how they have
been experience so those learning points
will come through those sections right
so it could be any of these people so
what happens in terms of preparation
timelines right so if you are basically
into IT and after the course it will
probably take about a three days to take
up the exam right and we have had
instances where people just after the
course itself the next day they take it
right so you will get lot more
familiarize because we will teach you
the concept you will take the module
wise exam
and you'll take two full mock tests that
means the full test that you will take
to get yourself familiar eyes and see
whether you are ready enough to to take
up the actual exam right if you are a
non IT person like beat manufacturing
retail insurance or any other vertical
that you are talking about we would
recommend non eighty plus course maximum
out a week and the best part is a dareka
we have subject matter experts and you
can ask a question anytime even post the
session post the class that will be more
than happy to share our experience and
help you guide you for cracking the exam
right so as I told you lot of these
Institute's say that it's 100 percent
pass but we recommend that we have an
art of the science of cracking the exam
we really have inbuilt experience and
expertise handling different customers
from different backgrounds different
experience across different geographies
so we are in a better position to handle
and guide you and coach you to get
yourself crack right so how do you go
about preparation the first and foremost
thing that I would first duck is each
and every one of us have implemented
certain things in the way an
organization does it right but you
should you should not come with any
baggage that means don't bring your
experience that you have learnt in the
exam right because the way your
organization does will be different from
what ITIL books says right so you come
up with an open mind and we will elicit
eight you the concepts the principles of
how the service mean what a service
level agreement what do you mean by a
utility warranty stakeholder definitions
and all that stuff right so Kim come
with an open mind we will focus on
understanding concepts and terminologies
this is not an exam to memorize facts
okay it's not a chartered accountant
exam that you need to remember all the
laws and then you know amendments and
acts it's not like that you just need to
be familiarize with the concepts and
understanding so the basic meaning how
that is used in the context of service
is important
we'll do a lot of getting yourself
familiar with the exam is is important
so you need to know how much hearts that
you spend is it an online exam is at a
paper exam so we will talk about that so
getting yourself familiarize and you're
taking a mock exam and this section wise
questions gives you a lot of confidence
in the way to take your exams right so
people ask me when we do this course is
there any other reference material that
we need to take we say don't require
because we cover the training course
we'll cover all the sections as required
by the norms of the exam as well as will
give some tips tricks as well as we will
conduct the module wise questions as
well as the mock exams so you'll be
fully functionally thorough by the time
you complete that sixteen hours of
effort going through this particular
course any questions so typically we we
say IT people with the course takes
about three days to take the exam non IT
people taking the course about a week
right so it varies but I'm just giving
you the on an average thing that we have
seen doing the people and as I said
within a week or three days anytime we
are there to help you coach you and
mentor you to get yourself familiar aged
with cracking the exam right these are
some of the topics so we have six topics
as part of the course which is divided
into two weekends we know a lot of new
guys are working and so we wanted to
take four hours every on a Saturday and
Sunday for two weekends right it could
be in the morning session or an evening
session in fact we are going to have a
batches starting from October 17th that
you can enroll so we cover all of these
topics and take model wise exams to do
that so you need not worry about
anything we start and go step by step
with examples and practical insights and
we do a lot of discussions we just don't
go and cover topics in a presentation I
hardly think that would be of any use in
everybody can
but what we bring in is a real practical
experience of how this works based on
the context of the exam now this looks
to be a big list do not worry but so
this is divided into five core
components right so we have service
strategy to start with service design
service transition service operation and
continual service improvement so
underneath every core volume there are a
set of processes it's we will in the
course of the exam it is only
recommended to know the concepts and
goals and how is it related with right
so you don't need to be an expert let's
say in Service Catalog management or
business relationship management it only
talks about what do you mean the
business relationship management what is
a goal
who do they interact with how do the
customer know you so we will we will
cover in a very basic fashion details
and it will not be overwhelming I would
say we will do it in a very structured
clear manner so that it is paced out
equally in in the time that we do and we
do not normally rush we give adequate
time for people because we know that
when you are with different backgrounds
you have a different way of interpreting
things so we work with you we understand
your needs and then align are the
courses and discussions and debates
accordingly what is the semantics of the
exam and how does the exam look like
right yes the dust one question from
mock Sheena Ashraf is does the course
available through online yes we normally
do this as an online training right so
you have a you have a trainer who does
the online training there we also record
these sessions so that you can listen it
later though that could be learnt
you know recorded but I would strongly
suggest that you log in through like
GoToWebinar link every weekend and we
will talk and discuss about it and then
you can ask questions yes we have this
course available through online
yes Sharon go ahead you were asking
about dumps we have a set of ma
questions we have certain questions we
have certain set of section y questions
and based on our experience we also
bring in those insights as part of our
learning process so I have actually seen
a lot of these exams so and based on our
all our instructors Anna Derek Akande
ring in those valuable tips there are
there are M number of things that we can
we can we can share as part of insights
when we do these courses okay and apart
from that there are a lot of other
resources available as well so from a
semantics perspective there are 40
questions you need to take 26 marks to
pass the exam that means that is 65
percent so if you get 26 correct answers
you get a 65 person that means you pass
the ITIL foundation exam right it's a
one hour duration that means you have 60
quests 60 minutes to answer 40 questions
it you will definitely have a lot of
time because it is multiple choice
questions so you just have to look at
four for one of the four options and
then select it and then then it becomes
easier for it to you know clear it
across there is no negative marking so
if you get something wrong don't be
worried you don't get anything negative
for it but but you don't get mark for it
right and it's a closed book that means
you don't have anything to be open you
are proctored online so you can take up
the exam without reference of anything
and you don't require any books I mean
just attending the course and taking the
you know model wise questions and exams
is more than sufficient for you to crack
the exam so I have actually handled more
than about you know several batches I
have always had 100% pass you know a
respect to what background they have
come in so we will ensure that you will
be confident enough to take the exam but
I will strongly recommend you to enroll
for a course because that's
we know exactly where you come from and
then bring those examples in alignment
with what you really require across now
talking about there was another question
from Nikolas let me talk about let me
see how many types of vital exams are
there and which one do we need to take
first so Nikolas the first and foremost
exam is the ITIL foundation exam right
the ITIL foundation exam does not have
any prerequisites so you can directly
take the exam I would recommend
attending the course so once you
complete the ITIL foundation course then
you become eligible to do the itíll
intermediate course now the ITIL
intermediate we'll talk about you know
doing it specific service strategy
service design transition and once you
complete intermediate courses you will
become an expert right but for
intermediate courses and there are two
sections of intermediate courses which
will tell when you complete idle
foundation is that ITIL foundation
clearance of ITIL foundation is
mandatory for you to appear for
intermediate or expert okay so that's I
hope Nicholas that answers this is the
first exam to to do that okay is there
any classroom training available in
China location
jaren we are we are an online training
provider right we we understand there is
a lot of constraints some time coming to
a venue and you cannot some time have
your schedule with your work project
personal assignments so we we only offer
online courses and that's where there is
a lot of flexibility for you to approach
a mentor even after the course as well
as you get the recordings available and
you can you can listen more and more you
know the classroom sessions what happens
is you have to be present you have to
understand and then afterwards you know
you have to reproduce on that right but
here you can listen to this recording
and we give a lot of more tips and we
also have a dedicated subject matter
experts who will give you advice free
advice counseling for you to take beyond
the scope of the exam itself
right so I would say that is where we do
that could you please let me know if you
would provide the mock exam papers or
dumps without enrolling in the course
such as practice tests I mean there is a
few practices that we can give but I
would say to send an email to support at
a de record or Co they'll be more than
happy to give you the the questions
because mock exams and papers are
available many many places but what we
have is a very structured way of
understanding what are the possible
questions that they could come because
it's more of the depth that matters
rather than the number of questions so
that's where I think it really would be
different in the way that we operate the
questions okay so keep your questions
coming across as we do welcome marina
can we select the weekend course timing
so we this this there is a there is a
course that will be coming across Jarrod
normally they do one time on the morning
and the other one on the night batches
so you feel free to pick and choose what
suits you well
that details are coming up just just
prior to the end of the session so you
feel free Tech and we we have
flexibility to attend both the you know
the morning classes as well as the
evening classes because people some of
people are in shifts so we really cater
to both the needs and that's the
flexibility that you get enrolling in
courses of Federica okay so
makuu will come to your question a
little later after I go for the tips and
tricks I hope that is okay with you
McCool so we come to the tips and tricks
ITIL terminologies and definition right
so we we need to first understand what
is the terminology what is the
definition of it please note that there
are lot of training organizations today
who deliver these courses right ed
Eureka is one among them but the way
things different is that in a dear a car
and I've worked with them for quite some
time now that they bring in experienced
practitioners right anybody can teach a
course but only very few people have got
experience in implementing those best
practices across client engagements so
they bring you a lot of valuable
practical tips not only for the exam but
also help you do your service or do your
work better so think about it for a
while of how do you go out and select
you know a good trainer to do that we do
a thorough revision as I told you you
don't need to have any other course
material we cover it in in incomplete
two weekends
all of this details we give you plenty
of examples and we make you a lot more
interactive right and because you are
within your home or with your you know
office you can feel free to just talk
and interact and because there are a lot
of other people will also ask questions
as a collective wisdom that you will get
by revising and understanding from each
other okay so we do a practice for
sample questions you will appear for
mock exam as I told you there are two
full-fledged mock exams that you will
get it is a replica it is a kind of a
real simulation of how you will take the
actual exam and what I suggest normally
is do not read it without with a
preconceived notion people what they do
is they jump in to jump into answers you
know the moment they they think about a
keyword right so what is important is to
understand that read the the all the
possible options right go through all
the answers of four options before
selecting an answer right eliminate 50%
of irrelevant choice the easiest way to
do is that out of the four options that
you will get to will be irrelevant that
means you can easily eliminate that are
not related to the question that they
are asking right and there are no
difficult questions just so don't think
too much when you answer this this is a
foundation exam so they are looking at
giving you basic insights basic
and testing your basic understanding
right so it's not going to be that
difficult to to do that so first do the
elimination of removing that to
incorrect answers and then you are left
with 50% so your probability of getting
that right is 50% right as opposed to
create if a person if you just grow by
one by one and then pick up the things
read it carefully and then do that so
normally trust your instincts because
you know the concept you understand that
as I told you there is no need to
memorize things if you understand the
concepts if you if you have listened to
the class well if you have done your
mock exams and understood the rationale
behind where you went wrong that is more
than sufficient to crack the Excel okay
so I hope these are some of the tricks
that you need to think about when you
are doing this example now let me come
to Merkel's question
sorry mukha like I I didn't get your
question can you please repeat that
question I think I accidentally missed
the question you are talking about ITIL
and ITSM hope eed okay I'm just coming
to that I understand there is a
difference between ITIL and I t-cell
ITIL will help to manage ITSM in much
more efficient manner but how can we
differentiate ITIL from ITSM in terms of
functionality great question Mukul so
first of all ITIL is a best practice
framework that means it only says what
are the best practices that you need to
follow right it's a framework but IT
Service Management is how you use this
framework using people process
technology that we say for peace people
process products and partners in your
own organization that is call IT Service
Management so IT Service Management is
the practical implementation of using
items best practice framework in your
organization I hope that clears you it
is talking about people process products
and partners to deliver it so ITIL is
just a framework you use
that for your benefit to improve or
deliver the service to your customers
I hope Mukul that answers a difference
between your title and IT Service
Management now Jaron has a question
Oh PDF or docx files also provided along
with online session we have the slides
slides are available we have B we take
you to the learning and management
system the beauty of this one is the
slides the mock exams and the section
wise exams are all available till your
entire life
you know it's like lifetime that you can
come and access it right so we we
provide you those facilities that we
don't restrict you just because you have
completed exam later if you want to
revise or come back again or if you have
any questions you can still refer to
that because it will be a part of your
own learning management system so once
you enroll for a course that will be
available for you for your lifetime hope
that answers your question
Jared okay so so let's move on to the
next slide as we speak some of the
common pitfalls that we have seen when I
mean people take the exam is first don't
be nervous it's not like a very tough
exam like what you did for your board
exams or for your college exams it's not
that don't bring your own experience
right you don't think that this is how
we implement in incident management this
is the way we used to do priority
calculation this is the way we talk
about service design don't don't bring
your own experience for a while as I
told you keep your baggage away it's
important to understand what ITIL says
and then recheck whether that was the
best way or this kept the argument of
but in the exam the exam is focusing on
what ITIL book says right so you need to
you need to don't bring your own
experience the other aspect is thinking
too much as I told you this is a basic
foundation exam that means you are
target
at understanding concepts so don't think
too much about a answer because it's not
that difficult right
and I say told you there are four
options that you get when you answer the
question of the 40 questions so please
read all the responses carefully and
then don't rush to complete people you
know you will have plenty of time so
don't rush to do that in case if you
don't know the answer pass it on and
then go ahead don't press the submit
button you can always flip back and pick
up the pick up the right answer and then
finally you can submit so don't press
the submit button until you have covered
so don't go in a rush and take time to
prepare right as I told you each one of
you are different from the background
experience and the domain that you bring
across so it's important to to
understand where you are and how much
preparation you need to do that so that
you become fully confident before you
take the exam right there's a question
from Nicholas is there an ideal version
for no this is the latest version which
is title version 3 in fact it's called
ITIL the 2011 version so there is no
ideal version 4 so once you complete
ITIL version 3 and at this moment it is
it is it is good for the for the rest of
the thing if at all that is something
they will do it but right now there is
only ITIL version 3 there is no version
4 ok hope that answers your question it
listen now we talked about a little bit
of the preparation time what does it
take and how it is done before I go into
the ideal preparation time I will I will
just give you a minute for you to watch
through the slide I have one more
question from Jaron
he's 2011 the latest yes there in 2011
is the latest version of item which is
the version in which this was upgraded
to the ITIL version 3
in fact itíll version 3 was released in
2007 and the updated one which is
different
so now coming on to the idol preparation
time and how iterator can help you in
the journey to to get yourself killed is
that first of all you attend the itíll
foundation exam prep training right so
it's it's for two weekends we do for us
each on Saturday and Sunday
either morning or evening we have we
really scheduled classes as as it is you
will get more information that's
supported at a record or Coe what you do
is once you do that it's an online
virtual training that we provide from
adraka where you analyze the preparation
and method and timely remember you could
be from IT it could be from non IT you
could have one year three years so we
help you to understand what is the best
preparation methodology what time length
that you need to look at so we we also
provide extra time right it's not about
only for ours that we do I
I do a post mid-session and then we do a
one-hour Q&amp;amp;A session if you have any
questions from what we discussed we can
also additionally arrange some sessions
for you to understand more or if you
need to
deep them more we can also do that right
so we we batch we schedule a batch extra
time for you to clarifications and I
said after the course you can still ask
question right so we will have a subject
matter expert who will be answering a
question and then make sure you are
available and you do it and even if you
complete your exam you are doing your
work and you want some information on
assistance for work purpose feel free to
ask that's why we are practitioners we
give a lot of practical advice of how
you can use that at your workplace and
our students have gone from ITIL
foundation to intermediate to expert and
they come up again and again to other
courses so people who have done in Big
Data Hadoop and other stuff also
enrolled for PMP ITIL courses and so on
so we are seeing a lot of people coming
across doing multiple courses in at
Eureka right so we will ensure that you
have a required exam assistants where
you can you can be confident
not only with the the mock questions
section wise questions but also from
clarification perspective confident
perspective to take the exam right so
depending on you know which division
it's probably spanning between one to
two weeks right two weeks is the maximum
you would need to crack this exam right
so we will give you personalized
guidance from subject matter experts so
I do a lot of coaching mentoring stuff
that I will give you so that you can use
those expertise to go there and clear
the exams right and if you have any
difficult question that you want to ask
and analyze feel free to us right so
that is nothing that will stop you from
asking questions or information or any
details we will be more than happy to
make yourself comfortable confident to
crack the exam right so that's what we
are talking about signs of preparation
there has to be a scientific method of
how do you prepare what kind of
structure you do where do you come from
what's the methodology and then work
with you to get yourself confident to
clear the exam any questions on this
particular slide there's a question from
Jay Prakash is there any validity period
of Vital certification there is no
validity period for itíll certification
so whatever you have is still valid we
in my case what happened was I came from
I I did my ITIL foundation in 2005 so
it's what ten years back right and that
time it was version 2 and when version 3
came they they automatically upgraded to
version 3 so I didn't do anything I just
did a bridge exam
finally to become an ideal III expert so
but at this moment there is no validity
period it is available for you
completely ok hope that answers your
question in Jaiprakash now now having
discussed about your you know that time
preparation tips and tricks and pitfalls
what are the resources and next steps
that you can do if you go to the ED
Eureka website and this slides will also
be available is
I have written a blog for all of you
guys to understand what is in for you as
an ideation professional and why you
should do ITIL foundation so I have
written about some of the myths people
think about ITIL people think about IT
Service Management people think about
from a non IT background so I talk about
all of those elements how to crack the
exam
what is the carrier progression that you
get by becoming an ideal foundation so I
would strongly recommend you to to go
there and enroll to go there and read
that's part of the header ayka course
itself what is in for you as an ITN
professional so I did have written a
detailed blog of disappearing myths and
how to become a service management
professional right so enroll for the
course there's a weekend course that is
going to start enroll for it quotes that
we will talk understand bring your
clarifying what background you come from
what is it experience and we will help
you to to achieve and crack the exam
right so study and clear the exam so the
best in first and foremost thing is you
read it you end on for a course and then
you can have more people joining and we
have had 100 percent success for all the
people who have had so far so I hope you
will continue their track record a video
Rekha and Mike match particularly who
whereas enroll have been always getting
you know 100 percent pass so I hope you
will be able to do that so I strongly
recommend you to go through the block
what is in for you as an IPS in
professional enroll a course and take
the mock exam there's a course from
there is a there is a question from
Nicholas there's a direct offer Seagate
training an exam prep they are on the on
the verge of completing it
the we are supposed to get acrid ition I
am a certified in governance of
enterprise IT and we do some of the
patches well so we have just about to
get our accreditation done and stuff so
once we get it completed you will also
see that available or on website so
that's on the cards so we I'm actually
facilitating some of those elements for
their course or addition so you will
hear
from them so as I told you we are all
very practitioner who practice IT
governance we practice talking with CIOs
so we will be able to offer some
practical insights for all of these
courses so we talked about validity we
talked about a dirac ëcause for Seagate
there's a course there is a there is a
question from McCool is there any
compulsory timeframe to clear
intermediate exam post clearing
foundation example McCool there is no
specific time frame we are not we are
not we are not what you call there is no
specific timeline but you should have
done an ITIL exam perspective and then
you should appear for the course to do
that people have done you know anywhere
between two months time through a year's
time depending on what they want to do
and how they want to do it right so you
need to undergo the courses the the the
normal recommendation is for for the
intermediate process it's about 21 hours
of learning that means you need to be
present for three working days spread it
over whatever weekends that we are
talking about are courses that you can
think about and after that you will have
to take up this example right and that's
also a multiple choice question but it's
a scenario based exam so it could go
anywhere from two months to a year
depending on what's your appetite and
how you want to run through this
particular courses yeah do you provide
certification of the course yeah you can
you can check with support some of these
elements of what we do and how we do
that that can be dealt directly with
support a trader a card or Co you can
contact them and they'll be able to
provide more details of certification
exam scheduling and so on okay so
hopefully that answers your question
Mabini now I've talked about
certifications and people are asking
when is the next course and and what it
is right so you you get yourself
certified in iTunes from adore acre
right so we have this course starting
from 17th October so as I told you it's
done in two weekends so it's a morning
batch it might be a night batch next
weekends so we design give best
practices so like what we are doing now
as a 1r tutorial we will do that
particular course as for ours Saturday
and Sunday we will also conduct
additional sessions if required if you
need any additional questions we have an
excellent 24/7 support
there are mock tests available and you
know we are certified trainers as well
as accredited trainers and practitioners
she will be more than happy to give you
more inside if you need any more
insights of how to use that in workplace
right
Mukul was asking how do you implement
service management so we can talk a lot
about that so feel free to use this and
I strongly recommend you to enroll for
this courses so that you get more
benefits practical insights from there
right so we will talk about some of the
case studies when we go to the
intermediate courses as well
where we'll bring is impractical idea
and ask you how you will adopt it in
your own real time scenario right if
suddenly there is a there is a power
outage how will you communicate to the
customers what are the backup
arrangement that will have so we will do
it in a very practical manner as opposed
to just running through PPD's right
everybody can run through PPD's that's
where people give you fancy books and
other stuff but practical experience
there are very few practical trainers
you will get an institute so I'm happy
that even associate with a director
provides real practical training for
people to get familiarize and take it
forward so I'm almost at the end of the
session your questions your queries are
welcome it's been so long so far a quiet
and interactive session where if you've
got a lot of questions and I hope that I
have answered them to your needs but I
will open up for the next three to five
minutes so if you have any additional
questions to whatever we have seen so
far on learnt
of the IT foundation course materials
exam pattern and and so on there's a
question from Nicholas that is talking
about do you guys have training on
Corbett I've just completed the Corbett
of course it is pending for an approval
once it's approved it is done I've just
done and delivered the Corbett course
for accreditation from aisaka so
hopefully once that is done you should
be able to get that as well done so I
just completed the course and we have
gained it for accreditation so you will
hear it from there fee structure for
item there is when you enroll for an
online course there's some discounts
going across and it is one of the most
competitive one across in all of the
batches right I've worked with a lot of
these institutes across this is one of
the most competitive price competitive
courses but we don't compromise on value
that we provide so I would strongly
recommend go through the header acre
site go to send a mail to support a
titter acre there is a feedback that
will come post this webinar see if you
fill that you will be you will get a
mail from a doe rekha where they'll give
you all the details and course fees and
stuff like that you can compare it's the
best in the industry and it's a lot of
value because you bring in real
practitioners who got about 15 20 years
of experience always talking foundation
courses I've known lot of these
Institute's to that asking for two to
three years people who just have passed
out from a college how about CSS P yeah
a lot of courses that are in pipeline
you must have to check with the people
to get it familiarized I would I would
always check with support at any record
Co and certification fee the best part
about this Janus when you enroll for a
course of vital foundation that includes
the exam fees as well so along with the
exam fees that is a very good Bonanza I
will tell you that's the most
competitive that you can get including a
course as well as this expert advice
along with the exam Boccia so all of
them are bundled together
when you enroll for a course okay so
hope that answers your question Jared
any other questions
can I choose Chennai locations so it's
an online exam so irrespective whether
you're in Chennai or in Singapore or
Malaysia genin you can you can still
take an exam right so it doesn't matter
you can you can take the exam from your
home you can take it from your office
it doesn't matter right there will be an
online Proctor who will be managing that
particular exam otherwise you can take
it anywhere so that's the flexibility
that you get to take an exam anywhere
anyplace anywhere how about the United
State of course I had a batch of
students from United States
I think last last batch once one was
from Pennsylvania one was from I think
Las Vegas and I'm doing a batch in New
Orleans

so we have done that and of course
absolutely Nicolas if you are in DC you
can take this course online as well and

an exam that flexibility is there to do
this course oh absolutely so you can
take your exam the voucher is available
