my name is Ashish Ashish Larnaca and I'm
here in ID in Springfield for last two
and a half years now and I've been in
DevOps for last almost three years
helping bigger organizations to help to
get there DevOps set up so I also work
as a DevOps approach an agile coach
helping people to transition from non
non DevOps
architecture to DevOps architecture so
let's talk what is DevOps that's a small
gender but today you'll be covering
upward it's different between the
containers and virtual machines so what
are the virtual machines we are using
these days and why they are not the best
suited practice or a few of the
environment scenarios so I do not say no
virtual machines are bad it's just that
they wouldn't fit in some of the
scenarios that we were discussing for
the production environment DevOps would
be a help the doctor would be a help in
DevOps for those specific scenarios you
will be learning a few things about
docker how to deal with it how to
install it how to get to the basis of
docker so that you quickly get to a
level where you could investigate more
and this form or from the operating
system okay so that's what is the agenda
for today let's start off right this is
a usual problem that anyone would face
generally what happens developers to
develop it develop something then the
tester would try to test it on his box
so while the developer is away the code
is just pushed there it may may not work
there is no guarantee of that the reason
why this happens the settings on your
develop machines are most of the time
stick it okay because there might be
debugging enabled some info level logs
are enabled some rewrite rules may may
not be available there okay the
configurations on the web servers might
be different you have not build the code
correctly or few of the defendants
dependencies on the stage servers or the
pre production servers are missing there
will be n number of things that would
probably go wrong and this is just
because
DevOps isn't done right okay so the box
tries to bridge
the gap between agile development and
knowledge I'll operations work there
will attempt to make the operations side
of it to be agile
okay to be more flexible to be automated
and docker would be one of the link
between that to replicate the
environments so how do we make it
possible if that's one of the problem
right
another problem is that the development
and production environments are not the
same the production the system
configurations might be different the
server configurations are very uh
versions are different generally what
happens is whenever we develop we
develop it where we develop the code
keeping in future keeping in mind the
future so let us say currently my
application is running on PHP 5.4 but we
are experimenting in the organization on
ph 5.5 or 5.6 might have or even in the
case of java if my application is
running on chip was seven six or seven
and i want to try try a wide fly or
something like that i will be developing
the code according to that so it works
on a machine because I am working on it
reiterating word stop trying to perfect
it that works when the code leaves my
box there is no guarantee that it is
supposed is bound to work right on the
production the things are going to be
different there are very different
scenarios as well let us say for
deployments these are people wouldn't
understand the code and we wouldn't
understand the ops side for sure
being a name developer so what I do is I
will be creating some steps that you
need to follow these steps in order to
build the code and then deploy it okay
that's how I I do or I do this things in
a typical developer okay so if I do that
and I forward the scripts on to the ops
side dogs people they don't understand
the coding part of it so they would be
following those steps trying to build
the code and wouldn't work for some some
other of the reason the reasons could be
that they missed a few steps or I forget
to include one of the steps that I
thought was a very trivial or part of
common sense watch so due to these kind
of human errors
the stuff goes wrong okay so what we
need to bring in we need to bring in
automation we need to bring in computers
we don't want to trust humans in
creating the instruction strips and then
running them manually onto the
production systems more often this all
about
environments if I guarantee that
environments on both the sides are
supposed to be same somehow if I make
them same in that case if I move the
code or my build artifacts from one
location one of the machine it should
work okay
ideally that should work at least in
here and this problem is solved by
doctor so what doctor would do for us it
would replicate the platform's okay are
you know Java right so if I have a Java
code why is it called to be portable
it's not because the code could be
executed on my machine or there are Java
interpreters which are Bennet's which
are installed on different different
machines for different different
platforms it's not that it's because the
byte code that is generated from that
sample code which I have could be
executed on any of the boxes it doesn't
mean that the underlying architecture of
the Java compiler or Java interpreter is
seen it means that the code that I am
building it is it is understood by any
of the underlying architectures
okay same thing is the docket what
docker does is darker uses the
underlying platform called kernel even
shelleyf works on the concept of Linux
containers in with top of the container
part so what is talking in the nutshell
it's an open source application okay
docker is rather a company which brought
the usage of Linux containers to the
public that's what we called it a
stalker
okay their product name is also docker
and it's open source platform that
packages your application dependencies
and configurations together how does it
do it it uses a different kind of file
system in which layers are placed on top
of the cone
so imagine you have virtual machines
running your gold and all of the virtual
machines that you use would have their
own resources which would be militate
for them they have the limitations in
form of resources if you are aware of
VMware or VirtualBox or worship PC word
manager any of the hosted hypervisor
sorry when bare metal hypervisors for
virtual machines what we do is we tell
the hypervisor that this particular
virtual machine should be granted so in
some amount of CPU a few gigabyte
gigabytes of RAM so much and so much
hardness and it would work according to
that ok docker in other words wouldn't
be bounded to those kind of resource
utilization what it does is it works
just like a structure of Java
it is very analogous to that but I
wouldn't say exactly same like that
because the line concept is very
different so they have darker engine on
top of that docker engine you would be
running your docker code ok so you could
pour to your docker machines anywhere
but right now let's keep the docker term
as very big we don't understand what
docker is will come to that when we
compare it to virtual machines okay so
docker is not a virtual machine if it
could do all the things like a virtual
container does it act as a virtual
machine no it doesn't what is the
difference the difference is very first
there is no separation of resources
between two different docker containers
ok
so physically you cannot separate it out
you cannot say that this docker
container of mine would be granted a 1
GB image resource and on the one would
be having another 1 GB of it they both
can share the same Ram practically the
basically the same locations in theory
it could do that ok but generally what
we do is we have kernels handle all
those things for us just like different
processes on a CPU or on a machine all
the hundred processes on your operating
system would be running fine even if
they are running on one single box one
single CPU sharing all the resource and
unless and until they explicitly step
foot on someone else's memory right
everything would be fine but if you do
that you would run into a conflict okay
that's what is the problem a talker
now that's the biggest issue if you run
the docker containers using super users
and the super user wants to do something
at the root level he would do it doing
it okay that's possible but with virtual
machines you cannot play with the
resources of someone on the virtual
machine they are completely isolated so
isolation here from the security point
of view and docker is a problem okay
another benefit with docker is that
docker is very light your virtual
machines are not like when you install a
virtual machine you first give them a
hold of their resources which would be
militate by the hypervisor spinet and on
both resources the virtual machine would
be plain it would have its own memory
management it would have its own process
management it would have its own
background processes running okay and a
whole lot of stuff which is going on for
a typical
operating system would be dead sort of
1gb of RAM almost 600 mb/s or something
like that whatever your operating system
is depending on that it would be using
the RAM so very less amount is left for
actual servers or tables to run on top
of it okay but with docker you get
complete amount of that so if your host
operating system is running maybe 16
gigs of ram your docker instances would
be having hold of all the 16 gb whether
it uses it whether it uses or it doesn't
use that it's all up to itself ok so
it's different than a virtual machine
though this virtual machine is I have
have got isolations strict isolations
there is no problem of security which
would be a problem in darker darker or
very light docker containers are very
very light they don't have any of the
internal mechanisms like an operating
system everything that is required for
the process to run including the
dependencies including the files
all of those stuff is handled by the
kernel itself okay so when we are
talking of kernel in virtual machines
every virtual machine would be having
their own kernel but in case of docker
the host system provides the the kernel
for the docker processes to run so
blocker only takes care of versus
isolation versus live like isolation is
very good photographer so processes
wouldn't be stepping on each other's
feed the isolation at that level is very
good but when you talk about the
underlying cpu level at the good
resource level stuff it's really flaky
so that's what the problem is and that's
the only reason people are fearing to
execute docker in the production these
days but it has four big scope people
are looking towards it it's very
promising software ok but how do we make
use of it so since docker
works on a the concept of layering so
you could actually run many multiple
processes on the same kernel right they
can be separated out and every process
will be supported by the same kernel so
the resources doesn't have to manage by
the forces these resources are managed
by the kernel itself one of the process
or one of the docker container is
requiring mode amount of RAM it takes it
okay it could be granted to that here at
a virtual another difference between
docker and virtual machines is in
virtual machines you have computer
operating system running but if we talk
that you're actually running only one
single process it could be one it could
be to any number of process but ideally
we keep this services separated out
using docker there are people who have
tried installing operating systems
instead of instead of docker as well
that works ok it's not a problem docker
can run your complete operating system
as well but probably not a good idea ok
because we use docker for keeping the
system's light we don't want to burden
eyes it even if in case of hypervisor if
you check both of these figures
in your virtual machines you would be
having a hypervisor running which has
its own kernel and on top of that kernel
each of the guest operating systems will
be having their own individual kernels
the portal kernel count is four in this
case that is 4x times the U the resource
requirement just for executing a kernel
I am NOT talking of any of the daemons
here if you talk of the docker engine
there is no hypervisor requirement
docker engine would take care of
forwarding all your instructions and
requests from within your docker
containers to your underlying host
operating system that operating system
has its own kernel
so there's kernel count is one we don't
have any process management requirements
no memory management stuff to be done on
individual docker container level and
apps can run in isolation from one
another like in case of virtual machines
and we have network managers we have the
same thing here in docker as well so
docker containers get their own IP
addresses they can talk to one local
containers we could link them together
but why do we use docker in first place
resource utilize each optimization and
performance okay there's a question
coming in from Manish mr. Manish
how is docker able to get hold of
interim entire memory of operating
system well that's a good question the
question is not how the question is why
it doesn't limit itself to something now
these kind of limitations are offered
because of the kernels okay so if you
are talking of an hypervisor hypervisor
has its own kernel which can separate
out other things for a different virtual
machines which are running on top of it
so there there is a separation which is
considered by hypervisor but here in
case of an operating system you know
that the operating system can be using
hundred percent of the system resources
any operating system you install on any
of the hardware by default it utilizes
all their system resources so imagine
there was no docker engine on top of it
so how much RAM you consider this
operating system would be using all of
it so that is just one kernel which is
utilizing all of the RAM and there is no
separation between the different virtual
machines there are no virtual machines
rather so the our machine a docker
engine when we installed that docker
engine package on top of your operating
system it actually picks up the complete
amount of RAM which is available okay
which would be free so in that
particular ram it could host as many
processes as it wants ideally we keep
one process per container okay so those
many containers can be executing so if
my process on Windows let's say I open
up a task manager all our families with
task managers so if I open up a task
manager on my system and I say that I
have
well gigs of memory and there are
processes which are using that memory ok
so there is a complete possibility that
one of the process would be taking up
compute RAM but it does not okay so
currently my browser will be taking in
122 MB of RAM but it would potentially
take up the complete well GP series with
the docker containers it runs as a
single process just like any other
process okay so it it would take its own
requirements as per its own requirement
but it wouldn't go beyond what is
considered to be harmful if it does that
that that means something is definitely
wrong with that container okay ships up
to us how do we design that processes
which are executing inside the docker
container
now doctor has been designed in such a
way that it could become incorporated
with many other devoxx tools including
the very famous ones so all the
configuration management systems can
connect with rocket they could change
the configurations they could build the
docker images ok one another fantastic
use of docker is to have version control
system well I am NOT talking of the
regular version control systems I am
just talking in our term where you are
saving some snapshots in time ok so we
could have operating system running or a
process running and I could commit that
slapshot somewhere so that I could go
back to it and I could maybe re rerun it
or even evaluated for some reason it
just like storing snapshots for the
memes but these snapshots that dogger
cont creates are layers ok so they are
very light and they do not take much of
the space and actually you could also do
a dr. dibbs command on it and it would
actually tell you that how many files
were changed between the last revision
and the current revision of the doubt
our docker commit selection so the
docker containers like I told would be
able to integrate with one other the
containers can talk to one another they
can have IP addresses so they could
connect to one another if they want to
you could also create a complete
ecosystem in docker so there could be
docker container having post raise
another one would be running something
else maybe some web server and you could
have that web server talk to the
post-race docker container all within
your system and that also without
knowing the IP address of it they would
be linked together to form one unified
docker container as old so you could see
- but internally they would be treated
as one ok that could also be done so I
show you different examples during the
docker hands-on session
let me take up a few queries before
starting off there is query from Sandy
if I restart the open system on with
respect to dr. engine on the process
running on it will also stop which is
not good yeah if you restart the
operating system the host operating
system your daughter is gone it's all
based on the kernel which is provided by
the base of the list and you are right
in that same is with the hypervisor see
if the hypervisor should feel none of
your virtual machines Putra right same
thing happens here so in the docker
architects there is another question
from Manish so in the docker
architecture is it not becoming a single
point of failure because if docker layer
becomes unresponsive things hang yeah so
is true with any other software it could
be true with the hypervisors in case of
VMware as well okay so if your
hypervisor fields or stalls your
machines are lost all of them and same
is the case with docker on ATT sub
software which acts as an intermediate
layer so we all pressed OSI layer model
right see all the same elipse through
which all the integration or the network
traffic flows if one of the layer is
constructed wrong maybe someone finds a
loophole into that and that's blocked
whom do you blame same thing is the
docker it's piece of software c'mon okay
it's bound to failures but we are till
now no one has reported in such kind of
things that the dropper stalls or
something it was a case with the view of
the operating systems but I guess these
people have been working on it and fixed
that I have also seen such problems
going on with VMware as well as
VirtualBox so that's not a big key but
you are right that would be the keys
another question from one indra i have
virtual machine we spare how can i build
a container of it so that i can use it
in another machine well great question
let me pick up the basics first i will
show you how to install and have your
own operating system instead of docker
and then we can go and set other things
there okay
make sense
another question coming in from Raj
Kumar what is the difference between
darker and chef puppet
okay we'll first docker is a
virtualization technology which is based
on containers that is completely
different chef and puppet are
configuration management systems which
help you configure the stuff so your
puppet can help you configure docker
image for you your puppet can help you
configure different machines Maggio's
web servers or set up your nodes but
that cannot be done by doctor doctor in
itself is a virtualization technology
that you could build from a single file
just like if you are aware of what
background does Ragman can execute the
script and it can bend your virtual
machine so doctor also has a concept of
docker file on into which you could
write some configurations and based on
that dr. hood created images and your
containers cubed puppet can create a
docker image
it wouldn't be compared to that the
dough's are completely different areas
ok there's another question coming in
from rush me can be create template from
docker container so we can reuse that in
another ecosystem yes and docker is
created portability they are very light
in the first case you could commit this
stuff you could review it again you
could export it to some tar ball you
could bring it to another machine
I again imported okay so that's possible
there is no talk of registry which holds
the images for you so you could have two
different kinds of docker registries it
could be third party or hosted one which
is provided by docker themselves another
one you could have it in your own
environment locally okay so in your own
production systems so you could tell
docker systems connect to that
repository and pull down the images and
executed so docker is really great at
portability and that can also be reduced
rate see if you have it portable you
could reuse on an assistance you could
import
or loaded both of them are commands
ecotype in a stock or import docker load
I'll show you how to do that another
question from because how dr. would be
better than vagrant reuse vagrant
extensively see comparing dr. to vagrant
is same as comparing their AL products
now these two are technologies n
products would be docker containers and
vagrants endpoint would be your virtual
machines so I have already compared both
of them rightly it's up to you which one
to use in particular ecosystem if you
are talking of deployments I would
really go with docker it's really great
tool for deployments the reason why
since we can package everything along
with the dependencies we create a
computer environment so instead of
sending the code out just a bare code I
would run that coding in my daughter
container check whether it works or not
ok commit that docker container to my
repository tell the production guide to
pull the the daughter container from the
current repository so that I don't have
to worry about which configurations to
set what to do with that how to install
the stuff protomatter dependencies I
just tell my production guys that pull
that image from there which I have
committed wrong on your systems that's
it no more hassles nothing so the
environment will be replicated as it is
on to the production environment and not
just on one single machine you could
have dr running on all of your nodes
where your code has to be deployed and
code would be deployed along with the
web servers with all the configurations
right and the systems would be on up no
time ok
it takes some time for your virtual
machines to boot but for docker it might
take a second or not even more than so
there is another question coming in from
Sandy we can also share the VM right
from the test production environment we
will take the snapshot of test
environment inside this pipe shot of
production environment so that they will
use this image to launch in vm so vm is
also portable
ok let's buy it for a minute that VM is
porting
you know that VMs are closely activated
to their underlying hypervisors so if
you are aware of vmware and there are
various versions that is support right
from VMware Workstation 5 to workstation
11 you have options of choosing VMware
version just because they are required
for a specific feature plus they have
different capabilities related to
Hardware emulation okay see if you have
the emulation is not done right your VM
wouldn't work there okay so that's the
problem if you say that names are
perfectly portable no that's problem and
another one is VMS are too bulky to be
considered to be to be considered as an
artifact for deployments you don't want
a 5-0 artifact to be transferred through
your network onto your end node just
because it is built-in sent to us and
has got some packages installing setup
doesn't make sense right instead of that
you would easily are happy port
something which is 20 MB in size or has
a few MB is more than your code
repository size that's a good idea right
that's what we believe in and if you
create a tarball out of it you could
simply a single tarball out so it would
be only those parts which are changed so
you don't even have to copy the complete
docker image to your notes that's the
best part of it we save bandwidth we
save time we save the restart time of
your nodes and great portability special
on the question here from monitor so
which is one is more popular these days
doctor or hypervisors see honestly the
cloud business currently is working on
VM webs of not VMware virtual machines
so where is one of the problems so
today's your talking of Cloward it is
all virtual cheats they do have support
for dockets but today is extensively all
about virtual machines docker is a
future technology
that has got many promising goals to
achieve in near future and we see that
the DevOps in the near future would be
all going towards Tucker 20 known as
Asian business not the virtual machine
business okay so currently your VMs are
famous but they are quickly losing their
stakes and people are jumping to darker
more another question here what is the
use case to use docker onto AWS cloud
does it is it cost effective okay one of
the use case I've told is deployments
okay another one would be to have your
machines converted into non non services
affiliated systems see if you ask about
the Google architecture there one single
machine would be running Gmail processes
as well as their Google services as well
as their app engines as well as their
search engines and they don't care which
one runs where as long as the resources
are all optimized and they are used to
the perfect level okay
but these days if you talk of your cloud
infrastructure we bind the services to a
node I say that this particular cluster
it should be serving only the web pages
that particular cluster would be serving
only the database tech business or what
if I unify them together illis wrong or
a pool of systems and I want Kuban it is
to handle it for me
so Kuban it is a system that would be
controlling all the resources in my data
center and I tell just tell Kuban it is
that these are the processes that I
won't run or pick up these docker
instances run them anywhere I don't care
just I need to be sure that my systems
are performing at 75% of 80% research
resource you are utilization and the
utilization should be optimized so
that's what is the end goal okay and
then everything is handled by cuban it
is in that case so we don't stick to the
servals we don't stick with our services
or binder services to the machines
that's one of the biggest benefits of
data which will never be per given to
you by any of the virtual keys
another question from Anita can data
sent receives daughter instead of
hypervisors why doesn't amazin Azure use
it instead of hypervisor that's what I
said
these are the many businesses what's
famous is being used since ages if the
technologies new people generally
adapted with time okay so it doesn't it
wouldn't be right to say that they don't
supported amazing support stocker as
well it's all up to you whether to use
it or not extensively if you go with all
the default settings they will provide
you with an virtual machine not not a
document it and of course an hypervisors
are completely different if you have a
setup which is running hypervisors
extensively you would be running only a
virtual machine on top of it you cannot
run docker for running Locker you need a
very minimum operating system at the
base which will be providing with the
kernel on top of that you installed a
docker angel and then you will go on
drawing the processes on top of it okay
so there is little comparison to here
another question from fan indra to
create image you need to have a tar file
what about sites that's minimum let me
show it to you so we are already 38
minutes down I would quickly jump to
what we have to offer from hands-on
perspective so what I need here is a 64
bit machine doctor doesn't install an 32
bits that's bad
okay so darker guy is not providing any
support for 32-bit systems so what I
have here let me bring up my systems I
have my VirtualBox manager I'm running a
Windows machine just because it came
pre-installed no big reason that's why
I'm using hypervisor to evil 8a kernel
on top of the kernel we would be having
a talker installed and then I'll show
you some basics we'll talk ok so that
you don't what are the different things
that you should be doing differently
when it comes to virtual machines
okay before that there is another
question coming in from Vijay could we
set up different containers to have
different priorities with respect to
criticality that is what I mean is some
containers may be running apps with
higher business value than others
yes we could do that if you check your
PA socks for the processes which have
been running you see the docker
containers running there okay so you
could change the priority now these
priorities can also be handled by some
resource manager like keeper it is five
or there is another nice product from
docker it is called docker swamp that
can also help you do the same thing okay
so it's not that we are running into the
problems for the very first time people
have been there already in there are
solutions another question here from
Manish so if I use docker do I need chef
puppet for configuration oh yes you do
the reason why docker would be running
your applications and isolation label
okay so for running docker unit docker
package to be installed on an operating
system you need operating system
installed on a much much so machine or
it could be virtual machine you could be
a physical box if it is either of them
you need a puppet auto-ship order any of
the configuration management system to
either configure it for sorry to
configure that particular machine five C
would be installing docker on it you
would be setting up some functions tips
you will be running the docker
containers on top of it right all these
processes has to be automated so there
is no option for pattern shift in that
kind of scenario you would also use
ansible if you want to so what I have
here is a machine so which I would be
cloning I have a template here which is
64 bit template so I would say it's top
one for me
I've kept docker installed just to save
a few minutes of time
but I will still go with the
installation I'll show you how to
install
so the current version that you need to
have is 3.1 plus secure running version
2.7 dr. brandt work
another bad themes I told you that was
the future technology so these days all
every one of us is jumping to 64 bits no
one uses 32 bits so these people are
still d-mat stages and way of building
stuff okay so don't depend on them for
faster round trips or faster turnaround
times for the bug fixes all this kind of
stuff but they are working mainly on
getting the fear feature-rich product
out in the market another question from
Sandy are you installing docker on a VM
yes I am reason because I don't have a
kernel in Windows Windows doesn't
support containerization or Linux
containers to be very specific so what I
am going to do is I am first trying to
emulate a virtual machine are trying to
emulate a Lannon system which will be
providing me with a kernel and on top of
that kernel I will be installing dock so
just you would be retaining or just
pretending that I don't have Windows
machine I have a Linux machine on which
I would be installing down docker is not
actually dependent on VM I am dependent
on Veeam because I am using videos okay
that's the only reason I am doing it if
you want to run with docker inside VR
videos there is a package in Windows
which is on boot to dr. what actually
does is it would be creating a virtual
machine with a kernel inside of that and
then it would be installing docker
packages okay so if I didn't have
Windows box I will be installing dropper
directly so this is 64-bit machine that
I am bringing up another great question
from Santosh can we have darker behind
load balancers
let me ask you a reverse question what
lies behind a load balance is it a
machine is it a service that here
targeting we're targeting services right
so if you are targeting services which
are isolated all across from boxes and
on that box I could run docker then I
could please docker behind a virtual
image or behind a load balancer right so
it could be a box running a docker
instance who sport Rex who has got a
board exposed
okay and that could be placed behind a
load balancer would work so when we are
talking of deployments at scale we did
load balancers you also need docker
containers for faster performance so
combination is good it works well first
I will just make some changes call it
docker for now
okay so that's my box I can bring to
internet should work okay so internet
connection is there another one I want
to connect to it from my local
connection SSH connection rather the
reason because I wanted to be more
bigger in front size if it is okay for
you then I wouldn't be doing any
configuration on that so is it visible
is the black and white screen visible
and can you read from it okay thank you
so let's install docker so for
installing Rochard you need to follow
the instructions which are provided by
the docker people on this website which
says talker dogster.com installation on
Ubuntu Linux some for I would be
following these steps now these steps
are number 10 from 1 to 10 you could
follow every one of them install your
offerings instance ok
eventually what you get is a docker ins
engine that's the package docker engine
once you install it your doctor would be
running on your system or bear okay so
let me follow a few steps rather make
some changes here see Network this is
let me add another one the reason I am
doing that I need to copy paste a few
things
and for that I would be needing client
if I pick h1 okay so there it is
so let's bring up a fifty session I
could respond in two to one sixty eight
dot fifty-six
not hundred and two now this is not very
specific to you
it could be just specific to me okay so
all you need is a system on which you
could connect as a route so let's see
what we need to do here so pull up this
page for now we'll go through it at your
own pace so I'm following the steps
first things first login okay get root
alright
so what essentially we are doing is we
are reading source code then we'll be
adding a source list after that we will
be updating it again then we'll be
installing the package called docker
engine but let's do one thing instead of
following all the steps out here which
anyone can okay so I am simply following
all the steps to install docker we
wouldn't be wasting time on setting up
the things here it is very even if they
are just ten steps they are practically
just to add a source list install the
repository why do we need a source list
because there is already a package for
darker which is available online but
that docker and this chopper that we are
talking about has no resemblance of no
matching between one another we need to
add a separate source list here in this
file and then install docker engine so
what I am going to do is I will show you
the pre-installed version of docker see
what I said is true you could simply do
doctor install a saree app get install
docker engine and there would be your
package that if I skip this it would
save us a few minutes so we are already
running out of time let me get that
bubble machine up I would say let us
shut it down for now
and I'm thinking why the box
so if you have doctor installed if you
type in darker you would be getting a
list of all the supported of doctor
commands which are they're available
with the docker engine okay
so I was talking on the repositories
right so if you want operating system to
be installed inside of docker very
closest operating system on a very
smallest one that you could install is
easy box if you don't know what busybox
is it is the minimum version of Linux it
is a pair bare minimum version of
clinics which is hardly a few mb/s in
size which you can download and then you
could file commercial top of it okay
so what I did was I simply did darker
pull busy box where does it connect it
connects to the centralized docker
repository or registry and to do that
registry let me break it up here you
could say dark urges free and the URL is
hub dot dot com some so-called ocker hub
here at docker hub people have
contributed from open source community
they have contributed to the different
images that you could readily use you
don't have to go and configure all the
images by all by yourself so what we do
is we pull it from this simple type in
busy box and I'm going to check whether
busy box is available here or not we can
search for that should get back to us
with the result so this is the list here
it would come back the deleted week we
will wait for it so if you see the
official the post is here be posters for
sent to us we have busy box we have open
to we have some more operating systems
already there but these operating
systems
just hold the file they don't have their
own current the kernel is provided by
the underlying host operating system ok
even if we see the operating systems
here these are not the full-fledged
operating systems you cannot run them on
their own it has to be executed inside a
container itself so if I talk of Ubuntu
what do you think how much will be the
size of it if we download Ubuntu 14.04
so if you want to pull it from here if
you want to use the image which is
currently created on the centralized
repository or docker hub we could type
in the command which says Tocker pull ok
and this is the command in here it is
mentioned here dr. pol command docker
full image name is Ubuntu if I want to
put a image for busybox I will be doing
dr. pool busybox
there are multiple versions of it so if
I type in dr. pol busybox it will be
pulling all the supported images but we
don't want all of them so if you check
here there are four different versions
of Ubuntu which I've mentioned here ok
out of all the four versions I want just
one so I need to specify which one by
default
latest is the one which would be send if
you don't specify anything everyone
would be pulled in so if I want the
latest I could say :
latest where busybox is the image name :
and something after it is a tag just
like the division here we say that it is
the type so let's go back and download
our VC box or maybe even ok I'll
download the busybox it's very small in
size say busybox latest or it
it would now connect to the docker hub
pull the image from there it is also
possible to create your own local
repository so that the docker container
sorry the doctor engine would be
connecting to your own repository it's
clock the removal question so it says
it's pulling from the doctor biome every
slash busybox it would take some time to
connect figure out the different layers
then download base layers and paper
image okay therefore time out this thing
google.com can correct
so by the time we figure out these
things do we have any more queries to be
asked
okay so this is bad licky we check marks
apology here
so there is a question here from Santosh
so do we bind our IP or the host type in
that case ok the case was about using
load balancers with docker we don't bind
the doctor ip's docker ip's are very
much internal to the host machine ok you
could only use the eyepiece if you want
to connect to that docker IP from the
host box in case you want to expose that
docker process outside you will be
exposing that over a port ok so you
could expose ports in darker so you will
be binding it to the host IP and docker
put another query is coming in from su
Manish can you install talker on Mac
directly or do you need a VirtualBox Mac
does support containers so we can
install dog directly on stock or
directly on Mac ok so finally have that
I have that money let's hold it for a
minute I am connecting to my docker
instance
another question from Rashmi for
application testing its work but how is
how it's applicable for storage testing
like Shannon ass okay there is
persistent storage option in docker
so if you want to make the storage
persistent in that case you write to
actual host Lucie so docker containers
are very much volatile okay once you
stop the execution docker containers are
stopped all the data which is supposed
to be dynamic or old which is kept in
your RAM or internal disk would be lost
if you kill that particular container
okay after stop it is it can be
destroyed later so if you don't want it
data to be destroyed even in case of
testing you write it not to the docker
disk but you mount some disk from the
host into docker and write to that
particular part of it that means when
you write to it your data wouldn't be
written to the docker container but it
percolate into the host or any other
mounted network it might be sad it might
even ask whatever you want to do now
pull we were trying about busy box and
the latest attack okay there is another
question from for indra i want to create
image of one vm how can i do that
well i'm not sure how it connects to
docker
I'm not sure whether I understand the
question
it could be more elaborative I could
take it again another question from
Sandy which language you use for docker
file
doctress but its own language it's
pretty much declarative if you look at
that there were very few key words it
would say pulled from ad copy and
something like that very few key words
are there okay so that's very simple
if you check here we have typed in local
docker pool busybox latest tag it is it
has started pulling the the repository
from dr io / library / easy box
pulling the metadata now it's pulling
the fs layer and the downloads have been
completed there's something we are it's
waiting for some more layers to come
down and now it's there
okay so we have downloaded the BC box if
I want to check which images I have I
would be typing in docker images so
currently I have busybox image I have
already kept open - image downloaded but
if you change the size your BC box image
is nothing more than one point three
three over one point one one three MB
and your Ubuntu is nothing more that one
88a be okay so one who doesn't come in a
package at at that size if you talk of
kernel and always all those supporting
stuff which is common in most of the
operating systems that part is
completely stripped off so that part
will be picked up from the virtual
machines kernel on which I am running
the docker okay so to talk typing docker
info it would give you the information
about the current docker installation
your systems configuration what is being
used currently ok so that's one we have
pulled the image now we are ready to
execute the the container container
would execute only till the time in
which the process six cubes so in the
process terminates your container will
automatically terminate it wouldn't keep
on executing so the containers are
tightly hooked with the process
executions if your process is not
running the container will not be
running if you process runs deep
container runs it also means the process
the containers will keep on running till
the point you come process is still
running inside the container so let's do
one thing let us run a process so I have
a docker I want to run the image BeeZee
box if I don't specify anything that is
supposed to be latest by default so
that's busy box let's execute echo okay
and I go what
I could say a doctor for now so docker
run is a command which helps us in
running the docker containers basically
we run the images into a container so
multiple containers can be executed from
one image at a given point okay see if I
hit enter it would say hello docker
which is supposed to be the result
coming in from the container but does it
does this container run okay is it still
running how do we know that you could
check by typing in docker PS so it gives
you a list of currently running
containers the container is not running
currently so how do we check i check yes
a which would give me a list of all the
dropper containers running oh sorry
all the daughter containers which have
been not deleted and are still still
there on the disk but they are not
running so the latest one was busy box
okay containers are identified by
container IDs the commands that were
supposed to be running inside that
particular docker container its status
okay so apparently it exited with a
success which is zero in case of line x
zero means success anything which is
non-zero is a report and if you have
exposed any of the ports it would show
it here so let's say there is a question
here from mr. Santosh if he has an
application running on docker on a
particular port for example Tomcat on
port number ninety eighty pound this
application for to docker a scent put
awesome so let's do one thing we were
supposed to be running an application so
it's low doing CP echo of being echo I
would be running a docker I would be
running a server by typing in some
command for the start script I don't
know which what is the path but probably
this would be the case so start would be
a script name that you are supposed to
be running for executing a tomcat inside
of a docker container okay here I will
be throw
in the port I want to map the port
number let's take it port number 80 80
on my host machine should be mapped to
port number 80 80 inside the docker
container that's how I map it if I want
to map multiple ports at the same time I
could say port number 80 should be
mapped to port number 80 inside dr.
container the first part is the host
part the second part is the container
okay
I hope that answers the question okay so
what if there is a continuously running
job then the docker container wouldn't
terminate okay how do I show it to you
so let's say we have a sample job
currently I'm just typing in a very
simple job here singular docker run -
Dee is Damon we are running busy box and
I would say execute bin SH with a code
which says an infinite good while true
you could run something as interactive
shell which is also a non terminating
process okay I just show you the
interactive shell shortly echo would be
I say darker and let's keep it sleeping
for one second
done so that's a small shell script to
create a infinite loop that would be
sleeping for one second in between and
it going to ah corrupt so what I did was
I executed a docker container and I have
assigned the reference to a variable
called sample job okay so if I if I have
done that how do we check the logs what
is happening instead of sample I would
say doc good logs checks aperture
okay so there are there is some output
which is coming in from that sorry
docker container and we are looking at
the budding log it is checked by tapping
in darker locks the container is
currently executing if I check it off
c'mon talker sorry docker PS - eh we
don't have to type in mine see now
because we know that the container is
still running and we are checking the
logs by comma type in the command docker
lots which is we are executing outside
the container for maybe any reason I
want to attach back to the 20th how do I
do that I would say blocker attach
doctor touch - what doc attached to
container ID and now I am linked to the
console of that particular container see
if you see the output it is just like I
am directly inside that container right
now so if I kill it I am out the process
terminated the container terminate if
you type in dr. PS again you wouldn't
find anything Daugherty s - a would give
you a list that this was the command
which was executed and it terminated
about eight seconds ago okay another
example let's say we have a a docker
container which I want to run and I want
to have an interactive terminal - t - i
and i want to have it using the image
called
ubuntu okay and what is the environment
i want to login it is in bash so
currently the container is created with
ID 8 3 e 6 7 something okay and i have a
terminal now i am a root whenever you
login into our material you get
root privileges see you are a root and
you put now install any package inside
of it if I want this docker container to
be treated as Apache or a webserver I
would say please install apache2 instead
of that ubuntu vented and that book but
remember I'm not installing it inside
the docker container I am NOT installing
it on the host so I am not polluting the
host the docker containers would be
reusable if something doesn't go right I
could say scrub it off okay and then and
my host machine still remains pure so
let me show it to you we are doing this
the result of the query coming in from
fan Indra I want to build a virtual
machine image and make use of it using
docker pull in another VM build a
virtual sheet image and make use of it
using docker full I am still not sure
what you are trying to do I'm really
sorry for that I am NOT getting a
question right you're trying to build a
version we make virtual machine image
okay I got it
it could be a VDI image if possible and
make use of it using docker pull in
another pn how do you push another
virtual machine image another in another
beer
sorry phonogram still not getting it if
you have got time we can talk maybe at
the end of the session and spend some
more time on understanding it or maybe
you could I could unmute you and we
could have a chat
so we have downloaded Apache it would be
installing it so what I've done is I'm
running our docker container right now I
could stop this docker container I could
start it again and we could find the
same number of files which are written
to it right now so how do we get off get
out of the docker container simply type
in exit and the talkative container
would be terminated so let's try it
again
docker PS - eh it exited five seconds
ago which was started with Ubuntu how do
I start it again I would say docker stop
start water start the container so the
container started but if the container
started was it interactive
no it wasn't okay so it's not an
interactive terminal now it's running in
the background so there is a server
inside of it which is installed it's
running okay it's running in the
background how do you attach to it I
could say darker attach to every time if
I have to remember the ID that's
cumbersome okay that could be a problem
so we don't we don't want to remember
IDs what we could do is we could instead
of that we would name the different
containers that we are forming okay let
me check if Apache is here if you see
d2h see a far che so there is a folder
Apache has been installed okay I can
terminate it again by typing an exit I'm
off okay nothing is running you could
start it again you could attach to it
and if you want to execute a command
inside of a docker container without
getting inside of it that is command
called docker exe C or execute okay you
could use that command to execute the
commands inside of a particular doctor
container so you'll have to remember the
proper container ID again so for now I
am getting rid of the docker container
ladies and I would say I just want
docker run a container in interactive
mode another one using the image called
Ubuntu but this time I want it to be
given a name I would say that the name
should be demo okay and the command I
want to execute in bash so currently I
am in the interactive shell I am getting
out of it it terminated off you check
dogger PS it is it isn't there dr. PS -
a if you look closely the name part here
says demo so if you want to attach to
that container again I would say docker
attack a docker start demo I don't have
to remember the container ID then I
could say dr. attach to demo or we could
say X cube
some commands on demo so we would
execute something like then echo in the
world and that executed back okay it's
completely running in isolation I would
say docker stop the container
Damona a stop demo it stopped I could
commit it back so before committing I
could check the difference on demo so
what changed in them since its last
execution history file changed okay
there's another one which checks darker
history the image if you want to check
the history of image you could type in
docker history if you want to check the
differences between the container from
the point it started till the current
point you could type in dr. TIFF on the
particular container so you could get a
complete TIF set
you could also check the difference
between the GUI images if you are if you
want to push the image back to the
repository could type in docker
push at the image name but before
pushing the image you need to commit
that image right so I have a docker
instance we have named it as demo and
okay there was one more right Letta
Letta check I will show you deaf of it
docker PS - a and we have executed a
patch installation in this so I would
say docker give me a div on grave prom
see if you check closely a whole lot of
files were changed or added okay so dr.
maintains the list of everything that
was changed in the particular container
we could figure out what's there it's
just like a small revision control
system but for the operating system as a
whole
alright so how do I commit I would say
dr. commit back commit what commit the
image clean demo sorry the container of
name demo2 the image you could give any
name to it
currently I am saving it with the same
name we went to but I want a different
tag so I say Ubuntu demo it had
committed it good let's get let's get
back and check docker images you would
be having the fourth one Ubuntu demo
we're going to let us first already
there we have committed one more is the
same name Ubuntu and attack called them
if I want to push it back so I would say
docker push Ubuntu them but I don't want
to push it to the public repository it's
not fair for other people suddenly bit
for here I wouldn't be pushing the
contents back there are many more things
that you could do you have seen how to
expose the ports there are stuff like
linking the two images together creating
the different separate which are we have
seen how to attach
to the docker image how to execute a
command on the continuous directly okay
also I've seen how to stop it the last
basic stuff that you want to do is
delete the mess that you have created
okay
there are ways to import and export side
would simply do some exports from a
waged docker export Ubuntu to some
record or tar so it's not open to its
container ID so my demo container would
be exported to a file called reporter I
could mail it to you you could download
it use it again somewhere else so this
offline portability online portability
is just pushing to pushing to the
repository and pulling it from the
request okay
there is another way of doing it you
could say not export you would say
something like load there's also a
command called seal so save would also
work in this case so it we check our
save would work so save works on image
currently we worked on a container
docker save image an image name is one
too and we could send it across as image
dot tar it would be dumping that image
to the image dot tar file if you want to
load it from the image instead of say
you used load if you want to import it
from the Excel report R which is the
container of container archive you could
use it using docker import instead of
export okay we check the disk there
would be two typos tar files here which
is useful for offline transport of
fights so instead of pulling it from the
centralized repository into time what we
could do is we could
clean the tar files and then use the
mechanisms like arcing to deploy to all
our moves at once okay if you check the
sizes of it 197 mbmb along with the
batch package installed so it doesn't
take much of the space so that's all
about docker basics that I had to
deliver today thank you so much for
patiently waiting for all the stuff to
go by and bearing with me during the
time any more questions that you think I
would be answering anything you have if
you want me to get in discussions with
you please read through the raise your
hand I can unmute you and we could have
its culture yes mr. Santhosh you will
come rush me any more questions from
anyone else
sorry Santosh if there is a my problem
with the mic you could type in your
query here can we have the question from
Santosh is can we have our own local
repository yes we can have it and it is
also called local repository uh so what
you can do is you could have your rocket
systems connect to your local repository
by using the lock in command now get the
commands name is login and you could log
into your local repository first and
from there you could use it the syntax
is like this docker login ah docker
login to your local repository so maybe
you could say local host something
called port Emre dat which is by default
there if you have it on some another
machine you could say my daughter is
running on some another box which C it
is or in DNS you have set it up as
docker dot example.com on port 8080
so you could use all the images which
are pulled on that particular machine so
let's say on my particular box right now
we have two images which are pulled and
so if one
friend is using my system as the
repository at the centralized repository
he could use those both images both of
those images that I have downloaded
nothing more would be available for him
but he would use just my so in that way
he prevents himself from connecting to
the internet okay that that's not
required in that case this question here
from kalindra of Virendra I am unmuting
you all right hi hi thank you
I have a virtual machine in that and
JBoss jegos is running on it up and I
have installed some rpms in it so I want
to create an image of it and then make
use of that in another virtual machine
alright so we don't have to do that in
the first place
okay how do we tell her they don't know
who I want to don't go into I mean take
anything like image predefined ugundi
image or anything I have already a setup
and I want to create image of it and
make use it of it in another versions
see docker images are completely
different than your virtual machine
images the oppor images are a very
specific layered file system which is
not understood by any of the virtual
machines and neither can docker and
understand any of the media VMDK
extensions so that is completely
different okay so what you need to do is
you need to have the bare operating
system from darker and we set up all
those things that if you want to install
JBoss inside of it you have to do it on
your own first save that image then
reuse it if you don't want to do that
there's better option go to docker hub
check for JBoss there would be some
JBoss repositories already there okay so
you could use it from JBoss wildfly
public repository you do not have to
install anything
simply download by tapping in talker
will cheapest it would be helpful and
after that you do your own configuration
that will be one-time setup that you
will be doing and thats all is
while you cannot have virtual machines
images running in docker I hope that
answers the question okay alright okay
one more thing the we are creating a tar
file out of it right the tar file will
be keep the size will be very large
right now it is not very large if you
have seen we had Ubuntu operating system
plus we had Apache installed on top of
it total size was 197 MB and the second
question is we have a vagrant and packer
right yes I concur all right right so we
need to have a Jason Script kind of
thing to create a pieman image out of it
so we are that I am facing a problem
without creating a Jason so mm-hm
can you even mean that see dr. Anne
Packard are more similar um background
is a bit different so background could
be related to virtual machine stop but
if you are talking of Packer it's a
technology which is created by Microsoft
guys to have containers supported on
their own system so this is not a
planets container this is a new Windows
technology that supports their own
containerization and it's called packet
that's what they use technology-wise the
scripts that these systems support are
completely different and pay so I
wouldn't be able to help you out right
now with this if you have any more
questions I would be happy to help you
okay thank you here you're welcome
so where's that's all have to offer a if
