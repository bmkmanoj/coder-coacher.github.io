and I welcome you all to this
introductory series of ServiceNow
sessions today's session mainly focuses
on ServiceNow developer role so people
who are interested in coding or
scripting should definitely like this
video before we get into the details of
service now let me quickly give you an
outline as in what to expect out of this
session well firstly I would be starting
things off with ServiceNow
nitty-gritties that is why it is needed
and what it is then I would introduce
you to service in our developer instance
this instance is something that we would
be using throughout our demo session
then I would get into the development
part that is what is service non
scripting and client scripting in
particular finally I would give you some
templates so you understand the
scripting part better and then we would
design our own script this is where I
rest my session I hope this agenda is
clear to all of you
so without any further ado let's start
with the first topic of discussion that
is why ServiceNow now they're quite a
few tools in the market that deals with
ITSM but ServiceNow still leaves the
pack now these are the reasons why
ServiceNow is so popular it gives you
automatic upgrades say for example you
are working on a particular process and
there is an upgrade which needs to be
pushed on your system ServiceNow make
sure that this upgrade happens in the
background so you are not disturbed
while you are working on your process
apart from that it's purely a web-based
platform since it's a cloud platform
everything - anything that is whether
you are a user or a developer everything
you do that rests or lies on the browser
and that is a good feature to have apart
from that if there is a new user
interface that has to be introduced into
service now once it is introduced it's
made sure that it is automatically made
available to your mobile interface as
well and you can access it using a
mobile phone - finally it gives you
custom subscriptions so whether it's
licensing or having new users everything
is taken care in the form of
subscriptions and if there are more
number of users all you have to do is
make sure you have more subscriptions
that's it these are some other features
which make ServiceNow popular say for
example it is customer focused and it
has automated workflows now when you say
automated workflows it makes sure that
all your tedious and repetitive tasks
are taken care automatically so you
don't have to worry about performing
those on your own apart from that it
gives it drag and drop features say for
example role allocations are maybe
building an application or developing an
application everything can be done by
using these drag and drop features now
these are the reasons why ServiceNow is
so popular so this was about why
ServiceNow is needed and why is it so
popular let us move further and try to
understand what is ServiceNow now
ServiceNow is a software platform that
automates various business processes it
supports to deployment models that is
SAS which is software as a service and
pass which is platform as a service
service now also supports various other
modular applications which differ from
user to user
I may be instance to instance if you
talk about its history it was founded in
2004 and it was founded by Fred bloody
who is the previous CTO of companies
like Peregrine systems and remedy
corporations if you talk about its
customers they're quite a few customers
which service now has to name a few we
have facebook we have pritter we have
Bell with a fairly popular so this was
about what is service now now let us
move further and take a look at one of
its services or processes which it is
popular for
now ServiceNow is very popular as an IT
SM tool when I say ITSM I mean IE
service management tool and one of its
important processes is incident
management I would be quickly walking
you through what incident management is
we won't be talking about incident
management in the further slides once we
are done with the introduction part of
incident management the reason as these
topics have been covered in depth in our
previous videos so if you are interested
to know more about incident management
that is in detail I would suggest that
you go through those videos as far as
the introduction is concerned I would be
quickly walking you through it right now
so what is an incident incident is
nothing but an unplanned interruption to
an IP Service say for example I have a
system and I am working on a particular
service no process for now and my system
goes down now this is an incident so
what does incident management do as far
as incident management is concerned the
aim is to restore normal service as
quickly as possible and that - with
minimum adverse effects or side effects
let us take an example for incident
management suppose there is a user whose
name is Joe what does Joe do if his
system goes down well Joe will first
fill in an incident form and submit it
to the support team how does Joe do that
Joe does that using connect chat now
what is connect chat connects at is
nothing but a chatting feature in
ServiceNow that connects all the people
in the organization that are under the
umbrella of ServiceNow so you can stay
in touch with all the employees that are
there in the company so what Joe does is
he submits his incident form to the
support team now support team delegates
this incident to the person who is
capable to solve this problem now that
person resolves the issue and gives the
feedback back to the user saying that
your problem has been resolved and you
can perform your services normally again
so this is what incident management is
registering an incident and solving the
issue with the incident it seems fairly
simple but it can be complicated than
what it looks say for example I have a
problem with my system and which is of
high importance I was supposed to deal
with few clients which are of high
importance to the company and those have
to be dealt with by the
of the day now my priority or the
priority of my incident might be higher
than priority of other incidents so
ServiceNow gives you features using
which you can set the priority levels as
well which gives importance to your
incident compared to other incidents
which can be resolved later now while
doing so we also have to consider the
fact that when an incident is recorded
it may go through a series of people
before it as a result say for example
when I registered my incident who does
it go to first it goes to the person who
is first in line of contact the person
just takes in the request and he
forwards it to the incident manager now
incident manager is a person who is
responsible for delegating this incident
to the respective person who can solve
this problem now this delegation might
go to a series of people again say for
example my system is not working
properly there's an hardware issue with
it a software issue with it and
something else needs to be fixed as well
so this request might flow from one
person to second person to third person
who is capable enough to solve the
problem and when the solution is given
that is when the request goes back or
the incident goes back to the user with
a feedback saying that your problem has
been resolved so yeah incident
management can be a single step process
or it can be a multi-step process as
well I hope you all have understood what
incident management is in that case we
can move further and try to understand
what is ServiceNow developer instance
well ServiceNow developer instance
serves as a portal to explore ServiceNow
platform when I say this I mean
ServiceNow gives you an instance using
which you can actually interact with
ServiceNow system that is you can have
hands-on and see and use how the
ServiceNow features work to do that all
you have to do is you have to create
your own instance log into ServiceNow
website and start using ServiceNow
ServiceNow also offers you quite a few
documentation and all those things using
which you would get to know how to use
ServiceNow system as far as the
ServiceNow developer instance is
concerned this is how it looks you have
the URL using which you can log in then
the build is Jakarta when I say Jakarta
Jakarta is nothing
the latest version of ServiceNow that is
available ServiceNow has an interesting
way of labeling the versions they start
from a to the latest version which is J
and each version is named based on a
particular reason or a city next would
be something with K and I believe it has
already been decided which is Kensington
if I am NOT wrong so this was about the
build you can see that the remaining
inactivity period is uranus ten days
that is if you do not use your
ServiceNow developer instance for ten
continuous days your instance would be
released and would be given to someone
else to use so if you want to keep your
instance intact you have to make sure
that you log in in every ten days at
least once even if your instance does
get released you don't have to worry
about it you can always request for
another instance but there's a
possibility you might lose out on your
data so this was about ServiceNow
developer instance how do I get one well
to start with you have to make sure you
log in to ServiceNow website first and
once you log in you have to make sure
you request an instance so how do you do
that as you can see in this slide you
have a link which you have to follow
that is www.instanteulogy.com adat
service not calm and once you do that
all you have to do is you have to
request an instance and then you have to
select the latest version which is
Jakarta in this case I would say that
you go for Jakarta because as far as
scripting is concerned it is preferable
that you use the latest version and for
now that is Jakarta so this was about
ServiceNow developer instance I would
soon be introducing you to the service
not developer instance but before that
let us take a look at what is scripting
first so what is scripting basically
scripting is nothing but a piece of code
that either runs on a client or on your
server so what does this piece of code
do well scripting does nothing but it
configures your system to perform
particular tasks that might have been
triggered by a particular event
what are the types of scripting
basically there are two types one is
your client-side scripting and a
server-side scripting let us take a look
at these one by one
now server-side script is nothing but a
script that runs on your
Hanyu database notice it has access to
your database or your server
say for example a user wants to fetch a
record from the database so he writes a
script or a code alright he just writes
a query for fetching that record now
there is a script that runs on a
database on your server this script is
called as your server-side scripting now
we won't be discussing server-side
scripting into details so I would keep
it here and I would move to the next
part that is client-side scripting now
client-side scripting is nothing but a
script that runs on your client now
since users have access to forms what
clients Xcode does is it basically
tailors your forms on your system to
suit their needs
say for example modifying the values in
the forum now what does the script do is
it makes few fields visible it gives you
read-only right only accesses to these
fields say for example I have to enter a
particular record in my form and the
record that has to be entered is the
name now name cannot be a number so I
can set an access write saying that if
the user enters a number
throw him an error saying that this is a
wrong value please enter character
values so this is nothing but a script
running on your client so this is what
client script is and let us take a look
at types of client-side scripting now as
far as ServiceNow is concerned we have
four types of client-side scripting yes
I know the screen shows only three types
because these are three which we are
going to discuss but I would tell you
what the fourth type is as well we have
an onload script a non changed script
and an onsubmit script instead of
listening to what I say and trying to
understand what these scripts are
instead what I would do is I would just
make sure that I give you a demo so what
we do is we would now switch to our
service not developer instance so you
would get to know how the interface is
and then I can give you an example as in
what are these scripts and what do they
do exactly so let me quickly switch to
my service not developer instance so I
have gone ahead and logged into
ServiceNow interface so this is how this
original developer instance basically
looks
to navigate you or to guide you through
this interface this on the left hand
side is nothing but a filter navigator
using which you can quickly navigate to
different pages or forms say for example
I go to incidents and I hit the enter
button here and I have incidents if I
click on it
these are is equal to
apart from that as you can see I am
logged in here as a system administrator
so I have all the accesses which a
system administrator will have as in I
can impersonate different users I can
elevate rows and all those things but
this discussion is for some other day
because we have concerned about the
development part today apart from that
you can see that there are a few click
go to menus say for example you can go
to creating an application directly or
maybe you can get into the analytics
part as in where you can create reports
and all those things if you click on
this icon it would take you to the
system security and all those things so
these are click options which you would
directly take you to the navigated pages
as well apart from that we have this
connect chat which I talked about a
while ago you can click on it and then
you'll have access to the portal and you
can actually connect with different
people here all you have to do is you
have to enter the name of the person you
want to chat with and you can connect to
that person if the person exists you can
send them files documents and all those
things so let us now get back to a
previous discussion that is the
client-side scripting I talked about
three types of client scripts let us
take a look at those scripts in
particular first what I do this and get
into the incident sparked when I type
incident in the service text menu I
would have access to all the incidents
that have been recorded recently so what
I do is I go ahead and open one of those
incidents
now if I click on this symbol and I go
to configure and say client scripts it
would give me access to all the client
scripts that are there in this incident
so now as you can see we have the
scripts as an unchanged script on submit
script on load script so let us take a
look at these scripts one by one so I
open this occur
- I can see there are few fields which
can be entered and when I scroll down I
see the unload script basically so what
does the script do well discreet loads
when the user loads in a particular form
all the script runs when the user loads
in a particular form
now this script it loads so fast or it
runs so fast that user might not even
notice it the main function of this
scrap is to make sure that it controls
the appearance of the form when the user
first loads
then we have the unchanged script now
this script runs when the user changes a
particular form or a field in a
particular form if you take a look at
this script you can see that we passing
parameters like old value new value so
say for example I change the description
in a particular form saying that value
XYZ which is replaced with say value ABC
so when I submit this form or when I
update the change the system will throw
in a notification saying that the value
in the short description was changed
from XYZ to EBC and then we have the on
submit script this script runs when the
user submits a particular form now what
does this could do this could basically
validates the changes that the user has
made and then finally we have the on
send edit script which I did not mention
in my PPT the reason is simple
the on change script and the on Excel
edit script are exactly same there is
one minor difference the on change
script it runs on the forms whereas the
on-cell edit script it basically runs
when you make changes to the lists so
that is the only difference here the
first script runs when you make changes
to the form and the on-cell script edit
script runs when you make changes to the
list that's it
so this was about the four scripts which
service not supports let us go ahead and
do one thing let us create an
application and in that application let
us try to take a look at these scripts
what I am going to do is I am going to
import a custom script or a custom
application which already exists which
already has these three scripts running
so what we can do is we can just go
ahead and pick that script up and take a
look at how these scripts work basically
once we have seen this then we would go
ahead and create our own script so for
now what I am going to do is I am going
to create a github account log into it
and import a repository which has an
application called as needed using this
application we are going to study the
client scripts for people who are new to
concepts like github and depository let
me tell you github is nothing but a hub
as the name
which holds a lot of repositories now
what is a repository repository you can
consider a repository as a folder which
basically holds scripts or applications
now these applications are either build
by someone or they're custom-made you
can use these applications and you can
edit these applications further to suit
your needs so that is what we are going
to do we are going to log in to github
and we are going to import a repository
called has day of training made it
Jakarta so I have already opened github
website all you have to do is we
archetype every wwr github.com which is
here and you are good to go if you do
not have an account I would say you sign
up first and create an account which is
very easy it would ask you to fill in a
couple of forms and given few basic
details like why do you want to use this
account and all those things and once
you've done it then all you have to do
is sign in I already have an account of
on github so I am just going to sign
there you go I have quite a few accounts
here because I've been on YouTube a lot
recently let me just sign in to one of
the accounts which I am using I believe
it forward on the password button let me
try this
yeah there you go have successfully
logged in now I've logged in to get her
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
share a link with you people you have to
follow that link directly and folk that
so-called repository into ServiceNow so
this is the link basically you hit the
enter button and
you get it there it is visible here
don't worry I would still be giving you
the link which you can refer I would
make sure that I leave the link in the
description section below so you all can
have access to it so this is the
repository which I need to poke in so
when I say token I am just making a copy
of this repository bits I can use and
edit it into my service now so if you
want to focus you have to click on this
icon yeah it might take a couple of
seconds it happens pretty quickly though
so that varies as for your internet
speed as well there you go it has been
poked the next step is to clone it or to
make a copy of it yes and you copy this
link which we are going to use into a
service map so I have copied the link as
well now I would go further and use it
into my service now so in order to do
that what you have to do is you have to
go to filter navigator hogni and types
to do it the enter button
and there you go it would ask you
whether you want to create a new
application or import from source
control so I would say import because
we've just imported a repository then
link which I just copied right now you
copy it here and then you enter the
credentials yeah
when I say credentials I mean the bit of
credentials from where you're poking the
repository so you will be needing those
credentials as well so when I say import
it imports the so-called application
into my service now
yeah and it has been imported you can
see the needed application is here the
selected
now there are no branches created when I
say branches I have to create a flow or
I should say I have to create a place
where I can create my transcripts so in
order to do that what you do is you go
to source control you say create branch
and you give it a particular name say
the name is needed
-
and to save this I have to create a tag
for this first say I say load for client
scripts model I say create a branch oh I
I believe I should use a different name
so in order to do that what I do is I go
back I say create a branch first I say
load from transcripts model so I will go
ahead and give it the same name the
client scripts model and then I would
say create branch it should be create it
now one two three four I believe my
internet is pretty slow so it's taking
more time yes and there you go your
application is ready to use and as you
can see it has created branches and
given you the client script examples as
well I have on change I have on load and
on submit let us take a look at these
one by one
as you can see you have this unload
script available if you don't click on
active the changes that you make on
forms and all those won't be visible to
you in the form of alerts let me give
you an example what I mean by - say I go
back now that I've already created my
needed application I first refresh my
system once or my instance once after
that I need it here
there you see your current update set
has been changed to default that is
needed which was global prior to this so
I type in need it here and once I do
that I would have records under all so I
click on all and I open one of those
records now say for example I change the
priority value here from low to moderate
and I say update now the wire has been
updated but no notification was given to
me as in order to see whether the change
has been made or not I need to make sure
that I active all my Cuban client
scripts say for example this is a
transcript yuan wrote one what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say active here
and I'm going to say from date there you
go then I go to my change script again I
click on active this is the script I say
update again
and finally on submit
if a bit
and yeah yeah very much good people
so again I push my page once just for
the sake of revision now I open the
first report I have there you go there's
a message for you thank you for loading
the needed form when you close this
alert you will be able to interact with
the form so that means the load script
did run and it also gave me another now
what I will do is I'll go ahead and
change this value I'll make a change to
this well and then I'll submit the forms
a critical and Isis update so it would
give me an update saying that your
request has been submitted there you go
that means my on submit script is also
running next I do this I would and this
time I make a change to the description
check on new hire status and I add one
more hundred saying and update B log in
X Y Z field and
of day today so if you can see it
there's an update given you saying that
you have changed the short description
from check on new higher status to check
on new higher status dot and update
below in XYZ team that means our own
change script is also running so this
was about the custom application which
let us our did give us an access to the
customized planned scripts I should say
let us go ahead and try to do one thing
let us try and create a script on own or
write a script on my own and see how it
works
so what can we do for the script
basically so what I'll do is I'll go
back I would prevent the things from
Murphy I would open this record
in this record you can see this a field
called as request type and it gives you
three options that is human resources
facilities and legal there's one more
field called as what needed now this
field tells you even if the request type
is legal and what is needed for it say
for example it's legal one here in this
case what if I wanted a request ID field
say if there's a particular requesting
field which says there's a particular
value in this case it's legal what if I
wanted this field to respond to this
field saying that if there is legal in
this field the work needed field should
give me only these options say for
example legal one legal to and other and
make sure that it hides these options
can we do that yes we can definitely do
that let us go ahead and go and do that
first in order to do that what we have
to do this we have to again go back to
our needed application click on create
application after that we go to client
development and we click on client
script we say create so our new form
opens what we do is we go ahead and give
a name to this so called clients left or
part of an application and the name I
give it letters near that request
like option yeah the tables which are
used for this thing is again an editable
UI type has to be fall and the type has
to be unchanged because we would be
making a change and when we do make a
change the script has to run as far as
the field name is concerned it was a
request type there you go
and the description I would say display
those fields
doc
actually relevant
to request
type value after I've done that I would
move further and I would start coding
when I say coding I would start writing
the script now what I have to do this
first thing I do is I go ahead and I
declare a variable basically and the
variable has to be
what needed is equal to G underscore one
dot
get value
I know you all might be wondering as in
what am i doing for people who are
completely new to the scripting part
don't worry I will be giving in few
information or some information as in
what am i doing exactly just bear with
me
yeah so what we would be doing is we
would be writing a script basically as
I've already mentioned and first thing I
do is I have to make sure that the
requests like filled when I select that
field first thing that happens is I
first hear all the work needed values
and replace those values only the values
which I need so in order to do that we
have to understand one thing client
scripts basically call an API called as
flight form when I say API it is nothing
but an application programming interface
now what does this API which is light
form does is it lets you control the
behavior of the form as and if you have
to edit a particular form you have to
use this API and code it accordingly or
create the script accordingly so what I
am going to do is I am going to use an
object called as G underscore form which
calls R which picks up the API into my
service now and implements this script
now this G underscore form object or the
glide form API has quite a few methods
which we can use say for example get
value get options as an if I have to
display a particular value I have to
enter in a particular value we have
methods for all those things so we would
be using few of those methods if I am
going too fast I'm sorry because I need
to cover this the scripting part and I
expect that you all know few basic
terminologies asn't what a method is and
what an object is so having said that I
would start the coding part now what I
am doing is basically I am using the
field whose label is what needed now if
you go back you can see that there is a
field which is what needed this is the
label of the field but if you configure
it you would see that it refers to
another field called s or this label
refers to a field called as you
underscore what underscore needed so
this is where all the records are held
so basically what I am trying to do this
fetch all those records and clear all
those records first so that I can go
ahead and I can create the records as I
want
so we have gone ahead and we have raised
those records now next step is to go
ahead and clear those records first so
other I'm going to
so how do we do that it's pretty easy
all we have to do is we have to again
call our platform object and I have to
go ahead and say the adoption and
again I am tellin my actual machining
which is this and yeah there you go so
this would clear the record scatter
there
now what we have to do this we have to
put in few conditions as in what if I
select it's a what should be the runners
that are displayed what if I select say
facilities what are the values that
should work so for that what we do is to
be putting an if condition and say if
new value
is equal to equal to HR then just go
ahead
and all my object
bitch basically
absorptions and when you add the options
again it has to be you on the school
what
under school needed comma my reference
field is
HR 1 and the value to be represented
here is Human Resources
say what and I end this piece of career
for this piece of course money basically
I am going to copy it and paste it
because I want to save in some time so
it's a copy control B copy again so this
is HR 1 bc p HR 2 to human little sister
to display my other field so yeah
to enter as
and it is advisable that you put in
comments here as in what are you doing
here so that when you use these codes it
is easy for you to understand however in
order to save time I won't be doing that
I hope you understand what we have done
here is if the new value is equal to HR
what it would do is it could give you
these options as in human resources one
human resources - and other in your work
needed field so likewise what I am going
to do is I am going to go ahead and I am
going to create few more records this
was for the HR field so I copy it paste
it this time I replace its are with
facilities and again it's our one word
facility is one and Human Resources one
case capital facility is one
facilities to
facilities to and the other fields
remains the same
this can be tedious and boring at times
yep
so the copying part is what I mean not
the scripting and finally be happy
neither field so it's legal I see you
got one
I say legal one here as well too
there you go so we've created the fields
successfully so this is when the user
makes a change to a particular field
that is when request type value is
changed say from example HR to
facilities the options that would be
visible would be only the ones that are
there in facilities but what is the user
does not make any change to the record
say for example facilities stays
facilities so maybe we need to change
the value no in that case we do not need
to change the run so what do I do for
that case I write one small script again
I say yes
is loading basically yeah and I'm not
equal to G underscore form is new
remember it's not is new record so what
do we do in this case in this case go
ahead and just do this G from dot set
value and Alice again you underscore
what underscore need notice
what
nearly yeah there you go so just to
verify it once we have this code and we
are going to run it now so the code is
ready I am going to submit it now the
code has been updated successfully and
my application or my transcript is ready
to use so what we will do this will go
back and we'll test our transcript so
for that you go to homepage
yeah I again go to need it in that case
I say open I go to a particular record
which is this and I change this value
from legal to Human Resources you can
see the value in the word needed field
has also been changed
yeah so we have only two options that is
you want to just respond to another if I
change it to facilities it will change
to facilities that means a script is
working successfully yeah
so this was about one client script now
what we are going to do this we are
going to move further and try and create
one more script now what does this
script do now what I want to do is there
is this requested for field if I do
create a new user
I want this field to be shown the value
which I entered in Azle say for example
I enter in some different value here I
create a new record and ice and system
administrator this time I open that
record that value should be displayed so
let us go ahead and do that first in
order to do that what I do is I will go
back to my application I would say
create did we update this feed yeah we
did all I have to do is close it again
go to client development say clients
craft and create there you go
what I'm going to do is I am going to go
ahead and give this field a name I need
it set requested yeah that's so go ahead
you again select the needed table you go
ahead and you say fall and this time the
type is unload because each time you
load it it should give you the details
or the fields you want so this is a
fairly easy script to enter
so what would this feel basically do
this it will check to see if
that form is for a new picker
if yes then set the value to the
currently logged in user and the piece
of code which we are going to write
errors again the if condition it says G
underscore form is new record
Aki's go ahead and do this G underscore
form dot set value
now this is again the reference field
for
the requested value which we saw
fixed you underscore requested
underscore form and then it should
return the value
for this object which is G on the scope
of user and the field which I would be
using is user ID know you were I can the
court and I submit the script
let us go ahead and test our application
for that cost feel refreshed
we have three records in here this
record has been requested of Fred very
basically what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to create one more okay
requested for this is system
administrator by default so let us
change it say it's a Brambling and
request type legal legal when needed
let's given a particular day I'd say 23
there you I say practice record
showing the requested for field value
we submit as you can see that the script
is still running and it shows that the
value has been changed for short
description but that is not what I am is
basically we would be going ahead and
submitting the request as you can see
the fourth table has been added here or
the fourth record I should say
oh did we just open the round record
yeah
yeah this is the record practice record
showing the requested for field and many
open it this is what you get it was
requested for Abraham Lincoln as I've
told you so this pretty much shows that
both the scripts which we have created
our working fine and I hope this
so-called demo gave you some exposure to
how the ServiceNow scripting works so
this was about client scripting and how
we do scripting in service now I hope
you like this part of the video and I
hope you got to learn something that was
new if you have any questions please do
let me know about those questions in the
comment section below and I would be
more than happy to reply to all of you
people so yeah probably that has more or
less been on my end I hope that you like
the system and likewise I hope to see
you all again so as I did mention in the
agenda part that I would be resting my
session once we are done with the
scripting part so that's it bye bye see
you I hope you enjoyed listening to this
video please be kind enough to like it
and you can comment any of your doubts
and queries and we will reply to them at
the earliest do look out for more videos
