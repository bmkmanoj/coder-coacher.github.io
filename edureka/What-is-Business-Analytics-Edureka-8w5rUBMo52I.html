is study of business data using
statistical techniques and programming
for creating decisions of course and
insight for achieving business goals
this definition has almost all the
things what what we are trying to study
we are trying to study business data you
want any other data and how we are
trying to use that data we are trying to
use the data using statistical
techniques in programming right so what
we are using using business data not the
entire data for the business analytics
only not I am NOT talking about data
census I am NOT talking about you know a
big data usage but I'm talking about
from the perspective of business
analytics only right in this business
analytics we are studying business data
only and we are making use of business
data from the statistical technique and
programming that we have available in
the various analytical to to like are
like SAS or SPSS data right and by it we
are doing it we are doing it to create
Chisholm's of course and to get insight
and what it will do it will actually you
know help business to achieve their
goals it will help the marketing team
pitch analyze their effort on the
marketing right so various various use
cases can be come out from the data that
you are analyzing based on the data that
you are analyzing so this is the typical
definition of business analytics now how
who creates it and how could it be who
creates its that data analytics crime
period sake right so business analytics
solution typically are using statistical
and quantitative at cognitive analysis
and it's been created by the people like
the skill set they have for programming
for statistical knowledge and the
business knowledge so these are the
three basic thing that you need to have
to become a good business analytics guy
you need to have the knowledge of
mathematical or statistical concepts you
need to have the knowledge of
programming and coding but not you know
these tools are and the GUI tools are
available in our they are very
sophisticated so even if you are not
from a very much strong technical
background but you know our programming
a bit then you have the GUI and other
things
which you can do your attack task
without writing a line of code also so
these things that is app is very much
sophisticated now and as I have a saying
requirement is to become a good business
analytics guy you need to have good
mathematical and statistical concept
knowledge you need to have the knowledge
of programming and coding and you need
to have the domain knowledge
like if somebody who's working in
banking domain and somebody who's
working in energy utility somebody
sucking insurance and it's creating
insights on the data which is available
for that particular domain he need to
have the knowledge of that domain
because you cannot do if you don't have
the knowledge of the domain and you're
doing analytics it is like machine it is
like machine learning so if you will
skip the business part from the total
business analytics it will be it will be
machine learning it is like something
with machine is doing so maybe if I am
calculating the calculating the prices
of a house and I am seeing that the
pollution and my machine is saying the
pollution is not an important sector
with with some parameter value my
machine is saying the pollution is not
I'm not an important sector it does not
mean I will not include pollution in my
calculation in the calculation of the
pricing of a house it is important
factor but if you are doing it with a
machine learning technique it may be it
may not be an important factor but
ultimately for business analytics to
calculate the pricing of a house in
society pollution is an important factor
so even if it has a low rate age
business analytics guy will try to
implement it in the in the model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
