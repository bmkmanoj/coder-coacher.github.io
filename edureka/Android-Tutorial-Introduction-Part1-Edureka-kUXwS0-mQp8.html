application concepts for today that's
correct that's correct Shalini we have
to submit the application by the end of
6th class yes they've that go ahead
alright so let's begin the topic for
today david says his application
requires the knowledge for today's
section here right yes or no one it
would be just good if you can just
submitted by the end of 6th class
because then only the evaluation process
will step up I hope this is clear to
everyone no matter I hope this is clear
to you as well alright so let's talk
about the session that we have for today
we're and we'll be talking about the web
interaction and also talk about
customization of widgets so whenever we
talk about customization of digits or
whenever we talk about what web
interaction so it's like I need to have
the internet permissions if I talk about
the wave interaction because that is
very important secondly what I will be
doing is i'll be using the HTTP requests
here all right so let's take a look at
all these things one by one so what
we'll be doing is will be first taking
the HTTP client and the HTTP response so
we'll be getting the creating the client
will be using the client and getting the
HTTP request a response and then we'll
be talking about the JSON or JSON object
Twitter application with will be created
using a sample Twitter application which
will be using the JSON peach and then
we'll be also talking about async task
in the constellation of widgets all
right so let's begin with the first as I
told you is the project man so everybody
can take a look at the project plan here
as I told you each person stood in as
expected to create an Android
application as a project work for the
course certificates will be provided to
students after successful completion and
submission all right so at the time of
budget submission
skype interview will be conducted and
the projects will be evaluated on the
basis of usability functionality and
also they design all right so it's very
important to keep these three aspects in
mind while creating the project it has
usability functionality and the design
and if you face any problems we are
always there to help you onto under the
forum or on skype I hope this is clear
to everyone so as I told you from the 43
converts the project would have got
started and what we should have got the
various doubts with respect to the
specifications or various design
submissions by now but since it's not
being done by any of these students yet
we can I think we can stretch it over
and then we'll be moving on to the week
5 Aaron will be talking about the coding
assignment and we'll be talking about
will be completing the complete project
once and then up the street from the 16
onwards will be doing it support
indistinct a complete project and end of
the sixth week will be the complete
project done by RN I hope this
particular project plan is clear to
everyone and everybody agrees to the
complete project plan you all can
respond back onto the chat window all
right so after the project gets
completed so what happens is we take
three days where when we conduct the
project reviews and after the project
review will take up complete week when
we'll be something with the various
certificates of the project completion
all right so Jay you need some help on
Java can you just tell me about what
exactly is the help that you need on
Java so Jay
I'll wait first agenda right back all
right so jay says about object creation
etc I think so Jay a once you'll start
working on the project you if you have
any queries any concerns you can just
write to us or you can just take our
support on skype and that then I think
that would be helpful to you in order
list and a Santa various Java concepts I
hope this is fine with you so Jay all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
