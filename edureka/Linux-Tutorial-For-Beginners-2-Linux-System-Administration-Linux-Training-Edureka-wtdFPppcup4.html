denounce tutorial webinar so we spoke
about few of these topics yesterday so
we spoke about the basic commands in the
next verse and then we spoke about how
to manage files and then I spoke about
how to manage for our directories right
and in today's session we're going to
talk about these topics all right I'm
going to talk about advanced
repositories how to create dart files
how to compress files and how to
decompress files and I'll talk about
what our environment variables that is
speak about regular expressions and then
another important topic our talk about
is data processes right so how do you
kill processes how do you create a new
process how do you manage them how do
you set priorities there and then I'll
go on and talk about the managing users
right so user management is an important
aspect of our statehood administration
so to speak about that and then finally
finish off today's session by talking
about the SH aspect so a search is used
for networking
all right so without wasting much time
let's just get started
all right so working with Linux
repositories okay and it said that
stable versions of most software's will
already be available and enough
suppositories and the command to install
them is this so you would have heard me
say earlier that very easy to update
software and the operating system itself
by just running one simple command right
you can update the software so this is
what I'm talking about so you can just
run one command so this is the only
command that you need to run okay if you
just give sudo yum install and if you
give the package name then that
particular package will get updated okay
the sudo something that you would
recognize from what I told you earlier
this row is to be given to to execute
this command as a root user okay and if
you see that there are two other lines
and the only difference between these
three lines is the letter that the word
we are using here okay so in the first
case in case of any Red Hat Enterprise
Linux system or even send to s right
which falls under Red Hat we use yum
okay but if it's a Debian based system
like Ubuntu or everyone to x12 or any
any other Debian Linux system then you
would have to use apt I forget okay and
then if you're using a federal basis
then you go to use a DNF okay so these
are the three different commands
and these are the that's because the
repository name for rel it's called as
the yum repository and the repository
name for debian is called as the app
repository okay and for federal is
called DNF repository so that's why we
say we are first we will have to first
give the pseudo sudo command which would
make sure that we execute this command
as the root user and from the command
perspective the first part would be
calling or referring to the repository
okay so from the Centaurs it would refer
to the yum repository or from the ubuntu
footage if I go apt-get it would refer
to the healer app repository and then we
have something called as install and
then we say install and let's follow
that by package name then that
particular package will get installed so
for example over here it is Java right
I'm trying to show how to install Java
on your system so in this case if you
first give a young update then it will
first full update your links to your
repositories okay it would update the
yum command and the links that you have
between the repository and yourself so
it's not something related to
installation of Java okay this is just
another command that you specify if any
of your installation fails okay so this
is not a compulsory your command that
you need to run but besides that what
you have is yum install Java one point
8.0 I have an open JDK now what the pack
isn't or you see oh right that is Java
so if I want to install Java then I
would just give this particular package
name and I would say install okay
because the package name of Java that's
present in the Linux repository that is
called as Java one point eight point
zero opens you detail and similarly if
you want to install any other software
right a few Juanes insulin is a
technology like how do then you can just
give one such package name you just got
to find out what is the name of the
package that they have in the repository
you can just simply google it and it
will give you the package name and you
can just say yum install or sudo yum
install for by packaging followed by
Hadoop - 2.0 or two point three point
zero or very soon out of three point
zero is coming so you can say how do -
3.0 something like that and yeah if it's
if you want install docker then again
you can take sudo yum install docker and
probably the version in I don't think
doctor needs a version though and for
ensuring docker you can do it also
through good
okay so when I install docker in my
other open to VM right which I showed
you earlier so that VM has the docker
installed and the command that I ran
that time was sudo apt-get install
docker and that downloaded and installed
the latest version of docker that was
available in the repository okay yes so
that is it and once you're done with the
installation it would take quite some
time to install and once I know
everything is done then you love to just
you know update your environment
variables okay you have to set the
innominate variables over here in your
dot bash RC file and once you set the
UNAM and path over there then you can
just do source and then your software is
already it's installed okay now this is
another step which I skipped out because
this is not really necessary for you to
execute this okay I'll tell you why
because this command which is update -
alternatives - - conflict Java it is
only to select a particular version of
Java now let's say that you're new to
Linux okay and you're downloading job
for the first time then you just need to
run this command so after running this
command you can straight away just you
know probably when you're done with this
Java installed basically okay but it is
that you need to go to your rows sudo
we should do sudo G edit for your bash
RC file and update the path where Java
is installed
okay you got to specify it your
environment variables your runtime
engine that Java has been installed in
this path so you have to just copy the
path of your Java and paste it in the
environment variables over here and then
you have to source that particular bash
RC so when you are done with these two
things your Java is installed okay but
if you already have a Java package
installed okay so in my case when I will
be showing you this now I already have a
Java 1.7 package okay so now if I do a
sudo yum install Java one point 8.0 open
JDK then I'll have multiple versions of
Java okay and my environment variables
would be currently set to Java 1.7
because that's what I already have but
since you have you know multiple
versions of Java and since there are
different packages you can have multiple
packages of Java installed but can only
run one of them okay so you set which
one you want to run right that one you
set over here whether I want to choose
to work you type in or whether I want to
choose to execute it that I can choose
by your updating over here so I'll show
you this command also okay so that is
what I want to show you with respect to
our next repositories so similarly you
can even you know you can do a sudo yum
install PHP if you want to install your
PHP server you can just say VST my
sequel server if you want to install any
other software like W get you can do
that also so this is what we are saying
you know it's very simple to install
software so if you're doing it with the
GUI then you will have a lot of steps
that you need to do you need to go to
the website download the appropriate
package then extract them then install
them all those things so instead this is
just simpler and it's much faster okay
now let me go back to my terminal and
show you how that is done okay so I'm
going to go to my CD and the command is
sorrow
young install and now would come to Java
package so the package I'm going to
install is Java one point eight point
zero okay that's because Java 8 is a
place with this name okay so the package
name of Java it in the Linux
repositories is Java - one point eight
point zero
- open JDK now when I hit enter it asks
for the password because this particular
sorry for that guys when I use sudo to
execute this particular command then it
ask for a password because I am
executing this as a root user so that's
why if I try executing this as the local
user as my own user then it wouldn't be
possible to execute this command okay
I have to execute this as a root user
and the root user is one that has the
ultimate privileges the ultimate access
he has access to everything so you just
enter the password and put enter then
automatically your packages we get
downloaded and it will get installed so
now it says you know turtle download
size is 33 mb and it asks is it okay to
download voice and for yes and n stands
for no now if it's you when you're
turned on word Java when you give this
command you got to say Y and hit end up
because that would download the third
3eme package and install it on your
Linux machine okay but however I have
already download Java and since I've
done it already so I don't need to okay
I don't want to waste my time here
because this is session right I don't
want to waste your precious time so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
click on end and give enter is it fine
Siddarth a month all you guys were in a
session is it fine because I want to say
sometime you by hitting n okay because
otherwise it would take some time to set
up the installation process so okay fine
yeah and we're going to guess from you
both alright so I'm just going to click
on no okay so it says exiting on the
user command grid yeah so the one thing
you will notice that in row pen if you
put Y and a few hit enter it will
download for you and you would complete
the installation all right
and there's one noting that I would
actually like to add to this so pulling
while installing the same package right
while doing the sudo yum install Java
this package when you are trying to run
this command
if you want this why often to be chosen
automatically okay because right now it
entered into the interactive mode
okay a tractor motors when the colonel
was asking you should you download this
and do you want to download this an
executed data and I had to press N and
get out of it okay but however you might
not want to okay so there may be times
when you might want to by default this
click on yes so what you can do at that
time is you can just go back here sorrow
young you you have a flag up you can
just put - why and if you then install
it then it would not ask you it will not
get into this interactive mode so it
will take this why
white flag why option automatically and
it will you know install the java
package so that is what I wanted to show
you that's what I want to tell you so
that's how you install java okay so now
I'll just clear the screen guys okay so
the when you execute this command in
your Linux machine and when you finish
downloading an installation of your java
what you going to do is you go to set
your anomic variables okay so as it was
written in the slide right you go to
group this row G edit dot bash RC to
enter into the bash RC file and set the
innominate variables you have the path
to where your Java is installed okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to do
the same - and your dot path a fee is
something that will be present only in
your home directory okay so we got to
remember to go to CD and from CD you got
to access that you got to say it su ro G
edit space dot bash RC when you do this
it'll ask you for the password but of
course I have to enter the password
previously so would you ask me but yeah
when you do that you will open this
battery file okay
so right now my Java path is set to this
okay so this means when during runtime
and any application is using or
requesting for Java then it would look
for Java in this path so you just need
to find out where your Java has been
installed in your system so it would
most probably be in your user slash slip
slash JVM folder okay so let me go to
the same so it will be there under your
root directory so if you go to your my
computer from your file system under the
lib folder we have various packages that
will all be installed over here okay so
on my system it
all installed over here so this is the
GBM folder and inside you have all the
different Java packages which I have
downloaded over your time
so guys uh in this case supposing CI
have Java 1.7 point 0 open JDK installed
ok
now in your case you will have a Java
one point 8.0 open JDK installed so what
you go to do is you go to just right
click on that folder ok similar to what
I'm doing now ok I'm going to right
click and I just click on copy and go
here and paste the path over here ok if
ending existing already then remove that
and paste the new path so the past is
nothing but where your JVM is located
from your root so it's in route us our
library folder and then inside libraries
and JVM and yes this is the folder it's
predator ok and then you got to also
originally give the path to your bin
directory
ok so you have this you have been
directory so what do you do is you right
click on pin again copy go to your dot
bash RC ok you go to paste over here
alright so this is how this is what you
do this is our simple it is so when you
do it you go to save it and you go to
you know closes dot bash RC file and
when you are done with saving and
closing it just go back to your terminal
and you go to run this command
source dot bash RC okay so when you do
this then your term will get synced with
the updated endowment variables
otherwise even if you don't run it it's
fine you can just start executing your
commands from a new terminal then it
Robbie fine but yeah the source dot
batteries no need to sync your
innominate variables with this
particular terminal that is opened okay
so that's how you install Java in your
system okay guys so I'm just going to
clear the screen now okay and I'm going
to go back to my slides okay so I'm done
with showing you how to work with Linux
repositories and the next topic that I'm
going to talk about is that of Todd
files so what are tar files okay so all
of you Windows users might be aware of
this software called WinZip or WinRAR
okay what are they what do they do they
are basically to extract your files
right so they'll be in compressed form
and you have to extract them so in
Jeanette's we have an equivalent for
matter so in Linux it is either the tar
file or the gzip and the gun zip files
okay so tar is the preferred option so
I'm going to show you how to compress
and decompress the file with dot tar
format but however even gzip and gunship
is something that can be used if you
want to compress a file is with the GZ
format okay then you go to use this
command but however if you are going or
decompress it then you got to give guns
oh okay and syntax is here okay but
however with retard you for both
compressing and decompressing you will
use the same tar command itself so
you'll just have dot and in the
arguments there will be a minor change
so when you're compressing the file you
will have to specify - see okay and when
you are raw decompressing the file you
will have to give the flag - X otherwise
it's all fine
the we here stands for verbose and the F
here indicates that you want to compress
the file that is dimensioned followed by
your D command here okay so this F just
basically indicates that you go to
compress this particular file otherwise
the kernel will be wondering which file
to compress and it will throw an error -
later okay so that is what the X we have
your stand for these are the different
flags that are available with the Stars
command okay
okay before I go and show you how to do
the started me show you a place where
dart files will be your present so in
Linux right
no matter what kind of software
downloading whether it's a Java package
or if it's a Hadoop package if you are
downloading them manually from the
internet okay then you would get them in
the dot tar format okay or you might
find them in tdz format
okay so tar is something the most I mean
I would prefer if you people download
tar because that's the easiest I see
this to extract and you know also
compress them so again just download the
tar file it's very common and you can
just buy this running this one command
you can compress the file so the Hadoop
packages that are available on a fasces
website right that would almost be
around 2 or 3 GB but you the company's
format will only be around 100 or 200 MB
okay so same thing can be said for
something like Tomcat if you're
downloading the Tomcat package order and
nag yours
so anything of that so those packages
would have a lot of MB and to download
them you will need to compress em right
so because the lesser you download the
more you save on bandwidth so it's also
easier to transfer them in a compressed
format so for transferring especially
you use the star files ok you compress
them into tar format and then later when
you're done downloading you can extract
them and bring them to regular file
format so I'll show you how that is done
so first of all let me go to my terminal
and let's go to the Documents folder ok
here I'm doing an LS we have this so
what I'm going to do now is I'm gonna
fit LS - L ok when I run this you can
see the different files and the size ok
you can see that the LMS folder right
then let's folder here it has its the
highest ok it's showing it's 4 4 4 0 9 6
MB so what we can do is I'm going to
show you how to compress this and
convert it into a tar file so to convert
it into a tar file you go to say
tar - CBF okay X is when you're trying
to decompress it but CVS is when you're
trying to compress it so you're going to
say dot - CBS and then here comes the
tar file name so what you want be the
name of the tar file ok so I just want
to have it as LM s dot dot ok so this is
the name of the file I want to keep so I
will put that here and then you go to
specify the file which you want to
compress whether it's LMS or
than in the folder so I want to do it
for LMS so I can just say LMS okay and
when I have run this command then this
particular document would have been
compressed and it's present okay so if I
do an LS now you can see that there is
an LMS folder and an LMS tar file okay
so this is the compressed version of
this folder now when I do an LS LS minus
del command you see that there is a new
tar file that's created okay LMS dot dot
and then you have this folder who is the
tar file this one is so that's how
simple it is guys and what it can do now
is a few you can just transfer this file
over FTP or via SSH or you know just
upload this to your internet and let
people download this because this is a
smaller file compact with this proper
folder right now in case you want to
extract a file so in case you have
downloaded this kind of a tar file okay
from the Internet
how will you untie it what is the
package to not decompress it so to
answer that question I can we can give
the command start - XPS and the package
name so in my case it's LMS retard so
when I just do this and when I hit enter
then that package would get extracted so
now if I do an LS command you can see
that this particular tar file has been
extracted but you can see two different
folders because the existing elements
folder has been rewritten okay so it has
been well let's just say it has been
overwritten and that's why you can't
take two different files but yeah as you
can see this was the process which was
taken to an tar the LMS package okay so
that's it with respect to the
compressing and decompressing of files
so let me quickly go to the next topic
in my slide okay so the next topic is
that of environment variables so what
our environment variables I told you
that we had to set the environment
variables in the god bash hostage file
right while installing Java so what are
they as the definition says your element
variables control the behavior of the
software packages in salt in Linux
okay the path where the packages happen
in salt that we specified in the anomic
variables so if you are installing Java
okay and if there is some other
application which needs Java let's take
the example of Hadoop okay so Hadoop is
basically a Java framework okay so
the MapReduce concepts it's all Java
related and you need Java to run Hadoop
otherwise it will not run out so by this
downloading the Hadoop tar file from the
internet and extracting that tar file is
not enough okay what you going to do is
you got to download Java also and set
the environment variables for both Java
and for Hadoop so in our case when
Hadoop is running because it's based on
the Java framework it would need Java to
work right so at times it allows the
runtime engine where is Java installed
so that I need some commands to be run
on Java so at that time when the runtime
engine is large that kind of a question
it will go to the environment variables
and it will look for the path over there
ok so that was the innominate variables
i was talking about earlier okay you go
and set your environment variables in
your dot pacify and your dot passes a
file can be accessed by going to your
home directory from your home directory
just run G edit dot bash RC ok and here
you can set your path so if you've
installed how do presently then you can
just set the path of a loop over here
and if you've installed Java then you
can set the path of Java over here so
basically whenever any other application
once access to some program right so it
can get access by looking at its path
from here so that's what the bash RC
file is all about ok that's what the
UNAM Invisibles are all about so that
was about the UNAM and variables and we
have some of the most common endowment
variables are these ok
but in env so this will basically lists
or prints the list of all the anomic
variables ok all or almost all the
anomaly variables that's what this will
do and then when you say echo you know
dollar home this will print at the path
of the home directory of the user so
this HOA me that you see here this is a
variable ok and the path of your home
directory has been specified over here
so whenever you press CD on your
terminal right so it goes to the home
directory correct
so that is the home the tree I'm talking
about over here and the path of that
this water is set over here
so when you say echo dollar home like I
told you earlier I show you that echo
will basically print what about
arguments ago but we print it to sign
and output right
so when you say echo daughter home it
will print the paths of your home
whatever stored in this variable
and similarly when you give a coal
dollar path then it will print the list
of all the directories in which the
shell looks for commands okay and all
those directories will be separated by
your colon okay so you'll have multiple
Diaries which we get as the result and
they will all be separated by a colon
okay and similarly for hostname whatever
the rim of your host of your system all
right that will be printed when you give
this because the second is a variable
and this is all set as a nominal
variables okay and then you have user
name your user name will be printed so
and when we say language it's basically
the language right in which the whole
system works and can be as a Chinese or
can be English so in our case lot be
English read score because we are all
working on English so it will all print
either US English or you can give
something like that and when you say a
coke - version this will print the
version of this instance of bash so
let's just go ahead and view some of
these innominate variables okay I'm
going to clear the screen and go to CD
clear the screen and the first of all
let's put dollar or let's say echo when
you go back oh you have nothing okay
I showed you earlier that when you just
put an echo and then you say hi you will
get high as you return the output will
be high so similarly when you say echo
dollar X right I set the path of X to
week 200 earlier so when when I say this
right X I will get the value of 100 now
and similarly the path of whom will
already be set so if I just give echo
and dollar path then all the directories
where the shell will look for to execute
commands those possibly present you so
scoop is located over here in this bin
path and separated by a colon we have
the next thing so I haven't taken my
system so pig is installed here
whoo Z is installed here I was installed
here okay and similarly if you see Java
Java is installed here okay and Hadoop
to point 2.0 that's installed over here
right and similarly there are all the
directories where your shell will look
for right they will all be specified in
this spot so similarly you have another
command that is for
home this will print the home directory
and my home directory is home slash head
Rekha you can also alternatively print
your host name right so my hosting is
local host dot local admin ok so this is
my host name right so my basically my
host name is local host so that's what's
being printed here and when I say echo
and follow that with language okay with
a dollar then it would print the
language so this is a using English USA
English okay Udyr 4 - 8 so that's what
this means and in case you want to print
the list of all the innominate variables
then you can just run this command print
PNB okay so all the UNAM and variables
that are there in a system they will all
be displayed here ok so that's it with
respect to environment variables let me
get back to my slides now and continue
with my session so going on to the next
slide now I'm going to talk about
regular expressions okay so regular
expressions or regex they are used to
search through data it can be piped
along with the grep command to find
patterns of text in the file okay now
what this means is that you will have
multiple different files or multiple a
lot of data and probably even 1/5 okay
with the help of regular expression what
you can do is you can search for
patterns of that data so you can use the
graph to search through data and you can
use the regular expressions to search
through patterns of data that kind of a
pattern supposing you have a spelling
mistake in the middle okay supposing the
spelling of a Polizzi a PP le ok and you
know you might have made a mistake in
one of the files you have save it as a
ple okay and you're not able to find
when you're using Apple dat ple you're
not able to find that actual string okay
then it's you be wondering why you're
not able to find it okay then you
realize that okay it may be because the
spelling that arrived entered in the
file it's that might be wrong by mistake
or event or a ple so in that kind of
situation you can use regular
expressions to find patterns of text in
the file so you're all aware of the pipe
I spoke about earlier right you can use
the pipe to use one operations output as
the input to another operation right so
you can use that and you can use the
expressions with the combination of grep
okay with the combination of grep
command so we have a lot of regular
expressions and the most common of them
are these okay so the dot here it
basically means it can replace any
character okay
it can mean any cutter the dot so and
then you have the calots symbol you're
so the calyx symbol here it basically
matches the start of the string okay now
what that means is do you an example
supposing you're doing a chat
file one dot txt or looking for some
kind of data inside this file on dot DX
see and using the grep command to search
this data cattle basically this down all
the file contents grep will search that
data and how will it search when you
give a it will just display you know all
the lines or all the words where a is
present but when you give calotype it
means that the starting of the string
starts with a supposing I have three
different lines or three different
strings in my document in my file one
dot txt okay so putting a half bar
ABC ya f g and ADF okay and if I give
carrot a then the result that will be
out would be your goon given back to me
those three lines because those three
lines are starting with the character a
so that's what this character means it
matches the start of the string okay so
that's about calop and similarly if you
want to match something with the end of
the string you can use the dollar symbol
and supposing you know that this
particular word or string that you're
searching for
it ends with X T okay in that case you
can put X C and then you can suffix that
with a dollar then all the strings in
that particular file you know which are
although all the strings in that file
which are ending with X T they will be
displayed okay so that's how you can
search for data and similarly if you
give a strict astrick basically means
that the character that is you know
preceding the preceding character is it
matches zero or more times so let's take
an example of for this okay now in this
case we have J in front of the a string
okay so the aspect basically means
preceding character math is zero or more
times supposing I have got two different
strings in my file okay one string is
ABC and the second string is des so then
comes the asterisk okay so when
as wicked basically means that the
preceding character it occurs zero or
more times but however if you give a
question mark it means that the
candidate that comes up proceeding
before the quest mark that appears
exactly one or it can appear more times
okay and then you have you know these
brackets or which can be used to group
these regular expressions supposing you
have you know more than one or two extra
clear expressions you can use them to
group them and again the backslash R it
represents special characters okay so
let me just run a couple of examples of
this for you okay let me go to my
terminal and go to my home directory I'm
gonna clear the screen
I will go to documents okay so in here I
have my three different text documents
automobiles file1 and file2 so if I do
cat and automobiles or txt then I have a
list of all these strings right I have
address of all the cars and bikes and
different automobile companies so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to say it
cat automobiles dot txt and I'm going to
use a pipe I'm going to use a grip
command to search for strings starting
with the letter A okay so if I give it
then all the strings where there is a
present
that will appear okay now first let me
show you without the regular expression
so when I give it then these are the
strings where is present okay
however if I give grep - V then it will
list down those strings where J is not
present okay so you might see a present
in these two things but the truth is
it's looking for small it okay if you
want case-insensitive searching then you
can just use I also alright so you can
see as you can see from here in these
four strings a is not present right so
that kind of searching is what we need
to do so I can use a regular expression
to search for those strings starting
with a particular character okay by
using the cat command so in if you take
this example so these are the list of
strings in which a is present right so
in here
is a starting okay so is probably
starting only in this one particular
drawstring okay but maybe also over here
but because I haven't included the in
case-insensitive so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to remove this Ruby once
I'm going to print it okay this do a
control L and X cubed again so now if
you see all the strings where he is
present whether it's a capital A or
small it those will be listed here okay
and now I can use a regular expression
to basically filter out those letters or
those strings which are starting with a
okay why you're specifying this card
okay so I have to ideally get the answer
should get as earlier or the and above
okay so when I hit enter okay so there's
a space here so that's the problem and
as you can see it says that there is no
string that's matching with this a okay
no that's because I removed the - I okay
I removed the - I which stands for case
insensitive searching
so it basically returns that it's not
returning any result here so that
basically means the would there was no
search but however if I add - I okay - I
and enter then I will get these three as
- ORS because I have added the case
insensitive searching here so data alga
is getting this concept of using regular
expression of you know this is carrot
okay this matches the starting of the
string now I can do something similar I
can search for the end of the string
okay
now let's see again if I use a itself
and if I cook dal or then it will look
for all the strings which are ending
with a okay so that's happening because
of this problem the whole dollar a
should come inside brackets okay I
should be in quotation marks so that is
thing so when I do this I'm not getting
any result so similarly I can execute an
under Rob command okay so another one
involving regular expressions of aspect
so what I'll do it I'll say grep - and
let's say I want to search for the
character itself okay so when I say a in
asterisks so it when when I use this
assets it basically means zero or more
occurrence of a correct so I'm going to
search for that from here and then I
have to specify the filename over here
so I'm not using any cat command
and I'm not using a pipe to get data in
over here okay so I'm just going to
display the number of times that happens
by specifying the file name here I'm
going to say automobiles on TXE when I
hit an enter I get all the occurrences
where zero one more times is a occurring
okay so that is one aspect and the other
command that I can show you is that of
with respect to echo itself so I can run
an echo instead flower brackets I can
say he to Z now when I print this okay
sorry
there should be just two dots symbols so
when we say to dot some is it means me
fills the characters the sequence of a
BC abcdefgh you know the entire
alphabetical sequence that 11 as you can
see so that's because they were just two
dots specified but has there been three
this won't happen okay it will just
display this whole thing again so the
thing you want to notice that the
regular expression that we are using
here is this one two dots okay
so similarly you can replace it with
even numbers so we can have 89 and you
can say 33 so from 33 to 89 all the
numbers will be you know the sequence of
the numbers would be present here you
can also have combinations like you know
I can have say P over here and I can
have Annie over here yeah when I do this
the combination of a with all of these
numbers would be invisible so as you can
see so 833 be a 34 P so things like that
right so patterns are also being
generated so that is the advantage with
some of these regular expressions okay
so I'm going to want to clear the screen
now and go on to the next topic okay so
we are done with regular expressions out
and this takes us to the final part of
for this Linux demonstration okay this
webinar and here we are going to talk
about processes adding users and SSH
alright so let's get started okay so
guys processes is something that's
really important from the administration
perspective of the nose okay well it's I
mean it's basically something that's
necessarily not more than you know
important thing it's most basically
necessary I mean
you should know what this is and when I
say processes I'm pretty sure that you
know that we are talking about the
programs or instances of programs right
so anything that you start on your raw
system so whether you are starting with
a browser or whatever crop how you're
using a media player so everything every
software that it will help causes
involved okay there can be multiple
instances of that particular project
supposing I am viewing a presentation on
my computer okay
supposing I'm seeing five different
resonation at the same time I mean I can
see only one at a time but I can have
the remaining open and I can put them in
the background right so that's what we
mean so the different instances of that
particular system can also be considered
as a process so at any point of time
only one application or only one process
will be in the foreground okay but many
such instances of many software's or
also of that particular software or
program can be present in the background
okay so the example of that is me
opening two chrome browsers so I can
have two different chrome windows and
you know one can mean the background one
can be in the foreground okay so
similarly
ppts or whether it's a media player
anything like that so that's what a
process is okay
now when we definition an instance of a
program is called a process all right
any command given to the next kernel
starts a new process and there can be
multiple process of the same program
they can be multiple processes when we
say processes it basically means
instances so we can have any number of
four instances of any of your
application right of Chrome or of VLC
media player of all those things you can
have multiple such instances at the same
time and all these instances are
referred to as processes okay
official term is processes and each of
those processes have some process ID
okay so yeah like I told you they'll be
divided two different processes one is
the foreground processes and the other
one is the background processes okay so
how will you determine what are the
different process that are running in
your system in Windows you can just do
control-alt-delete and then you will get
the list of programs right and you can
even terminate them you can end the
programs from there right so you have
different tabs so let me show you an
example of that okay so this is my
Windows system okay and when I do
control-alt-delete
it starts my task manager and it asks me
for applications or processes and all
these things so this is the process that
I'm talking about okay you can have any
number of process and running your
system
okay you might not be aware of all of
those things so yeah anyways some may be
started by you and some may not be
started by you right some may be started
at the system mood and some of those
process might be started by you when
you're running some command so that's
what this is so every time you specify a
command in the terminal or the kernel
that will put a program or a software
and that will also alternatively start a
process okay
and every time you started you will have
a new process to fight and if you want
to see the list of all the processes
running in your system then you can use
this top command okay and what you get
followed by that will be the list of
processes and they're a PID their user
username their priority all these things
so I will talk about all these aspects
in some time so let me first show you
the different things and how they look
in the Linux in my VM okay so I'm going
to run your I'm going to run the top
command and when you do that you can see
that you have something called as PID we
have user you have PR you have a whole
task button and we have with respect to
which software is running which program
is running what is the application name
and all these things okay so right here
you can't probably see anything that I
have created on my own okay except for
this virtual box client and maybe the
terminal okay but if you want me to
create one then I can also create one so
what I'll do is I can just end this here
by pressing the ctrl C I can get out of
this top and what I'll do is I'll create
a Firefox instance okay so Mozilla
Firefox is installed in my system and
through my terminal I will start Firefox
okay when I hit enter my Firefox has
been initiated okay see now I did not
make any change okay I do not touch the
Firefox icon but instead of that on its
own mozilla firefox opened that is
because I hit Firefox and I put enter
the terminal so when I did that the
Firefox open okay now I can just
minimize this and if you go back to the
terminal you will see that I am still
inside the you know the terminal is
assuming that I'm still working on
Firefox okay
I still not edit Firefox or that so when
I when I close Firefox that's when I'll
come out
of the term lawyer but instead of for
doing all that I can essentially do ctrl
Z or ctrl W okay when I do ctrl Z it
means that I am stopping my firefox
instance okay so whatever firefox
browser that was opened as i stopped the
process however would not be stopped the
process would be running in the
background okay now supposing I want to
push it if I want to bring it to the
folk around I can just say for F G then
I can give Firefox okay this will again
initiate Firefox for me but otherwise I
can just you know close it and I can
push it also to the background I can say
BG and I can say Firefox and if I could
enter then my Firefox has been pushed to
the background so now what I'll do is
let me run that top command again and if
you see over here the Firefox was not
visible okay but since I started and
pushed my Firefox with the background
and all since I've done all these things
my firefox will be visible in this list
of processes
okay now seems like I've send it to the
background right so that's why it's not
coming so let me hit Firefox again and
it's opened the terminal now and what
I'm going to do is of course it's in the
background so I'm going to run the top
command again and show you that Firefox
is here so we have the Firefox here
right as you can see there is a Firefox
process that of course keeps moving up
and down and it's all sorted by the
priority that each process has okay
so yeah so every single instance or
every single program or application that
you start right so they will be starting
this way and they will have a process ID
associated with them they will have the
time for how long they have been
instantiated they'll have the CP
memories are using the virtual memory
they are using and all these things okay
so let me explain each of these things
by going to my slide first so if I go
back to my slides okay as you can see
here these are the different blocks that
you saw earlier okay on the terminal
so the first PID stands for the process
ID so each process that is initiated
which will have a unique process ID okay
and the user here is the name of the
user who started that process and the PR
is refers to the priority of that
process because every process that is
running in your raw UNIX it will have
priority associated with that
okay and the greatest
the process is what will be executed
first and that we execute at the top and
then so along with the priority of that
process you have the niceness value so
niceness value is again you know the
value of ranges from minus 20 to plus 20
and even the priority value it varies
from minus 90 to plus 20 okay so
basically the nicest value is somewhere
it's opposite to priority okay so the
lesser the nice value the greater will
be the priority of your process you can
also manually set the niceness value of
your process to increase the priority if
you want to give a particular program or
a particular process mode priority then
you can probably decrease the nicest
value and that will lead to the increase
in priority on your zone
so that's what this is and then after
that we have this VRT block okay so VR T
stands for virtual memory re S stands
for the physical memory s HR stands for
the shared memory s is the status of the
process so that's what X is so s speaks
about the status of that particular
process okay and then personate CPU is
it is about the percentage of the CPU
time okay and presage of the memory of
the physical memory that's being used
okay and then you have the time block
which refers to the total CPU time that
this process has been running for and
then finally you have the command okay
and that's fine and then after the
command you will have the process that
is actually running okay so let me just
quickly go back to my thing here so the
command is basically the application
that's running okay so yeah that's about
the different process I'm just going to
end this top by going control Z when I
go project this stops and I can just
clear my screen so that's about my
processes okay now I show you how the
top command works okay now along with
that if you want to see the list of all
the processes that are running okay then
you can see that by running this command
PS - space UX or you can do this or you
can even run PS - PID so when you do
that you will only get the list of
processes that are even being started by
you okay so you're the user and the user
and the my name is Ed Rekha right so all
the processes which I have started right
so all my processes will be visible of
course
the other users process will not be
visible to me it will be only visible
for him okay so I can also give PID
otherwise PS PID okay the PS you exit
busy displays the process that you have
started okay so you any any program or
anything that you started that you can
see it here you can see you know what is
the percentage of the memory that's
being used because of that process what
is the process ID for that particular
process and all these things okay so
similarly if you have you know anything
else so that's what this command does
okay the next thing that I want to tell
you is that of running the PID of a
particular process so you know that
we've started the particular process
okay we started the Firefox process that
time and what I can do is I can find out
the PID of that particular process by
giving this command PID off and what is
the name of the process so in my case
it's Firefox so I'm just going to give
PID off and Firefox that will give me
the PID of that particular process five
eight three six okay
now I'm going to clear our screen okay
I'm going to run the process again okay
I'm going to start Firefox again and
when I do this there is a new instance
of Firefox that starts okay so a new
process would have got started by now
and when I just give control set I'm
kind of stopping my process and now if I
give PS - UX then you can see here that
there's a new Firefox process that
starts that's running okay the idea is
zero six zero okay you can verify that
by also giving by thing what is the
answer that I get
fi PID of Firefox when I do this I get 6
0 6 0 so that is what this is all about
okay and if you see the status it's also
showing as RTL okay this means that
terminated that process okay so process
of Firefox is I've been instantiated it
has a PID of 6/0 6/0 okay and you know
if I want to kill this process then I
can give the command kill six zero six
zero all right great
so that's about the different process
that I want to talk to you about okay so
what's next is uh let me go back to the
slides and talk about the next topic
alright so I spoke about processes here
and the next topic is this is the
penultimate topic actually I'm going to
tell you how to create your own users so
you can create users by this comment
simply saying pseudo user ID and the
user name okay if you want to set
password to that person then you got to
say password and the user name of that
passes and then it will prompt you to
set a password for that person and
simply if you want to delete that
particular user you can say user delete
and then the name of that user name
whichever you want to delete okay
but one thing is that you go to always
use sudo before that because these
commands cannot be executed by users
like us okay we need a root access for
that we need the only root users web the
Super User permissions can not do this
so that's why we use sudo and we enter
the password okay now one thing you
notice that when a user is created then
by default is also added to a particular
group okay there'll be sometimes
there'll be a default group to which
that post will be added and if you want
to add a user to a particular group then
you can just do that by using the
usermod' command okay you can say user
mod - g-g represents the group and then
you can see the group name and the
username so the group name that you want
to set and followed by the user name of
that particular person suppose you want
to add your own groups then you can do
that by group add and group in and then
it will delete them it's again the same
thing okay after this process then again
you can assign them a different group
okay so let me just show to you on my
terminal okay so the first command is
adding a user right so before anything
let me just go to system go to
administration and user and groups it
ask for a password
okay I'm going okay when you go that you
see that there are two users currently
so it Ricardo see so these are the two
users and in groups again there are a
drea and you see there are two groups
here also now if I want to add users I
can add it from here okay I can just I
can click on add user and I can give the
user name I can give the full name
password and all these things from the
GUI but you know the CLI is a more
simpler version where I can just supply
a command okay
so I'm going to say user ad space I can
give the name of the user so if I want
to create a user for myself okay I can
give this name using it user ad button
okay but of course it's wrong going to
work because it would say we need a
pseudo access function tonight right so
what I'll do is I'll give pseudo access
it asks for the root password and when
you give the password you don't have any
argument so that means your user has
been created successfully so if you go
back to system and administration and if
you go to user and groups you'll find
that there's a new user that's added and
the user ID is five not to okay now let
me just minimize this for now similarly
if you want to set a password for this
user because right now it might not have
a password if you want to set a password
then you go to run this command sudo
password and the username username is
varbin
so do this hit an enter it will say
changing the new password for the user
okay and let's say the new password is
this and it will say it's retype the new
password I can give it here and then the
tokens are updated successfully okay
password is updated successfully so
that's what this is all about so if I go
back to this user window and if I click
on button then you'll know that there's
a puzzle that's been added over here
okay this is what I added from here and
you'll also notice that there's a new
home directory that's created for that
post so all these things right so that's
about creating a user supposing you want
to create a new group then how will you
do it
similarly this say group
add so I'm going to say a pseudo and
then enter this so the group has been
added successfully and if I go back to
John the system under administration and
our users and groups if I go to groups
now even I NSC is something that's
created so this version is something
that got created done now because the
island when you create a new user right
when you create a user without you know
by specifying in any group then
automatically is added to a group so a
group is created automatically when our
users created and it is the same as the
user name so that's how this got created
but anyways this is the new group so I'm
just going to do ctrl L and say ma if
you want to delete any users it's again
a very simple process you can just do a
sudo and user delete and the name of
that user okay if I want to delete
button then I can do this
yeah so I'm not able to delete it right
now because one is currently logged in
so if I just log off from this VM and if
I log in as warden and log out from
there and then as a root if I execute
this command then I would be able to
delete this user but the command is very
simple this is the command and you can
all try it at home alright and similarly
if you want to delete any group again
the commander is simple it's a group
delete and then the name of the group
that is a high n st here which I created
so if you do this the group has will
delete it now okay yeah as you can see
now Insp is not visible
okay so that was the previous window I
hadn't refreshed it so now if you see I
NSE is deleted so that's how you delete
the group and that's how you delete a
user all right so that's that brings us
to an end to this topic so I'm just
going to clear the screen and what I can
do is I can just go back to my slides
and get started with this final slide of
mine so guys are this is the last topic
for today that is the secure shell okay
it's also called the SSH and this is for
gaining remote access of a system okay
so you can get access to a system which
is remotely located so without you
physically accessing that system you can
get access through this SSH server okay
so that's what the SSH does okay it's
called secure shell the connection is
called secured shell connection so
all
other topics in this session right today
sessions there were all basic stuff
which any user could learn but this one
this SSH is something a little little
little advanced and this is and this is
with respect to networking okay you know
it's a thing that people would look
forward to okay so if it's you know if
you guys are waiting for a long time and
if you are feeling bored in the session
then this is something that's going to
be a little more fun you're going to do
something real time and you're going to
see something incredible happening okay
by pinging and accessing some other
machine so first of all how does secure
shell work so we have two different
systems right but in my case will be two
different beams and in general it will
be two different systems which are
remotely located and you can get access
to them by the help of this SSH and how
is that possible by setting the IP
address and all those things right you
set the IP address and in two different
places you set one system as the master
and you set the other system as the
slave and you basically what you do is
you have something called as the EDC
hosts okay so you go to this file and
you set the master and the slave IP is
over here okay you'll have to set up
this IP for the master and this IP for
the slave machine and then you can do
the if configured the IP address hope to
list down the IP address of that
particular machine so if it's something
other than what you want to set then you
can just do that by deleting the
existing IP table running this command
in both the EEO machines and then to add
an IP address to that machine you can
run this command sudo IP add or add and
the IP address you want to add okay so
remember to set the mask for that and
when you enter this command this
particular IP address will be set for
that particular node okay so that will
be the master node and set this IP
address for the slave node okay the
command will be the same but before that
you got to delete the IP address the
existing one by this command and then
add the new IP address at the same end
with this command and then simply just
type SSH master or slave okay so when
you do that your secure connection would
be established and you if you see the
username then you realize that okay
you're logged in into the different
system okay that's what I want to show
you now and that's what I'm going to do
it but before that you might have some
problems like firewalls and stuff for
that okay if you have a firewall you can
still set up an
such connection okay but the problem is
we'll have to generate RSA key and all
and I don't want to do that gives it's a
little more complicated and since you
people have big knowledge I just want to
show you by II turning the fireball off
okay and to turn the G fireball off what
you gotta do is you're going to drop the
IVA table okay it will just stop your
driveway table and this command will
permanently disable your agreeable so
this is with respect to Linux so when
you do these two things then even get
started all right so let me go to my VM
and show you what are the two different
machines that I will be pinging - okay
as you can see so this is the VM which I
was working on right so let's say cancel
and I'm just going to minimize this
terminal okay let me just close every
other file and folder alright this is my
terminal that's minimized so if you can
see here you have something well as
master written right so this is the
master machine and if I go back to my
virtual box you can see that this is the
machine that's already running okay now
this is the same machine which I will
ping so I need to instantiate this slave
machine also and even when you are
pinging two different machines to remote
machines or two machines in the same VM
then what you go to do is you know you
go to turn on both and you go to set the
IP address in both places and then you
go to ping them from there so let's just
wait until the slave opens all right
when it's launched we can start with our
commands but in the meanwhile I can just
go to my master terminal and I can go to
the terminal and start executing my IP
tables okay so let me check if my
connections are all running you click on
this ok now that both my network
connections are on so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say if conflict okay
so when you do an if conflict you get
this kind of an output okay so you're at
zero is the is your any the address is
your network address translation okay on
your s1 in my case it's at one but
generally you people will not get a net
one because this comes when you are
running a VM okay so I have a setup of
bridges adapter okay post earlier rapper
actually where between my two beams so I
have a master VM and our save VM right
yeah since there are two VMs in the same
machine I need to set different IP
addresses for both the beams right so
that's when at one comes into the
picture
otherwise in your case if you're running
running Linux and
you run this config tab then you will
not get at one you'll only get at zero
or you'll just get one option you get L
not and we get ed view okay and this L
not basically represents the energy
address okay so this ten point oh point
two point one five this basically is
your IP address which you need to use to
connect to the internet so if you don't
get an address aware then it means
you're not connected to the Internet
okay so that's what this means and right
now my h1 address is one ninety two dot
one six zero at 56.2 okay and similarly
if I go to my slave VM let me just log
in here first
as you can see from here it's a slave VL
and if I launch my terminal what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to run the
command if config again right so right
now it says that my okay I don't have a
nine eight address okay and my network
is not connected okay I have at one
connection and that is one a two dot one
sixty eight dot
56.2 okay but my nad address is not set
so I think I'm just cutting it from the
internet so what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to click on system at zero
and when I do this I'll be connected to
the Internet now and I'm going to run
this command again and now if you see I
have the nad address okay so this is my
network address ten dot 0 dot 2.15 and
in case of my master VM ten dot zero dot
dot one five was again the energy
address okay it's the same but however
the H one would have to be different
okay I mean whether it's different or
not I need to change my Y our h1 but now
what matters is I'd open my slave from
my master right so I need to drop
whatever IP address is there right now
so if this is the IP then have to drop
this IP so even in your case by default
there will be one random IP address you
can drop that IP address by running one
on the commands as I showed you in my
slides I'll show you that again suddenly
you go to do the same thing at even your
master then you got to drop the IP over
the earth one IP address and when you
when you have done that you can set your
new IP address so you will be setting
two different IP addresses one for your
master and one for your ro slave okay
this you'll be setting one over here in
this VM and you will be setting one over
here and that address will be over here
okay so I will make my
as one ninety two dot one sixty eight
dot 56.3 okay so I will drop this one
and I'll update it as Daughtery and in
fact master can be the same one ninety
two dot one sixty eight water physics
point two can be the you know the IP
address off my master slave okay so I
will use these two things and once I add
these two IP addresses to the ATC slash
hosts file then I can start pinging them
okay I can start pinging them and I can
get remote access to them alright so
what I'll do is I first clear the screen
and I'll go to my slave and again I'll
do the same thing I'm going to clear the
screen now so going back to my VM the
first command that we go to run is we
got to drop this particular IP address
so to delete the IP address we have this
kind sudo IP add a delete and then
whatever the IP addresses okay
so here this was the IP address right
I'm going to drop the Edwin address so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
this here I'm going to say dev f1 now
when I hit enter this particular IP
address will be dropped okay okay this
is the password okay now if I again run
if conflict you can see that I don't
have a net1 address that's because I
dropped it over here correct
let me just shoot you that's because I
dropped this particular address okay now
similarly let me run the same command in
my slave also the commander's IP add or
delete the IP address over here is one
ninety two dot one sixty eight dot 56.2
okay so this is the same here also so
I'm going to just pay secured and say de
vh1 when I go enter
okay I need to give sudo so that is a
problem so I'm going to give sudo IP era
and ask for the password there you go
and yeah my IP address has been
discarded okay now if I again run the if
conflict you can see that each one again
does not have any IP address now what I
needed was I need to set my own IP
address over here so let me first set
the IP address over here it says in my
this slave VM so to add the IP address
the command is almost the same except
that instead of delete you will have to
put add okay and you will have to
specify the IP address you want to set
so I want to set one ninety two dot one
sixty eight or 56.1 not to okay I'm
going to say that will not do and then I
need to give a mask so if you remember I
told you that we need to give a mask so
it will be slash 24 or let me give one
not three because it is the slave right
I can give one three here one or 3/24
when I give enter the IP address would
have been added so if I do the if
conflict now you can see that each one
has this address 192 dot 168 what 56.1
not three this is what I added some time
back right this is what I added here now
similarly need to go back to my master
bian and I've deleted the IP address
from here I need to add the IP address
or the new one okay so the command is
add when I need to got 160 or 56.1 not
to slash the mask
that's 24 you vent up okay now let me
check the if conflict as you can see the
IP address for my h1 is there it's up
and running now it's 192 dot 168 or 56.1
not too over here in this case okay now
have another I have done this there's
one more important thing that I need to
do I need to add my IP addresses to the
ETD slash hosts file which indicates to
both the beams where the master is and
what is the IP address of the master and
what are the IP address of the slave
okay
now that I've added this one so let me
just copy this address I'm going to copy
this and I need to set this address of
the master and similarly the address of
the ER slave in the 83 slash hosts file
okay how will you ask the ETD slash
hosts file
you need to first go to your home
directory and from here okay let me
clear the screen home directory so here
you got to give a pseudo G edit / ET c /
hosts okay when you hit enter you'll
open this file okay this file is called
the host / in easy file so in here you
know I've already set my IP addresses
okay now I can just delete it for name
sake and I can just copy your paste what
I had copied so it was 192 dot 168 what
56.1 not - this is the IP address of the
master which I wanted to set correct if
you see her this is the IP address that
I added now and I'm adding this IP
address dot 1 or 2 to the host I'm going
to add that as master and so now if I go
to the slave the IP addresses 192 168 56
and one not three okay now I need to go
to the ECD file and since that is a
slave I got to set the IPS for the safe
and of course even the slave IP already
set but I just up it and save it anyways
I'm going to save this and I'm going to
close this okay now similarly I need to
go to the slave VM and set these two IP
addresses okay now again the command has
go to CD and go write sudo G edit /
EDC's slash hosts
okay so here also the IP address is set
to 1 or 2 and 1 or 3 okay now this is
the slave VM and the IP editor of this
machine is 1 or 3 and the master is 1 or
2 okay that's the other way so I mean is
the same so I don't need to make any
changes yours um this one close this
yeah I can just close it without saving
now now that I've done this I can
straight away start pinging or get SSH
connection ok
I can just say since this is the slave I
can say SSH space master now since I've
added the IP address of the master in
the host table I don't need to specify
the IP address of that particular system
I can just say SH master and if I put
enter then it will ask me for the
masters password the other beams
password is what I'm going to put here
and when I put enter as you can see I'm
logged in now so the password has been
entered and you can see the last login
you're ok so the last time I logged in
was on this date and I logged in from
this slave itself ok from this
particular BMS F so to prove that this
is the actual master what I can do is I
can just go to CD and I can do an LS
command ok I can go into any of these or
desktop or the downloads or the pictures
or folders right because I made quite a
few changes in my master slave and turn
the master slave is where I showed you
the earlier files red I created the
automobile dot exe the file 1 dot txt
the file 2 dot txt okay if you can
remember
then my documents has these contents
okay it has folder 1 it has automobile
dot txt and all these things so I can
just add the same to my slave so I can
just navigate to desktop and if I do an
LS I get the list of all these things ok
so as you can see there is a the
automobile dot txt and that readme file
in my downloads folder ok now let me go
to my master so in my master if I go to
downloads I have these two files ok so
this is what I mean when I say a remote
access so these two VMs are
communicating with each other such that
the slave is accessing and it's running
command inside the master and whatever
is visible over there I get ax 2 here
supposing you want me to open another
file ok so the music folder has these
three files right so I can
these also a congestus a CD and go back
one pot and say I'm gonna smooth change
the music so when I go here and read one
LS I have automobiles dot txt file one
dot exe and 52.3 XD so basically these
three text files are present in the
other VM in the other machine okay they
are present over here
however they are not present in this
machine if you want me to prove that
they are not there in this machine then
I can just minimize this go to the file
directory go to music ok it's empty so
this basically means that I'm accessing
the master wheel from this slave VM ok
alternatively you can also check the
Downloads folder there's nothing here
either so yeah that's how we login to
the remote machine and in my case I've
logged into slave from my machine and I
have access these folders ok I can also
view these quarters in this folder by
going to cat automobiles or txt and when
I hit enter whatever data set that I
created earlier in the session right
couple of hours back so those are
visible over here ok so that's it so
another thing is that if you want to
exit from your masters machine right if
you want to exit your exit shell then
you can just hit exit ok when you hit
exit it says a logout ok connection to
master is closed so this shows that now
we are back to your own OBM and now if
you try going to CD and if you go to
music or something you will not find any
documents or any folders in that
particular directory that's because it
is your VM this is the slave VM and
similarly I can just you know from my
masters VM also I can get access to the
slave VM by just typing in SSH and slave
the password is this and this is the
last time that was logged in and I'm
here
if I go to CD music and if I do an LS
there's nothing available here okay
that's because the slaves VM does not
have anything in the music folder or
anything in the Documents folder so that
is the reason okay and similarly I can
exit from here by giving this command
exit it says it's logged out and
connection to slave is closed okay guys
so this is about the SSH and this is
about the sector or shell connection
there is something called as the RSA key
okay now that is something that will get
generated if there is a firewall so in
my case I have blocked my firewall by
dropping the IP tables okay
so the command to drop the IP tables are
this one there are service heart.we
tables and stop ok this will drop the
variable temporarily and if you want a
permanently disabled type a table then
you can just run the command sudo check
conflict and IP tables off so by doing
this your firewall will be turned off
and you can use the SSH connection in
the way I showed you okay now this is
very simple of it but in case of a real
scenario okay where the machine is
located remotely where you cannot
actually disable your firewall okay
because firewall is important to block
any unauthorized access right so
firewall is important to be enabled so
in that case if you want an SSH
connection to be present in spite of a
firewall then there is another procedure
where we have to generate an SSH key
write an RSA key from the Master Zen and
said that turkey at the same end so you
have that kind of process and that is
something that's a little more
complicated than this and of course that
I can't show you now but I promise to
show you that in my next the next
webinar
okay so a few days promise to come back
and with me in that webinar then I can
promise you to throat you there alright
guys so I'm hoping that it's all fine
I'm hoping that you people understood
the concept here and it's been a good
session spending pretty long but it's
been worth it right basically came unto
his new to computers and he says that
you know he is got a lot of and I want
to see the understood and next well and
yeah he also says that he's going to
install CentOS okay let him on that's
good because even on this or Center is
maybe this is why you want to install
Center wise but don't just keep the
cells for
to this Center West human you can also
install Ubuntu and find out which one
you like so see I like the scent OS and
this is my preferred Linux distribution
okay so I recommend everything coupon to
an Center West you you can install them
and you work on them and you will only
figure out which is better for you okay
so I'm glad that you know some beginners
and newcomers to this Linux world are
getting something out of this session so
yeah that brings us to the end of the
session guys so let me conclude today's
session then so first I started off by
talking about the birth of Linux alright
I told how it was born from UNIX and how
it gained popularity and then I spoke
with the different Linux distributions
that you can choose from and then I
start executing some of the basic Linux
commands and then I we worked with files
and directories
you know the different and the basic
commands with files and directories and
then I showed you how to work with your
next repositories how the tar files work
how to set anomic variables and how to
work with the help of regular
expressions okay I showed all these
things and then finally I finished great
session by your talking about process
setting up different users and secure
shell connection so that's it for today
guys yep so guys that brings us to the
end of this session and if you guys have
you know any doubts then you can put it
now or you can ask you now right so ok
I'm getting a thank you from a couple of
people ok so thanks guys thank you for
being part of the session and yeah it's
more than me you tiny needs me thanking
you people for you know being ever so
nice and trying to understand whatever I
try to teach you all ok so yeah I'll log
off for today then ok thank you guys and
happy learning all right so until the
next time we meet
ok we'll have a session again and that
time I'll probably show you something
more advanced and Linux all right till
then
